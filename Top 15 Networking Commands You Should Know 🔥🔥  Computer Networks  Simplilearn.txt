foreign
and troubleshooting the network settings
for our systems is a necessary system
skill for any ID professional using some
of the most important Network commands
we can easily configure and troubleshoot
network settings for the device without
needing additional assistance
hello everyone and welcome to yet
another interesting video by simply
learn in this interactive demo session
on the top networking commands we will
look into some of the most popular
commands applied by users to handle
network issues and save precious time so
stay tuned
but before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update from us
to begin practicing the commands we need
to access the command prompt application
using the CMD command in the start menu
now let's begin with the list of
commands the first command is ipconfig
this command displays the system's basic
IP address configuration data which
includes Network information about IP
addresses subnet masks and default
gateway
similarly we also have ipconfig slash
all command which displays all the
details regarding our device like Lan
settings physical address of the system
IP addresses subnet masks and DHCP
information
let's use the CLS command to clear the
application window for the next one the
next command is hostname which is used
to access the system's hostname
to verify this let's use the ipconfig
slash all command to check the hostname
in the information and for sure we have
the same hostname
let's perform the CLS command again and
perform the next command
the Ping command is used to check the
communication availability of the
destination host and the user system
for example user ping command with
google.com to check the server
availability which gives us the
following result
also using the results IP address and
then the pin command we can get the same
result in case we just don't have the
domain name
we perform the CLS command again and
move on to the next one the nslookup
command is used to troubleshoot network
connectivity and find the IP address of
a domain like Google and Amazon as
applied just now to receive the name and
address of the domain
also using the MS lookup command and
then applying the server command with an
IP address we can get the domain name
belonging to the IP address
and similarly to check the number of
servers with the same domain name we can
do this and we have four name servers
for Google
we perform the CLS command again and
move on to the next one
the tracered command is used to
troubleshoot the routing issues of the
network by displaying the routing table
through which the data is transmitted to
a maximum of 30 hops in the network as
you can see
similarly you can also try amazon.com
and share your views in the comment
section below now let's clear the
application window and perform the next
command which is the ARP command
this command is applied to display the
communication exchange between the IP
address and the systems Mac or physical
address
let's move on to the next command which
is the path ping command
this combines the preset and ping
commands and displays detailed
information as an output for a maximum
of 30 hops in the network
this command takes some time to compile
the full hop details so that you can
share findings in the comment section
next we have the netstat command it's
used to display the network connection
summary of the system as shown in the
demo
similarly if we use the netstat hyphen n
command it will give us much more
details about the connection and UDP
details
next we have the net share command which
displays the details of where the data
resources for a system are shared and we
can check them under the share name
resources and remark column
then we have the route command that
allows us to access the routing tables
and also allows us to make changes to
them
let's try the route print command and we
have the interface list ipv4 routing
table details with all the active routes
and the IPv6 routing table moving on
let's clear the window and look at the
net sh command the netsh is a popular
command which allows us to view and
configure the network adapters in the
system
under the net sh command we have
multiple functions for configuring
settings let's try the show command and
we have the following result
moving on we have the task list command
that lists all the currently working
applications on the system with task or
program ID and the memory it uses let's
perform an example
access Google Chrome and then perform
the task list command and as expected we
have the Chrome details in the list
and if we close the Chrome window and
again use the task list command we don't
have the application active
similarly we also have the task kill
command which will terminate the task
corresponding to the given program ID in
the command window
for example let's access Chrome and
perform the task list command to check
the program ID
and then we'll use it with the task kill
command and we can see that the
application is terminated
to check our result we can access the
task list command again next on the list
we have the system info command
it's used to view all the information
about the system from the windows
version to the BIOS and booting
configuration you can access all these
details using the system info command
and the last Network command for this
section is the wmic command
for getting detailed information on the
ports and functions of the system like
CPU details and then similarly we can
check the bio settings with this we have
completed the session on the top
networking commands if you have any
question about them you can ask your
doubts in the comments section below
