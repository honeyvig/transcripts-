hey everyone Welcome to our video about
Transformers in Ai and no we don't mean
the robot toys from the movies we are
diving into something even cooler in the
world of computers and AI have you ever
wondered how your phone knows what word
you might type next or how Google
translate works so well that's where
Transformers come in they are like super
smart computer brains that can
understand and create human like text
here's a fun example I asked a
Transformer to tell me a joke and it
said why did the computer go to the art
school because it wanted to improve its
draw speed okay that's a bit cheesy but
it shows how these computer programs can
come up with new ideas on their own
Transformers are changing how we use
technology every day they help us with
things like translating languages
summarizing long articles writing emails
and stories and even playing games like
chess in this video we will explore how
Transformers work why they are so
special and what cool things they might
do in the future craving a career

the course link is mentioned in the
description box below so let's get
started so let's talk about what exactly
are Transformers Transformers are an
artificial intelligence model used to
process and generate natural languages
they can read and understand huge amount
of text and then use that knowledge to
answer questions translate languages
summarize information and even create
stories or write code the magic behind
Transformers is the ability to focus on
different text Parts with a tension
mechanisms this means that they can
understand context better than older
models making their outputs more
accurate and natural sounding the basic
structure of a transformer includes two
main parts the encoder and the decoder
think of the encoder as a translator
that understands and processes the input
and the decoder as the one that takes
the processed information and turns it
into the output for example if we are
translating a sentence from English to
French the encoder reads the English
sentence and converts it into a form
that AI can understand the decoder then
takes this form and generates the French
sentence a great example of a
transformer in action is chart gbt chart
gbt uses Transformers to understand and
generate humanik text when you ask a
question it processes your input with
its encoder and generates a response
with its decoder this lets it have
conversations write essays and even tell
jokes for instance if you ask Chad GPT
what's the weather like today it uses
its Transformer model to understand your
question and respond it with its Sunny
with a chance of rain in the afternoon
this ability to understand and generate
text makes Transformers incredibly
powerful so let's talk about how
Transformers work Transformers are
especially good at sequence to sequence
learning task like translating a
sentence from one language to another
here's how they work first there's the
attention mechanism this allows the
Transformer to focus on different parts
of input data for example if it's
translating the sentence the cat sat on
the mat it can pay attention to each
word's context to understand the meaning
better so it knows cat is related to sat
and Matt helping it produce an accurate
translation in another language
Transformers also use something called
positional encoding since they process
all words at once they need a way to
understand the order of the words
positional encoding adds information
about the position of each word to the
input helping the Transformers
understand understand the sequence
another key feature is like parallel
processing unlike older models like
record and neural network which is rnns
the process texts words by word
Transformers can process the entire
sentence at once this makes them much
faster and more efficient let's compare
Transformers with Recine neural networks
but first let's understand what are rnns
so RNs is a type of neural network
designed to handle sequential data they
process data one step at a time
maintaining a memory of previous steps
this makes them good for task where
order matters like speech recognition or
time series prediction however RNs have
a problem called The Vanishing gradient
which means that they can forget
information from earlier in the sequence
imagine trying to understand the
sentence Alice went to the park and then
to the store and RNN might struggle to
remember Alice by the time it gets to
the store but a Transformer can easily
keep track of Alice throughout the
sentence so why are Transformers better
unlike rnns Transformers process the
entire sentence at once keeping the
context intact this solves the vanishing
greent problem and makes Transformers
faster and more accurate to task like
language translation and text generation
so let's talk about the applications of
transformers at first we have language
translation they are used by services
like Google Translate to convert text
from one language to another for example
translating hello how are you to Spanish
as hola then we have document
summarization they can take long
articles and summarize them into shorter
more concise versions for instance
summarizing a 10-page report into a few
key points making it easier to
understand the main ideas without
reading the whole document then we have
content generation Transformers can
write articles stories and even quote
they can create new content based on
what they have learned for example you
could ask a Transformer to write a short
story about a space adventure and then
it would come up with a unique narrative
then we have game playing Transformers
can learn and play complex games like
chess making strategic decisions just
like a human player they analyze the
entire board and make moves considering
all possible outcomes let's talk about
image processing they are used in task
like image classification and object
detection helping computers understand
visual data for example identifying
objects in a photo like recognizing a
cat tree or a car now let's understand
the training process the training
Transformers involves two main steps
semisupervised learning they can learn
from both labeled data where the answer
is known and unlabeled data where the
answer is not provided this makes them
very versatile for example a Transformer
could be trained on a mix of articles
with and without summaries to learn how
to summarize text effectively
pre-training and fine-tuning
Transformers are pre-trained on a large
data set to learn General patterns then
they are fine- tuned with specific task
making them highly versatile for
instance a Transformer might be
pre-trained on a large collection of
books to understand language and then F
tune to generate marketing copy for a
specific brand the future potential of
Transformers is huge researchers are
continuously improving them making them
even more powerful we can expect more
advanced applications in areas like
healthcare finance and more
sophisticated AI systems that interact
with humans in more natural ways imagine
having an AI that can provide
personalized medical advice or one that
can help you write a novel in conclusion
we can say that Transformers are a
revolutionary architecture in AI they
offer Speed efficiency and versatility
changing how we interact with the
technology the future looks bright for
Transformers and we can't wait to see
what they'll do next thanks for watching
