the evolution of software development
reached greater heights in recent times
the current id industries demand the
most efficient and updated software
development skill set in the market and
there is no better way than to upgrade
your skills
hey everyone welcome to yet another
exciting video from simply learn in this
session we will be discussing how to
improve logic building skills in
programming
however before we begin with the session
make sure that you have subscribed to
our youtube channel and don't forget to
hit that bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn
now let's take a look at the ways that
we are going to discuss in this session
we brought you the top 10 tips that will
help you improve your logic building
skills and they are as follows
the first one is practice from basics
followed by that we have consistency in
learning next we have the paper and pen
approach
up next we have run the program or code
later we have learned data structures
and algorithm concepts
on the next sixth step we have step by
step approach
next after that on the seventh stage we
have to follow the programmers
communities
next we have solve some questions
then we have learning from the feedbacks
of other developers finally having some
projects for the portfolios
we will discuss each one of these parts
in detail
first let's discuss about practice from
the basics
the first one is practice for the basics
when we start programming we start with
an easy problem for some resources and
then move on to the next level
these cover all concepts and provide you
with the idea of learning
the next step on practicing from the
basics is develop new and creative ideas
on moving further
practice enough on several questions
from easy level then move on to the
intermediate level questions and try to
solve some variety of questions on this
level then proceed to the complex
problems
on the next step of practicing from the
basics we have built knowledge and get
experience in development
when we try practicing in this manner it
is better to gain knowledge on coding
and get experience over programming
now we have finished the first stage
let's move on to the next stage where we
have consistency in learning
so the first step in the second stage is
consistency helps to get more command
and learning it is popular saying that
practice makes a man perfect we often
take up a challenge to solve a question
and then discontinue in the middle after
some days this should not be happening
in the second step we have improved the
ability to gain knowledge
practicing consistency will help a lot
in overall logic building process
and also other than that it improves and
helps to gain more knowledge
the third step increase the development
speed and logic building practicing
consistently also improves the
development speed and also helps in
building confidence levels in
programming
now we have finished with the second
stage let's move on to the third stage
where we have pen and paper
so the first step in the third stage is
representing helps to solve problems
quite easily
representing on paper will help you in
writing the code and improve your
programming skills in a better way trial
and error methodologies are much easier
to implement on paper before applying
the final solutions through computers
the second step it also improves the
knowledge and logic building when we see
any problem we generally start coding on
our ide so when an interviewer asks us
to write a code on paper we fail to do
so
always try to write and implement the
code or algorithm of the code before
starting on your ide
now the third step is
increase the speed of development and
building
whenever you approach a similar problem
in the next time you will be able to
recollect more easily it will also help
you in speeding up your development
now we are done with stage 3 we have
stage 4 now
that is run program or code
so the first step in run program or code
is practicing is the key to develop new
ideas
one of the best ways to develop logic
building in programming is learning data
structures concepts and these concepts
provide an idea on how to build an
algorithm
the second step says running program or
a code provides an opportunity to learn
the working process
running or coding a program can also
help get an idea of working process of
the program which is a significant
benefit in building the logic
so the third step is running a program
or code helps you build and get more
experience over programming
it helps you improve your programming
and gets experience in programming and
skill up your performance by building
confidence levels
so now we are done with stage four we
have stage five that is learn data
structures and algorithms concepts
so the first step in learning data
structures and algorithms concepts is
data structures and algorithms concepts
help you build algorithms and logics one
of the best ways to develop logic
building in programming is learning data
structures concepts and these concepts
provide an idea on how to build an
algorithm so the second step in learning
data structures and algorithms concepts
is develop programming skills in a
programmer so when we can build or
implement an algorithm it is easy to
develop programming skills in a person
so now the third step is increase the
ability and knowledge of programming
developing an algorithm provides a good
knowledge piece and also helps in
increasing the development time
now we are done with the stage five
let's get on to the stage six so the
stage six is all about step by step
approach
so the first step in stage six is
provide more clarity and clear
understanding
we don't start talking from the day we
are born
similarly we should not directly jump
into learning all the concepts it is
better to keep a step-by-step approach
like a procedure
we should go from basic to advanced
level questions it provides more clarity
and clear understanding sometimes people
solve a lot of easy questions from all
the sites but they are not able to solve
medium level questions instead make a
balance of these levels
next
helps think logically and have the
complete idea
step by step approach helps in clearing
the coding tests and gives an
opportunity to build the skills in a
person
now we are done with the stage six let's
get into the stage 7.
that is programmers community
find various questions and their logics
we often get bored while solving the
problems all by ourselves with no one to
teach or guide us
through the programmers community we can
get an opportunity to find various
questions and solve them in a better way
or it may also happen that you know the
problem solution and you may guide
someone else as well
now the second step is clean and clear
explanation for better ideas
solving various questions seriously will
help you to get more complete idea of
the working process and development
process of a program which is a benefit
in building logic in need
now the last step is it improves logic
with various development techniques
programmers communities help you build
confidence in you and provide an
opportunity to develop more skills so
far we are done with stage 7 now we
enter the stage 8 which is about solving
questions
so the first step in stage 8 is solving
questions will help you improve your
ability to work on different questions
if you want to build and develop logic
skills you must try solving as many
questions as possible it provides an
opportunity to work on various types of
problems and solve them
now the second step is it gives you a
complete idea of the program and
development solving questions will
seriously help you get a complete idea
of the working process and development
process of a program which is a benefit
in building logic in you another third
step solving questions will help you or
provide an opportunity to develop more
skills it also builds confidence in you
and provides an opportunity to develop
more skills
now we are done with stage 8. let's
enter stage 9 that is about learning
from feedbacks the first step in
learning from feedbacks is identify the
mistakes and improve the ideas one of
the best ways to improve knowledge and
build logic is learning from feedback
when you implement or develop any
program you must go for a second opinion
or feedback and once you go through a
feedback
it helps you to identify mistakes and
avoid them in the future
the next step is
develop the debugging skills and improve
logical skills
so learning from feedbacks help you
build debugging skills and improve more
command on the programming language
now the third step learning from
feedback helps you improve the
development speed and knowledge when we
try to know the mistake that we have
made previously it helps you get an idea
over programming it increases the
development speed and builds more logic
now we are done with stage 9 and we have
the last stage that is stage 10 projects
so the first step in projects is working
on projects provides and helps you build
ideas
one of the most important things that a
beginner or an experienced person should
follow to get better at programming
logic has to do projects
working on some real life projects will
give you an exposure and experience to
become better at programming
the second step is it improves the
ability and development speed you can
make any small application or if you're
an experienced person then you can build
some complex or big projects it improves
your skills and build logic in your
personality you also get an idea of how
the workflow of creating a project goes
on
finally
develop creative and logical skills when
you work on a project you need to solve
a big problem by breaking it into
smaller steps this helps you to improve
your logic building skills and
creativity levels
and with that we have come to an end of
this session on how to improve logic
building skills and programming we hope
