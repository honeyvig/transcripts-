advanced persistent threats making it
ideal for cyber security analyst so this
was all about the cyber security analyst
now moving to the next Ru that is
incident RIS responder so now we will
have a detailed overview starting with
understanding the role so incident
responders are critical to an
organization cyber security team tasked
with addressing and managing the
aftermath of security breaches cyber
attacks or other security incidents
their role is pivotal in minimizing the
damage from such incidents and
preventing future breaches by analyzing
what occurred and implementing improve
defenses so now we'll have an insightful
look into the role of an incident
responder so talking the role level so
this role level applies entries from
entry level to mid level while entry
level positions are available especially

Rewards of this essential cyber security
role so now moving to the next role that
is security software developer an
in-depth overview will be given you
overh so security software developers
are specialized professionals who focus
on creating secure software applications
they are tasked with incorporating
security measures throughout the
software development life cycle to
prevent vulnerabilities and protect
against cyber threats we'll give you a
closer look at the role and the required
salary types and the skills and
certification so starting with the role
level so this role level is open for the
entry level mid level and Senior
positions so security software developer
that is typically requires a substantial

cyber security field so security
software developers play Vital role in
today's digital ecosystem crafting
software that meets functional
requirements while also being resilient
to cyber threats their work ensures that
software applications can protect user
data and maintain integrity and
confidentiality making this role both
challenging and essential in the f fight
against cyber crime so now moving to the
next role that is penetration tester or
ethical hacker now we will have an
comprehensive overview so penetration
testers also known as ethical hackers
are cyber security professionals who
specialize in proving for and exploiting
security vulnerabilities in networks
applications and systems their primary
role is to simulate cyber attacks in a
controlled environment to identify and
address potential security issues before
malicious attackers can exploit them so
here's an in-depth look we will first
have a look look at role level that is
entry level to senior level so while
there are entry level positions
available in penetration testing these
often require foundational knowledge in
cyber security and related experience so
progressing to more advanced roles

$130,000 annually with a median salary
of approximate
$92,000 and the senior level penetration
testers and those with highly
specialized skills can expect salaries
at the higher end of this range and now
moving to the education and skills so
bachelor's degree in sa security
information technology computer science
or a related field is often required
however a strong portfolio of practical
experience and relevant certification
can sometimes substitute for formal
education now coming to the skills so
the number one on the list is

Frameworks and compliance requirements
and then excellent problem solving
skills and creativity for finding new
ways to breach defenses and last on the
list is strong communication skills that
is for preparing and presenting findings
to both Technical and non-technical
audiences now moving to the
certifications certifications play
crucial role in the field of penetration
testing by validating one skills and
knowledge so popular certification for
penetration testers include offensive
security certified professional oscp one
of the most respected certification for
Hands-On offensive Information Security
Professionals focusing on penetration
testing skills and next on the list is
certified ethical hackers C offered by
EC Council that covers a broad range of
topics in ethical hacking and
penetration testing and then we have G
penetration tester gpn that focuses on
penetration testing methodologies and
best practices and then we have licensed
penetration tester LPD a certification
that goes beyond technical skills to
include the legal and ethical aspects of
penetration testing and then we have
ptia pentest plus so that covers a
penetration testing and vulnerability
assessment and management that is
suitable for professionals looking to
enter the field so penetration testers
are vital to the cyber security
ecosystem offering a proactive approach
to discovering and mitigating
vulnerabilities before they can be
maliciously exploited with cyber threats
continually evolving the demand for
skilled penetration testers remain high
offering a challenging and rewarding
career path for those with the passion
and dedication to pursue it so this was
all about penetration testers now moving
to the last entry level cyber security
role that is network security architect
so Network security Architects play a
crucial role in designing implementing
and maintaining an organization's
network security infrastructure they
ensure the security of data transmited
across digital networks protecting it
from cyber threats and unauthorized

$160,000 annually with a median salary
of approximately
$120,000 salaries at the higher end of
the range are typically found in larger
metropolitan areas and at companies with
extensive network security needs so now
talking about education and skills so
bachelor's degree in computer science
cyber security information technology or
related field is generally required many
employees also value candidates with a
master's degree or special training in
network security or architecture now
coming to the skills list so network
security architect should have expertise
