we start without wasting any
time yeah first of all good evening one
and all I hope you're done with oral
pathology and oral
medicine uh recent Grand exam which is
for 240 marks I hope everyone of you
have done I just need your response
people who are done please do respond me
on the CH
box op and om done done please quick
response yeah now yeah very good very
good response okay if you are not done
please finish it uh let it be if you are
part of any coaching Center the most
important thing in any competitive exam
let it be now or let it be post MDS if
you're planning to give sship
examinations
or let it be when you're planning to
move to different countries to write
license exams in any competitive exam
the most important thing is even if you
don't read even if you read whatever it
is you need to give exams properly on
time and you need to analyze the exams
okay so that you will find out the areas
where you are going wrong I'm not
talking about subject wise or topic-wise
okay analysis wise which aspect you are
going wrong okay you may be reading good
but you cannot score marks okay that's
what I was talking uh in morning to few
of you uh reading hours hours and giving
an exam that is for Theory exam not for
an McQ based exam okay my simple example
is you're you prepared very hard for
Down syndrome okay Down syndrome you
read so much of content from the videos
from the worksheets you have done but
without solving an McQ on a Down
syndrome
I cannot tell you whether you are
perfect or not because if I'm asking you
to write a nine marks or a four marks
answer on a Down syndrome whatever you
have read you can do it but if I'm
asking a single point a particular line
or particular concept related to a
particular characteristic future or a
particular aspect of a Down syndrome
that is very very specific to that point
whether you know it or not so only when
you're solving mcqs after reading also
after reading and watching videos only
if you solve mcqs okay then only you
will know whether you are you have done
it properly or
not there may be few lines where
everyone can answer but whenever the
question is on application based okay
you need to solve okay I see like most
of us in the entrance exams we fail
because we read content and we read McQ
okay so clear I think my words are very
clear most of us
in my past experience what I have seen
is most of the students they work so
hard but they fail in the exams the
reason is synopsis they read Smart Video
notes they read worksheet they read and
McQ also they read McQ is not reading
you should not read an McQ you should
solve an McQ okay you should solve an
McQ okay McQ always be solved right so
this is a very very important aspect
that I want you guys to make a note so
that your preparation can be enhanced
okay when you give exams on
time and if you feel like you are not up
to Mark in scoring or you want to
improve your scorings you need to sit
with the mentor talk with the mentor or
you need to analyze your question paper
after giving and find out the areas
where you are going wrong or find out
the reasons where you're going wrong
okay so this is a very very important
aspect in the preparation even if you
are straight away as of now even if
you're straight away in around like uh
300 plus or 350 plus okay there are high
chances that you can move from these 300
400s and 500s to score of what you
really deserve like 550s 650s or 750s or
more than that okay because now for your
final exam need you have in and around
like five and half months to six months
of preparation time which is decently
sufficient to improve your scores from
these 300 odds to 600 or 650 plus odds
where you are going to end up with a
desirable college or a desable
department of your choice I hope this is
very very clear clear guys please give
exams exams will give you the outcome
exams will tell you where you are going
wrong exams will help you in rectifying
your mistakes in overcoming your
mistakes without giving exams I feel
it's impossible to crack a rank okay
exams are the most most most most
important part of your it's not smart
videos it's not uh doing books from
different different sources it's not
doing repeats it's not be uh you part of
a big coaching Center here and there
okay no the only aspect which is going
to help you the golden standard step for
your final exam is you give exams
according to the schedules on time okay
you are in the competition you are in
the competition you're eligible for that
seat whatever you're targeting for right
clear okay right uh so keeping our oral
path and oral medicine exam a subject
heavy subject but a single subject
together single subject subject which
has very good weights in the exam
keeping that exam aside uh I'll try to
discuss like what we are going to do in
the upcoming few uh like for example in
the upcoming one one and half month okay
I hope you got this schedule already so
from tomorrow we are going to start
general pathology General pathology is
in front of you so along with General
path of course most of you have done
blood in the oral path okay but even
then I have I have demarcated blood as a
separate topic okay so along with
General
pathology you guys are going to do blood
a little bit of physiology a little bit
of medicine a little bit of pathology so
that we are going to do from Tomorrow a
few of you have already started I'm
going to give you the checklist of this
particular subject along with
microbiology once we are done with enter
okay so what we are going to do is we
are going to start from September 19
that is from tomorrow we are going to
start general path okay General path is
a minor subject okay because along with
along with micro along with micro it is
going to carry 14 marks in the exam okay
so it's a minor subject micro is one
more minor subject okay so General
pathology you have six to seven topics
hardly okay and most of the topics are
very very comfortable a little bit of
concept oriented stuff will be there in
your in the case of your uh chapter
genetics but rest of everything you sit
with a worksheet okay it Ram so you can
calmly cool composed you can do it most
of the questions in general path will be
direct Let It Be histology based okay or
let it be a direct questions will be
there which you can easily answer okay
so pathology we going to do so once we
are done with pathology uh the next
comes is we are going to do CVS okay we
are going to do CNS okay CNS you're
going to do general medicine part you're
going to do physiology part followed by
endocrine you're going to do general
medicine physiology and most of the
endocrine part is slightly already
covered in your oral path and oral
medicine okay already covered okay
Endocrinology is again a part of your
oral path and oral medicine we have done
it so once we are done with these two
systems of general medicine physiology
part okay then uh we are going to move
to the
microbiology uh along with the
infections part so microbiology is a lot
about infections again that's what I'm
telling these infections exclud clely
the bacterial viral fungal infections
without your parasitology okay
parasitology here we are going to cover
in microbiology except parasitology most
of the bacterial viral fungal infections
which are very very important for the
examination point of view are covered in
your oral path and oral medicine you
have already done it if you're not done
we will be doing it again clearly so
you'll be having General microbiology
where we are going to talk more about
sterilizations and all those basics of
microbiology with a little bit of immune
system hyper sensitivities uh your
immunoglobulins very important topic is
hyper sensitivities immunoglobulins okay
uh all these are very very important
topics which will be coming under your
general microbiology with a little bit
about vaccinations followed by we'll be
jumping into the viral fungal uh
micology that is viral fungal bacterial
viral fungal and followed by we're going
to do parasitology so that's we are
going to do in microbiology followed by
microbiology on October 8th we are going
to start biochemistry one more minor
subject biochemistry followed by a week
we're going to
start proo in combination with dental
materials and followed by uh the next
one is uh we're going to do general
surgery okay so this is a outline but I
am planning to drop one more Grand exam
after biochemistry okay after
biochemistry a grand examination will be
there which will be covering General
path CNS okay and endocrinology
microbiology and biochemistry I'll let
you know the exact dates and everything
with a day Gap in between okay so this
is the 10 day to schedule I hope you're
clear guys till this point we're going
to do my general path from tomorrow and
we are going to do blood along recap of
blood what we have done in oral path and
oral medicine followed by we're going to
do CNS and we're going to do
Endocrinology a little bit of c CVS also
as I promise you that I'll be doing CVS
revision also so we'll be doing CVS
revision CNS and Endocrinology will be
done followed by we are going to jump
into microbiology infections why I have
demarked infections is infection is a
very biggest topic either from oral path
oral medicine and general medicine also
general medicine also infection is a
very very important and a big topic so
along with micro we'll be doing lots of
very common infections where the
questions are very very frequently Asked
such infections will be done followed by
we are going to do biochemistry then we
are going to take a grand exam on all
these subjects right clear
right clear individually we are going to
have a subject specific exam like
General path you'll be having one exam
microbiology you'll be having one exam
uh biochemistry you'll be having one
exam okay individually you're going to
have subject specific and together
you're going to have a grand exam of 240
marks according to the new pattern of
neat that is timeline based pattern that
whatever we are practicing from so many
days so we'll be having one such
examination clear right clear about the
schedule rough schedule exact dates what
to be done everything I'll be discussing
uh I'll be posting as a PDF on the group
okay once we are done with this class
clear okay
CH done so leaving this aside uh I'm
directly now jumping into what to be
done for General pathology
okay okay right so coming to General
pack so coming to General pathology so
you already have worksheet of General
pathology
right worksheet of gent pathology is
already with you guys okay right so
first and foremost thing that I want you
guys to do from General pathology okay
that is uh plan a plan Pro and offline
students okay so this worksheets are
accessible smart videos are accessible
only with these three plans so all these
people who fall under these plans the
first thing that you need to do is take
the worksheet finish the smart videos
you don't that's what I'm telling
pathology is a very very simple
organized subject okay you don't have n
number of videos here you don't have n
number of topics here you hardly have
six topics worksheet is properly made
sit with the smart videos none of the
smart videos are more than like 30 to 40
minutes so you sit hardly 8 to 10 hours
you can finish entire pathology smart
videos with well organized worksheet
clear right the first step that I want
you to do is finish smart videos
plus worksheet of all the
topics single stretch clear clear
guys Smart Video print has to be taken I
want you to sit with the smart videos
work sheeet plus smart videos has to be
done now the second one
is revision revision of this you need to
revise it properly understand everything
properly writing is different revising
is different okay then the third one is
mcqs okay what mcqs mcqs from any source
of book that you have maybe Dental pulse
or maybe
dentist or maybe from the
website and make sure whenever you're
solving a question a question is simple
direct don't go with the explanation if
you already feel explanation is
sufficient enough in your smart
in your worksheet don't time don't waste
your time on reading the same content
okay for example a simple direct
question on necrosis types of necrosis
liquefaction necrosis is seen in which
of the following organ or seen in which
of the following condition fat necrosis
is seen in which of the following
condition basic differences I mean like
a question on gas gangen which you are
which you know it okay so whenever you
find a question which is out of box
which is out of box in the sense which
is out of your worksheets then I I want
you to read the explanation underline
the explanation okay one part is you
want you can underline or you can
straight away convert that simple short
notes to your
worksheets please do add few more white
pages to your worksheet so whatever you
don't know whatever mcqs you don't know
whatever mcqs you're not able to solve
from any of the books whatever you're
following Mark them whatever mcqs which
are direct straight away no application
based straight away direct questions
from your worksheet from your smart
videos no need to revise them you're not
going to do these mcqs again these mcqs
has to be done once okay and whatever
you find tricky whatever you find new
whatever you find out of box new lines
new points all those stuff has to be
added to your worksheet clear guys third
step is very very important means you
need to solve an McQ after solving the
McQ you should differentiate whether the
McQ is straight away mean straight away
mcqs I'm not going to do again questions
which are application based questions
which you are not able to answer I want
to solve them again or I want to add
them to your worksheets clear very
important because pathology revision is
going to be hardly one day or one and
half day once you do pathology again if
you want to do pathology in the revision
sessions it should be only one day one
and half day because application based
questions in pathology will be minimal
less new questions will be less most of
the questions will be straight away so a
subject which has less straightaway
questions you have to revise in a very
very limited time I told this again for
your dental
Anatomy application based questions in
your dental Anatomy will be very very
less application questions in your
general Anatomy will be very very less
but in your oral surgery it will be more
oral surgery application based questions
will be more so as the application based
questions are more you need to allocate
more time for revision of those subjects
okay so at General path you need to keep
less time for Vision so your content has
to be organized well clear clear guys
okay so then we'll go with the regular
pattern
okay whatever mcqs whatever contents
diagrams that are being discussed on the
group if you don't if you find something
new please do add to the worksheets or
else just it's just like a quiz enjoy
the quiz answer them if you don't know
correct yourself move on okay right
clear guys this is a very very simple
checklist for your general pathology
right and the checklist is going to be
same for your microbiology okay
microbiology worksheets will be posted
enjoy the smart videos understand the
concepts see the clinical photographs
because lots of photographs are being
added to your worksheets you see so many
diagrams so many diagrams so many
diagram based discussions cross-sections
were discussed microbiological Futures
were discussed histopathological
feutures were discussed lots of contents
were discussed and given to you in the
worksheets of both General path as well
as your
microbiology clear
clear
guys I want your response on the chat
box quick quick so the the checklist
will be same for you for
microbiology as well as general
pathology right okay done okay then uh
jumping into people who are preparing
for inic right there are few people who
are preparing for in so which module you
are in
inic hope you're done with module 2
examination if you're not done please
try to finish it as quick as possible so
now we are into module three of inic can
you tell me what are the subjects which
are included in module
three one is the running subject General
pathology second one the upcoming
subject
microbiology physiology
and general medicine right clear
guys
clear I want your response quick this is
only for in8
people
okay right so according to the schedule
GP is going so GP will be done and micro
micro will be done because we have only
11 days for I already this is the first
day okay so majority of General path and
microbiology will be done in the next 10
days okay so that is already included in
the schedule okay but as of now medicine
and Physiology part we will be doing CVS
we will be doing CNS we will be doing
Endocrinology in the next three or four
days okay after River after this General
pathology followed by CVS CNS and endal
okay so what I want you to do apart from
this according to your schedule is I
want you to do the revision part of old
systems which are done okay all systems
right we are done with all systems G is
done respiratory system is done renal
system is done CVS is done nerves are
done muscles are done okay all the
leftover systems whatever you have done
previously whatever worksheets you have
written previously I want you to go back
and check those worksheets and try to do
those topic specific or subject specific
mcqs whatever you have done you try to
solve them
clear that is about the slight
modification of schedule for the people
who are preparing for
in okay right okay so keeping these
aside okay uh as we are going deep into
the preparation few people are started
now few people are taking the things
seriously Maharashtra interns uh Tamil
NAD interns Karnataka interns all the
few interns are almost done with their
internships started their preparation
seriously few of them mut to offlin
Anders so different people are at
different levels of preparation okay
preparation cannot be same for each and
every one of us the main important
aspect that I want to stress on in this
in this in this uh in this session is
okay know your capabilities know your
time limitations know your commitments
plan accordingly plan cannot be same for
everyone okay plan cannot be same for
everyone like if your range of scores
even after giving exam is still 300 300
400s
450s sit with the mentor find out the
right way to move from 450 to 550 if
you're hitting 500s 550s find the way to
move from 550 to 600 if you're already
Crossing 650 700 find the way to to
stably stay at that okay because the
direction from 350 to 450 is not same as
the direction from 450 to 550 is not the
same as 550 to 650 okay because plans
implementation strategies are going to
be different at different different
levels so be comfortable take your
chance sit with the mentor talk with the
mentor what to be add on what to be
removed please do plan on okay because a
person who is working so hard but not
able to hit that 400 Mark even at this
time you need to find out the reason so
there should be something should be
remov from the reparation so that your
burden has increased okay it's something
like a load you're carrying lots of load
even after working hard you're carrying
lots of load you are not able to hit
that 400 450 by this time means there is
there should be some load that should be
removed from you so that you can run
hard reach that 450 Mark okay and people
who are having 550 600s want to move to
700 an extra load has to be added okay
so this is completely a strategy okay
because reading will not give you marks
only reading will not give you marks
there is something Beyond reading there
is something Beyond analyzing okay so
that you need to sit with the mentor
it's okay if you're hitting 600s very
constantly I'm not talking about such
category of individuals okay they're
already on the boat they know what
they're doing they are capable of
understanding they're capable of
analyzing they're capable of everything
I am not worried about the people who
are are constantly hitting that 600 650s
or 550s constantly yeah okay no need to
talk with the mentor you need to talk
with the mentor just for motivation I
more worried about the people who are
working hard still jumping in 300s 400s
you need to talk with the mentor right
away this is a very beautiful face you
need to talk with the mentor because we
have six months yeah we have six
beautiful months of preparation time
even if you're an intern 6 months is
something very very extraordinary I
personally feel like six month months is
a very good thing you can you can start
your preparation today and reach the
highest goal by the end of 6 months 6
months is a beautiful time let it be a
repeater Let It Be intern or let it be
an intern who has finished internship
recently want to stretch your
preparation for fulltime yes my answer
is 6 months is a very very beautiful
time okay no need to doubt about it but
make sure Mentor sitting with the mentor
talking with the mentor
add-ons sometimes you you have to add on
something to your preparation sometime
you have to subtract something for your
preparation to make it better okay it's
not always like I see like repeaters
coming back reading heavy heavy books no
no no no we need to read basing upon our
capability okay you have a buffet in
front of you you need to eat basing upon
your capability your stomach capability
few people they can eat heavy few people
they cannot eat heavy it is something
similar like that okay so please do make
make make a word 600 plus it's okay I'm
not going to I'm not much worried about
those category of individuals but if you
are still playing or playing in before
that like 300s 400s not able to touch
that 500 Mark yes it's a good time that
you need to interact talk with the
mentor find out a way to improve your
scores okay six months is a good time
okay right clear
clear and second thing uh okay uh life
life is beyond beyond the preparation
okay I'm bored of these uh um like
achieving great great ranks uh after
after 10 years what I feel is uh yes
rank is important to select a department
uh rank is important to select a college
rank is important to get a stifen okay
but it's always uh the mindset which is
more important than rank to survive in
dentistry to survive in country like
India which which stands first in the
entire population okay you stand you in
a country where uh it is the highest
highest ranking one in the population so
it is definitely is going to be ranking
one in the dental patients okay you you
have the highest number of patients in
our country the dental problems highest
variations of cases in our country okay
and you have everything okay you have
everything and this everything requires
you to stand out for that okay it's not
uh like once you get a rank once you
join a college once you are entered into
the department this rank is no way
useful okay the maturity what you have
the analysis what you have the way you
talk the way you interact the way you
convince the patient the way you develop
your hand skills passion towards the
Dentistry or the towards the department
is more important that's what I'm
telling that is beyond all these
readings and everything okay uh I still
remember the day uh the day one of MDS
conqueror the first badge of MDS conquer
or I myself as a first year MDS PG the
thought process that what I have on the
day one is totally different on on this
day okay it's almost like nine years I
entered into 10th year 10 batches lots
of students thought process or approach
has totally been changed okay so I mean
it's not going to happen on the day one
it's not going to happen initially but
it comes with the experience it comes
with a being positive okay right so we
all
require a good preparation to end up
with a good rank but that's what I'm
telling like in this six months apart
from the rank we try to develop the
passion towards what we are planning to
enter we will'll we'll try to learn the
ethics we'll try to learn that that
skills to talk with the patient that
skills to be positive in this Society
because India as already said like we
are in a country where highest
population is there so whenever the
population is more the negativity will
be more the spreading of negativity will
be more you can see the the stuff that
is going in social media anywhere like
it spreads fast positivity spreads fast
or negativity spreads fast you have a
word with you so in a country where you
have the highest population you have the
highest negativity let it be your
surroundings let it be your relatives
let it be anywhere you go there will be
more negativity okay so the most
important thing in our profession
particularly as as a doctor as a
counselor because being a dentist is
being a counselor right you need to uh
tell the patient understand the patient
do something make sure you give best to
the patient okay you give best to the
patient first of all we need to do some
best to the patient so in this process
you you will encounter lots of
negativity negativity is a very very
common thing it is not there in a few
other countries because I was I used to
travel like you see the negativity in a
few other countries is very very minim
istic here it is everywhere you see you
walk you it's there you going into
social media it's there you going to
Instagram it's there you going to
YouTube it's there okay so main
important aspect is yes learn get a rank
we learn the principles we learn the
principles we learn the ethics we learn
how to be positive and this preparation
will tell you everything how to be cool
and composed even in the toughest
situation so preparation is not just
reading giving exams getting ranks
telling bye-bye going back to something
uh doing something over there coming
back working somewhere opening a clinic
going to us getting a married having
kids this is a very very common thing
that every flowchart of a Dentistry
whether it's a boy or girl that's we are
going to do this is okay five five years
back I'm a different individual I had a
flowchart 10 years back I'm a different
individual I had a flowchart and
probably 80 to 90% is of us will have
the same flowchart there's no no
variations okay but what's going to make
the difference is who is there in the
flowchart in my flowchart I am there I
make myself unique I make myself
good following the principles following
the ethics being
responsible similarly you're no way
called as a student anymore even if a
postgraduate you're nowhere called as a
student remove the tag of PG student
okay you are a PG or a doctor you're
going to do best to the patient in the
process of doing best to the patient you
are doing best to yourself you're doing
best to your family or you're doing best
to your Society okay so it's a process
okay in this common flowchart that
everyone of us go I want you to be
unique I want you to be responsible I
want you to follow the ethics I want you
to enjoy the flowchart please enjoy the
flowchart please enjoy the process don't
keep yourself too too heavy take simple
simple suggestions Implement them in the
preparation get a better man okay it's
not mandatory that every one of you have
to do this have to do that get into that
colus get into this colus it's okay cool
composed enjoy the process enjoy the
life enjoy the Dentistry enjoy whatever
Department you get even I I talk with my
oral pathology oral medicine oral
Radiology no one is so passionate to
enter into those departments but there
are few people who entered into those
Department
ments because of some unavoidable
situations but even then okay even then
you can do best to yourself you can rock
Dentistry even an oral pathologist even
an oral medicine fellow okay even even a
department which you never thought of
entering you entered it you can do it
it's all about you the department the
college the xets are just attacks you
are most important person in this entire
Journey in this entire common flowchart
that everyone are traveling the most
important person the most respectable
person is you whatever you're doing you
should respect yourself first of all
then people will automatically show
respect to you guys clear don't stress I
was talking few of you people are
telling I'm feeling anxiety I'm feeling
fear
sleeplessness no you means you're you're
working hard you're getting marks even
then you're feeling anxious you're
working hard getting marks even you are
having that Fear Factor you're not able
to sleep properly then what is the
problem is you are not enjoying the
process you're not you more worried
about the outcome but you have to enjoy
the process while cooking if you enjoy
the process of cooking then the outcome
will be beautiful if you don't enjoy the
process of cooking like cooking like a
mission then the outcome is maybe
unpredictable so life moves around very
very simple things and most of us we
complicate the simple things and this
complication lead to anxiety this
complication lead to CVS problems CNS
problems stress related issues
psychological issues right life is so
simple here let's let's view the life in
the simplest way okay so don't uh I mean
like uh if you're
preparing you should only prepare okay
means you should not include your
personal stuff to the preparation like I
I my personal suggestion for all of you
is don't combined your personal to your
professional life professional life is a
different thing personal life is a
different thing people who demaret these
two things by a narrow line will rule
Dentistry will be happy personally okay
guys clear clear enjoy the process let's
enjoy the process you're learning enjoy
the process find out the mistakes
rectify the mistakes try to move ahead
step by step try to achieve your goals
you work hard you work hard in a proper
way with the with the mentor
leave the rest to God okay this is like
I I can tell myself as an example I'm a
very good student in first BDS very good
in second BDS third BDS final BDS but I
never used to get that uh appreciation
from any of the staff or from from any
of the department e either the case of
the marks the only thing I get
appreciated is the theory uh the theory
marks which were given by the university
okay so we never get appreciation and I
got the appreciation is I got the
appreciation in the final year I got
distinction I never thought that I will
get a distinction but I got the
distinction appreciation was there and
whatever the things which I have learned
I have written I have prepared notes is
I thought they are useless so many of
them they thought they are useless but
now they are useful to so many people
okay so many people are using them so
it's just a process okay so try to enjoy
the process once you guys enjoy the
process you will definitely reach
Heights in your life
okay
right so G respiratory renal and all
these for people who are preparing for
inct that is module 3 schedule so go
back you're I hope few of you are
already part of inic group that is
module three of in okay so whatever
you're following the regular
standardized schedule in in schedule is
slightly different from the regular
schedule regular schedule will be on
your regular WhatsApp group DP you can
go back check your WhatsApp group DP
you'll get an idea anything more guys I
don't want to waste your time much just
go take break or if you want you don't
want to take a break go start your GP
don't waste the time start your GP
whenever you want you can take break
okay anything important or shall I close
the
session yeah don't think too much that's
what my only suggestion for you is don't
think too much thinking too much will
lead to more negativity don't overreact
to the situation I see like few people
they react very over to the situation
but at the end once we compare once we
see I don't find that extraordinary
result what I was expecting from that
particular individual because that
particular individual may be
unnecessarily overreacting to the
situation and spoiling simple simple
aspects that's what life is so simple
preparation is also so simple why we
spoil is the way we think has to be
changed okay the approach has to be
changed find out the reason why you're
not able to reach that particular Mark
or find out the reason why you are not
able to spend some time for example like
you're you're having like a 2 hours or
three hours preparation time per day may
not be
sufficient but try to find out the
reason to overcome that yes that's what
like even I have I also have that Fear
Factor like I have the Fear Factor why I
have the Fear Factor I I I I'm I'm so
worried like about my students whether
they're reading or not whether they're
understanding or not whether they're
doing or not but reading or not
understanding or not is out of my hands
okay because there are few things which
are in your hand which you can solve it
but there are few things out of your
hand so things which are out of your
hand or which are out of your control
there's no point to worry okay right of
course you will have the Fear Factor
so to manage the Fear Factor that's what
I'm telling like you should have your
own way of breaking that stress so like
that's what I'm telling I I expressed
this so many times like how I break my
stresses I'm not a big fan When I Was
preparing for my entrance examination
I'm not a big fan of uh I mean big fan
of God or big big fan of temples and all
this stuff but what I strongly believe
in a temple or in a church okay because
I studied my BDS is from a Christian
College my schooling is from Christian
College so I'm more inclined to
Christianity and of course I'm a Hindu
okay I and uh my roommate uh throughout
my BDS and MDS is a muslim okay right so
we have all these combinations like what
I strongly believe it is let it be any
religion my motor is let it be a church
or let it be a mid or let it be a temple
is a source of positivity so people
entered over there will not think about
Nega negativity they don't talk Negative
they don't talk rubbish they don't talk
bad words whenever at least they enter
into these places they don't fight there
so definitely these places are going to
be a places of positivity no one is
going to shout in the library so library
is also a place of positivity study room
is a place of positivity so whenever you
enter such places sit for some time okay
sit for some time do meditation for 10
or 15 minutes or if you have a habit of
praying to God you do sit 10 to 15
minutes you pray then stress levels will
break down it's not movie which is going
to break the stress it is about
surrounded by positive people surrounded
by positive energy is going to make you
to break the stress like for example I
regularly see in the offline Center or
anywhere when I go to going to the
interactions or somewh the group of
three or four people four or five people
they sit read together these people who
sit and read together probably will have
less
stress do you agree for that they may
probably have less stress because they
have their own stress breaker they have
their own stress breaker because their
friend the close friend is with that
with them who is going to break the
stress always so so whenever you do such
things like whenever you do something
like you do a good thing it's going to
break your stress okay you do a good
thing like you you talk with someone you
do a good case you talk with a patient
you motivated your patient you talk with
your sister you motivated your sister or
brother you do something good it's going
to automatically break your stress so
it's very simple like you you're
anxious uh you're depressed you're
frustrated okay do something good do
something good and my suggestion is or
if you are not able to do something good
at least you try to uh enter into a
place or get surrounded by a people who
are positive the best way to be positive
best source of positivity is as I said
right people uh
[Music]
so that that is a simple area of
positivity you go to such place sit for
10 or 15 minutes you see people coming
there will very obedient to God they
follow the rules they follow the
regulations okay they leave the foot
outside they do all good there right so
when you see good good things around you
you automatically the stress will break
and you all automatically fall on track
this is my personal experience like I
used to my brain is to blow like
anything that's intra pressure that
highest value I used to reach When I Was
preparing for entrance because my
situation is so horrible When I Was
preparing for entrance personally family
wise and everything so the only one who
can break who can who can give a
solution to me is I blindly go to the
nearby Temple sit for 10 or 15 minutes
come back read again I go to Temple
again I frequently I used to go to
Temple I I still remember those tricky
tough days but that's what like uh
preparation may not be same for every
one of us okay most of us are at
different levels of preparation
commitments will be
different thoughts will be different in
everything okay right so let's let's
start with a positive
note yeah pathology we are starting from
today because we we hardly have like
let's let's open our I we hardly have
maybe like 180 days less than 180 days
for the preparation even if you remove
30 days even if you're starting
preparation now remove 30 days for
revision at least 30 days should be for
revision so you have 150 days and in
this on 50 days you have to cover 20 odd
subjects that includes major and minor
which you divide like 150 by 20 odd
subjects it's
hardly a week for each
subject now whether you do pathology for
first time whether you do pathology for
second time according to the leftover
disc pathology has to be done within
seven days that's all okay the less the
time duration of time and I suggest you
not to count the number of days okay it
is not number of days it is the number
of hours you work okay for example
you're working two hours per day so you
have 150 days into two means your
preparation time is only left over 300
days 300 300 hours okay it's very simple
like you have 150 days you can maximum
spend 3 hours per day so it is you are
left over with 400 hours of preparation
for example 150 days you can make 10
hours per day it is500 hours of
preparation so see how much difference
you can see 150 to, 1500 or like 150
into 12 you can work then the numbers
are going to change okay so it is about
how many hours you can spend per day
left over that is more important in
calculation not the number of hours like
uh so you manage your schedules
accordingly that's what I'm my
suggestion for all of you is people who
are working in the clinics it's a very
peak time that I want you to quit your
clinics stop your clinics who are
interacting personally with me I'm
giving this as a suggestion for you okay
so it's a peak time if you're working in
the clinic
yes it's a time that you need to take
break from the
clinics okay already you're you're a
mother having kids it's a peak time that
you have to call your your mother to
help your kid okay or you need to call
your illas to take the responsibility of
the kid I'm not asking to uh take there
are few responsibilities in the family
in the home as a mother you have to take
okay you you want to keep a maid yes you
can keep a maid so such things simple
simple things will give you productive
outcome okay so keep a ma ask your
mother to come and help you okay so that
they are going to manage the kid they
are going to manage the householding
things so that you can focus extra one
or two hours in the preparation because
that one or two hours will totally
change the game plan in the next 150 to
200 days okay right
anything yes worksheets are enough all
the things are covered in the worksheets
you solve the worksheets keep the
worksheets in front of you finish uh
smart videos of micro and general path
yes everything is covered no need to
write heavy heavy noes don't waste your
time on writing the
noes anything more I think these are the
few questions which are
posted anything more
guys stay calm
cool stay calm cool okay your
wallpaper should focus because most of
us we spend most of our time with with
the phone okay right so whenever you
open phone your wallpaper should always
reminder you that you should keep your
yourself calm okay so what is the
problem with you what are the main
deviations that you have write down with
your handwriting nicely with pens or
colorful pens take a photograph keep
that as a wallpaper so whenever you open
your phone your phone will tell you so
these are the main things which are
disturbing you these are the main things
which are spoiling you so phone will
always reminder you uh come come back
come back open the books this is again a
methodology I have seen few of my
friends doing it few of few of the
students who are doing I have not done
it but I think most of them they told
it's working really good okay if you
want you can do
that okay guys uh
done anything uh you can please
personally me so that we can plan
accordingly please guide us on solving
240 question paper giving proper time to
no you cannot give any proper time
they're already given a proper time
already given right you're giving in
question module module exams your in is
basically divided into 200 mcqs and 200
mcqs are being splitted into four parts
okay so four parts that is 50 mcqs 45
minutes 50 McQ is 45 minutes okay it's
already splitted so there's no no need
to manage the time it's already managed
long back we have this pattern of
managing the time in this 45 minutes in
the first few minutes you need to solve
all the easy questions okay so for
example there will be questions right
which are simple straight away such
questions just a
second so such easy questions has to be
solved
first okay right
just a
minute okay right so uh whenever you're
taking a a question paper a lengthy
question paper
uh particularly for example a part part
A you're focusing on part A or part one
so in part one or part A normally uh I
mean we don't know the exact uh division
of neat because uh we need to wait for
the notification so roughly what I'm
telling is you may have 60 Questions in
each part 60 Questions uh for the first
45 minutes 60 Questions next 45 minutes
60 Questions 45 60 Questions 45 so in
the 60 Questions 45 minutes
in this first 60 Questions whatever that
are accessible to
you you need to identify you need to
exclude two types of questions one is
lengthy questions sometimes you may have
a 10 lines question reading 10 line
question itself will take more than one
minute or two minute so in the first
first session like whatever you're doing
in the first round of your part one so
first try to leave the questions which
are more than more lengthy four five
lines six lines lengthy lengthy
questions okay you keep you should you
should touch them in the second part
second round okay so in the part one
when you're solving so first leave this
question second one leave questions
which are inclined to mathematics okay
getting a formula inserting those
numbers getting an answer two third one
is you need to leave a question which is
which is which is asking you to spend
more time with the question
understanding the question understanding
the keywords lengthy lengthy things
where you need to recollect that
classification it's going to take some
time so exclude that question fourth one
there is one method of solving a
question what is that elimination bed
because in every exam we solve 10 to 15
percentage of questions by elimination
method means you you mark option D oh
this is not answer okay this is not
answer so elimination based will also
take more time so all these four four
categories of questions you have to keep
in the last 10 or 15 minutes so when
you're solving a question paper that to
in a part a so what questions has to be
excluded is these five category
questions has to be excluded why I'm
asking you to exclude these five
category questions is these five
category questions will definitely take
more than one minute because neat is
clearly reflecting you 60 Questions in
45 minutes means each question it is
asking you to solve each question in
less than 45 seconds so whenever you
find a question which requires more than
45 seconds that has to be kept aside
that has to be kept in the last so first
for example out of 60 questions you feel
like 40 45 questions are straight away
identify those 45 solve in the first
first first attempt then you'll be left
over with some 10 to 15 minutes or 20
minutes of time okay now go back go back
now go back to those those questions
okay solve them as many as possible you
try to solve them because even if you
leave five five questions which are
taking so much of time solving 55
questions is more safe than solving 45
questions right so this is uh
what what you need to plan accordingly
right clear clear uh I think uh
pal are you clear guy are you clear
about
this so once you're done with Session
One the same methodology for session two
the same methodology for session three
the same methodology for session
four uh I mean like we recently started
a zoom uh Zoom interaction and today I
have taken eight calls okay so uh I
think chaan has messaged uh chaitanya
you need to first message the mentor
probably as of now I am taking the
interact interactive sessions personally
few few of them which are very very
common uh which are very very common
topics maybe I'll check it off if it is
uh the video call is not too personal
okay without showing the face of the
student student uh we'll be posting on
the uh YouTube or we'll be posting on
the website for the access but if the
topic is too personal I may not give
access to such things uh but that's what
I'm telling you you need to ping me take
the appointment okay appointment will be
like 10 to 15 minutes uh the call will
be 10 to 15 minutes uh we can have a
personal talk on the zoom call uh uh
discuss the schedules uh maybe time
permits I'll I'll try to check your uh
website uh website exams and everything
where you're going wrong how you're how
how you're losing your marks that
analysis like will be taken like today I
have taken some eight or nine calls over
two hours of time so that that you need
to personally ping me so that I'll tell
you the exact time uh you have to be
ready and a personal Zoom link will be
posted to you so you can join uh on the
link and we can discuss uh about what to
be implemented and
everything no that's what like it's not
mandatory that you have to attempt all
all the questions in the final exam even
if you check out the Toppers the most of
the Toppers they are going to attempt
230 uh 230 35 Plus okay leaving five or
10 questions in neat examination we're
coming to in the range of attempt will
be 160 to 170 maximum they leave because
negative Mark impact in inct will be
more when compared to the neat neat is
minus 1/4 inct is minus 1/3 so negative
impact negative marking impact will be
more in in so that is the reason why
attempts will probably will be less in
in when compared to the neat exam I hope
this is clear
PR that's what K the question is like if
you for example if you're doing the
smart videos plus worksheets properly uh
I think like definitely half of the
questions of dental puls for example a
topic in a dental pulse is having some
50 or 60 Questions 50 uh they guys they
are many questions right which are which
are completely overlapped same question
will be given in different different
pattern and I feel like more than 30 to
40 questions of these 60 Questions will
be direct they're direct
right so they are direct like so once
you do such questions questions is all
questioning is question solving a
question is always about practice the
more you practice okay the more your
accuracy will be the less the chances
that you are going to do mistakes in
easy areas so there's nothing wrong in
practicing more mcqs because once your
foundation is proper the foundation will
be laid basically by the uh by the
worksheet and the smart videos that is
the foundation few of you maybe a
finally a post intern or an intern who
has a strong Foundation that is also
sufficient to solve most of the mcqs but
that's what I'm telling like foundation
will be laid by smart videos and
worksheets over which whatever you do
whatever you practice is going to
improve the accuracy in the foundation
okay that's what I'm telling like I
started with a note about Down syndrome
you read Down syndrome you you watch a
video on down syndrome you you you you
read a worksheet on a Down syndrome that
is different rather than doing a video
and a worksheet it is better you solve
10 to 15 questions on down syndrome
which is going to make you more
accurate so that is where that is that's
what like normally you have two modes of
preparation there there are few students
who are going to do an orthograde mode
of preparation that is reading a Content
then solving an McQ okay or there is one
more mode of preparation that is called
as retrograde preparation the few
students who don't read who don't read
or watch a video they directly solve
mcqs they directly solve mcqs so they
solve McQ they see the answer and if
they don't if they're not able to answer
a particular question or if not able to
understand a particular question they
read the explanation back again they
read the explanation back again okay
right so that is called as retrograde so
what I am suggesting you is whenever you
have a strong Foundation you got your
strong Foundation to you now you're
solving an McQ after the foundation that
is your your worksheets plus your smart
videos now for example you're solving a
questions you may encounter a question
which is
tricky you know the concept but you're
going wrong application based question
now what I'm telling is go and check the
explanation of that particular question
so this is called as a combination of
orro plus retro means retro in areas
where your weekend something like simply
like uh you have this right in end when
you're doing biomechanical preparation
you have something called as Recaps
solation coming back to the same one
okay so what you're doing is when you're
solving an McQ after your orthograde
preparation what you're doing is you're
coming retrograde you're Recaps cating
the areas where your concepts are not
clear where your memory is not able to
recollect so this methodology is going
to improve your accuracy okay right so
maybe website mcqs will not take much
time they're hardly like 20 or 25 on
each topic so it is just like hit and go
you if you're B if your foundation is
strong you just hit them go finish them
and come back okay right I hope you're
very clear clear about this
uh
cab anything
check out check out clinics uh try to
avoid try to avoid clinics until unless
it is your own Clinic we don't have any
other go if you're working under someone
I want your preparation I want you to
give full time for the preparation okay
full-time preparations will get good
ranks part-time preparations may end up
with the part-time ranks not in all
situations but now in this heavy
competition I strongly recommend you to
go for the full-time preparation
okay guys it's already hitting 7 so
let's not waste the time please go back
with your uh regular schedule of gentle
path I want you to start gentle path as
quick as possible okay right anything in
person uh doubts uh regarding the prep
or you want to have that one to one
personal talk for that 15 to 20 minutes
so please do drop me I'll let you know
the time and at that particular time we
will be posting you the link you can
join talk discuss everything like
personal stuff whatever you want you
feel like you want to exchange with the
mentor take some suggestions Implement
those suggestions for a betterment
you're always welcome okay see you bye
take care
