I have always had a strong
self-confidence and Relentless drive to
pursue in my career but I noticed that I
wasn't experiencing the personal as well
as the professional growth because I
observed that in the market individuals
with the pspo and the PMP certifications
are preferred more compared to the one
without any certification when I started
learning pspo I understood why it
completely shifted my focus from the
Project based mindset to a product based
mindset simply learn pspo has helped me
to understand deeply the roles and
responsibilities of the product owner
empowering me to take tough decisions in
my business venture and also in my
career hi I'm Jan Kumar hm I'm a
co-founder of sop Academy and
consultancy I stay in Shima
Karnataka to speak about my personal
life I married and I have two kids I
really love cooking when I off the work
apart from that I love listening to
music I recently left my job to start my
own Venture that is online Tutoring
company I began my career as a design
engineer in tata Johnson Controls India
limited where I was working on the
seating systems and the overhead systems
later on I joined Volvo India private
limited to take the next level of
responsibility where I was mainly
involved in the complete design and
development of the C body invite system
for the heavy commercial vehicles now my
main aim is to educate the engineers in
the product design and development
process so that they can create their
own product they can improve the
products where they are working in if I
start with something I won't give it up
until I find a solution for it apart
from this self-learning skills and my
self motivation are very crucial for me
I was fully immersed in my work I was in
my comfort zone enjoying the yearly
salary hikes and also the financial
rewards however few years before I was
experiencing that I was not growing
professionally as well as personally
that is when I realized that I need to
get certified which will promote my
skills in front of the potential
employers and that was a turning point
for me I approached many organizations
who provide the online courses on the
psbo and also on the PMP including
simply learn but the best part of the
simply learn is that the genuinity the
assistance that was provided by them
during the initial inquiry was really
amazing so this helped me to enroll into
this course within a
week overall the learning experience
with simply Lear was exceptional
especially the trainer Mr Sumit was
amazing with teaching techniques the
training had involved a lot of exercises
and a lot of tasks which made our
experience really great the trainer
formed small teams assigned us small
small tasks by which solving them and
also by which enrolling ourselves into
those tasks made our understanding
deeply into the course and also enhanced
our understanding on that I really
appreciate the support that I received
from the simply learn especially from
Miss nandini who enrolled me into this
course previously mainly I was involved
into product design and development
process only but the knowledge of the
simply learn and the pspo expanded me to
Encompass all the phases of the product
management what I learned was the
product owner oversees the entire
product management process however the
project managers handle the specific
faces I gained the insight into the
roles and the responsibilities of the
scrum master and learned how they help
the product owners in achieving their
goals and success so this was a very
important learning for
me it's very very important to upgrade
our skills and sharpen our skills in
fact I personally did not prioritize my
learning early in my career I was able
to do my MBA only after 10 years but
remember the market evolves and it's
very important to sharpen your skills
