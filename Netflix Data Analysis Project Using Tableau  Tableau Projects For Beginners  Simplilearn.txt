foreign
in today's session we are going to take
example of the Netflix database which we
have and we'll prepare certain reports
in order to identify what kind of
reports we can generate from such a data
set
So currently on my screen what you can
see is the Tableau the Netflix data
sheets the data sources where you have
the Netflix shows movies their
Associated duration uh what kind of
shows or movies are there they release
here are the associated rating
description and a key which is the show
ID now this is the unique identifier for
each show in this Netflix title sheet
and with this show ID all other sheets
are related like you know who are the
directors of the show in which country
the show was released what is the cost
of each show all that information is in
this sheet and to which particular
category basically the listed in
category is being uh listed in this
particular sheets so what we're going to
do is first we are going to import this
sheet into tableau
okay and then create relationship
between them using the Tableau
relationship canvas so first our the
primary transaction table the sheet in
which all the information related to
movies is there or shows is there is in
Netflix titles and then we will drag
sheet like Netflix cast titles cast now
W has automatically identified the
relationship between the show ID of
titles and show ID of titles cast and it
has made a join
so if you double click this
you can see this relationship
cardinality and the related fields
similarly I'll drag relation titles
category countries and directors
Now by virtue of this all the sheets
have now been joined with Netflix titles
and with this relationship ready we can
start preparing our reports
now let's create a basic report where we
can just glance the data like you know
whatever we were seeing in the Excel how
it looks in w
so you have all the types of movies then
for example I drag the release Here
now first I do not want to consider it
as a
Dimension so I'll just
release Here per category per type there
is a release Here
and then I'll drop the listed in
so now these are the categories so per
year the details of the categories right
and then you can
drag the title and the associated rating
so this is just a view of your data
we can name it as shows listing report
now let's try to create some report for
some
measures some numbers
Etc
so now let's check in which country how
many movies or titles were released you
know what is the count
so first let's drag the
country
so as soon as we drag the country
uh field it is identified that it has
the geographical names and identified
the latitude and longitude details so
Tableau internally does that
automatically and it has identified the
spots across the globe of the relevant
country
now let's drag the listed in on the
color section
now what it is doing is it is showing in
which country what different kind of
uh category wise movies are or shows are
being released like in Sri Lanka
documentaries have been released in
India action and adventure United States
action and adventure like this
now let's
put
account of
the titles right so if you see 247
action adventure movies or shows have
been released in United States
okay so this is one inference by this
particular report you can
identify
so let's save this report as
listed
in
by country
okay now let's create another report
we will call it as the per year
statistical report in this first I'll
put the release years in the column
now
count of Netflix titles so this is the
count of Netflix titles per year 2017
2016 14. and then count of Netflix
titles in the countries
this is the second bar chart okay now
what I'll do is I'll combine it into one
so one report
we are
moving in the bar creating the bar and
one in the line now I just have to
so we will click on the count of Netflix
titles by country right click Market
dual access
so now as soon as you click click this
both the uh charts have been combined
and right click over here and say
synchronize access
okay
okay so now if you can see see right in
2017 you had uh 2 303 Netflix releases
across all categories and one one five
nine
titles right one zero six three titles
in 2017. so this is a descending
representation of the count of titles
release per year across category and
across titles
so let's call this as
per year
stats
now let's create another report
number of shows
but title okay
so or or sorry per rating so we will
drag the rating column
and
we will
count of titles
unique count of titles and unique count
of show IDs
okay
one is bar and one is line
okay
so this is a report which shows rating
wise titles and the show IDs
happens
so in the tooltip you can see the
listing count of titles and show ID per
rating
okay so let's call it
shows per rating
now let's create another sheet
call it as
shows
by cast
so in this
what we're going to do is first drag the
cast column on the rows section you have
name all of all the cast and then we
drag the
show ID on the column section and put a
count d and sort it okay
you can remove
the null cast
and this is your
sorted order and on the labels section
you can say show Mark labels and you
will see the count that don't open care
has done the maximum then on Shahrukh
Khan om Puri nasruddin Shah so this is
the details on this sorted order that
who has done how many shows okay
then next is
shows by director similar to shows by
cast
dragged
director into rows
or differently if you want to prepare
into columns
and then count of
show ID
okay sort it
and you can actually filter out the null
director value
and this is the account put the label
so you can see Jan's Twitter has the
maximum shows
okay
then create another report
shows by category
now similarly drag the listed in
in the rows and show ID count
remove the null category
and sort
labels show Mark labels so International
movies are the highest category dramas
the next comedy International TV shows
this way
you have your category
now let's create a dashboard in which we
want to bring combine all these reports
and
take a common view so first let's drag
listed in by country
then
shows by director
also please let's set the size as
automatic
then let's drag shows by category
and shows by cast
now these four reports are on a single
dashboard we will link them to each
other so go to worksheet actions
add action
filter
select dashboard one
only select shows by category here
and in Target dashboard one
except shows by category keep everything
else
and in the source sheet just select
click select
click ok
now whatever category you will select
over here
that related category data will
automatically be shown in other reports
like see International movies across the
globe across countries directors of only
International movies who has done the
maximum
Johnny Tow and uh shows by cast right
that who has done the maximum
International movies or dramas
or comedies
travel has a maximum number of comedies
and then if you see the comedy movies uh
you know these are the count of comedy
movies released across the countries and
the who is the director
another a very interesting report which
you can prepare is that for example you
want to check in which country maximum
duration of
uh your
maximum duration of
movies have been released so
first let's create a measure
and remove this
okay
so if you see
maximum duration of the movies or the
entire Netflix content is maximum United
States then in India these many minutes
next is United Kingdom and you can also
change the colors
whatever you feel is as per your
standards or as per the convention you
can change the color combination
so there are multiple ways you can
generate reports and uh hope you have
understood how you can leverage such a
data to create your reports
