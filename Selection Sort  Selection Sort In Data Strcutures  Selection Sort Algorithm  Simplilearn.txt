hey everyone i am peppa khandelwal and i
welcome you all to simply launch youtube
channel in this session we will discuss
selection sort algorithm we shall begin
our session by introducing selection
sort
then we will discuss selection sort
algorithm
after that we will implement selection
sort algorithm in the code editor
finally we will sum up what we have
learned from this session
before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon below so you
never miss an update from simply runs
youtube channel
so without any further ado let's get
started with an introduction to
selection sort
the selection sort algorithm is an
in-place comparison based method that
divides the list into two halves with
the sorted portion on the left and the
unsorted half on the right then the
smallest element from the unsorted array
is chosen and swapped with the leftmost
element and that element is added to the
sorted error
now let's discuss the selection sort
algorithm
let's say we have an array
first we will divide this array in two
sub arrays unsorted array and sorted
array
then we will divide the minimum element
from the unsorted array and swap it with
the left most element of this unsorted
array after that we will add it to the
unsorted array
we will keep repeating this process
until there are no elements left on the
unsorted array
we have now introduced
sort and its algorithm
now let's implement this algorithm in
the code editor
we will start by creating a function
swap
argument will be integer pointer x
comma
integer pointer
y
will declare an element temp
to store the value of
pointer x
then we will store pointer wise value in
x
and we will store temps value in y
and that's how we can swap them
next we will write the definition of
selection sort function
void
selection sort
argument will be
end
array arr
comma and
n
we will declare variables and i
j
and a min
underscore idx variable to store the
minimum index
now we will one by one move boundaries
of unsorted sub arrays
so for loop
i is equals to 0
where i is less than n minus 1
i plus plus
we will find the minimum element in this
unsorted array so
min
underscore
idx
is equals to i
now for
a is equals to
i plus 1
j less than n
j plus plus
if
array element at jth location
is less than
array at the min index
then
min idx will be updated with j
now we will swap the form minimum
element with the first element
so we will call swap function
with argument as
ampersand
arr
at min idx
comma
ampersand
arr
at ith location
now we will write a function to print
this array
so void
print
array
argument as int arr
and its size
and n
uh
i is equals to 0
i less than
n
i plus plus
layout
arr
at i
layout
handle
now we will write the code for the main
block
so end
arr
is equals to
4 comma 2 comma 1 comma 8 comma 3
we will find the size of this array so
end n is equals to
size of
array arr
divided by
size
of this array is first element
now we will call selection sort function
argument as arr comma n
then we will try to print this so c out
sorted
array
and we will call the function print
array
to print this array
arr comma n
now let's try and execute this program
as you can see we have successfully
sorted this array using selection sort
algorithm
let's get back to our slides
at last let's sum up what we have learnt
in this session
first up the selection sort algorithm is
a comparison based in-place algorithm
next the selection sort algorithm is not
appropriate for use data sets
next up selection sort have the worst
complexity of big o of n square
finally it can be beneficial when memory
write is an expensive procedure
and this was all for today's session
