with the video game industry reaching
new heights with every passing year it
has been an uphill battle meeting the
demand with supply
what used to be branded as a form of
entertainment which is often nonsensical
has now become a curry of many
professionals across the globe thanks to
this rise in esports culture
a small category of esports will be
featured in the 2025 olympics much to
the surprise of the general public who
never saw video games to be anything
more than a leisure activity
with so much capital being invested in
this industry the development of these
games have their own career trajectory
and one of the most exciting prospective
roles in the market today
starting from coding at its base level
to complex machine learning algorithm
might it speak video game development
has a lot of potential for growth due to
the variety of languages one can learn
to be able to contribute
so hey everyone this is biaber from
simply learn and welcome to this video
on the best programming language for
gaming before we get started let's
understand the metrics behind the rise
in esports culture
according to a business insider article
the esports industry is on track to be a
1.5 industry by 2023.
this growth has been accentuated by the
fact that a multitude of academic
institutions now provide scholarships to
those people looking to pursue a career
in video games and represent their
organization professionally
as you can see the infographic the
growth in advertising revenue during
esports events have been growing at a
rapid rate
from 143 million in 2018 to 226 million
in 2020
video games have found prominence in the
daily household
it is said that 3 out of every 5
americans have either a sony playstation
an xbox or a personal computer built
specifically for gaming
such a high audience invites higher
sales figures which in turn generated
industry topping revenues you can see
the rate of growth getting stabilized as
we move into the 2020s indicating an
onset of esports culture normalization
which will most likely see it take one
of the top revenue generating streams in
the recreational sector it's not just
about the people though
thanks to this new era of digital sales
and easy access to gaming consoles
reputed game developers like electronic
arts ubisoft and bethesda have
constantly managed to rack up higher
production budgets
in some of these game titles
the production cost is more than in some
hollywood movies starting from hiring
voice actors and animators to finding
programmers and investing in marketing
this kind of splurge of cash has been
made possible purely due to the
consistent return of investment in games
like gta 5 and destiny
not every ambitious project will get
enough praise in the industry but
companies pay good money to make sure
they hit the right formula as often as
they can thus increasing the necessity
of efficient game developers
with the right foundation and
programming one can take the first step
to become a sought after name in the
video gaming industry
thankfully this video is here to give
you a primer on the right programming
language to choose for your career
let's have a look at what we are going
to learn today
we first learn what is video game
development then move on to the top
programming languages in the market to
start coding games on
we also look at some of the honorable
mentions when it comes to languages that
just miss the cut then have a
demonstration on how we can create a
game using python
so let's understand about what game
development is
video game development is the art of
creating a game rise from its design
development all the way to its release
it has various aspects throughout the
development cycle artifact design good
user experience balanced game mechanics
realistic animations and voice acting a
reliable network profile among many
other things
the highlights include the process of
designing the look and behavior of games
all the menus to all the maps that are
included in the game need to be designed
by certain animators and graphic
designers that work together as a team
in certain sects of the game
we also have reliable artifact designing
to the voice model which help in giving
life to the game
while programming is not exactly
compulsory to learn game development it
is essential in certain segments for
example while designing the look and
behavior of the games or the sound
designs programming is not as important
however when depending on the behavioral
aspect of some game engines programming
is a must
while many of these departments don't
need programming things like mechanics
input configuration and networking setup
can all be programmed from a single guy
to teams dispersed all around the globe
depending on the scope of the project
to help reduce the load for certain
developers game engines have been
created
they act as a set of pre-configured
modules and mechanics to accelerate the
process of game development
engines also help in easy distribution
among different platforms thereby
reducing the workload of the development
team by a considerable amount engines
like unity cryengine and unreal engine
have revolutionized the way games are
developed today and engines like these
keep pushing the boundaries of what we
can expect over a single framework
there isn't just a single department
that manages the complete cycle of the
game development it is the joint effort
so let's see some of these individual
teams
the input management team has a lot of
responsibility in creating a responsive
environment for the user to play in
this theme programs the kind of input
parameters to be used all the way to the
game reacts to movements actions and
interactions
the animation and design team is
supposed to be responsible for the first
impression that people have when they
see the game for the first time
be due to terrific graphics in the
trailers or an immersive gameplay
experience thanks to an open world the
design team holds a lot of weight in
deciding which way the game should
proceed
the sound production team handles all
the voice acting and the game response
in order to generate the best auditory
output
some video game titles have managed to
capture the atmosphere and war much more
accurately than some hollywood movies
apart from in-game production a solid
voice acting lineup helps build
credibility into the story and the
inverse of it leaves a sour taste in the
mouth
that is irrespective of the great
graphics of the responsive gameplay
behavioral optimization teams handle the
response of the games to user decisions
it can be simple condition based
programming or complex machine learning
algorithms that learn the user's habits
throughout the playing process to
deliver a much more personalized and
authentic gaming experience
now that we understand the basics of
programming in game development let's
see which languages are the most
preferred when starting out with game
development
the languages we are going to cover in
this video are c sharp
c plus plus
java
javascript
and lua
c-sharp is one of the most widely used
languages in the video game industry
thanks to its unique xna framework xna
framework is a set of tools and runtime
environments developed by microsoft
thanks to this framework c-sharp is very
popular when it comes to developing
games for windows operating systems and
xbox consoles
the famous unity engine was written
using c sharp to encourage new people in
taking a video game development as a
career instead of running through heaps
of codes as an amateur
c-sharp is used along with other
languages such as c plus plus and java
to create a fully functional game
platform ready for release
some of the most famous titles to be
written in c hash are the popular
multiplayer game rust and the classic
stardew valley
speaking of c plus plus it is still the
most basic language needed for game
development even after decades of its
arrival
it's very fast and compilation is
surprisingly quick even for large
products with multiple modules being
side loaded since c plus plus has been
in the industry for so long it has found
its way into almost every platform that
can run games and is easy to run across
different systems
the modular nature of c plus also helps
in better management of memory and cpu
resources thereby improving the overall
performance and user experience of the
game
it was a major part of the development
of game engines like unreal engine and
frostbite engine which are still being
used extensively in today's industry as
flagship development platforms
the most popular games written on c plus
plus can be attributed to the frostbite
game fifa series or the unreal engine
game hallmark those are the borderland
games series
java found its way onto the game
development scene with the introduction
of the mobile phone
starting from the old motorola phones to
the thick nokia handsets java has been
prevalent since then and is a crucial
part of development
java gets compiled on a java virtual
machine or a jvm
this helps in decreasing the reliance on
a machine specification and makes it
much more scalable
java also has a multi-threading feature
that allows it to run multiple threads
of a single cpu simultaneously
this earns a significant boost in
productivity and performance
it may not be as instrumental in today's
desktop caliber games but mobile based
applications still feature java at some
level in their code base
some popular games that employ java in
their codes are runescape and the
popular multiplayer game known as
minecraft
javascript on the other hand is a much
more suited to games that run on the
browser level
since it is already used for website
development integrating gaming mechanics
into the latest web technologies is
easier
this is possible due to the vast amounts
of libraries available for javascript
and a huge support community that has
been building it since the last decade
the well-known games in this javascript
sector are angry birds and the game
known as bejeweled
lua is a relatively quick and
cross-platform scripting language used
in game development
the language is very easy to learn
thanks to its easy syntax and
beginner-friendly language rules
a big bonus when it comes in developing
lua is the ability to modify game files
many models take a lot of effort into
adding extra content to a complete game
as per the request of the community
according to a survey conducted by
gamedev.net in 2003 lua was found to be
the most popular scripting language
being used for game development
lua finds its use in the development of
popular games such as roblox and
baldur's gate
apart from these languages there are a
few honorable mentions that i feel we
should look into that got overlooked in
the above list
we have all heard about python it can be
used for both development and scripting
purposes
the main advantage of using python is
its pygame module that acts as a quick
prototyping mechanism instead of running
through a lot of machines for testing
purposes
unfortunately the scope of game
development in python has a lower
ceiling than the other languages we
discussed before
the games which are written using python
are usually simple in both design and
function while also being two
dimensional in gameplay these factors
prevent python from being the single
used language of a highly acclaimed game
title
it is used along with other languages
like c and c plus plus to create a
unified game catering to all the needs
of the player python also finds use in
training machine learning models to be
used in video game development to create
a much more personalized gaming
experience as compared to the general
development paradigms
apart from python kotlin has become a
new language to go for as a replacement
for java based platforms
it is mostly used for developing android
games
thanks to this google's very own android
studio allows using kotlin to develop
android applications and games instead
of java
some of the reasons people are jumping
to kotlin is because of the coding
efficiency and much better memory
management
code length in kotlin is much smaller
than java for the same output
while many people are starting to prefer
coating over java for newer projects the
community and bug squashing support is
still far from the heights of java so it
is going to be a good while till you see
cortland take over the mobile
development scenario completely
now that we get an idea of how unique
each programming language is when it
comes to game development
let's take a look at one example where
you can understand how the games are
created on a very small scale i use
python for this demo and the application
being run is the classic snake game
let's jump in
i will be using the software pie chart
which is a development environment for
python
we use this environment for coding the
game functionality as well as testing it
as a prototype
before i proceed i would like to make
you aware that python needs to be
installed on the machine before start
writing code along with pie chart or
does any other software which can
compile python code
now when we jump into the code my first
step is to import the libraries being
used while developing the game
python has a huge library of extensions
that can be imported into its programs
in order to gain certain functionality
in this case i am importing three
modules namely turtle time
and random
turtle is a pre-installed python library
that enables users to create pictures
and shapes by providing them with a
virtual canvas
the on-screen pen that you use for
drawing is called the turtle and this is
what gives the library its name
in short the python turtle library helps
new programmers get a feel for what
programming with python is like in a fun
and interactive way
the time module is used to count the
number of seconds elapsed since the
epoch while the random function can be
used to generate random numbers in
python
we use a set of predetermined variables
to be used along with the program
in our first segment we create a window
screen this is done by using the turtle
module this helps in giving a background
to the game on which we can turn up our
controls and other graphical
enhancements
in the second part we create the head of
the snake
this will be our control for the entire
game and it will change the direction on
which direction we want to go
the next part we design the food of the
game all of this can be done using the
turtle module and in some parts the
random module as well which helps to
determine where the food will be
appearing on the screen
the next part is assigning control
variables
in the assigning control variables part
we need to assign local variables and
global variables to be used when we
provide input while playing the game
all of these can be used using the
turtle module and here we can assign the
keys that are being used to assign the
controls we have given the w s a d
commands to go for the top bottom left
and right commands respectively
after the commands are set we need to
focus on the main gameplay of the portal
the main gameplay will handle the score
management the way the size of the snake
increases after eating the food and the
way the game ends when the snake hits a
barrier or body itself
all this can be done in the final part
which leads to the final output of the
game
let's take a look at the result
as you can see we have initiated a
proper full working python game using a
single page of code
this can be controlled using the wsd key
as we mentioned which are customizable
and can be done in any format possible
it has the backgrounds it has colors
which can be changed and we also have a
high score mechanism that gets updated
if we lose or continue playing
apart from the visuals we have also have
sound libraries imported into the game
to make it more life like albeit in a
snake game that makes a less of an
addition
so this is how we can use python to get
started on generic game development
using just turtle and a few other
modular functions
hope you learned something interesting
