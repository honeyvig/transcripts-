that open AI is really good at making
smart stuff if we talk about model
evaluation as measured on traditional
benchmarks GPT 40 achieves gp4 turbo
level performance on the text reasoning
and coding intelligence while setting
new H marks on multilingual audio and
vision capabilities so now let's move
forward to the demo part and now let's
explore the features of chgb 4 so as you
can see my phone screen is there so this

something about
gp40 gp4 is a language model developed
by open AI it's designed to understand
and generate humanlike text based on the
input it receives GPT 4 is an
improvement over previous versions with
better accuracy understanding and
generation capabilities it can be used
for a wide range of application so CH
can you please tell me how to become
machine learning
engineer sure becoming a machine
learning engineer involves several steps
one education start with a strong
foundation in mathematics especially in
areas like statistics linear algebra and
calculus a degree in computer science
data
science so this is how you can ask CH
GPD anything right so let's ask
something related to IQ let's check the
IQ so can you please tell me which is
the most spoken language in the
world the most spoken language in the
world by number of native speakers is
Mandarin Chinese it has over a billion
native speakers however when considering
the total number of speakers including
those who speak it as a second language
English often ranks at the
top okay so CH can you please tell me
like I want to create YouTube video on
what is machine learning so can you
please help me with the content
plan sure here's a simple content plan
for your YouTube video on what is
machine learning one introduction one to
two minutes greet your audience briefly
introduce yourself and your channel
State the topic of the video what is
machine learning two what is machine
learning two three minutes Define
machine learning in simple terms okay
see this is how you can ask LGBT
anything and the all the file all the
data will come here okay see I asked
this okay SOB can you please tell me
this then the answer is there so now
let's check the another feature which is

okay so these are some basic features of
chb foro maybe in future it will launch
more and more new features right you can

sort of a screenshot you can ask for the
code you can do anything right you can
upload your image any sort of image and
you can ask jgb to describe it or to
make one story so now let's move forward
and see some safety and limitation of
chgb 4 so now let's talk about safety
and limitation of GPT 4 gp40 prioritize
safety by Design across different sites
of data and by refining Its Behavior
after training they have also developed
new safety measures to control voice
outputs they also had outside experts
review gb4 to identify and address risk
especially in new areas like audio they
will keep improving safety as we learn
more while text and image inputs and
outputs are available now they are still
working on making other features like
audio safety and user friendly so if you
