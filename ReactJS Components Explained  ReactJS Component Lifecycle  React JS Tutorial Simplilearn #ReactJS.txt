hey everyone and Welcome to our YouTube
channel today we are diving into the
fascinating world of react components if
you're new to react or just looking to
deepen your understanding you're in the
right place in this video we will
explore the fundamental concept of what
component is in react we'll break down
its role and significance within the
react ecosystem and we will walk you
through the process of writing a
component step by step but don't don't
worry if you're completely new to react
we will start from the basics we will
guide you through writing your first
react component and help you understand
it through Hands-On examples by the end
of this video you will have a clear
grasp of how components work and how
they contribute to building Dynamic and
interactive user interfaces but before
that if you are beginner or looking to
refresh your knowledge grab your coding
setup and let's Dive Right In just a
quick info for you if you're
professional who wants to switch careers
with software engineer by learning from
the experts then try giving a shot to
Simply learns postgraduate program in
fullstack web development accelerate
your career as a software developer
through this postgraduate program in
fullstack web development course in
collaboration with keltech ctme in just
a few months you will learn modern
coding techniques with boot camp level
intensity and gain all you need to be
fullstack technologist the link in the
description box should navigate to the
homepage where you can find a complete
overview of the program being offered
all right now let's start with the first
topic which is what is a component so
let's imagine you're making a digital
puzzle each puzzle piece has a specific
rule but it's when you put them all
together you see the whole picture in
the world of react these puzzle pieces
are called components now imagine a
button a form or a header on a web page
each of these is a component these
components are like reusable templates
kind of having a set of puzzle pieces
that you can use to create different
pictures you can take these components
and place them throughout the website to
construct the complete user experience
so in simple terms react components are
the individual parts then when combined
make up the entire website they make it
easier to create and manage different
pieces of a web page just like putting
together a puzzle to reveal the big
picture of your website it all right now
what role does it play in react like
what role does it component play in
react so as your projects gets bigger
you can reuse the components you have
already made to create new designs it's
like using familiar pieces to build
things making development faster
components help organize your code and
make it easy to manage as your project
grows just like using the same set of
Lego blocks to build various structures
this simplify the process of creating an
maintaining different parts of your
website making it more efficient and
saving your time so this was about the
role that component play in react now
let's understand how to write a
component and for that we'll have to
move to vs code so we'll do a practical
demo all right so this is our vs studio
so here we will be writing a simple code
so that code will have a heading and
unordered list so we'll start first of
all we'll write return
all right inside return we'll write the
code H
one and we'll write best
places to
visit okay now below
this unordered list and write
list
first of all we'll
write USA then we'll simply copy this
instead of writing again and again we'll
just copy paste
it all right so
USA Canada let's
say
Singapore
Australia
South Africa these are the just random
countries M writing and let's say
Mexico all
right so this is the unordered list and
this is the heading all right so now we
don't want to write the complete code
over here so instead of this as we can
see heading is very less code and this
unorder list is very less code but in
actual problems this these type of codes
are very number of lines in terms of
number of lines these are very large so
in order to make it small we'll create
components so instead of writing the
complete code in app.js we'll create a
component to make you understand now we
are going to make things simpler by
creating a special part of the code
called a react component instead of
writing all the code in one place app.js
we'll break it into simpler pieces so
instead of typing everything over here
that is in app.js we'll just use the
component name to include its code it's
like organizing our code in more
straightforward way so we'll simply use
its name but for that we'll have to
create a component so let's go to
source and we'll go to new file so first
we'll want to create a component for
heading so heading is best places to
visit so we don't want to write it over
here we just want to uh write the name
of the component over here so that it
looks concised all right so we'll write
heading make sure the name of the
component start with a capital letter
that is as we can see heading H is
capital then GSX heading. jsx so this is
the component now here we will include
first of all we'll write input react
from
react
UT all right
WR
input react from
react all right now the function here's
the function inside the
function all right so inside the
function there is a return statement and
what return statement is
saying that we are simply going to
include this instead of writing it again
we just copy paste it just took it from
here and we'll just include it over here
so this this is the heading best places
to visit now in order to export I mean
in order to use it over here we need to
export it and the app.js needs to import
it so we use basically we use Import and
Export in components to share the ReUse
code easily so this is the ReUse code
when we export a component it's like
packaging it for use elsewhere then when
we import that is we will import over
here when we import that component in
another file that is app.js we are
basically saying Hey I want to use that
code here it helps keep things organized
and allows us to use the same component
in different parts of our app without
repeating the code so what we'll do is
first of all we'll export it from here
so for that we'll
write export default and the name of the
component first of all we haven't
mentioned the name over
here heading
the name of the component is heading all
right so we're going to save it and now
we can write over
here name of the component heading
space forward slash so this is the
syntax angular brackets name of the
function or the name of the component
space forward slash closing of angular
bracket so this is how you can do it and
now we will import it import
heading
from do
slash heading now if you want to include
jsx you can otherwise it is not
mandatory all right now in order to use
it firstly we're going
to use
div so as the multiple lines are there
as we can see so we have to use either
the fragmentation or a div all right so
yeah we did it so we have included it
and I believe it will work fine let's
have a look at it as you can see best
places to visit USA Canada Singapore
Australia South Africa Mexico so it is
working fine now we don't want this list
also over here we want to use it as we
did similar to this we we are going to
do this for list also so we don't want
it here we'll create a component for
this and simply we'll include the
component name and forward slash so this
is the syntax basically so we'll name a
component name list in which we'll put
the code and then we'll include or
import this code over here so let's do
that like the previously we did
similarly we'll go to Source new file
and list. jsx let's name it list
now import react from react
Now function the name of the function is
list the name of the function is list
and
now
return all right so we'll go in app.js
we just copy this one cut it and
simply paste it so again here we can use
div all right we'll save it now here
also as you can see first of all is a
typo yeah now as you can see here also
we'll have to export it otherwise the
code will not work it will not display
so we'll write export
default list all right so we have
exported this so once once you have
exported any file can take it so app.js
will take it so we'll write
import
list
from so dot slash
list all right so now instead of writing
the complete code we'll simply write
we'll I repeat we'll simply
write list space
forward
slash all right now let's try to run it
let's see if it is working or not so as
you can see it is working fine best
places to visit and all the places are
are there and let's see if we go back
just copy paste this
list so we we have pasted it multiple
times so now if will go over here and
check so we don't have to write the code
again and again we'll simply copy paste
the component and that part of code will
be copy pasted in different places as we
want so this is the beauty of react this
is how we can do it that's why react is
preferred because of its
reusability and so we have created two
components heading and list so let's
just go and create one more components
let's say in which we will use a image
so let's name it like picture or
something like that so we'll go to SRC
new file and we'll name it picture.
jsx
right
all right so now here we will include an
image so in this
component first of all we'll write
Dev so now inside div
we will use a image tag self closing
one now inside it first of all there
will be SRC that is the
source so we have this
picture
just paste it over
here all right now we can name it
also all right now
now if you want to do CSS
then this is how we can do it in react
the
GSX let's say the width
is 200
pixels and we have to enclose it in the
double
codes right
height 200 pixels all right so I think
this would be enough now let's save it
and Export it
also export
default
picture all
right let's save it so now we'll have to
import it over here write
import picture
from
slash
picture now we're going
to Simply include the component so again
the syntax of the component is the name
of the
component forward slash and the closing
of angle brackets this is it so there is
an error it is showing picture is not
defined over here we can see typo is
there now we'll save now let's have a
look so this is it so best places to
visit is a heading this is a list and
this is a picture so none of them is
here we are just included their
components and if will copy
this you can see multiple images will be
there so this is the reusability feature
you don't have to write the same code
again and again in react also one more
thing so in this picture image as we can
see in this picture component the
component list returns an IMG tag with
SRC and ALT attributes IMG is written
like HTML but it is actually JavaScript
in every component it is like that it is
looking like HTML but is it is actually
JavaScript under the hood this syntax is
called GSX and it lets you embed markup
inside the JavaScript and also the
return statements so return statements
can be written all on one line also but
if your markup isn't all on the same
line as you can see if your markup is
not on on all on the same line then you
must wrap it in a pair of parenthesis as
we have
done all right so this was about this
now I have one exercise for you in which
you'll have to look at the code and tell
us what is wrong with the code all right
so let's go there so this is the code
you'll have to look at this code and
tell us what is wrong with this code you
can pause this video and figure out what
is wrong in this code based on the
things we have taught
you all right so as we can see now we're
going to figure out what is wrong with
this code first of all the thing is this
is the component and this is the name of
the component so this is the basically
the definition of the component now as
you can see we know that the starting
letter that is the first letter should
be Capital so instead of T small T we'll
put capital T copy this in all of
these and over here also if it is not
Capital it will not work all right so we
have done this so now let's try to run
this as we can see it is not running it
is showing a error so what is that error
we'll have to figure out so as you can
see they are saying 12 in line 12 it is
showing now the thing is over here we
haven't EXP orted it this is the second
fault so we'll write
export
default
gallery all right now let's try to run
it so as you can see it is done and
Local Host 3002
right so as you can see key points of
react elements first of all let's remove
these two all right so now let's save it
all right so key points for react
components so these three key points
you'll have to remember react component
names always begin with a capital letter
in react every piece of user interface
is a component react components return
jsx markup so as we have already told
you about the markup so this is about it
also as we did we can copy paste it
again and again to make it
more all right so in conclusion react
components are like building blocks for
web apps with react components you can
keep your code tidy and make changes
easily it's like having set of tools
where each one does a specific task by
organizing your code this way you can
make your app more flexible and easier
to understand so think of react
component as the handy tools that make
web development a breeze all right guys
with that we have come to the end of
