hello and welcome everyone today we are
going to discuss cues in data structures
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our youtube channel and hit
the bell icon so you never miss an
update from simply learn primarily let's
have a look at our plan for this session
today we will start this session with an
introduction to the queue
later we will discuss the structure of
the queue in detail
after that we will deal with different
operations that can be performed on
queues
advancing further we will understand
various types of queues and their
structures
and finally we will discuss different
applications of queues to understand how
queues are used to manipulate data on
that note without further delay let's
get started with introduction to queue
you know that all of us depend on
messaging applications like whatsapp
facebook messenger instagram chats to
communicate with our friends and family
members and while using them you must
have observed that the person you are
trying to communicate with receives
messages in the same order as you have
sent them now the question that arises
here is how is this happening how are
these applications maintaining the order
of these text messages
and the solution to these questions
bring us to queue
basically in these applications a queue
is maintained for each user containing
the messages to be delivered to the user
when the user connects to the network
all the text messages in the queue gets
delivered and once the messages are
delivered empty queues get deleted
this example clearly illustrates the
importance of data structures so let's
dive further and understand the
structure of the queue in depth
but before doing that let's look at a
real-life example of cues to understand
it more clearly
the most common and relevant example of
a queue is a movie ticket counter
in the movie ticket counter you must
have observed that both of its ends
remain open also these ends are fixed
with the help of barricades and that is
why no one can enter in between these
ticket lines
additionally the person who enters first
receives a ticket first and the person
who enters last will obviously get
served at last
cues and data structure resembles all
these properties of a movie ticket
counter which makes them better at
creating virtual first come first serve
systems
basically they are defined as a linear
collection of different data types that
allow insertion at one end and deletion
at another
unlike any other data structure the
queue ends remain open allowing it to
have different functionalities at both
ends the end at which insertion takes
place is called rare
and the end at which deletion takes
place is known as front
furthermore there are two approaches to
consider the structure of the queue and
both of them depend on the approach of
the programmer
that means being a programmer if you
consider the left hand as front then
your rear node will be at right end
otherwise if you consider the left hand
as rare then the right end will be your
queue's front node
unlike arrays and linked lists elements
in the queue cannot be operated from
their respective locations here they can
only be operated from the front or rare
position
moving on let's discuss the operations
in queue data structures one by one
the first operation is enqueue it is
used to store the elements in the queue
next up is dq this operation is used for
removing them
further we have is full and is null
operations is full function scrutinizes
if the queue is full or not and the is
null operation evaluates if the queue is
empty
we also have a peak operation that helps
you get the element from the front of
the queue without removing it
let's now understand how these
operations work with the help of the
following examples
here we will look at nq5 and q1 and q
minus 2 then is full
then dq
peak
and is null
but before explaining these operations
it's essential that we initialize the
queue data structure by assigning some
random size to it
for example int queue of three by this
declaration we are assigning only three
spaces for insertion and q
also at this phase there is no element
in the queue as it's empty so both the
front node and rear node will point to
the same location with null memory space
in the storage system let's consider
that null index to be -1 for ease of our
convention
now the first operation on our list is
nq of 5.
as we discussed previously enqueue
operation is nothing but the insertion
of data into a queue data structure
it begins with checking if the queue is
full or not
if the queue is full then the previously
assigned memory is completely filled
with data elements
so insertion would not be possible this
is also known as overflow error in terms
of programming
but as our queue is empty so the
insertion can be performed here for that
we have to increment the rare pointer to
index 0 from index minus -1
and once we do that the data element phi
will be added to the queue also for
front insertion both front and rear will
point to the same location as there is
only one element present in this queue
let's insert two more elements into this
queue with the operations enqueue 1 and
then q minus 2.
for that we have to increment the rare
pointer to the next index which will be
1.
now as the point is incremented so the
data will be entered into this position
next up is nq minus 2. again we have to
follow the same process of incrementing
the rare pointer we will increment the
rare pointer to point towards the next
index that is index 2 and hence the data
element with value -2 will be entered
here
the next operation on our list is is
full
in this operation if the rare pointer
points to the max size then the queue is
considered to be full as there is no
space left for insertion in our case the
max size of rq is 12 bytes
additionally we are considering to enter
only three integer elements
and one integer data element takes four
bytes of the memory space that means
three integer elements will take 12
bytes hence this function will prompt q
is full on the screen
now we will discuss the dq operation if
we want to access data from a queue we
have to perform two sub tasks the first
one is access the data where the front
is pointing and another is to remove the
data after access and this complete
process is called as dq operation
the first step of this operation is to
check if the queue is empty
if the queue is empty then there is no
element available for deletion this is a
case of underflow error
but as our queue is not empty we can
proceed with the next steps we will be
accessing data from the front node and
later we will be incrementing the front
pointer in order to remove the link to
the previous node so that the data gets
removed now front will point to the
index 1.
thus the data value 5 will be removed
from the queue and will also be prompted
on the screen
therefore this function comes with an
integer return type
next up is peak operation
in this operation element at the front
node will be accessed without deleting
it
the algorithm for this operation begins
with checking if the queue is empty or
not
if the queue is not empty then data at
the front node will be accessed with
temporary variable and printed on the
screen
advancing further let's perform two more
dequeue operations here first is dq of
one and another one is dq of minus two
the data at a front node will be
accessed primarily and the front pointer
will be incremented to point to the next
data element
when we do the point incrementation the
link to the previous node gets remote
which results in data deletion
similarly we will perform a dq of 2
operation here now the front will be
pointed to null memory space as there is
no element left in rq and the data -2
will be removed
the last operation on our list is is
empty
this function checks if the queue is
empty or not in the previous procedure
we mentioned that if the front points to
the null memory space then the queue is
empty and in our case the front is
already pointing to -1
so the output of this function will be q
is empty
this is all about operations in the
queue i hope that you all are clear with
these operations
next we will discuss different types of
queues and their structures at a glance
basically there are four types of queues
linear queue
circular queue priority queue and double
ended queue
the structure which we have discussed
till this time is that of a linear queue
so now we will move on to circular queue
the circular queue is almost similar to
the linear queue except that the last
node of this queue is connected to the
first
it is also known as ring buffer as all
the ends are connected to another end
additionally this circular queue is a
better version of the linear queue as it
removes the drawback of insertion in the
linear queue
the empty space available in a circular
queue can be filled with the new element
by simply incrementing the value of the
rare position we will learn about this
in detail in our further sessions
a priority queue is another special type
of queue data structure in which each
element has some priority assigned with
it
based on the priority of each element
the elements are arranged in a priority
queue if the elements occur with the
same priority then they are served
according to the first in first out
principle
in the priority queue the insertion
occurs based on the arrival while the
deletion occurs based on the priority
the above figure shows that the highest
priority element comes first and the
elements of the same priority are
arranged based on the first in first out
structure
the last type of queue is dq
dq is a linear data structure in which
the insertion and deletion operations
are performed from both the ends we can
say that dq is a generalized version of
the queue
dq can be used as stack as well as q as
it allows the insertion and deletion
operations on both the ends
if the insertion takes place at one end
and deletion at another then that eq is
known as a linear queue
and if both addition and deletion are
performed at a single end then that dq
is called stack
advancing further let's discuss some
applications of queues to gauge an
insight into the importance of queues
the queue data structure is used in
computers printers and applications to
utilize the benefits of the first come
first serve technique
in computers whenever you work on
documents or ppt you must have observed
that whichever key you press on the
keyboard appears in the exact same order
on the screen
but when your processor is too busy with
other tasks you might notice that the
keys you press appear on the screen with
some delay after you press them
basically those keys are stored in queue
and when the processor becomes free it
processes in the order the keys are
pressed
that means the key pressed first will be
written in a word document first
so this is how computers use a queue to
eliminate deadlocks when multiple
processes are in a ready state
next up is printers
a queue data structure is used in
printers to maintain the order of pages
while printing that means the pages are
stored in a queue in the order that you
want to print them and once the page is
removed from an ordered queue it gets
printed
another most common application of queue
data structure is their usage in web or
mobile apps
applications like domino swiggy uses a
cue for maintaining food order status if
you place an order from an online portal
your order id enters the queue and once
the previous orders before your order id
gets scattered then your order will be
catered as well
from these examples we can clearly say
that queues are used whenever there is a
need for an fcfs strategy in software
development so whenever you work on
projects that need a first come first
serve approach then remember that you
have to implement a queue data structure
to complete it successfully
finally let's have a look at some key
takeaways that we discussed in this
session
we started this session by examining the
structure of the queue
we learned that the queue is a linear
data structure
after that we talked about different
operations of queues in which we learned
nq and dq are responsible for data
manipulation in a queue
later we discussed different types of
queues as well
finally we discovered some applications
of queues and how they fulfill the need
of fcfs systems
we have also made it clear that queues
can handle multiple data types as well
so with this we come to the end of this
