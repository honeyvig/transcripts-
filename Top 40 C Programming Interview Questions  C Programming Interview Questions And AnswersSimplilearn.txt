C programming interview questions are a
major part of every interview procedure
this video has covered all the basic
interview questions and that every
candidate is asked to check his or her
knowledge in the programming skills they
have become essential to crack by every
interview and the current ID industry
so please stick till the end of this
video while we give away answers to that
one importancy programming questions
that is the most frequently Asked in
every interview
hey guys welcome to Simply learn today
we will learn the top 40 C programming
interview questions and answers
before we start let us test your
existing knowledge of C to use
operations like mlog and clo which
header files should be include the
options are
stdio.h
stdlib.h cornea.h or string.h do leave
your answers in the comment section
below and while we are at it please
leave us a like if you find our content
helpful and a sub to the channel would
be appreciated
before we begin with this this video is
categorized into beginner level
intermediate level and advanced level
questions so without further delay let's
get started
the first question is what are the
features of the C programming language
C is a simple and portable it is a midi
level language it has a features of
modularity sales rich in library it is a
procedural language easy to extend and
it consists of built-in operations it
also provides memory management
the next question is mention different
data types in C
data types are classified into basic
derived and user-defined data types
basic data types are int care float and
double direct data types include array
and pointers and user-defined data types
are inum structure and unions
what is the use of static functions
functions declared with the keyword
static are the static functions they
have the scope restricted only to the
functions in which they are declared
the next question is mention the dynamic
memory allocation functions
dynamic memory allocation functions are
analog see a log realloc and free
when we use the analog function The
Continuous block of memory will be
allocated and the pointer variable will
hold the address of the first element
clf function is similar to analog
function but in the case of clog
function multiple blocks of memory of
the same size will be allocated which
holds zero value by default and it takes
two arguments that is number element and
element size
we use real lock function to change the
array size without losing the data in
short the real up functions will change
the size of the previously allocated
memory block the free function is used
to deallocate the memory space occupied
by the previously allocated by mlog see
a log realloc functions in order to use
the memory more efficiently and to
return back the memory to the Heap once
done we use free function what is the
difference between local variable and
Global variable
variables declared inside the functions
with the keyword local or called local
variables the local variable scope is
inside the functions in which it is
declared variables declared outside the
functions with the keyword Global are
called Global variables and they can be
accessed by multiple functions defined
in the program
moving ahead to the next question
what is the use of pointer variables in
C programming and what do you mean by
dangling pointer variable
a pointer is a variable that holds the
address of another variable to be
executed which can be of data type int
care array Etc
pointers are used to access the memory
location easily and it reduces the
storage space and increase the speed of
the program's execution when a pointer
pointing to another variable is deleted
and a pointer is still pointing at the
same memory location then the pointer is
known as a dangling pointer
the next question is what is nested
structure nested structures are the
structures where data members of One
structures is referred by the data
members of another function next what is
the use of break control statements
break is used to terminate the loop so
whenever the control encounters the
break statement it will stop the loop
iteration and transfer the control to
the next statement soon after the loop
generally break statements are used in
the loop and switch control statements
and the next question is what are C
tokens
tokens are the smallest individual
elements in the program which include
keywords identifiers constants special
symbols strings and operations
what is predefined functions in C
predefined functions are the built-in
functions it helps user to use already
existing code in the program what is the
use of printf and scanf function printf
and scanf are inbuilt Library functions
defined in the standard input output
header file scanf is used to read the
input from the user and printf is used
to print the output on console
the next question is what is the use of
header files in C
header file contain the predefined
library functions programs can make use
of standard Library functions by
defining hash include in the program it
reduces the number of code and
complexity of the program
what is an array mention its different
types an array is a homogeneous
collection of elements of the same data
type that means similar types of
elements are stored under one name
called an arena and also the array of
elements stored in consecutive block of
memory types of array includes one
dimensional array two-dimensional array
and multi-dimensional array next what is
the use of const keyword
using a const keyword the value of a
variable is constant throughout the
program runtime constant values are
unchangeable syntax include const
variable name equal to value and
semicolon at the end
what is a memory leak
when the memory is allocated dynamically
and not deallocated even when the memory
is no longer required that leads to a
memory leak now that your basic level
questions are completed let us go
through a few intermediate level
questions
differentiate between call by value and
call by reference in call by value we
pass values by copying variables in call
by reference we pass the address of the
variable in call by value the memory
location for formal and actual arguments
are created separately in the case of
call by reference the formal and actual
arguments share the same memory location
any changes made in copy of variables
will not affect the value of a variable
outside the function in call by value
whereas in call by reference any changes
made in the variables will also affect
the value of the variable outside the
function moving on to the next question
what is the difference between a
compiler and an interpreter
a compiler compiles the whole code at a
time and displays all the errors whereas
The Interpreter executes the program
line by line and displays the error of
every single line
what are the entry and exit Loops in C a
loop in which the condition is checked
first and then executes the statements
is known as an entry Loop for example a
while loop is an entry Loop
a loop in which the set of statements is
executed first and then checks the given
condition is known as an exit Loop for
the example do while loop is an exit
Loop and the next question is what is
typecasting
typecasting is a process of converting
one data type to another data type the
conversion that is done automatically is
known as implicit conversion
next
mention four types of storage classes in
C
four types of storage classes in CR
automatic register static and external
next what is the use of the size of
operator in C the size of operator is
applied to the data types such as int
care float Etc to determine the exact
size of a variable in bytes
what are the string handling functions
in C string handling functions are Str
Len strc80
strcpy and Str CMP Str Len is used to
find the string length it will count the
number of characters in a string and
prints the output
then strc80 is used to concat two
strings which means adding up two
strings SDS cpy is to copy a string to
another
strcmp is to compare two strings
and the next question is write a c
program to print the following pattern
so now let's understand the working of
the code so in this pattern program we
have two for loops
so
where the order follow-up indicates the
number of rows and the inner for Loop
will indicate the number of columns so
here it first checks the auto follow
condition and if the condition is
satisfied the country will go to the
inner follow and print the value that is
it prints the J value
and once the condition is false the
control will transfer back to the auto
follow and increment I by 1.
and this process will repeat until all
the number patterns are printed
successfully so now let's execute it
so as you can see the number here this
is the pattern where we are executing
with the help of two for Loops that is
for I is equal to 1 I lesser is equal to
n so n value is 5 and then I plus plus
then coming to the inner for Loop J is
equal to 1 J lesser or equal to I and J
plus plus
so now moving on to the next pattern
question we have Implement a program to
print parameter star pattern so in this
parameter star pattern program we have
declared variables i j and rows is equal
to 5. so the number of rows that we are
going to print is 5. so for I is equal
to 0 to I less than 5 it's going to
print the rows and
this for Loop will print the blank
spaces
so from J is equal to rows minus i j
greater to i j j minus minus so this for
Loop is used to print the spaces in
between the parameter star pattern and
coming to this for Loop here J is equal
to 0 J lesser or equal to i j plus plus
it will print this star
so let's run it
okay let's run it
so as you can see the start pattern is
formed
and the next question is write a c code
to swap two numbers without using third
variable
so here we have the variables first and
second so first is initialize to Value 1
and second is initialized to Value 2. so
print before swapping the values of
first and second and it will print the
values of first and second initially
essentially the values of first and
second is one and two then coming to
this statements
so here first is equal to First plus
second so suppose let's consider
first is equal to so the first value is
1 so 1 plus
2 is equal to 3.
okay so now the first value is holding
the first variable is holding the value
3 then coming to the second
here second is equal to now the value of
first is three so three
3 and minus the value of second is still
2.
so let's give 2
so which is 3 minus 2 is 1 so now this
variable second is holding new value
that is 1.
then
first is equal to
first minus second so now what's the
value of first the new value is 3 so 3
minus and what's the value of second
that is 1.
so 3 minus 1 is 2.
so now as you can see initially the
first was equal to one that is before
swapping the value of where first is
equal to 1 and second is equal to 2. now
after swapping the value of first is
equal to 2 and second is equal to 1. so
that's what's Happening Here
so let's remove this
hope it's clear
so now let's run it
so as you can see the screen before
swapping the value of first is equal to
1 second is equal to 2. so after
swapping the value I have exchanged so
first is equal to 2 and then second is
equal to 1.
moving on to the advanced level
questions first what is a union union is
a special data type that holds the
element of different data types at the
same memory location the concept of
structure and unions are the same
however the only difference is in terms
of storage space and the keyword in
Union memory is allocated once the
variable is created and the union
variables are created to access and
assign values of the union members in C
the next question is what are
enumeration
enum is a user-defined data types
consisting of an integral constant in
short and enum is a keyword that allows
a user-defined data types consisting set
of integral constants the syntax of
enumeration is inum inum name and list
of constants separated with the help of
comma operator and the next question is
what is a recursion recursion is a
process of making a function call itself
in short the user call function inside
the same function
the next question is what are
microcensee macro in C is defined by the
hash Define directive a macro is a name
given to a piece of code so whenever the
compiler encounters a macro in a c
program it will replace it with a macro
value in the micro definition the macro
are not terminated by the semicolon
syntax of a micro has defined macronium
followed by macro value example hash
defined by 3.14 and semicolon at the end
what are file operations in C
creating a file writing a file reading a
file seek operation within a file and
truncating a file
and at last deleting a file
what are the difference between macros
and functions macros are pre-processed
but functions are compiled using macros
execution speed is faster and in the
case of functions this feed of execution
is lower the macro name is replaced by
the macro value before compilation
whereas in function transfer of control
take place during the function call
using macros the length of the code
increase the code length is unlefted
using the function
the next question is sort an array using
a quick sort algorithm
as you can see the screen we have a
quick sort algorithm function declared
where we have array
of size 25 left and right variables so
coming to the main function we have I
count and array so
using printer function it will print
into the number of elements so it will
take the number of elements that means
suppose you want to sort 5 elements so
it will take that number and then it
will take elements one by one using this
for Loop then it will call the quick
sort algorithm so when then this quick
sort algorithm the control will transfer
to this function and we have array of
size 25 left and right
so here we have two variable stick that
is i j pivot and temp variables so if
left hand side element is less than
right hand side element then left hand
side element is assigned to Pivot and
then left is assigned to I and right
element is assigned to J
so while I lesser than J so why it
checks the condition array of I lesser
or equal to array of pivot and I is less
than right then increment I by 1. while
array of J greater than array of pivot
then it will determine J by 1. so if I
is less than J
here we are using temp variable
to swag that means to
shift the elements so whatever is there
in Array of I is given to Temp variable
whatever is then there in Array of J is
given to array of I and whatever is
there in the temp variable is assigned
to array of J then now temp is not
holding any value so array of piot
is given to Temp variable
and
array of J is assigned to array of
private and temp is assigned to array of
T then two times you are calling the
quicksort algorithm first time to saw
the elements at the left hand side and
then to sort the elements at the right
hand side
and coming to this main function then it
will print all the sorted elements
so let's run it
so as you can say enter the number of
elements so let's enter 5
and let's enter some random numbers
okay so the numbers that we entered was
1 4 32 5 and 5. so sorted elements are 1
4 5 5 and 32 so it has sort all the
elements successfully using quick sort
algorithm
and the next question is Implement a
program to print the factorial of a
given number using recursive method so
as you can see here we have a main
function in which we have declared the
variable n and then enter a positive
integer so it will take the N value
then it will print factorial of a given
number and then call the fact function
so the control will transfer to this
function where we have fact of in n so
if n is greater or equal to 1 only then
it will perform a factorial method so
suppose here we are giving a positive
integer that n to B 3 okay suppose we
are given 3 so n that is 3 into
fact of
n minus 1 that is 2 3 minus 1 is 2. so
again we are calling
fact here fact function
so what this basically do is
3 into 2 it will perform
three into two so three twos and six so
it will print
6.
factorial of 3 is 6 so let's check it
so enter positive integer let's enter 3
and the value is 6. so similarly if
suppose the number is 5 5 into
fact of 5 minus 1 that is 4. so
what it does is
it will take 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into
1. so it will count all this and bring
the value so let's check what's the
factorial of 5
so let's enter 5 and see the factorial
of number 5 is 120.
I hope it's clear
and the next question is write a c code
to find the Fibonacci series
so inside the main function we have
declared the variables N1 into N3 I and
now so initially the invent value is 0
into value is equal to 1. so first it
will print enter the number of terms so
the number of terms that you need to
fight Fibonacci
so
once you enter it will take the num and
it will print the initial value of N1
and N2 that is it will print N1 is equal
to 0 and into is equal to 1. then coming
to this for Loop
I is equal to 2 essentially I is equal
to 2 and then I lesser lesser to num
so it will check whether 2 is less than
num so if it is true then it will come
and execute the statements
so N3 is equal to N1 plus N2 so suppose
now we have the value of N1 and into so
N3 is equal to
N1 is 0.
Plus
into is 1. so now the value of N3 is 1
1. okay so that will print as a N3 then
here it will again we are going to
change so now we are assigning N2 value
to N1 so what is into value
that is 1 is given to
N1 is equal to 1 then
assigning entry value to N2
what is N3 value now that is 1 that is
given to N2 now N2 is also holding 1.
so now once once it print this value
again it will go to the for Loop and
increment I by 1. so once this is the
increase that means once it increment by
1 that means now the I value will be 3
so again it will check whether 3 is less
than num so again this will continue the
process till the I value is less than
num
so let's execute it
so let's run the program
so enter the number of terms so let's
enter 5
and the Fibonacci series of 5 is 0 1 1 2
and 3.
and the next question is write a program
to check whether a given number is prime
number so in this
program inside the main function we have
the variables num I and flag is equal to
zero so initially flag value is equal to
0.
so as you all know that flag acts as a
Boolean variable so if the condition is
satisfied it will indicate true or false
so
then we will print enter the number to
check Prime and it will take the number
for condition I is equal to 2 till I
lesser or equal to num divided by 2.
then checks the condition if num module
I is equal equal to 0 this is the
condition that it has to meet to check
whether the number is prime or not so if
this condition satisfied then it will
print number is not Prime
and flag is equal to 1 break if flag is
equal equal to 0 then print number is
prime
so let's execute it
so enter the number to check Prime so if
I enter 3 it will say number is prime
so now let's give another number
which is not prime let's keep 4 and
we'll say number is not Prime
so I hope this program is clear
the next question is
how to implement a program to find the
height of a binary tree so as you can
see the screen we have
the structure of node
then we have a variable data
and nodes left child structure and right
right child structure
so we have a function called high to
find the height actual height of a
binary tree so if node is equal equal to
null that means if there are no nodes in
a tree then it will return 0 else it
will assign height
height of notes left child to L height
then assigning height of node's right
child to R height so then check the
condition if
L height is greater than R height then
return L height plus 1 else written R
height plus 1.
so to create new node we are creating a
new node called node and allocating
memory to it using analog function and
assigning a data
initially denotes left child and right
child are assigned to NAB then return
the node coming to the int main that is
coming to the main function we have
structure of node that is root
assigning value 10 to the root node and
Root's left child is assigned to 15
Roots right child is assigned to 20 and
value 25 is assigned to Roots left
child's left hand and 30 is assigned to
Roots left child's right child then
print height of a binary tree
then it will take the the control will
go back to the this function height and
then prints the value
so let's print
let's run it
so here height of a binary tree is 3.
moving on to the next question write a c
code to find the N terms or natural
number and find the sum
so basically we are finding the odd
numbers first
then we are adding up all the odd
numbers and printing the sum value
so we have the variables declared i n n
sum initially the sum value is equal to
zero so first enter the number of terms
print it will take the number of terms
suppose we want five natural numbers odd
five odd numbers then we are giving 5
there
then the odd numbers are
using this for Loop it will print all
the odd numbers so I is equal to n i
lesser or equal to n it will print using
this formula it will print all the odd
numbers that is 2 into I minus 1 and
then whatever it finds it will add up
all the odd numbers so using this
statement sum is equal to sum plus 2
into I minus 1 we will get this value of
all the odd numbers
so then if we print the sum of four
natural numbers up to n terms
so let's execute it
so enter the number of terms suppose we
need five odd numbers so odd numbers are
1 3 5 7 and 9. so then it will add up
all these odd numbers so the sum of all
natural numbers up to five terms are 25.
next Implement a c program to display a
string in reverse order so basically we
have a string where we are going to
reverse the string
so here we have declared car string 1 of
size 100 and we have a temp variable and
then length l r and I so L is for left
hand side element R is for right hand
side element
so first print enter a string to reverse
so whatever string we need to reverse
that we are going to enter
so it will take a string then string of
length
string length of str1
is assigned to l e n
so initially L is equal to 0
till R is equal to length minus 1.
so here whatever string we have suppose
we have
simple so this will be 0
here this index will be 0 and this will
be a length minus 1.
so that that's what your basically tells
then for I is equal to l to I less than
r
it will perform this statements so
whatever is that in string of 1 of I is
given to temp
then whatever is there Instinct of one
of R is given to string of 1 of I then
whatever is that in temp is assigned to
string of 105 then the increment R minus
minus then again it will go to I and
increment I by 1.
so from I is equal to l l to R it will
perform all these operations and then
reverse a string so one by one it will
put and reverse the string so let's
execute
enter a string to reverse let's enter
simply
and the reverse string is ILP Mis
I hope it's clear
the next question is Implement a program
to remove duplicates in a sorted array
so here we have a sorted array that is
10 12 30 40 and 50. and as you can see
we also have a duplicate elements that
is we have 10 2 times then we have 12
T repeated and also 15 55 duplicate
number
so here this is a sorted array so
basically we are going to delete the
duplicate elements so for that
we have a remove duplicate array
function
so if n is equal equal to 0 or n is
equal equal to 1 then written in
so if the elements are 0 or the element
is 1 just return those elements then
declaring the temp variable and this
function is used for traversal so the
control will travel all the array
elements so it will check so I J
initially J is equal to 0 so for I is
equal to 0 to I less than n minus 1
it checks whether a of I is not equal to
the next Element e of I plus 1 then it
will assign e of I to Temp J plus plus
then again assign here n minus 1 to 10 J
plus plus then modifying if there is any
repeated here if I is equal to 0 to I
less than J
temp of I is assigned to e of I and then
written J
coming to the main function here we have
the array elements as I said 10 12 30 40
and 55 and also along with the
duplicates so n is assigned to size of a
so it will give the size of array divide
by size of a of 0.
the function array duplicate remove
duplicate array is assigned to the
variable n and for I is equal to 0 to I
less than n it will print all the sorted
array elements so let's run it
as you can see
the elements were 10 10 so here it's
given one duplicate element is deleted
and here again 12
30 40 and 55 is given successfully
so the elements are deleted
and the last question is Implement a
program to add a node at the beginning
end and specified position in any linked
list
so here we have the node structure where
we have data and also the variable next
so
we have a function for insertion at
beginning
insertion at end and insertion after a
note
so first starting with insertion at
beginning we are creating a new node and
allocating memory to it using mlog
function and
we are assigning a new data to a new
nodes data part and new nodes next is
assigned to head that means head is
assigned to this because head is holding
the address of the new node now so head
is equal to Mu
avoid insertion at end so basically here
also we are creating a new node and
allocating memory to it and coming here
we have a head is assigned to last node
because we are going to insert it in so
head now head is assigned to last node
so new data we are assigning to new
nodes data part and initially the new
next is equal to none now actually
because it's a last node
the note or the next new notes next will
hold the null value so if head is equal
equal to null then head is equal to new
while last notes next is not equal to
null
then last is equal to last notes next
and last note next is equal to Mu that
means new we are assigning it to last
notes next then coming to the insertion
of third node so here we have previous
node and new data
so if the previous node is equal equal
to none that means there are no nodes in
a list the given previous node cannot be
none
then creating a new node allocating
memory to it and assigning a new data
and to the next new nodes next
we are assigning previous nodes next to
the new node next and new we are
assigning to previous notes next
coming to the display function checking
while node is not equal to null
then print all the node data part
then assign nodes next to note
so coming to the mean function here we
have head initially equal to none and
insert at n we are inserting 25 at the
end then at the beginning we are
inserting 15 again at the beginning we
are inserting 10 that means 10 15 and 25
then at the end again 30 then insertion
after note hits next 20. then you will
print the linked list elements
so let's run it
so it has print in our order
