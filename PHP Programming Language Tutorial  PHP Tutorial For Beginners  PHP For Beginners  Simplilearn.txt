hello everyone and welcome to simply
learn
in this video on php programming we are
going to discuss different php concepts
from the very basics such as syntax
hello world program up until learning
how to collect form data using php
scripts and also cover a lot more
concepts in between
so without further ado let's get started
now before moving on to programming
concepts let us first see what is php
and some of the reasons why it is useful
now php stands for hypertext
preprocessor which is a recursive
acronym but was originally known as
personal homepage
php is an open source server-side
scripting language that is embedded into
html and used for web development
now two main terms for focus here are
open source and server side scripting
now open source is a term for technology
that is freely available to everyone
while server-side scripting means that
the entire php script is processed on
the server side while the user just
enjoys the result
now let's move on and see why is php
useful
because websites developed in php
functions faster
with php you can create dynamic web
pages
php frameworks provide security
encryption
it is a cost efficient and an easy to
maintain language
and is platform independent that is php
scripts can run on any platform without
the need of any special plugins
so now that we have some understanding
of php and why it's useful let us move
on to its programming concepts
now the first thing that we need to do
is set up the environment for our php
programs
to do that we just need two softwares
one is
visual studio code
now this is where we'll be writing all
of our programs all of our php scripts
you can download the visual studio code
for windows linux and mac
and the second one and a very important
one is
sam
now zam
is a web server solutions package
generally used for creating local web
servers and databases
as you can see it is also available
available for windows linux and mac as
well
now i have already downloaded and
installed both of these servers on my
system
let us see how to make use of them
now what we need to do is to use visual
studio code
what we do is we go to c drive xampp
folder or wherever you have installed
your xampp software we go to that folder
locate htdocs and let us now create
another folder and you can name it
anything that you want to based on your
project
since we are discussing the concepts let
us
name it
concepts
now right click on it and
here as you can see it shows open with
code
when you click on it
you can see that it opens visual studio
code for you
along with the concepts folder that we
just created now this is where you will
create all your files for your project
and will be writing all your all of your
php scripts
now let's create the first php file from
here
new file
let us name it tutorial
dot php
and
see how a php
syntax looks like
so a php syntax begin with an angular
opening bracket question mark
php
and ends with a question mark and a
closing angular bracket
while
the php
script
goes in between
so this is the very basic syntax of how
php scripts are written
now let us move on and see
how to write a hello world program using
a php script
so
to print something on php
echo is used
now to use echo what you need to do is
just write the string that you want to
print in front of it
and save the program
so
hello
and
welcome to
simply learn
let us close it
and
save the file
now i am going to show you how to use
the sam software in order to run php
scripts
go
and open your xampp control panel
and from the control panel you have to
start this first service that is apache
now this is going to start a local web
server on your system
now open your browser
go to a new tab and type localhost
followed by the name of the folder that
we just created into htdocs that was
concepts
and hit enter
here you can see the file that we just
created tutorial.php
and when you click on it
you can see your first program visible
here hello and welcome to simply learn
now suppose you have a program that
needs to print this exact same string
again and again throughout the program
so
what are you going to do
type the entire echo statement
through your code
or make it simpler
now to make it simpler what we need to
do is we need to go back to our code
and discuss the concept of
variables
now to create a variable
what we need to do is we need to
use this dollar sign
followed by the name of the variable you
can name it anything you want so let us
name it
str and
type
hello
and
welcome to
simply learn
so
this is a first variable now this
variable str stores this string value
also you can create different variables
for different purposes such as if you
want to store a number suppose so
you can store number five
and
suppose you want to store a floating
variable
and that would be float
and a floating variable is a number of
decimal points so 7.6
so now we have three variables in a
program
now one thing to notice if you're coming
from a different programming language is
that you don't need to
define the type of variable in php that
is if it is a string number or a
floating variable
now to print this
we can use echo but when you want to
print a variable in echo you need to do
things a little differently so
let us start with h1 heading
now to print a variable what you need to
do is you need to use
dot
followed by the name of the variable
that would be
str
and another dot
followed by if you want to type
something
along with the variable
i'm going to copy this code
and paste it
now
let us change the size of the headings
and also change a variable so in the
second line we are going to print num
and in the third
the float that we created
so now we have all of our
variables into our echo
now let us save this program and see
what it does
so as you can see
the variables are printed on your
program and you don't have to write them
again and again you can simply write
name of the variable along with echo and
dot and print it along
now that we know about variables
suppose you want to print the names of
different laptop brands available in the
market
now what you're going to do
do you create different variables for
each name that is a variable for hp a
variable for lenovo variable for a
source
or do you want a single variable to
store store all of the names of the
laptop brands available
now with arrays it is possible to store
different information
of the same data type that is
integer string
under a
single
variable
the condition is all of the
data that is stored under the variable
should have the same data type
now
let us see how array works
now
array
stores multiple values in a single
variable as we already discussed
now to make an error
first what we need to do is
name a variable
laptop
brand
and
type in
array function
and under that function
we are going to write the names of
different laptop brands that is hp
with separated by commas
lenovo
asus
and
dell
so
suppose these are the four laptop brands
that are available in the market in your
area
now
what you need to do is you need to print
what is
in this particular
variable that is laptop brand
so
to print it
you need to first create
variable dump now what variable dump
does is
it as you can see here
it
exports the variable that is in its
function
now
we are going to
[Music]
write the variable that we just created
into the variable dump function and it
will just return the data type and value
now suppose you want to print it so to
print it what we need to do is just add
echo in front of it
okay now before moving on to seeing the
result of this program let us just
make this part of the code
inactive
now to do that
we are going to learn a new concept in
between that is comments
so comments are the lines in a code that
are not
executed while
the program is run
so
a single line comment starts with do
slash and anything written in front of
it is does not run along with the code
so
these comments are very useful when
you're writing a
code
to make your code readable and more
understandable by any coder who will
or might later on using the code that
you've just created now suppose what we
can do with
comments is
i'm going to write a comment just in
front of it
this is a
string
variable
now
after these
slashes
anything written is not executed when i
am going to run the program
also now
what do you do if you want to
make this whole part of the code not
functioning
do you add
two slashes in front of everything
or you can use a much simpler method
that is multi multi-line comments to use
multi-line comments what you're going to
do is
you slash
star
this marks the start of the multi-line
code and to end this use star and slash
again
and everything in between
does not run when you're going to run
your program
so
we will now see
how this
array works
we will just
reload this page
and as you can see
hp lenovo asus and dell are visible here
also you might notice
this array 4 shows the length of the
array
and this shows
the position where all of these strings
are inside the array that is an array
starts with the zero position not one
but zero so the first would be zero
position that is hp
and then one lenovo and subsequently
asus and dell
now suppose you just want to print the
second variable in your array what you
need to do is you need to go back to
your code
and
in front of the variable you need to
write the position that you want to
print
under square brackets that is the second
position
in array would be number one
and save the code
go back to the browser
and only the second
array is the second
variable in the array is visible
now suppose instead of a variable you
want to create a value that you don't
want to be changed throughout your
entire program
so
consonants are used for the same purpose
now consonants are very much like
variables except
that once they are defined they cannot
be changed or undefined
so
let us see how consonants work
first
we will
put this code
under a comment
and now start writing a consonant
so to define or create a consonant what
you need to do is
use the
define function
and inside the define function what you
need to do is
you need to
write the name of the consonant
and
okay first let us write the name of the
consonant
suppose
laptops
followed by
the value
of the
hp
consonant
lenovo
and asus
and that's it and you close the define
function and there you have defined your
consonant in your php script
now this cannot be changed or undefined
throughout your program
now to print it what you need to do is
type echo followed by the name of the
consonant that you just created so the
name of the consonant is laptops
save the code
go back
and hp lenovo and asus
are visible here
you can also create consonant errors
along with a normal consonant now to
create a consonant array
you just need to add a square bracket
just a second
let me close this one
separated by
commas
and now we have
the names of the laptop as an array
which
by the way cannot be changed or
undefined through your throughout your
code just like any other consonant
now suppose you want to just print the
name of the third laptop that is
available in the market
now what you need to do is you need to
write the position and the third
position in case of arrays would be
number two
save
and only asus is visible here
so this is how consonants and variables
work in php
now before moving on to the next section
let me give you another situation
now suppose
i want you to print
a number only and only if it is greater
than 7
how do you do that
now since it is a condition conditional
statements are used to perform different
actions based on different conditions
now some of the conditional statements
include in php
are if
if else
if else if else and switch and we're
going to discuss them one by one
no so the first one is if
now
let me create a variable let us name it
there
and
write the value 8.
now
the example that we just discussed
if we want to
check if
this variable is greater than 7 and only
and only then
print the variable on the screen
now to do that what we need to do is
type in
if
and in the bracket we need to type the
condition that we're going to check that
is
if
variable
greater than
7
now
use curly brackets
and inside the curly bracket
write the code that you want to execute
only and only if the condition in
of this
if is met
so we need to print this variable
so echo
where
and go and save it now go back
and reload and you can see it is printed
here
now let us go back and change the value
of the variable to
5.
and save it
go back reload
and as you can see
nothing is printed on the screen since
the condition that we just mentioned
inside if does not meet
now suppose
i tell you that
if the condition does not meet you have
to print
a string
saying that the condition does not did
not meet
how do you do that
to do it what you need to add after if
is
else
and else does not need to have a
condition since as
the english
word suggests it is else
which means the condition of if did not
meet
and inside the else we're going to write
the code
echo
the
condition
did
not
meet
save it
the condition did not meet
now time for another condition
now suppose i want i ask you to check if
a number is
divisible by 2
3 or both
how do you do that
now to do that
first
let us
create a number
six
now check if
variable
percent
two
is equal to equals to 0 now what this
shows is this
brings out the remainder and if the
remainder is 0 that means it is
divisible by 2.
and we need to add one more condition
here
and and
variable
percent 3
equals to equals to 0
and
what this does is it checks if both of
these conditions are true that is
if the number inside the variable is
divisible by both 2 and 3
we will display
divisible
by
both
now
what we need to do is we need to
check if it is divisible by 2.
so
else if
since it is else if we need to add a
condition in it too else if
variable
percent
2
equals to equals to
0
echo
there is a
bill
by
two
similarly
divisible by
three
another you can add as many else if
statements as you want
and the final else will show
okay
let us go back and save our program
since a variable is 6
it should show divisible by both
and you can see it shows exactly the
same divisible by both now let us change
the value
and see if our program works
so what we are going to do is we are
going to change the value to 4
save a program
and run it again
this by two
similarly
nine
divided by 3
and finally
13
not divided by either two or three
so this is how you can make use of if
else if and else statements
now the next conditional statement is
switch statement
now the switch statement is used to
perform different actions based on
different conditions
so let me again give you a situation so
that you understand better
so suppose
you're playing a game
which has four different levels
and
first level is easy medium hard and
extreme
so
you need to print that
now what will you do
you can also use if else if but it's a
lot of code
switch statement makes it a lot simpler
and more readable
so
what we need to do is we need to
type in switch
okay first what we need to do is first
we need to create a variable
so a variable
suppose
let us name it level
and
level is three
to create a switch statement you need to
type in switch and
enter the name of the variable that will
be passed into the switch statement to
check for the conditions
level
and it also begins with a curly bracket
and inside
the search statement what you need to do
is you need to type
case
that is
the first case would be case
one
followed by a colon
and the statement that you want to
execute that is
echo
you
are
playing
at
easy
level
and since you want
your program to stop here itself what
you need to do is you need to type in
break
similarly for rest of the levels i'll
just copy this code here
two three and four
and just make the changes
and
similar to if else statements you also
need to add
another statement that would be
default
if any of the conditions are not met in
the switch statement suppose the value
of your variable is 20 which does not
make any sense to the game
then
what you need to do is
you need to
display
a default error message and that would
be
invalid
input
and you also need to
end the switch statement
with
a curly braces
and end the
php program
all right let us save it
go to a browser
and run you are playing at hard level
i guess you must have understood the
concept let us just one more time
change the value of the variable to 20
save it
go back
invalid input
so this is how the conditional
statements in php work
next what we're going to talk about is
php loops
now suppose you want to run a block of
code or a part of code again and again
and again or in other words in loop
so php has that functionality known as
php loops
to do the same task
now there are different types of php
loops available that is while do while
and for loops which we will be
discussing
in this part of the video
now let us start with the while loop now
the while loop
loops through a block of code as long as
the condition that you have entered or
specified in the while loop
is true
so
let me just
remove it
now to write a while loop what you need
to do is
type while
followed by
the condition
and to write the condition what we need
to first do is let us create a variable
and
we'll
give it a value of 2.
now the condition
which we are going to write is this is
just an example
so if
or while
the value of variable
is
less than equals to
10.
and then we follow along with the curly
braces
and type the code that we want to run
again and again until
the value of a variable becomes 10
or till the value of a variable is less
than 10.
suppose
number
and then the variable that is
where
and that's about it
now what we need to do is we need to
increase the value of the variable else
this code this code will run for an
infinite amount of time and the system
might crash
so
to increase the variable in each
iteration what we need to do is we need
to use the plus plus operator
which will increase the value of the
variable by 1 in each iteration
now we're going to save the code
and run it number two three four five
six seven
and so on
let me just
add
break here and you can see all of the
numbers up until 10
are visible here
and after 10 the loop just stops
so let me
explain it again
so
what we are doing is we are writing
while
along with the condition until
then the code is supposed to be run
again and again
so the condition is if the value of the
variable
is less than or equals to 10 since a
value of
value of our variable is 2 the condition
is true so the code inside of this vial
is executed and the code will display
the value of the number
and the
variable
value will increase with each iteration
until it becomes greater than 10 and
then the loop will exit
now the do while loop is very very
similar to the while one the only
difference being
in case of a do while loop
a
code
this this code will execute at least
once
i'll show you how it works
so
in case of do while
we start with two
curly braces
let us use this same
example
and after the curly braces what we do is
we
write
while along with the condition
that is
equals to 10.
let me just
okay
now let me tell you what do we need low
value suppose
the value of a variable
is
11. now since the condition
does not meet
in case of the while loop it will not
even run once now suppose you want to
display the current value of the
variables whether or not if it meets a
condition at least once
so
in case of do while
it will first go into this do loop
run the code and then after the do loop
is complete this part of the code is
complete it will go on to the vile part
and check the condition
now if the condition does not meet the
loop will end here and if it meets it
will continue until the condition does
not meet the while part
so it will run at least once
now
save this
and go back to a browser
and reload this program and as you can
see number 11
is visible here
so
do while is helpful
in some cases which you'll realize as
long as
you start coding more and more
now next up is follow now for loop is
used when
we already know how many times you want
the loop to run so for loop is used when
you want to run a piece of code a
specific number of times
now let me show you how it works
now the for loop is written in three
parts here we don't need to define a
variable beforehand
the first part of the for loop is
defining the value of the variable so
variable is equals to let us
value it at one
now we want to make it
run till suppose six values
so what we need to do is
we need to
write the condition
in the second part of the for loop
a variable less than equals to 6
and in the third part will be the
incremental part so as you can notice in
while and do while we put the
incremental part inside the block of the
code here the incremental part is inside
the for function itself
variable plus plus
and then we start with the curly braces
and we write the
code similar to
i'll just
copy it from here
and now let us
just save it and print to show you
how it works
number one two three four five and six
now these loops are a very important
aspect of programming and you all should
try out different problems based on
loops by yourself
now next up in php is php functions
now functions are very very useful and
very important part of programming in
any language
functions are of two types
built-in functions and user-defined
functions
now built-in functions are the functions
that are already present inside the
framework of your programming language
a very popular example
of a function built-in function of php
is echo echo is a function that is
already built in php and is used to
print out variables strings and values
on the screen
now
user defined functions are functions you
create yourself
to use a code
repeatedly in your program
so i'll explain you with while writing
the code itself
so suppose you want to use this for code
four or five times in your program
so
or even more maybe 10 20 30 40 100 times
in your program if you're writing a very
very large program you want to print or
use this part of the code 100 times in
your program what do you do do you write
this entire code or copy paste this
entire code again and again 100 times
and make your code
lengthier or do you just want to use
this piece of code from here
from anywhere in your program
now to do that we need to
put this piece of code inside a user
defined function so how do we do that
we do that by
writing
function
followed by
suppose you want to call
this function a name
name
and start with curly braces
now this is a user defined function
named name
now inside this name function
is a piece of code
this
for
now how do we reuse it
i'll show you in a second
so
suppose you are
a long way from your code from this code
you don't even know where it is
you want to use
this code again after writing hundreds
of lines of code so how do you do it
you just type the name of the function
that is name
and close it that's about it this is
called calling a function so it is
similar to calling a friend for help so
here you just called your friend name
to execute this part of the code
here
save
and
where there are no changes since the
output will be the same
let us make some changes
add another echo
i'm
going to
run it
again
later
and
call this function again
save it
and as you can see
once the function is called the output
is printed and i'm going to run it again
later and then again the function is
called
and it
uses the same piece of code again and
again and again
see how simple coding can be
when you know what to use
when now we move on to the final part of
the video
that is
creating a form and collecting its
information to display on a screen using
php
so
what i am going to do is i'm going to
create a new file
say
form.html
and start writing
some html code for a form
form
action
now
here what i'm doing is you need to pay
a lot of attention
what i am going to do is i am going to
write form dot php now this is the file
that i am going to be creating later on
which will be linked to this html file
which will in turn run the php script on
the html page
on a web browser
we also need to
write the method
that will be
post
now let us create
a very simple form that will display the
name
email
and
i think that's about it
name
input type would be
text
second would be
email
input
type
would be
text
name
no this would not be name
this will be email
also this is just for example you can
also put the input type as email
for an email and input type as password
for a password
and let's add one more field
only two fields will not look good so
let's say
blood group
input type
would be
text
named
b
group
and i think our form is complete let us
have a look now what we're going to do
is since we created a new file we have
to
go
to the concepts
folder and look at the new file
form.html click on it and as you can see
it is the basic form that we just
created name email and blood group
now
we need to add one more thing
in our form that is the submit button
which will submit the details of the
form
let us go back
and
save
reload
and here we have a submit button
it does nothing
yet
now
we are going to
create
form dot php file
and write a php script
to collect the form data
let us start
our php script
let me add and
indent it a little bit so
in this php script what we're going to
do is we are going to create three
variables separately for all the three
values in a form that is
you can name it anything so the first
variable could be the same as name
now to retrieve the value from from the
form what you need to use is
an array
post
now this
super global
array
is used to retrieve the value from the
form
now in this
post array what you need to enter is the
name
that you just entered for the values in
the fields so
we named it name
second thing second variable would be
for the email
email
you can name it anything else
what you need to
have same is this name
with this name
now
third let us change the name the third
was blood group so we'll
type in the complete blood group
use a post
global variable
and here
we will write the name
what we've just given here which would
be
b group
and now what we need to do is we need to
display
this information that we just retrieved
from the form on our page so to display
it
echo
information display
let us start with
me
and
copy this code instead of writing it
again and again
[Music]
email
blood growth
and go
save it
and enter the details in her form
mac email address would be mac at the
rate simply learn dot
com
and blood group would be
be positive
which we all should be
and let us click on submit
information display as you can see name
email and blood group is displayed
so
let me just add
you
save it
go back
and
the information displayed a little
neatly now so you get the point
we use post method to
retrieve the information from our forms
we also can use get method but it is not
secure in case of get method all the
information is also displayed in the url
section of the web page
hence it is not usually recommended in
case of secure transaction specially
so these were some php concepts to get
you started with php program there is a
lot more to learn so stay tuned
