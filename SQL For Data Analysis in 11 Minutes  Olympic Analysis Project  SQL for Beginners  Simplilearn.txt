foreign
set which is Olympic events
now
in this data set
we have columns like ID name of the
Olympian sex age height weight the team
which he or she belongs to the code of
the country the games the year in which
the Olympics were done season it was a
summer olympics or Winter Olympics the
city where the events were done the
sport and the name of the event and
whether the player or the participant
won a gold silver bronze or whether he
did not win any medal like any not
applicable now so basically it's an
interesting data set let's see what all
inferences what all queries we can kind
of fire in this and make some
intelligence intelligent inference out
of it okay so this is the basic query
select star uh from your schema name dot
the table name
now first query which I want to find out
is write an SQL query to find in which
port or event India has won the highest
medals it could be gold silver bronze
but not any okay so I want to get a
count of the total medals daily of India
according to each event in which it has
participated and I want the highest to
lowest medal tally okay so now I'll just
first break up this query for you
so let's first say select star from
Olympic events where team is equal to
India
now this is the entire data set filter
data where India has participated and
these are the participants now I am
excluding which is not equal to
I am excluding all this all those events
where India has not won a medal so okay
so now excluded those events so now
India has medals with bronze gold and
silver now I want account of all these
medals per event now it makes sense for
me to do a group by
event so now I am doing a group by now
in my select Clause I can have event or
any other aggregation or number
crunching which I want to do now my goal
is to get the medals tally so Group by
event and get the count of The Middle so
India has won 28 medals in men's hockey
one in shooting rifle and one in
wrestling men's wrestling okay so total
30 13 is the total count and out of that
this is the breakup
okay by default you can see the data is
already sorted but you can also put a
sorting Clause order by count of middle
descending and you will get the same
result 28 1 1. such a good inference you
can check uh even if you want that in
which year
per year-wise breakup if you want
so you can use this column here
and say for example you just say ear and
event
now let's see what we get
okay so now in this in 1932 men's hockey
we got the maximum medals then 1952 then
1928 either you can sort so we have
sorted by descending highest middle
count to the lowest middle count or if
you want to order by year
so here you have the latest one to from
2012 to 1928 which is now the data is
sorted by ear descending or you can say
folders to low earliest which is 28 to
2012. so all the options are available
so but we want to see what is a problem
statement which you want to solve
next last example
identify the sports or even which was
placed most
consecutively in the Summer Olympic
Games okay so now
similarly now we want only the Summer
Olympics so what we will do is
Olympic events where season equal to
Summer
okay now I have filtered that data and
event
Group by event
and get the count of that particular
event
now I want to sort it my football men's
football is the most uh played
event okay so again say order by event
count scripting descending
okay so football men's football 1545
events hockey uh base basketball water
polo cycling rowing Athletics men 400
meter uh relay 100 meters so this is the
descending order of the events
next example
write an SQL query to fetch the details
of all the countries which have won most
number of silver and bronze medals and
at least one gold medal now this is
interesting we want a count of separate
count of medals tally which is silver
bronze and gold separately first okay so
now we will take an example of a case
statement now in SQL what I have to do
first is I have to query the Olympic
events table and I have to check in
which case I have the uh the team or the
player I want silver I'll say if someone
has won silver give say then one l0 if
someone has bronze one bronze then one
l0 someone has won Gold one l0 so I have
basically created three columns separate
columns bases the condition of whether
the person is winning silver bronze and
gold now I'm just gonna run this query
independently
and if you see in the end now I have
three new columns introduced z uh basis
the count of the gold silver and drones
so suppose for this example uh this
player has won Gold so he has one in
front of the gold okay
someone has brown bronze so there's a
one here now I'll use these three
columns to do a sum to get the total
tally of silver bronze and gold
separately
so now if You observe I have prepared a
put this in a in a query and on top of
this query now I am writing another
query which is select team comma sum of
silver column sum of groans sum of gold
and I am grouping by team so now
if you see this
China has won 32 Silver 27 drones 41
gold Denmark Etc now I have
per team
it's medals tally silver bronze gold but
now I have to put a condition that I
only want a list of teams which have at
least won one gold means the sum of gold
tally should be greater than zero so now
I will use my having close so after
doing my group ping I am applying the
having Clause it means I should remove
all the teams which does not which have
gold equal to zero okay so now if I
apply this
there is no team now left in my data set
which is having
zero goals at least one gold is there
okay now idea is to solve which has won
the most number of silver and bronze
medal now I have to do sort by silver
let's do that
okay so now if you see United States
have won most number of silver and
bronze medals but at least have one gold
so this is the actual output which is
what we want okay
foreign
and if you go to the bottom the last
there is uh if you see Scotia or
China 2 or any other example
uh I'll just take another example
Uzbekistan
Ireland Indonesia if you see only one
gold and one silver so that's why it's
at the bottom of the table Uzbekistan
for gold but at least they have one gold
okay
next
another very obvious thing which you
might come to mind which player has won
the maximum number of gold okay so
similar to the previous query we will
again create a column with a case
statement that give me a count of
uh only gold and then on top of it I'll
use the name of the player
Group by name rather than the team and
find
and then sort by sum of gold
see Matthew Nicholas has won eight goals
Ole Aina 8 Hussein bold eight goals okay
then Nikolai seven Victor all these so
this is the
sorted order of your
gold Style
next which sport has maximum events very
simple Group by Sport and get a count
star
and then sort
Athletics is the maximum events which
have happened
gymnastics swimming
and again similar question which year
has shown the maximum number of events
which year wherever Max 1992 there were
maximum events in 1988 then 2016 then
2000
so you can see you know 1992 was the
maximum number of events which were
played so these are the kind of
you know intelligent inferences SQL
mining you can do on
on this data set
