yeah hi winners uh this is dr srikant
from team mds conquer uh hope you're
doing good and you're fine
so
finally a conquer team has decided to
come out with few
question solving sessions
okay so keeping in mind the upcoming ini
cd need and followed by the
notifications that were out
related to the government jobs in the
last one month so
these
round of videos
okay are going to be more often going to
be integrated and we'll try to cover
as much content as possible within the
limited time duration so this is what
the target for this
particular section of videos which we
are going to
post from now
okay so let's solve this question in
front of you a baby was brought into an
emergency
uh with a chief complaint of difficulty
in swallowing with the following
investigation
right so what is the investigation they
have given as of now the investigation
they have given is a chest x-ray you can
you can see a chest x-ray here so upon
the examination you can see a radio opec
object which is present here so assuming
that the baby has taken okay has swell
on
the
coin okay so you can see a coin like a
radio pipe object on the chest x-ray so
the coin can either move into
one part that is
trachea
or can jump into the second part that is
the esophagus it can go anywhere so the
chest x-ray is giving both the options
but now if you observe the complaint
that is given by the mother in the
emergency world they are clearly
mentioning that the baby is feeling
difficulty in swallowing swallowing is
most often related to gid okay the
answer here for this particular question
is
you can stick on to esophagus for
example in the if the question is
mentioning difficulty in breathing
same question with same extra difficulty
in breathing then your answer would be
optional that is
trickier
but now in this question the the content
they have given is difficulty in
swelling okay so this question the
answer is b that is for an object in the
piece of address
right i hope this is very very clear so
i'm jumping into the next question okay
so next question is related to the oral
surgery extraction so a 32 year old male
patient underwent extraction of upper
first molar on the right side and a 5
millimeter of perforation was created in
the sinus wall the mode of treatment for
this space okay so first of all uh this
question they were talking about the
oriental communication so oriental
communication is most commonly
associated with
maxillary first
maxillary upper maxillary first molar
maxillary first molar okay that's one of
the important point that you have to
make a note so orange communication uh
the treatment plan varies with the size
of the perforation what is being created
and of course we know the difference
that is acute
uh oral and communication or chronic
orientate communication we have two
things which we have discussed so many
times but now whether to go with a
surgical option whether to go with a
regular follow okay so because you have
all the options here you can check the
options a is surgical interventions b is
suturing the area and follow-up c is
giving the antibiotic dressing and
allows the secondary healing and d is
none of the treatment so it just depends
upon one keyword that is given in the
question that is the size of the
perforation okay here in this question
the size of the perforation whatever
they have given is in and around five
millimeters okay right so they have
given five millimeters as the size of
the perforation so now we are jumping
into the
uh contents okay so for example if it is
one to two millimeters perforation
regularly doesn't require any treatment
because it heals
regularly okay so that doesn't require
any treatment but in this question they
have mentioned it as five millimeters
the second one is two to four
millimeters perforation
where the follow-up has to be done one
to two weeks and advice to avoid strain
straining those areas like sneezing
those areas are probing those areas okay
all those areas like it should be
protected whenever the lesion is six
millimeters or larger six millimeters
are larger then you have to consider the
surgical intervention so there are few
text books mentioning it has six few
textbooks mentioning it has four so
thinking from the paper center point of
view okay so he's expecting a lesion
larger than five millimeters assuming
that he has to go for surgical
intervention so for this question the
answer i want to go with option a
okay so then jumping into the
next question okay so you have one more
question so this is again uh
this this is the type of question that
is given in uh to need examination uh
check the question a 52 year old woman
with a controlled hypertension
with a controlled hypertension came to
the dental opd
to
undergo a dental extraction procedure
after the
extraction
he got down from the chair and
immediately falls down on the floor the
diagnosis of this particular cases
so you have options like postal
hypotension
second one you have option like syncope
third one you have option like
hypoglycemia
fourth one you have option like stroke
okay
so coming to hypoglycemia hypoglycemia
regularly occurs in diabetic patients
okay hypo hypoglycemic shock regularly
occurs in diabetic patient
so whenever you have a background
history of a
diabetic patient so because the most
common cause of hypoglycemia and
diabetic patient according to your
malmed
is skipping
skipping of
breakfast
breakfast or skip skipping of meal that
is the most common cause and second most
common for occurrence of hypoglycemia is
insulin
you take insulin okay all doses of
insulin or insulin okay that is the
second mode of
hypoglycemia but basically it is the
skipping of the breakfast so they're
going to give a history of skipping of
the break first
or the patient with a background history
of diabetic then you can consider it as
a hypoglycemic shock okay like and
coming to vasovagal syncope uh vasovagal
syncope is a different entry that is a
vasovagal syncope is an option
that can also be considered that can
also be considered in this particular
question okay so my suggestion is so you
can eliminate option d option c but you
can stick on to either a or b okay so
but if you go deep into this question
it's clearly mentioned that the patient
is having controlled
hyper hypertension
okay he's having a controlled
hypertension and
because of the uses of the drugs and
everything so they're clearly mentioning
the patient got down from the chair so
they're clearly mentioning the position
position of the patient so it is better
uh from my point of view it is better to
go with option a compared to that of the
option b that is postal hypertension
okay so a is a better option even b is
also b can also be considered but a is a
better option when compared to that
other b
right i hope you are clear with all the
contents okay so we'll be coming up
short with one more video
stay tuned towards the
updates
on the youtube
