metrics and kpis to measure the success
of a product using key performance
indicators kpis are crucial because they
provide a benchmark against which to
measure your performance going forward
kpis make it obvious whether or not you
are succeeding in your objectives and by
using kpis you may Define objectives

start our session here's a question for
you all what according to you is the
most important metric that defines the
success of a product do let us know in
the comments below today we'll start
this session by providing you with a
brief introduction to the product
management metrics in kpis and then we
will be discussing product management
metrics and kpis and stick to the end
because we will be discussing product
management Frameworks which are the
heart framework and the r framework
let's start with the session and know
about product management metrics and
kpis like other company teams product
management teams utilize key performance
indicators or kpis to set clear goals
and natural choices recognize success
and spot risks and problems a lack of
kpis can cause a product management team
to have a poor sense of progress making
it challenging to evaluate and learn
from past work and make it difficult to
prioritize amongst different activity
streams when progress fears off course
the product manager often defines these
kpis depending on what they think are
the most crucial indicators to measure
and report on the product's success and
the product management process are
ultimately measured and improved using
product kpis
the breadth of the product manager's
kpis might vary depending on the
organization's procedures and product
type the kpis could significantly favor
the design and manufacturing of the
product for instance if the team's
primary goal is product development
however if they want to recognize the
influence on the customer the kpis might
be more broad to include use in consumer
behaviors the decision-making process
about the kpis that matter must
ultimately be left to the product team
leader although it should be highly
influenced by the organization's top
level goals let's Now understand what
our product management metrics metrics
for product management give product
managers The crucial information they
require to monitor their performance and
health of their products your product is
more likely to offer accurate insights
on what adds value to your current users
and help convert potential users by
setting and tracking the proper metrics
product metrics are are used by product
managers to recognize which features are
most used underused or completely
ineffective
finding out how customers interact with
a product find out how frequently people
return after registering test how well
your product is received by customers
identify the user cohorts that are power
users and others there are five basic
metrics that are used to measure the
success of a product the very first
metrics of product management are growth
and activation in product management
growth refers to boosting the utility
and user base of an already existing
product product management seeks to make
an existing product more successful as
opposed to Conventional product
management which focuses on managing all
operations necessary to bring a
lucrative product to the market to
maximize user retention during
onboarding and the initial hours or days
the term activation is used onboarding
customers with less friction educating
them about the benefits of your product
and gaining their early commitment are
all examples of activation goals this
holds several kpis number of users per
session traffic churn rate the next
metric used for product management is
retention the capacity of a business or
product to keep customers over time is
referred to as customer retention if a
business or product has a high customer
retention rate it implies that consumers
keep utilizing or repurchasing that good
or service low customer retention refers
to the rate at which consumers
discontinue utilizing or purchasing a
company's Goods or service effects of
retention total company growth and
client loyalty when considering extra
products or Services loyal clients are
more inclined to stay with a reputable
business retention as a metric holds crr
CLTV the next metrics we're going to
discuss is engagement measuring user
involvement enables you to determine
whether customers value your offering
logins downloads and the amount of time
people spend on your website are all
indicators of engagement engagement
holds daily and monthly active users
session duration moving on we have user
happiness as the next metric used in
product management since user happiness
is a self-reported statistic asking
users to estimate their happiness rather
than observing their behavior is
necessary happiness in the context of
products and services refers to a
gratifying or enjoyable user experience
contentment joy and Delight are
additional nouns that can be used to
denote happiness user happiness is a
self-reported assessment thus rather
than observing people's actions you need
to ask them how happy they are that also
implies that prejudice and feelings are
present in this situation user happiness
holds NPS rating on the App Store and
the last metric used for product
management is revenue revenue is the
cash that a firm generates via its
operations depending on the accounting
technique used there are several ways to
compute Revenue sales made on credit
will be included as revenue for products
or Services provided to the client under
accrual accounting Revenue may be
recognized following certain standards
even though payment has not yet been
made the cash flow statement must be
examined to determine how well a
business collects debts cash accounting
on the other hand only counts sales as
Revenue when payment is made
Revenue holds CAC mrr arpu now let's
move ahead in our session and understand
what our product management kpis the
success of a team may be measured using
kpis for product management product
management sales and marketing teams as
well as other business experts use these
kpis to set objectives track development
and address problems because they offer
advice on setting priorities and
assigning tasks kpis are beneficial for
product managers and other team leaders
the creation and management of high
quality products for a corporation
depend on these metrics product managers
can carry out the following tasks thanks
to kpis established goals track
development take notes on prior work
make sensible choices manage competitors
resolve issues deliver high quality
products the very first product
management kpi is monthly recurring
revenue or mrr a company's predictable
income stream from month to month is
measured by its monthly recurring
Revenue this metric's main objective is
to compare performance between different
subscription terms or packages each with
unique features and costs for companies
that provide software as a service or
saas or make money by selling
subscription services this type of
technology is ideal these sales
activities are recurring and simpler to
predict than one-time purchases product
managers May monitor the business's
Financial Health and track the rise or
drop of monthly Revenue using mrr this
gauges a product's monthly gross sales
if you wish to compute this you must
take into account the mrr at the
beginning of the month add the income
from new customers and subtract the
number of customers you lost for
subscription-based businesses like saas
where no further sales are made after a
client becomes recurring mrr is simple
to evaluate monthly recurring income is
calculated by multiplying the average
monthly rent Revenue per user by the
overall number of users for a particular
month the next product management kpi is
the customer retention rate it is the
proportion of clients who remain clients
after a specific amount of time the
length of time you can keep clients will
be measured using this kpi and product
management you should also check to see
if steps are consistently done to keep
clients if the number of customers
departing starts to fall without a
retention plan it is common for firms to
focus solely on recruiting new clients
while utterly disregarding their current
clientele asking your former clients why
they choose to stop doing business with
you is another strategy you may employ
to lower the retention rate always
remember that acquiring new consumers is
harder than maintaining relationships
with your current clientele older
customers are more likely to spend more
money with you than new ones
additionally it is common for current
customers to test new features upgrade
plans or offer comments it could be more
profitable for a corporation to
concentrate on keeping them the
retention rate is equal to customers at
the end of a period minus new customers
divided by customers at the beginning of
the period times 100. moving on the next
product management kpi is the net
promoter score the number of current
customers who are likely to recommend
your product to a friend or colleague is
measured by a kpi called net promoter
score it keeps track of the number of
consumers that aren't interested in your
goods or detractors customers who give
you a rating of 9 or 10 are the ones who
will remain loyal to you they sing
psalms about your brand and are referred
to be promoters or Advocates NPS equals
the ratio of promoters to detractors the
specific definition of a good NPS score
is ill-defined the ideal NPS score does
not exist depending on the industry it
varies a firm in the electronics sector
can have a higher NPS score than one in
the Telecom sector the percentage of
patrons who are inclined to suggest a
product or promoters and those who
disapprove of it or detractors is known
as the net promoter score a high NPS
promotes growth and knowing how many
customers are complaining might help a
company identify a problem with the
customer experience this measure
displays the most popular product
features and may Inspire teams to come
up with fresh concepts for brand new
features or improved ux design here's
the equation NPS is calculated as the
percentage of promoters minus the
percentage of detractors the next kpi
used in product management is average
revenue per user the average revenue per
user is the amount of money a business
May anticipate from a single client this
is an excellent technique for an saas
business to evaluate the effects of a
new strategy a new subscription plan or
a pricing change which client segments
provide the greatest value in may be
determined by running the computation
for several subgroups this can provide
information to investors about
profitability levels guide investment
choices and guarantee the business's
Financial stability you may calculate
the amount of money each user generates
each month or year using arpu knowing
your arpu may help you make decisions
more easily when you are unsure of how
to price a new product or when you want
to raise the price of an already
existing product both new users and
current users can have their arpu
calculated for a new user arpu refers to
metrics that are based on accounts after
the price of the product or subscription
plan changed but for an existing user it
relates to figures from before the price
change arpu is calculated as monthly
recurring Revenue divided by total
accounts the next product management kpi
is customer acquisition cost the
anticipated cost of acquiring One
customer for your firm is known as the
customer acquisition cost understanding
the necessity of measuring CAC is
essential if you plan to operate a firm
for the long term CAC covers the money
you spend on Advertising overhead the
effort of the sales staff software used
and other expenses only after you can
figure out the entire amount spent on
each client will you be able to estimate
how much you will need to spend moving
forward on bringing in new business the
cost of lowering and acquiring a new
Talent is known as the customer
acquisition cost this includes the time
materials cash and effort needed to
create leads and turn prospects into
paying customers the customer
acquisition expenses might include the
price of marketing supplies sponsoring
costs cost of software marketing salary
levels for sales and marketing staff CAC
is the sum of all past and present cash
outlays divided by the total past and
present customers the next product
management kpi is customer lifetime
value you may estimate a customer's life
lifetime value to determine how much
revenue they will provide overall in
essence it provides you with a general
sense of how much income you may expect
from a client before they quit doing
business with you customer lifetime
value is a common metric for determining
the potential Revenue a business might
derive from a client over time the term
customer lifetime refers to the typical
length of time a customer Supports a
business value is the amount of money or
profit that a client is worth a firm May
plan its economic stability and do
Financial forecasting using CLTV
obtaining cash from investors might also
be aided by it product managers May
learn from CLTV how much money they can
spend on acquiring and retaining
customers these expenses include those
for lead creation marketing and
retention tactics they want to ensure
that their expenditures are reasonable
given the return on their investment
establish the average customer lifetime
and average revenue per user for your
company to compute CLTV CLTV equals
average revenue per user times average
customer lifetime the next product
management kpi is the number of
customers acquired the number is not
reserved only for your sales and
marketing staff the quantity of
customers you have obtained is a good
sign that your product is successful if
the discrepancy between the amount you
anticipate and the actual acquisition is
significant either your skills have been
overestimated or the product hasn't yet
gained much traction you may use this to
identify areas where the product may be
improved learn more about the reasons
why your product failed and then act
right away to redesign it to get a
broader appeal the number of new users
new user percentage and percentage rise
in user base are a few of the product
management kpis to monitor that are
connected to the acquisition the next
kpi used in product management is Bounce
rate the percentage of people that visit
one page on a website or app before
leaving quickly is known as the bounce
rate this measure gives essential
information about how users behave while
interacting with a company's digital
content if a business has a high bounce
rate it should look for strategies to
hold users interest for longer it is a
statistic that assesses the proportion
of people that access just one page
before leaving the website or simply
staying for a brief period the bounce
rate provides you a chance to improve
the offering so that the visitor
explores more pages and progresses
farther down the sales funnel you may
boost the average user's focus on the
website by using this statistic the
bounce rate should be decreased
according to the product manager the
next kpi for product management is churn
rate the pace at which customers depart
a business or the churn rate is the
reverse of the retention rate
particularly following a product
modification it provides information on
client satisfaction two different
turnover rates exist client churn and
churn in Revenue customer churn refers
to the number of users who have cease
using your services or canceling their
subscriptions the business's Revenue
lost as a result of client churn is
measured by Revenue churn while we would
suggest focusing more on customer
turnover than Revenue churn the latter
is still crucial because it may reveal a
lot about customer happiness customer
churn rate equals customers lost divided
by total customers
moving on the next product management
kpi is the customer satisfaction score
the level of a client's happiness with a
product or service feature is known as
the customer satisfaction score
companies can identify it by conducting
customer satisfaction surveys which are
typically rated on a scale of one to ten
this can assist managers and staff in
determining how they might enhance their
efforts to provide a better client
experience a leader can use it to decide
whether they want to do a more in-depth
qualitative examination of client
happiness CSC is a metric that assesses
consumer satisfaction with a given
commodity or service customers are asked
to rate their satisfaction with a
particular item or service using a
rating scale in this kind of survey this
metric is calculated by adding the
scores and dividing them by the total
number of respondents CSC gauges how
satisfied a single feature or service is
whereas NPS gauges total satisfaction to
continually learn from the customer how
they like utilizing a certain feature
use CIA SC frequently make sure you
address their problems based on the
feedback to provide them with compelling
reasons to renew the product
the next kpi we have for product
management is the number of users per
session
a product manager May learn which
aspects of an app are most used by
monitoring the number of user activities
every session this is dependent upon the
acts that a user repeats this is
particularly beneficial if a business is
evaluating the use of a new website or
application component they can measure
client interest in the modification to
see whether it is intriguing or
practical kpis are used to monitor if a
product is still meeting client demands
this kpi monitors user activity on your
website and mobile application any
action they do and the characteristics
they employ fall under this category
this is a potent kpi that may direct
your approach to feature uptake the next
kpi is traffic the volume of users who
locate and assess websites are referred
to as traffic it may be organic emerging
spontaneously or it may be paid emerging
as a result of sponsorship of content or
the purchase of advertising space by a
business
people that are in traffic are typically
curious about a company and may
eventually make a purchase
this is a useful indicator for assessing
the success of your internet marketing
additionally it may be eye-opening to
know where your traffic comes from you
will be able to identify the most
effective channels for you when you
measure sponsored traffic you will be
able to identify which platforms perform
best and which don't if you have a
variety of channels where you post
content to generate organic traffic
analyzing this measure will be fun for
your marketing team you should ask the
user why there isn't more active
participation if you see that the
engagement rate is low send your clients
questionnaires to learn where you are
falling short and how you can enhance
their experience to encourage them to
utilize more of your product moving
ahead the next kpi used for product
management is session duration
the amount of time a person spends
interacting with a website during a
session strategies to monitor the use of
digital products include this kind of
measure although revenue is not measured
customer involvement is and this has a
big influence on sales the more a
customer engages with the business's
website and digital content the more
probable it is that they will purchase
anything from that business online
resources may offer Vital Information to
prospective customers about the goods
goals and values of a business longer
session times demonstrate user interest
in a website which is beneficial the
success of a marketing campaign may be
measured by user interactions which can
also Foster brand loyalty these kinds of
measures that are centered on the
customer are great strategies to
increase financial performance the
number is crucial because it lets you
know how valuable the information in
your offering is in the end it will have
an impact on client loyalty and
retention rate adding new videos and
links and enhancing your website's
General design are the only ways to
improve it session duration equals the
total time users spend on your product
divided by the number of users
the other kpi is daily and monthly
active users how many active daily and
monthly users you have is an important
product consumption measure it
demonstrates whether your product is
compelling enough you must select a time
frame and kind of interaction when
defining active users users are active
if they complete the interaction within
the specified time frame you can think
of them as inactive users if they don't
the number of unique users that visit
your digital product on a daily or
monthly basis is tracked by the daily
active user and monthly active user
counts daily active users are the daily
total of active users users who are
active each month are counted as monthly
active users to get a clear picture of
how engaging your product is compare
your active users daily and monthly to
your entire user base the last kpi used
for product management is rating on the
App Store users may give your app a star
rating on a scale of one to five 5. the
summary rating of your app which appears
on your product page and in search
results is based on user ratings when
you publish a new version of your app
you have the option to reset the summary
rating which is unique to each region on
the App Store however we advise being
cautious when using this function having
few ratings May deter potential users
from installing your app even if
refreshing the summary rating might
guarantee that it matches the most
recent version of your program which can
be advantageous if an update answers
customers prior issues now let's move
ahead in our session and know the
Frameworks used for product management
so in this video we will be discussing
the two most important Frameworks of
product management that is heart
framework and R framework so let's first
understand the heart framework an
approach to enhanced software user
experience is called the heart framework
according to five indicators focused on
the user the framework AIDS businesses
in assessing any part of their user
experience the heart framework which was
created for user experience designers
and researchers may be a helpful
technique for product managers since it
is centered on developing a deeper
understanding of user behavior and user
preferences Google ux created the heart
framework 10 years ago as a means of
precisely defining product kpis to
enable data-driven decision making it
aids in defining and delivering
user-centered product metrics the heart
framework may be used by product
managers to prioritize features assess
the performance of a product and make
more data-driven product choices the
user's experience is measured by heart
instead of focusing on system or
technology metrics like failures we wish
to pay more attention to user data like
usage frequency these categories include
happiness engagement adoption retention
task success adoption the rate of users
who finish the try trial or onboarding
process and switch to regular use is
known as adoption it tracks the success
of your client acquisition and
activation processes and enables you to
pinpoint the factors that encourage
repeat usage task success
to determine whether users can
successfully execute their tasks using
your solution look at task success based
on the findings of these tests you may
modify your app's functionality such as
the back end to make sure information
flows through it smoothly and delivers
the outcomes users are looking for
engagement
user activity is gaged via engagement
depending on your product this may
include the number of sessions each week
the number of likes or downloads the
length of sessions the number of
transactions as well as other metrics it
is vital to Define track and monitor
suitable user behaviors in your app the
findings will provide you invaluable
insights into how people use your app
and you will be able to observe the
effects of any changes you make
retention
the percentage of people that often
utilize your product is measured by
retention it's important to keep track
of who is and isn't returning to your
product and why as negative retention
also known as churn will affect how your
product performs in the market
happiness
users levels of happiness reflect their
opinions of your product it is a way to
gauge how satisfied users are and
methods include surveys in app reviews
and net promoter score or NPS this is
quite helpful when determining how
customers feel about the most recent
version of your product or the addition
of a new feature this may then affect
the features you decide to preserve and
the ones you decide to create now coming
toward the end of our session let's
learn about the r framework one of the
most often used Frameworks for measuring
growth and success in saas and startup
businesses is the r model the pirate
metrics or pirate framework are other
names for it it was first proposed by
David McClure the founder of practical
Venture Capital it divides your client
life cycle into five phases and
correlates each with relevant kpis
starting with the initial point of
contact and continuing until a potential
customer can parts to a paying one this
will offer you a clear understanding of
which stages of the client life cycle
are succeeding and where there is room
for improvement in your conversion
funnel R is a startup metric approach
created by entrepreneur and angel
investor David McClure often known as
startup metrics for pirates you may
improve the user experience for your
customers by using these metrics which
reflect all consumer activity patterns
they let you measure conversions more
accurately and concentrate on the best
channels the nicest part about R is that
it doesn't require any technological
expertise making it simple to comprehend
for both seasoned entrepreneurs
embarking on new projects and for
newcomers with brand new Enterprises in
short it exists to assist you in making
better data-driven decisions and
achieving success by maximizing each of
the five criteria and if you comprehend
them you'll be able to see any issues
with your startup straight away as well
well as what specifically isn't working
and how to correct it by doing this you
may prevent basing choices on guesswork
or on bad information the five stages of
your client's life cycle are referred to
as R which are acquisition where do
customers come from activation the
process of converting acquired clients
into engaged ones retention how to
entice potential clients to return
referral techniques for encouraging
clients to endorse your offerings
Revenue how to convert prospective
clients into paying clients acquisition
in essence you want individuals to
register for something for instance you
could want someone to register for a
free trial keep up strong traffic
acquisition you need to make sure your
website is receiving qualified leads the
fact is if you have a good amount of
focused visits each month you don't need
a ton of leads to obtain clients save
your time establish your Target
demographic and conduct a campaign to
build anticipation in for the launch
when customers are waiting for your
product to launch gaining new customers
will be simpler you must provide your
audience with value if you want your
advertising to be effective for instance
you provide an automated email marketing
service in this situation a smart place
to start is an online Network for
experts in email marketing to pique
interest and discreetly promote your
product to the audience publish engaging
pieces regarding email marketing growth
techniques activation the value and
happiness a firm provides at this stage
Mark the beginning of a connection with
a consumer and whether or not that
relationship progresses further down the
funnel will depend on those factors the
number of people who do a certain action
such as seeking additional information
subscribing to a YouTube channel or
making a purchase may be used to assess
activation the number of customers or
users who have been activated would be
divided by the total number of people
that view the website or Etc to arrive
at a formula that would be helpful at
this point
retention
retention is essential to economic
success for any organization that wants
to endure for a long time this is
because the most significant measure of
how much people value your product or
service is retention depending on the
pricing range of your goods attracting
first-time buyers or customers may not
be challenging because people make
impulsive purchases every day a
subsequent purchase or engagement
however shows that the customer was
satisfied and that the item or service
matched their needs businesses use many
techniques for measuring retention
however such as annual recurring Revenue
monthly recurring Revenue customer churn
repeat purchase ratio and time between
purchases may be approaches to gauge
client-based retention
referral referrals are one of the last
components of the pirate funnel it is
crucial to remember that many graphic
representations of the funnel include an
arrow called acquisition that Loops up
from the bottom back to the top and this
is because a perfect funnel would be a
loop or a customer cycle that keeps
bringing in new clients while
maintaining existing ones successful
referrals may be especially crucial
since they are a less expensive method
of acquiring customers than traditional
marketing and because of the impact of
family and friends they are frequently
predisposed to Brand loyalty if
individuals in their Circle are already
customers there are no ideal measures
for this statistic however several
metrics such as number of active users
sharing invites can assist a firm when
they start tracking referrals many times
people fail to mention that they were
recommended or a user who receives an
invite from a friend may take months or
even years to activate nevertheless a
good referral program may be
demonstrated by reduced customer
attrition sustained growth and overall
program success
Revenue although money is transferred
earlier in the customer life cycle
Revenue may be unreliable if the
preceding phases aren't completed and
measured for this reason revenue is
frequently shown as the last step in the
pirate funnel rapid Revenue production
is less important for a company's
success than effective marketing and
initiatives to keep customers and get
them to recommend others the ability to
track income correctly is essential for
a business to succeed and while being
aware of total revenue after cost is
crucial it only represents a small
portion of the full picture to get a
full view of a company's success and
make informed financial decisions it's
important to evaluate income across a
variety of user product and service
categories so far you've learned a lot
about product management metrics and
kpis so here's a question for you all
which metrics would you prefer to
measure a product if it's good to go or
not do let us know in the comments below
and if you have any questions regarding
product management metrics or kpi then
do let us know in the comments below
