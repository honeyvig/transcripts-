Interest now without further delay let's
get started with the session on data
cleaning for data analysis so for today
we will deal with this particular data
set which is New York Airbnb open data
2024 so this happens to be the latest
Airbnb data set uploaded to kaggle on
June 5th
2024 so we will download this particular
data set and uh let's presume that we're
going to conduct some data analysis
using this particular data set and we
find some errors or in discrepancies in
this particular and we'll try to clean
it right so I have already downloaded
this dat set and I've already extracted
that particular Z file and here we have
it let's try to open
it following data conversions in this
file convert large number of scientific
notations do you want to permanently
keep these
conversions um you can just um you know
you can just convert if you want and you
cannot convert if you don't want it but
I'll go with the convert option which
might be recommended in few situations
anyhow we will be cleaning the data set
right so no worries on that part now if
I expand the second column which happens
to be the name column we already have
some irregular discrepancies in the data
if you go back to the website you can
see it is a combination of okay let's
scroll a little so you can see it's a
combination of name rating and uh the
configuration of that particular Swit
room all right so it happens to be the
name of the hotel rating and the number
of rooms you have in there or the
configuration of that particular hotel
right by some error or by some way Excel
is enable to recognize what exactly was
there in the data set and it converted
that particular data into a special
symbol and remember you cannot work on
this particular column you might think
I'll use text to column s right you can
uh say let's try it okay let's try it
you might wonder I can go with text to
columns uh solution and I'll use the D
limiter as other and past that
particular symbol here but it's it's not
going to recognize it okay even if you
copy it let's say I copy this value and
try the option of text to columns by
selecting the entire column and I'll
give the D limiter as
other is not going to paste it you don't
have it right in such scenarios you
might go you might you go crazy and you
might not even have a solution for it
right but what if I tell you a simple
substitute function can help you here
right seriously there are endless
possibilities when it comes to data
cleaning and the solutions are really
simple and you cannot believe uh how
easy it was right so uh this is the
First Column and uh again if we go down
to a little bit if you dig down a little
bit you can see here the review date and
uh you have neighborhood Hotel names and
uh the latitude and longitude that means
the location data and room type is it is
it a private Suite or you know types of
rooms try to understand your data try to
read your data right that's when you
understand what are the possibilities or
what are the insights you can build
using this particular data set right so
read your data properly and uh here you
have ratings right ratings is something
which we can work with the cleaning
process and um yeah so here you can find
a few places where there is no rating
right the rating is not provided here
and if you come to the same row right if
you go across the same row and if you
come to the column B you can see we have
rental unit in New York and all of a
sudden we have one bedroom one bed one
bath right so we don't have a
combination of rating here and if you
check out the cell uh B30 you have the
rating and the configuration right in
such scenarios if you try to split the
cell you might end up with having
discrepancies in the data set right so
what you can do is wherever we have
the rating as no rating or let's say no
rating is equals to zero or Blank cell
right we can replace these particular
notating with blank cell and imagine
that these are the blank cells that you
might encounter in real life scenario
and you wanted to eliminate those
particular blank cells and rows because
they might cause some discrepancy and
you might end up getting a wrong report
right so let's try to also work on that
particular solution where we have blank
cells in the data set and we remove the
entire r or blank cells okay we can have
a use case on that part as well and uh
here we have another column that says
license and uh we go down we have the
configurations
here right so that's it with the data
okay and uh here if you check out we
have a column called priceing right so
it gives you the pricing details let's
say uh I come from a different country
right um let's say I come from India and
I pay in terms of rupees or I come from
UK and I pay in terms of let's say
pounds right and you come from United
States of America and you pay in um
terms of English dollars United States
right this causes a lot of discrepancies
and for a report where you are trying to
convert or where you're trying to
generate an exact report what you want
and you have some discrepancies in the
data set it might end up giving you a
wrong result but for now it's correctly
formatted in terms of whole numbers no
decimal places no special symbols no
currency symbols right so it's just
plain numbers so uh let's say I don't
want those symbols and we have the exact
number over here and let's say in case
we have some decimal values you can also
add and remove those decimal value so
you can change the um so in case if
you're facing that issue with the
currency format you can change of remove
the currency format and change the
decimal values to the whole number and
uh yeah so let's get started so that was
the brief overview of the data set and
let's get started with uh working or
data cleaning right coming with the
first one which happens to be the name
column column B we have a new
column let's try to add a few more you
might want
that there you go
now since we are you know uh creating a
new column and trying to eliminate the
special character let's okay let's not
name this we have multiple symbols right
so let's try to use them first let's
copy
it the SYM we want to
eliminate okay and here let's use the
substitute equals to substitute
function text box let's try to fix it
with F4 column B is fixed and the cell
numbers will change and old is this
particular text so we're going to insert
a text right so let's try to insert that
simil in double codes and what you want
to replace this with nothing just two
double codes
enter
now get across all the cells and we have
eliminated this particular symbol which
was capital A now we have another type
of symbol right so if you clearly check
the entire data set we just have one
more special symbol which happens to be
the lower case a alphabet a and followed
by that we have few f stops right now
let's try to replace that as well we are
going to use the same substitute
function Cel address let's try to fix it
with function key
F4 column C is fixed the cell numbers
will change 2 3 4 5 6 comma the old text
since we are keeping text so double
codes inside that we have the text close
the double codes and what you want to
replace it with nothing two double Cotes
close the bracket and enter now we have
the name of the hotel rating and the
bedroom right the configuration of that
particular hotel rooms now drag this
across all the cells and there you go
now you have the data in the way you
wanted it right now you can just simply
copy the entire
[Music]
column new column all
together copy the entire column let's
try that once again go to the new column
and here go to the paste special you
just need to paste the values over here
and there you go you can copy this
particular column name paste it right
here where we have the cleaned data and
he can eliminate all the remaining
columns delete them right right now you
have another catch you want to split
this particular data cell into the name
of the hotel rating and hotel
configuration but in few scenarios we
don't have a rating right in this
particular column B 15th cell we have
the name and configuration but there is
no rating right this might end up in the
wrong data and again another catch is
you have spaces right rental unit in New
York it has space space rating space one
bedroom right so we have spaces in
between and we have a full stop for
rating now how could you
recognize and how could you split this
particular data set we have no idea on
this right now uh let's say we want one
two three uh column right so we want one
column for the name of the hotel and one
column for the ratings and one column
for the configuration right we have
created this particular um you know
configuration but we don't know how to
split it right how do you split this
particular cell into three different
columns now comes help from chat
gbd just copy any of the cell I'll copy
this particular cell and go to chat GP
PT which is in my tab over here start
chart GPT and explain your problem to
chat
GP I have a
cell with
data double codes enter the
data I want Excel
formula that that can
split the given
cell
into as shown
below right now paste the same data and
split it first one name of the hotel
second one the rating and third one the
configuration right clear just be more
specific about what you want uh chat GPT
to help you with right so I want Excel
formula that can split the given cell
into uh three
different columns as shown
below right just enter and chat jbt
should be able to help you so it is
telling you to use the mid-end search
functions and it has already given you
three different formulas for three
different occurrences let's try the
first one which is with the name of the
hotel right just place it over here and
obviously you will get the value because
the cell address is different so we are
supposed to give B2 as the cell address
let's try to fix the cell address so the
column B will be fixed and cell numbers
will be changing copy that particular
cell address and paste it over here and
press enter now you have the name now
drag this across all the cell and you
have the cell names I mean Hotel names
right now let's go with the second code
copy that paste it over here and same
process you will have to change the
address to
B2 let's try to fix it using function
key
F4 column is fixed cell numbers will
change copy that replace A1 everywhere
in the formula now you will have ratings
in a few cells and in a few cell we have
the configuration which happens to be an
irrelevant data because there was no
rating provided by the user in that
instant so we will remove that don't
worry we will have a separate process
for that and again equals to so we will
replace A1 with
B2 try to fix the column using function
key F4 there you go copy the cell
address replace all the a ones in the
formula and to thank you chat gbd which
help you with a beautiful formula right
so places where you get stuck you can
use some AI there right so there must be
some mistake that we
did undo it and I think we messed up the
formula somewhere so let's try to copy
the code AS provided by chat GPD and
place it exactly where it's supposed to
be going and replace
B2 to fix the
formula we
paste paste paste it here paste it
everywhere it's supposed to be press
enter okay there must be some mistake
let's check the formula properly once
again I have a reference data set of
this let's try to open the reference
data and check the
formula
so I think it's with the prompt so we
gave the prompt in this way so it has
double spaces somewhere so I think let's
check the formula once again go back to
the original data set control Z and
here I think we have single space no we
have double space that's the
problem
yeah okay so we can ask CH GPT for a
different formula and try a different
formula in this particular location in
case if it's not working then equals to
the
formula so in place of A1 we will have
B2 we can fix the address
F4 Cy place it right over here and this
over here enter
right okay it's not working
properly
okay we Chang the formula a little bit
with addition of mid sege and length now
if we enter this particular formula I
think it's it's it's going to work just
replace a1's
with b2s
everywhere with
fixing and enter there you go now you
can drag the same data set across same
formula across all the cells and you
should be having it
now this is
done let's try to copy all the
data you have copied it now delete it
and now you will be pasting the values
only as
required okay let's try to insert three
new
columns okay so I think we have the
option
of selecting the entire column and then
deleting it and then let's try to copy
and
now right click insert copy cells now we
still have the formula right so we don't
want the formulas
anymore let's try to work around it copy
the cells
insert three different new
columns here and copy these three fghh
columns and go back to here and now try
to paste the values only values and this
in this scenario you don't have any
formulas embedded in this particular
data now what you can do is just quickly
delete these um cells which you don't
want anymore in your data set
that so I think you don't want EFG JK so
I think we U mistakenly uh inserted the
data twice so let's check the original
data just for
reference so I would always recommend
you to keep a copy of the data set that
you're working with so that anytime you
have a problem just go back to the
original dat set and have a look at it
right now I think we don't even want
this particular column over here so we
have the name of the
hotel
rating and now if we come back to the
rating section remember the blank cell
elimination process we were discussing
about that's the one so you can quickly
uh select the entire data set go to sort
and filter option and filter
and here you can select the rating
section and deselect everything and go
with the last one new and rating okay
now you have only the new and no rating
options over here you can just quickly
select the entire uh column and delete
it which will end up giving
you the approach of having FL sets Now
quickly remove the filter
option now you have some blank cells
right now what to do with the blank
cells simple contrl a go to contrl g go
to special and here you have blanks
select that and there you go now all the
blank cells are
selected it might take a little while
because we have around some thousands of
rows the blank cells are selected now
press control and hold it there and
theness press it it's the minus symbol
right now you have different options
just select the entire room you know you
can just eliminate entire row with any
discrepancies it might take a while
again just give Excel it's time to
delete the
unnecessary uh blank cells and rows in
the data set so that we have a
completely formatted data set there you
go I think we are good and now for
verification if you check the
configuration section or the rating
section you will not have any
discrepancies which fall into or they
are spilling into the um rating section
you know the configuration section
should not be spilling into the rating
section and that's how we do it so far
it's good enough and I think there is
one problem over here right so I think
it uh this particular uh you know row is
having some errors with this particular
spell cell splitting function okay
that's not a problem so we can quickly
check for that discrepancy and uh you
know we did the filters option right so
quickly filter
out and uh it should add a new
filter so if it has anything else than
numbers you should be having in the end
so yeah I think we have a couple of
celles with some irrelevant entries you
can just quickly select those cells and
eliminate them as
well I'm un selecting everything and
selecting only the cells that have some
Text data so that you can have those few
rows maybe around 7 to eight rows and
eliminate those
rows there go and now if you quickly
remove the sort filter options we have
the data set ready and now uh we will
also learn the trim function before we
go any ahead okay in some scenarios we
might need that let's say I have okay
let let me insert a new
column let's say I have some irrelevant
blank
spaces and the spaces in between here
which will cause a new problem for us
while we are performing our data
analysis jobs right in these scenarios
if you use the trim function it will
eliminate any improper spacings just try
trim tap to select and enter and if you
drag the same formula across all the
cells you can eliminate any Extra Spaces
here you see there are no spaces for the
data that you have entered you have
trimed out any excess spaces in between
the text in the beginning of the text
and at the end of the text right so this
is again a good option for us you can
just quickly undo everything so that you
don't have to worry about the Extra
Spaces right there you go and that's one
way of removing Extra Spaces from your
data set and uh let's say if you want to
keep this in the form of uh uppercase
let me insert a new
column let us remove this
and uh let's say I want in
uppercase just tap to select there you
go and you have it in uppercase right
just drag the same formula across all
the cells you have it and let's say you
wanted the same in lower case you can
just type in lower tape to select and
there you go and in case if you had the
same problem uh let's say the name is
all in upper or lower and you want it in
proper case you can just press proper
and select select the function proper
and there you go you have the proper
case right that's another way of you
know doing things or okay the text
cases and uh now so far we have dealt
with um splitting text into columns and
uh converting the upper case to lower
case and also trimming the Extra Spaces
and uh also using the substitute
function and U yeah we have uh also
dealt with the currency format and uh we
have a few more let's say we wanted to
work with data okay I think this
particular data set does not have the
date column okay we do have it
here last
riew okay so I think it's uniquely
formatted it does not have discrepancies
with date with Am Pm right okay we'll
we'll try to look at that from a
different perspective different D set Al
together don't worry about it now
another common factor let's say I have
some duplicate entries let's go back to
the bottom section and let's say I have
a duplicate entry of these three uh know
rows
copy and paste it over here now we have
some duplicate data entry now you can
select the entire data set go to data
option and here we have something called
remove duplicates option right if you
click on that it will remove it will
first it will select all the columns
okay uh and remember to check this
particular function check on my data has
headers select all the uh columns don't
forget any of the columns okay what it
does is it will check all the columns
and if there is an entry which is
similar to all the columns right all the
column headers are same to same and all
the entries in each and cell every cell
are uh under the column header are same
to same then it considered and considers
it as a duplicate entry and eliminates
it so far according to our knowledge we
should be having at least three
duplicate entries let's see when you
click on okay duplicate I think so it
has already eliminated it so I think we
didn't past it properly but that's how
you can eliminate the duplicate entries
in your data set let's try to do that
once again and select all remove
duplicates
yeah one did not past the values
properly previously but that's how you
can remove the duplicates one duplicate
value is found and removed so that's how
you can eliminate duplicate entries in
your data set and uh here so far so good
we have learned the formatting thing we
have learned the split to cells we have
used chat GP to get our formulas we have
formatted cells from upper lower proper
and we did substitute functions we did
the currency formatting and yeah what
remains is about the date formatting so
let's work on a different data set all
together if we go to file and
open this particular T set I think that
should be beneficial for us or let's go
to yeah yes this is the one I was
talking about right now let's close all
the previous dat sets don't save
anything and this I think you might want
to save let's save this for reference
now we have this particular data set
right in front of us and you can see we
have um date and time formatting in 24
hours and if you scroll a bit to the
bottom you can find we have the same
data in terms of date time that is 12
hour timing and AM and PM right now you
might wonder you can just directly split
the data set into space You Know by
giving the D limit as space and I can
eliminate the timing but if you see the
data set title it's about crime right so
if you are going to perform some proper
data analysis based on time location and
date you might require the date in the
form of date time amm and p.m. right you
might want that time section you don't
want to miss that right so in such
scenarios you can take the help of
custom formatting see here we have date
month time and hours and minutes and a.
and p.m. just select the entire column
go to this particular formatting and go
to custom and here remove General and
past the data set formatting you want in
terms of date month year hours minutes
am and p.m. select okay and there you go
00 got replaced with 12 a.m. which is
the beginning of the day and the entire
column is being now in having a uniform
date time format so so these were the
