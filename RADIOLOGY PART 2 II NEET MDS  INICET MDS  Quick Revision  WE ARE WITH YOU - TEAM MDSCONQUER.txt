see that if you take the interpretation
if you start from the coronal region
you can see there is an filling in the
coronal region and along with an dk
process
okay so it involves the pulp
and if you take in the periapical region
you you you
you are seeing a well defined
radiolucency
which is more than one centimeter
so here there are two things so as
radiology is involving pulp it might be
the dental caries which involving the
pulp
so the tooth will be non vital and in
the periapical region you have seen a
well defined this is a well defined
radiolucency so these two
important features or the signs are
give a positive diagnosis for the
radicular cyst okay so two things you
have to remember a well defined
radiology greater than one centimeter in
the periapical region
and a non-vital tooth gives you a
diagnosis of a radicular cyst
and one more thing and this is an
ipa seeing you can see here and if i'll
define radial recency
in the region of this missing tooth and
there is an
prosthesis connecting this to posterior
teeth
okay so here this type of radial sense
is in the
edentulous region and that too the tooth
is
missing okay so this edentulous
edangelous region which gives an
positive sign for the diagnosis of
residual cyst okay so if this is
this type of radiation is seen in the
identity region
and you might you should think that the
tooth has been extracted because of
a caries and there is an remnant
type of remnant radicular cyst which is
not accurate as properly
so which might result in the residual
cyst only one point identically
area if an well defined radiolucency you
can go for the option residual cyst
and here it is an occlusal radiograph is
given
and here you can see a some type of
heart shaped radiolucency
involving in the anterior palate region
so
heart shaped radialis in c in the
anterior palate region will given
diagnosis of nasal palatine
cyst okay heart-shaped radiology will
give a diagnosis of nasopalatin cyst
coming to this opg here we can give two
differential diagnosis
so here you can see a the posterior
region
that is in the right this is the right
side that is for the four
six and four eight in the apical regions
you see you have seen a well defined
radiolucency
and four eight is missing here and this
four
eight is impacted and there is a
radiolucency surrounding the
impacted tooth in the posterior region
so this type of radial senses you can
give a differential diagnosis
first as it is an impacted tooth
and there is an covering radiology you
can go directly think about
dentist cyst and one more differential
diagnosis you can give in this case is
if you see here there is a
resorption of roots okay so in you in
this
type of aggregate aggravative tumor
the example is your amyloblastoma okay
so the one more diagnosis easier amilo
blastoma the first one is
dentist cyst because of an impacted
tooth
with covering radiolucency and the
second one is because of
resorption of periapical root region
and also an impacted tooth is there so
you can go for the
differential diagnosis of amyloblastoma
here this is a view okay this is an
which view this is a jig handle view and
what fracture can you identify in this
thing
that is zygomatic arch fracture you can
see here
zygomatic earth fracture so we have
already done that zygomatic arts
fractures are
seen or evaluated on jeg handle view
which is nothing but a modification of
submando vertex view
so that's all for
so this is a glance of radiology subject
presented here
which will be very useful for you thank
you for listening and
happy learning with mds conquer
