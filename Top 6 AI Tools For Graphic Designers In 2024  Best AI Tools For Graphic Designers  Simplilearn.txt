without further Ado let's get started so
first up we have chroma so this AI
powered color tool helps designers find
the perfect color combinations based on
their preferences by learning your color
style chroma generates pallets gradients
and even patterns that match your unique
taste it's a game Cher for anyone
looking to perfect their color scheme
now let's see the chroma website so this
is the chroma website so we will start
with generate so the first step is to
select 50 colors that appeal to you so
you can select the 50 colors that you
like so this process allows chroma to
learn your color preferences and style
here you can see a variety of colors so
simply click on the ones you like chroma
uses these selections to generate
personalized color palettes and then
start training now this step might take
a few minutes but it's essentially for
the AI to understand your
taste now you'll see the main dashboard
where chroma presents different color
combinations gradients and patterns so
first let's explore the palletes tab
yeah this is the palletes tab just a
moment so here chroma shows various
color palettes based on our selected
preferences so each palette includes a
combination of colors that work well
together so for example you can click
here to see more details and even see
your favorites for later use now in the
gradients tab you'll find beautiful
gradient options so these are perfect
for creating visually appealing
backgrounds or overlay effects in your
designs so again these gradients are
tailored to your color preferences now
let's talk about font Joy now choosing
the right font pairing can be
challenging but font Joy makes it a
breeze using AI it suggests font
pairings that work harmoniously together
allowing you to create visually
appealing typography effortlessly now
let's see how font Joy works so to get
started click on generate now phone joy
will present you with a random pairing
of fonts so this can be a great starting
point for exploring different
combinations so if you find a font you
like you can lock it by clicking the
lock icon this tells font joy to keep
this font while generating new pairings
for the other text elements for example
let's log the header font this is the
header so let's log the header font yeah
it is logged and generate new pairings
for the body text
yeah so as you can see locking of f
allows you to experiment with different
combinations until you find the perfect
match so you can continue this process
until you're satisfied with both fonts
now fjy also offers sliders to adjust
the contrast and similarity between the
fonts so by moving these sliders you can
fine-tune the pairing to match your
design needs whether you want fonts that
are very distinct or more similar so
once you have found a pairing you like
you can preview it in various context
such as headers body text and paragraph
now this helps you to see how the fonts
will look together in a real world
setting now next we have Adobe Firefly
now Adobe firly is another incredible
tool which is a part of arobi suet of AI
driven features it uses AI to automate
repetitive design tasks like content
fill intelligent scaling and even
generating realistic textures and
effects it's designed to integrate
seamlessly with your existing Adobe
tools making your workflow smoother and
more efficient so for that first you
have to log into Adobe Firefly with your
Adobe ID so once in you'll see the
dashboard with various AI power tools so
these are the various AI power tools so
first let's look at the text to image
tool so this is the text image tool so
the tool creates images from text
descriptions so simply type what you
want and Firefly generates an image
matching your descriptions so you can
type a
Chef cooking Sak so let's see what will
come okay you have to sign in you can if
you don't have an Adobe ID you can sign
in through Google account also
so we gave a prompt which is a Chef
cooking Sak and these are the results so
you can experiment with different texts
to get varied results now next we have
generative fill so the generative fill
lets you fill or replace parts of an
image so for
example you can select this image and
you can select the area which you want
to replace so we'll select the
background either you can use a brush
like this or you can select a background
now the background is selected and here
you have you can give a prompt like with
which kind of pict picture you want to
replace it like for example we'll give a
peaceful Lake a
peaceful
Lake see so as you can see Firefly
seamlessly fills the area with generated
contents so this is great for removing
unwanted elements or adding new features
now next we have whsle ai now for those
involved in uiux design whsle AI is a
must have it uses AI to transform
sketches into high filty wi frames
complete with interactive elements this

so to get started click on start
designing so you'll be taken to a blank
canvas where you can either start
drawing directly or upload your sketches
and screenshots so let's upload an image
of a UI design like for example I have
taken a screenshot of Amazon's web page
so let's just add that so this will go
to your file manager and you can add
your screenshot and once you upload Bly
I will analyze it now wizly a
automatically converts your uploaded
image into a WF frame so as you can see
here so the AI identifies UI components
like buttons text Fields Etc and it'll
turn them into editable elements like
for example I can you know type over
here so it will transform it into
editable elements so you can also adjust
the properties of each element by
selecting it and then using the right
hand panel so visi saves your project to
