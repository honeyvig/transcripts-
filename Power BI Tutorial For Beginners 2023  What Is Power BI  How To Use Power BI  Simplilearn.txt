foreign
today we are going to talk about power
bi what are its features what are the
basic advantages of using a
visualization tool like power bi and we
will talk about how to install power bi
and other features it provides and the
basic setup
so let's discuss what's in it for us
today
now we will first talk about why power
bi you know why it's a popular tool and
what problem it solves what is power bi
and what are the primary features of
power VI uh which you can use in your
day-to-day data analytics visualizations
creating fancy reports creating
meaningful intelligent reports uh for
your organization for your personal use
for crunching numbers for generating
reports real time Etc
now the most popular tool for power bi
is the power bi desktop uh I'll show you
certain uh aspects of power bi desktop
and then I'll show you the steps how to
install power bi desktop on your machine
and then definitely power the bi desktop
is a free tool provided by Microsoft but
then you can also subscribe for an
Enterprise version which is primarily
used by Enterprises for publishing their
data so we'll see the difference and
then overview of our dashboards which
can be created uh you know what kind of
dashboards can be created in power pi
so this is the agenda for us today
now why power bi so generally uh you
know visualization tools reporting tools
are required in order to create and
prepare and analyze meaningful data it
could be a data for an organization it
could be a social media platform data it
could be a data from iot devices but
something which needs to be analyzed and
some intelligent inferences and data
mining has to be done on top of it now
imagine there is today we are in a world
where terabytes of data and information
is getting generated on an instantaneous
basis on minute-by-minute basis so it
becomes very essential to churn out
something meaningful something
intelligent out of it in the market
there are a lot of other tools which are
available like clicks all tricks Tableau
and power bi so power bi is a Microsoft
product which is one of the most popular
products and it comes as a free to
download product Microsoft power bi
desktop which is available and I'll show
you a couple of ways how you can install
it on your machine but why power bi is
uh popular is because it provides a lot
of out of the box features drag and drop
features which we will talk about in our
subsequent sessions and you know classes
but today's session is primarily focused
on giving you guys an introduction on
what is the purpose of power bi and what
all problems it solve uh in the in the
real world so power bi allows you to
view analyze and visualize huge
quantities of data and the data could be
in any format Excel CSV text or it could
be a direct connection to a database
like SQL MySQL Azure Oracle anyone IBM
db2 so it supports n number of uh you
know data types or data sets and it's
very powerful in terms of data
connectivity
so it uses powerful compression
algorithms to import and Cachet the data
within the dot pbix file
so it's as convenient as a simple
software if suppose you import a data
and then you prepare a report and then
you can easily share the reports with
your peers or someone who's
co-developing with you either through
Power bi cloud services or even you can
share the pbix file in an email
or through any other means and you can
share the data set with the concern and
they can then work on the report
independently so there are different
ways there is no uh kind of a limitation
for you know working on power bi there
are multiple ways and it is very fast it
is the most fast uh tool to work with
Excel because definitely Excel is also a
Microsoft Technology so it works very
fast on Excel based data and gives you
numbers and Reporting at a very high
speed
so now once you have imported the data
power bi allows you to model the data
allows you to work intelligently on the
data it allows you to model data in a
way that if you are importing data from
multiple Excel sheets importing data
from multiple tables you can easily
create a relationship between those
tables or data sets in power bi and then
create visually appealing reports
meaningful reports as I've been
emphasizing and make sense out of the
data no data in silos is of any use data
in Silo means a single worksheet or a
single data set will not churn out any
meaningful information until unless you
basically join it clubbit merge it Union
it append it with some other data sets
because a single data set will never be
able to hold that much amount of
information which is generally required
for a you know important report
so it has easy drag and drop
functionality with features that allow
you to copy all formatting across
similar visualizations so just like in
Microsoft Excel we use format painter to
copy the format of one cell to another
similar features very very similar to
excel products or Microsoft product they
have provided that if you have applied a
a particular thing on a report you can
easily replicate that on any other
report the font uh the header size the
background color you don't need to do it
again and again so there's a lot of
reusable features which are also
available
okay now as I said Excel is a Microsoft
product power bi is a Microsoft product
so they have intercompatibility you can
publish data from Excel to power bi now
with the latest developments and
enhancements
as of today pixel has also plugged in a
new feature called Power pivot which
I'll uh show you later down the line but
that also allows you to do a quick
analysis no you can't create of course
complex reports or uh fancy reports like
power bi but Power pivot allows you to
create you know quick measures quick
functions quick calculations on your
data quickly only in Excel so it's an
Excel plugin but whereas you know you
can power bi is also compatible with
Excel so when you create a report in
power bi it gives you inbuilt feature to
export your power bi report into Excel
format directly you don't need to do any
programming for it also
uh you can easily publish when you
publish your power bi reports it allows
you to give some inbuilt intelligence of
analyzing your reports in Excel and it
gives you all those of all those
features of exporting your power bi
reports into Excel which is not
available in any other tool or otherwise
those tools have to create plugins
create add-ins and probably they might
charge for it but Power bi comes with
lot of out of the box features which are
very very helpful for analyzing data in
Excel and vice versa
Azure Cloud now Azure itself again is a
Microsoft cloud Tech stack so using
power bi with Azure allows you to
analyze and share large volumes of data
so Azure basically Azure database or
Azure Cloud servers are meant to hold
huge amount of data and power bi allows
you to have seamless connection you can
easily connect to Azure data Lake
you can reduce the time it takes to get
insights and increase collaboration
between business analysts data engineers
and data scientists so azure
data Lake becomes the central focal
point where all your analysts Engineers
can keep working on on the centralized
piece of data and churn out their
reports data scientists primarily job is
to keep the data in a structured way
optimized way optimize the input output
operations disk operations and memory
utilization so that the reports also get
churned out in a faster manner so every
uh you know every person has their own
role in order to give a quick
refreshable report a quick rendered
report any report which is taking huge
amount of time to get rendered will not
eventually be used by the business users
because then it does not solve the
purpose the report should be fast
reports should have uh you know
appropriate filters slices and dices you
should be able to you know create the
reports or dynamically or you should be
able to analyze visualize the data
dynamically so all those visualization
features are available in power bi and
it works seamlessly either it is small
data or huge data uh it allows that you
to work on those kind of data in a
seamless fashion
right so this is just a very uh quick uh
example of how our typical dashboard
looks like dashboard is nothing but you
know you have clubbed couple of multiple
reports on a single page and you know if
you change a filter uh a single filter
on the page all the reports will honor
that filter and the numbers will change
accordingly so if you see the in this
example there is a filter or a drop down
or product ID product name employee name
or supervisor or a date range so
whatever date range or filter you will
apply all the reports on this dashboard
will get changed based on the filter you
have selected so power bi allows you to
get insights from data and turn insights
into action to take data driven business
decision and that is the ultimate goal
of any visualization tool that is the
purpose for which visualization tools
are bought
uh and purchased by the organizations
and data is fed into them
Now power bi fetches data from Factory
sensors social media sources to get
access to real-time Analytics so that
you are always ready to make timely
business decisions so so basically there
is a feature of live connection or cut
off data connection so either you can
work on data which is deciding on a
machine and you can just work on the
cutoff data like for example it's
there's a data which is available for
sales 2017 2018 and you're just working
on a historical data it's a cut off data
or it could be possible that you want to
be connected live uh to a real-time iot
based sensor based data or social media
data like Twitter Facebook feeds or you
know you're connected to live Google
worksheets that is also possible you
just need to publish your Google sheet
for a public domain embed that you are
in into Power bi and then whoever
updates that Google sheet automatically
the power bi report will also start
honoring and consuming the new data
which is added in the uh Google sheet so
all those kind of real-time streaming
analytics is also possible and that is
one big feature uh and very important
feature of power bi which is widely used
and has a very huge uh you know Market
acceptance and Market utilization
now what is power bi
power bi is a business analytics service
provided by Microsoft that lets you
visualize your data and share insights
right so earlier
you know uh uh Microsoft used to have a
technology called ssas now they have
replaced actually ssas and SSRS with
power bi so basically you can use power
bi on the data which is there in your
Excel or any other data source and the
power bi service or power bi desktop
basically creates a connection to those
data sets and uh imported cache it and
give you a handle to it in order to work
with it so you can create these fancy
meaningful visualizations like for
example there's a geographical map if
you are importing data for a country or
a continent or a region power bi will
automatically detect that it's a
geographical information and give you a
map with latitude longitude information
and you just need to plot your uh your
numbers on the map either you can use
bubbles or either you can use triangles
or whatever data structure you want to
use but all the mapping will be
available geographically then you can
create pie charts which is shown in this
visualization you can create tree maps
you can create cards where you know you
can highlight the most important numbers
like sales total sales of your company
across all the regions or the growth
chart or the month on month uh you know
sales of your organization or number of
total number of products or units sold
so whatever is important and to be
highlighted for the management to take
any meaningful decision or any insights
you want to share power bi visualization
tool the power we have visualization uh
chart allows you to drag and drop and
create wonderful reports okay
so what are the features of power bi so
power bi desktop is something a
standalone tool which you need to
install on your machine it allows you to
build reports by accessing data easily
you do not need Advanced report
designing or query skills to build a
report though yes it is beneficial that
if you know some SQL programming
analytical programming or you are aware
of advanced features of any analytical
tool that might help you but that's not
a showstopper you can easily build
reports in quick turnaround time without
needing any technical background you
just need to have some analytical uh
mindset and you can create uh Savvy
visualization in you know analytical
reports
stream analytics as I mentioned you can
create a live connection uh with any
kind of data it could be iot it could be
media social media it could be Google
Docs it could be uh you know any other
kind of uh you know live connection it
could be a live database connection
itself so any insertions or updations or
deletions happening will automatically
reflect in your report
yes multiple data sources and that has
to be the primary criteria for any tool
to be popular if any visualization tool
is limited to certain data sets then you
know it will not be highly acceptable in
the market
and custom visualizations right so as I
showed you certain uh examples in the
past in the previous presentation uh
that feature is very important because
someone might want to look the kpis look
at the kpis from a different perspective
some management might want to look at
the kpis from a different perspective so
you need to you need to have that
capability to create different
visualization from the same data set now
let's take a look at how
to install power bi desktop on your
machine
so basically what you need to do is
you need to go to this URL
power bi Dot microsoft.com en US desktop
okay
and you need to just
enter this
now you can download it for free so just
click over here
and
it will open Microsoft store so
basically now what Microsoft have done
in the latest operating systems is that
when you are trying to download you can
actually directly go to the Microsoft
store
and search for Power bi
so let's wait for a couple of seconds
right here so power bi desktop in
Microsoft store for me it's already
installed so it's asking me to open it
I'll open it in a while but for you for
anyone who is not installed he will see
the button of install over here and it
will automatically install in your
machine and then you can easily go and
open power bi desktop now if I click
open over here
now this is the
uh UI of the power bi desktop I'm not
going to go right now in creating
reports right away we will talk about
that in a subsequent session with sample
data sets and we will cover the features
of power bi desktop one by one but this
is what it is this is the whole tool of
power bi which is having the
visualization pane all the different
visualizations are you know can be
created from this pane
then this is the pane which allows you
to select the data data fields then
there is a report view data View and
relationship view the data model view
where multiple relationships you can
create you can view the data in the grid
of the tables which you will create and
their reports so you can create multiple
reports on multiple Pages you can keep
adding pages either you can drag create
multiple reports on a single page and it
will become a dashboard or you can
create separate independent reports on
the single page
and these are the menu options which we
will talk about how you can change color
scheming you can do data modeling you
can create new reports and you can also
transform data which is the biggest
feature extract transform and load the
data apply different logic changing data
types massaging the information creating
new joins appending the data you know
adding new columns etc etc
we that is what you can do in transform
data so this itself is a whole different
world it's a dedicated topic so we will
talk about that in our subsequent
sessions
okay so I hope you all had a great
learning with this session
and uh I will meet you in my next
session on the subsequent power bi
topics thank you very much
