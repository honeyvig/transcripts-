so guys here we have searched about the
chat GPT photo documentation and this is
the official page of open
Ai and here you can find out that they
have put on advancements and the model
capabilities that J gp4 processes you
could see here they have posted the
videos that two gp4s are interacting and
singing you can play and watch these
videos so how they have advanced this J
gbt for
compared to chat
j4 and you could see the vision
capabilities of chat jt4 as they are
asking for the interview preparation
with their Vision capabilities so
similarly you can check out all the
other videos that they have posted and
moving downwards we can see that they
have posted explorations of capabilities
you could select the sample that could
be visual narratives or poster creation
for the movie or corrected design so you
could check out how CH GT4 and 40 are
different and as we move down here they
have mentioned the model evaluations
between chat gb4 and CH gb4 turbo here
we have the text evaluation audio ASR
Performance Audio translation
performance and they have posted the bar
graphs and the charts with all the other
AI tools compared and then we have the
language tokenization and what
improvements they have made in that
that is they have used Gujarati language
Telugu Tamil marati Hindi and they have
achieved the fewer tokens in these
models Now we move downwards we can see
that the model safety and limitations
they have added some more safety
features and the model availability that
is charity foro is available for both
the free version and the paid version so
this was all about the the official
documentation of chat jpt 4 so let's get
started with the comparision analysis of
chat jpt 4 and 4 so guys I have opened
chat GPT 4 here and in the other window
we'll open chat GPT 4 and we'll provide
the same prompts to both chat gp4 and
for and we'll see what responses they
provide to us and in what time frame
we'll compare the time frame also and
how they conceptualize or provide the
fractional prompts to
responses so starting with number one so
the number one category we will be
choosing is factual inquiries so we will
ask both of them and we'll ask
them that tell me something interesting
about
merury and provide to chity for also so
let's press enter and see which one of
those will provide
us a good
response uh so you could see that chat
GT4 has provided us the response in a
paragraph and if we read this so the
tone
is okay like it is telling to a third
person and if we move to CH je4 you
could see here that it has categorized
the points here
that these are the main points that you
could use as an interesting points about
merury so I would say CH GT40 has an
edge
here and I won't think like there was a
time difference and I can say that we
can't have any difference in the time
taken by both the models so now we'll
move to next category that is complex
scientific and Technical problems so
here will ask both the models about how
quantum computers work and compare their
advantages to classical
computers so let's ask
them that
explain how quantum
computers and compare their
advantages to classical computers
we'll copy the same prompt and paste it
to CH GPT 4 also so let's press enter
and till then I will tell you guys that
from here you can use the different
model also that you have used GPD 40
here it's showing you after generating
the response I will show you guys how
you can switch to the models
also here you can copy it and here you
can read it loud
and in the settings also you can check
out what voices you need as an assistant
here so moving back we can see that CH
GT4 is still responding and generating
the response while CH GT 4 has already
done it we can surely say that that J
gbt 40 has an edge with the time frame
thing as it generated the response much
faster than
j4 and if we compare what the responses
they have provided
and CH jpd 4 has mentioned how quantum
computers work advantages of quantum
computers comparison with classical
computers and after that challenges that
quantum computers are facing and if we
see what CH gb4 has provided you could
see that how quantum computers work and
after that the advantages of quantum
computers and the comparison with
classical computers so you could see
that with the less time frame CH GT4 has
provided more subtopics
and the more points that he has covered
whereas chat j4 has provided the least
information but he has provided the okay
information that we are sufficiently
acquired with the
prompt but definitely I will give an H2
CH4
here so here I was telling you about the
change model thing so you can click here
and check out CH gbt 4 and chg for if
you click here CH GT4 it will generate
the response again with jp4 model as we
have select the CH jpt 4 model here but
neglecting that he will generate with
the chat gbt 4
model so here after generating the
response if you click
on 1/2 so these arrows you can find out
this response has been generated by GPT
4 model and this response has been
generated by gp4 model and you can have
this comparison in the same window also
but I using different windows so we'll
compare it in one another
only so now moving to the next section
that is creative writing so now we'll
ask both these models to write a short
poem about a moonlit night in a forest
so let's ask them that write a short
poem
about a
moonlit night and a
forest so let's copy the same prompt and
paste it in
gb4 and let's wait for the response as
you guys can see that GPT 4 has already
generated the response and here gp4 has
also
generated and before comparing both
these responses I want you guys to
notice something that this new version
of open AI that is GPT they have moved
the profile section from bottom left to
top right and there are many more
advancements if you see here this is the
history section and the memory
feature and you could find many other
features that could be manage memory in
the profile sections
only so if you go into personalize
category here we have the memory
section so moving back to the prompt
response so here we have the gp4
model and if we read this poem in the
forest deep with shadows play the moon
cast light in a silver aray Whispers of
leaves in a gentle breeze Dan with the
night in serin silent E and if we
compare this so gp4 has provided a
really a short poem whereas GPD 4 has
provided us the four Paras and if I tell
you about the tone so GPT 40 has an edge
here as it has provided a really crafted
good poem then
gp4 so now we'll compare these models on
the basis of text analysis skills or
before that we will compare them on
complex mathematical and logical queries
so we'll ask them to solve a quadratic
equation and we'll provide them the
equation solve the equation
that would
be
3x² -
12x + 9 =
0 and explain each
step so let's see which model does IT
job better
so you could see the writing speed also
like how this cursor is moving I would
definitely say that CH GPT 40 has a good
speed
here and it has generated the response
and gp4 has also generated the
response so I would say that GPT 4 has
taken six steps to solve this and
provided a detailed information how you
can solve the quadratic equation and
whereas GPD 4 has shown us the three
steps and he has integrated other steps
in step one only that is factorize the
quadratic
equation so if you are a beginner you
could definitely switch to JJ 4 to
understand these quadratic equations or
mathematical
equations so giving another point to CH
for here now we'll move to another
category that is data analysis question
so now we will provide a data set to
both of
them uh so this will be the data samples
sales
data so here we will ask both the models
to
create a bar
chart between sales and
region you would see that both the
models are
analyzing and here we are jt4 has
provided us the response and the main
thing that I want to showcase here is
that j40 has now interactive images or
bar graphs or the visual representations
here if you click to static chart they
have an option here so now this bar
chart is not
static and you could just have the plain
2D design and if we click on this again
you could see that you could find the
actual figure what has been showcased in
the bar graph and similarly here you
could change the data set color that is
you can change the color of the bar
graphs or the bars in the
graph and moreover you have the download
section here also and the expand section
if you expand it you could see that here
you can generate the response and chat
with jp4 model and have the output
here so we
will get back to the window and here you
can see that CH GT4 has provided us the
basic response as it was doing
previously also so here's the bar chart
and no interactive design and no
download
option moreover no other EXP pending
options also so let's move to the next
category and that would be our last
category so now we'll ask both the
models about solving philosophical and
ethical problems so now we'll ask them
do animals have moral rights so justify
your
answer we'll copy paste the same prompt
to gp4 model
and ask both of them to generate the
response so you could see that both has
generated the responses and if we
compare them so chat GPT 4 has provided
the number one point that is argument
for moral rights of animals
and then the second point that is
argument against moral rights of animals
and if we move to GPT 40 section he has
also provided the main topics but he has
provided the subtopics and highlighted
what are the main key points for both
that is moral rights and against moral
rights so I would definitely say that j4
has improved factual accuracy and
response discipline like he has a
framework to provide the response
whereas Char for just provide the
response in a basic
Manner and one more category we'll see
here that is we will ask him to create
an
image of two
robots
fighting or facing each
other or in a face
off so let's copy the same prompt to gbt
for model
also so here's the response you can see
that CH jpd 40 has
generated an image with two robots in a
dramatic face off in a futuristic Arena
and whereas that gp4 has also generated
two futuristic robots in a dramatic phas
off and I would definitely say that gp4
has done a good job
here his image is much better than GPD 4
so if I tell you about the conclusion so
choosing between chat gbt 4 and chat gbt
4 depends largely on your specific needs
if you work requires detailed analysis
and you often engage in complex
discussions then chat GT Forum might be
the better choice with its deep
understanding and retention capabilities
however if you need quick turnaround
times and are managing multiple task or
collaboration speed and efficiency will
likely serve you better so both tools
have their merits and can significantly
enhance your content creation process
and other data analysis processes so as
these Technologies evolve staying
informed about updates will help you
continue making the best use of jni in
your work so with that guys we have come
