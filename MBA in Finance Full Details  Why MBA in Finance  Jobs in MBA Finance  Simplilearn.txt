that is introduction to mba in finance
the wise people have said that money
cannot buy happiness and many
individuals not only believe in but
actually live by this adage
so being a genji millennial tell me
what's your take on this do you believe
money is unimportant and you can be
happy even if you don't have it
if you say it's unimportant then what
about food lifestyle internet rent and
tv subscriptions can you enjoy these
things without having any sort of money
you cannot right
so let's face it money matters a lot and
matters related to money need experts
who understand how money matters
an mba in finance trains you to become a
financial wizard it is one of the most
competitive lucrative and in-demand mba
specializations among recruiters
finance and accounting regularly shows
up towards the top of mba recruitment
charts that's the reason why people
consider finance as a go through
business management specialization
nowadays
furthermore with international incomes
surpassing the dollar hundred thousand
mark it is probably the most sought
after specialization by all mba
aspirants
having said that let's get our basic
state by understanding what is the
eligibility criteria for pursuing mba in
finance specialization
the fundamental criteria for an mba
degree in finance or any other field are
essentially the same
you must have all of your ducks in a row
high gmat or gre score excellent gpa
appealing resume mba essays some finance
and accounting work experience on the
back along with employer recommendation
letters are the factors that most
finance mba applicants bring to their
applications
the minor characteristic that
distinguishes finance folks is their
fondness for mathematical skills
sharp quantitative and analytical
abilities are required to survive and
make sense of a future job that is
primarily concerned with numbers
typical folks who frequent finance major
classes have one of the following on
their resume
an economics mathematics or commerce
degree or some other quantitative
background
a well-known quant certification such as
chartered financial analyst or what is
generally known as cfa
work experience in the domain of finance
or accounting and a strong gmat gre or
cad quantitative score if you lack these
factors but can demonstrate excellent
analytical abilities via your job
experience you might still be able to
undertake an mba in finance
after qualifying and advancing to the
interview selection process you will
need to prepare for one of the most
common yet profound questions admission
officers are bound to ask why mba
only in this scenario they are likely to
focus on your decision to get mba in
finance compared to any other financial
program such as mfin because of that the
preparation for this question needs to
be in two-fold why mba and why mba in
finance moving forward let's focus on
the second question that is why mba in
finance
the maximum number of students answer
this question by highlighting the
highest salaries finance offers
if your source of happiness is linked to
owning a tesla electric car or a private
jet who are the interviewers to judge
right but think for yourself are those
aspirations legit enough
that's why the first step we want you
all to follow is to avoid claiming
career benefits such as higher salary as
the only reason for your specialization
decision
while framing your response consider
what pulls you towards the quantitative
and analytical challenges presented by
this discipline
think about how finance itself is an
integral component of any organization
and doesn't exist in a silo by itself
consider how you may prepare yourself to
be adaptable and valuable enough with
this remarkable degree to back you up
think about which sectors of business
you are passionate about and how finance
can help you achieve desired outcome in
that sector
also if the recruiter asks you why mba
and not other master specialization
then to answer this question try
combining the skills any mba program
brings to the table
hands on practical exposure as compared
to just theoretical training
effective communication strategies along
with persuasion and negotiation tools
resource management abilities
digital savviness that helps you build
strong business acumen
entrepreneur spirit
and the ability to strategize a path to
reach common business school
highlighting all these skills will help
the interviewer visualize how
knowledgeable and effective candidate
you are
