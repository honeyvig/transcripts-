so hello guys welcome back to the demo
part of this table diffusion so
first we will I will open St JT
AI
okay so this is the artificial
intelligence company which launched
stable diffusion text to image generator
okay so we have multiple models in
this okay so we have image model we have
video model audio 3D languages okay
let's go to this image models yes so we
have two series sd3 series and sdxl
series sd3 large is there tur large
turbo is there sd3 medium is there in SD
XL see stable diffusion XEL is there
sdxl turbo is there and Japanese St
diffusion XEL is there so there are two
ways of using stable diffusion the first
is you can install stable diffusion
locally and you can use it but there are
some requirements you should have on
your system okay just like there should
be you know uh GPU should be there
graphic card and viia graphic card
should be there or another graphic card
will be fine right so here you can uh
you know use the API or you can get the
license or you can download the code
okay or you can read about the stable
diffus Exel here right so I will show
you how to
download and install this stable
diffuser for a while I don't have any
graphic card on my system okay so I
can't use but I will show you properly
how to use and how to run it so first
step I will give you this link okay this
is the hugging
pH so here sdxl is you know their
recently launched model okay so here you
can uh read it about all the
configuration or you want okay the how
you can install so first you have to
install python okay first you have to
install python latest version and then
second you have to install after
installing python you have to install
git not get
copilot just this get
bash okay
this you have to install Windows either
Mac OS or Linux okay so here what you
have to do I will give you this link and
you have to go to files and version and
you have to download this one sdxl base
1.0 0. this one or you have to download
it so see I have already downloaded it
okay so this file is all around 6.5 GB
okay for a while I'm canceling it
because as you can see here I already
downloaded okay so after downloading
this you have to go
to you know you have to
write
stable web
UI stable diffusion web UI okay I will
give you this link as well okay here
what you have to do you have to go here
and download zip
file okay again zip file is there but
again let me download it for you okay
this is
done okay after that what you have to do
you have to unzip this table diffusion
okay then this folder will
come okay then you have to go down and
here you can see web U UI user for
Windows badge file you have to run this
batch file okay if you're you Mac User
you
can uh run this shell script okay so I
will install this I have already
installed but you have to just double
click this and everything will be
installed okay so it will launch one
page after installing this it will take
like half an hour because it will
download multiple files of 4455 GB okay
for a while let me run it see this page
will come so as you can see here I am
running stable diffusion locally 1 127.0
this okay this is local so here so now
we downloaded first file right if you
remember we downloaded this
file so what you have to do you have to
go to downloads then you have to copy
this file download it file then you go
have to go here here you have to go to
models then here you have to disable
diffusion then you can copy paste here
your file okay so these are the models
so this is the latest models okay it
will install with v15 prune model but we
want to use latest model okay so that's
why we are copying it okay so while
installing it will show you
some these type of things here it will
download multiple things right so after
installing this just
refresh and you can see two models are
there okay you can select either okay
I'm selecting this here I will
write
astronaut riding horse but it will give
me error okay I it will generate so what
error is coming see found no Nvidia
driver on your system okay I don't have
any drivers installed in my system I
don't have any graphic card but if you
have graphic card it will run smoothly
it will give you all the outputs but
again we can use this stable diffusion
online as well web okay here see stable
diffusion 2.1 demo I will give you this
link as well okay so let me write again
then the same thing as
not riding
horse generate
image so it will take 11 second as it is
showing we have to wait okay it's
scanning almost done processing see
astronaut riding
horse okay okay
let's go to chat gbt and ask some
funny give me some
funny text to
image
generators
prompts okay so let's get okay A C weing
chef at
adapting this one is cool okay let's
copy this and paste it here
okay let's read a penguin dressed as a
pirate searching for treasure on a ice
flow with a pirot that only sarks
okay
see pirate
head see pirate head okay let's try
something
else arobo trying to blend at a grumpy
beer sitting in a therapist office okay
this one is cool I
guess okay let me run
it again it will take some 11 seconds
but this you know if you run locally
this will work definitely I'm sure okay
because in other than my system it's
running smoothly see a grumpy we are
sitting in a therapist office discussing
its feeling about something see sitting
this one so this is how you can use a
staple diffusion okay locally and using
web right this is better than Dal
