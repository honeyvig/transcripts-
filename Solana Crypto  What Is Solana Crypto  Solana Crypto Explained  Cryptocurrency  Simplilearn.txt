hey everyone i'm sharmly and i welcome
you all to this new video of simply
learn on a very interesting crypto
solana in this video we will explore
some of the interesting and important
aspects of solana crypto
first we will understand what is solana
then we will look into what is a soul
token
or sol token
then we will explore when and how did it
originated
after which we will look into some of
the features of solana
then we will explore what type of
consensus method does solana use
after which we will understand how
solana works
then we will explore the current price
and volume of solana in today's date
after that we will look into the future
of solana holds for itself
and at last we will look into real-life
uses of celana
so without doing much ado let's start
the video
let's explore what is solana
solana is a cryptocurrency that is used
to pay for transactions or a
decentralized computing network
solana attempts to increase blockchain
scalability by combining proof of stake
and proof of history consensus as a
result solana promises to be capable of
processing 50 000 transactions per
second while maintaining
decentralization
now the question arises what is the sl
token or soul token
sonata's ecosystem uses the sl token as
its native currency as a result the
token can be transferred between nodes
in the solana cluster in exchange for
running on-chain programs or certifying
their results
it can also be used to make micro
payments known as lamp ports
now when we are talking so much about
solana crypto let's also dive down and
explore how and when exactly it came
into existence
anatoly yakovenko established the solana
platform in 2017.
before launching solana yakovenko worked
at balcom after working as a software
engineer at dropbox
he has a wide spectrum of knowledge
with compression methods
he developed a new method of dealing
with typical throughput difficulties in
the bitcoin and ethereum blockchain
with the help of eric williams and
solana cto greg fitzgerald
they intended to develop a trustless
distributed protocol with increased
scalability
the team now has experience from leading
companies around the world including
apple google microsoft intel twitter
dropbox and others
now that we know what solana is and all
about its background let me ask you a
question recently solana joined hands
with two foundations to raise a fund of
5 million dollars to encourage the next
wave of creators and fans onto crypto
networks so comment down your answers in
the comment section below
to know the correct answer to this
question
watch this video till the end
moving on let's talk about its features
which makes it unique and popular
scalable solana uses proof of history
and a number of other groundbreaking
features to allow the network to scale
at the rate of moore's law
low cost for applications with billions
of users solana is designed to keep fees
low
so you will never have to worry about
rising fees as your user base grows
composable the single global state of
solana guarantees project composability
multiple shards and layer 2 systems
should never be dealt with
so we have heard a lot of references to
proof of history but what exactly is it
that we will discuss within the type of
consensus method solana uses
the cilanna network which has 200
physically different nodes
can handle a throughput of more than 50
000 tps
when using gpus is one of the most
performant permissionless blockchain
unlike bitcoin which employs the proof
of work algorithm as the system
decentralized clock solana uses the
proof of history technique
you can use proof of history to
construct historical records that verify
an event occurred at a given point in
time this algorithm is a verifiable
delay function with a high frequency
this function requires a specific number
of sequential steps to evaluate
each transaction or even that is
examined will be assigned a unique hash
an account that can be verified publicly
and effectively
the count serves as a cryptographic
timestamp
allowing us to determine when each
transaction or event occurred this
provides increased throughput and
efficiency within the solana network
now that we know about its structure and
mechanism let's explore how solana works
now we know solana has built a
one-of-a-kind method for determining the
time of a transaction known as proof of
history
let's see the step-by-step procedure of
how it works
step one input the details of
transactions performed in the network to
its leader
step two
leader will now efficiently sequence and
organize the messages so that they can
be processed by another nodes
step 3 the leader then executes the
transactions based on the ram's current
state
step 4 the completed states transactions
and signature will then be published by
the leader to the verifiers or
replication nodes
step 5 if the state receives
confirmation the verifiers will perform
the same transactions on their copies of
the state and publish their signatures
and at last step 6 the consensus process
will then use the published
confirmations as votes now that we know
everything about solana let's have a
look at the price and volume of solana
according to market capitalization
the solana network can process more than
50 000 transactions in one second
and the current price of it is 30 with a
circulating volume of 270 million sql
coins
which is quite impressive considering
its time span in market capitalization
as well as compared to other
cryptocurrencies
let's see what future the solana holds
for itself
filana although being a new project has
delivered on its promises of speed and
scalability it's token price has also
done well
attack attracting investors attention
nonetheless the network acceptance and
usage
are still in the early stages
we won't know whether solana speed make
a significant difference in the bitcoin
realm
until we witness substantial traffic and
more use cases
having a fast network is beneficial but
the advantages will only occur as more
people utilize it and more use cases
emerge
real-life uses of solana
serum radium bon peda orca
oxygen and phantom wallet are some of
the recent projects that solana is
working with
well this is all about solana crypto but
before ending this video i asked a
question before in this video so the
answer to the question is audience and
metaplex foundation
solana joined hand with these foundation
on 23rd july to raise funds and to
promote the participation of new
creators in the crypto network
we have almost reached the end of this
video if i missed anything important do
let me know in the comments section
i hope you enjoyed this video on solana
