yeah happiness this is dr srikan from
team mds conquer
now i'm going to give a brief idea of
what we are going to do in the upcoming
few days
in handling this particular subject oral
surgery
so as already discussed in the live
interaction
that oral surgery has a very great
importance
in any sort of examination whether it is
inicet
or whether it is need pg or whether it
is any sort of exam
any sort of entrance examination
throughout the world
oral surgery has great importance and it
is one of the clinical department
excluding your oral medicine radiology
the second department which has
interactions like interrelationship with
many other departments if you see your
orthognathic surgeries a combination of
arthritis surgery
if you see your pre-prosthetic surgeries
combination of
your uh your prostho and
your surgery and your cleft lift cleft
palate is related to again
ortho pedo and everywhere okay your
maxillary sinus
is related to anatomy okay tempo
mandibular joint and atom is important
local anesthesia general anesthesia
related to your pharmacology
so this is a subject which is
interconnected or
which has an interdisciplinary
relationship with
many other subjects and most of your
questions as
as as now the trend in the last two
years has changed in almost all the
examinations
excluding your ins et most of the
examinations are now
integrated okay you have your integrated
neet exam you have your integrated
inbd examination uh you have your
integrator almost
all the uh like uae country uh trans
examinations or the exam
qualifying examinations uh for your
dentistry practice most of these
got integrated so now your learning
approach should go
in an integrated manner okay so keeping
that in the mind
so a proper beautiful well organized
integrated schedule is prepared for you
i'm just going to give a brief idea of
what we are going to do
so it's not oral surgery it's integrated
oral surgery so i just want to add a
word integrated because
here i'm reading or making you to
go ahead with pharmacology here i'm
making you to go ahead with general
medicine
medical emergencies okay here i'm a part
of perio
here a part of oral medicine radiology
here a part of prostho here a part of
orthopedic
here a part of anatomy uh dental or not
or oral or not or oral histology so the
many many other things
we're going to learn in this upcoming 20
days so let's have a brief look
so the first two days that is the third
and the fourth december so
uh we're going to move around exudancia
so you can make anodized exodus plus
all the minor surgeries so minus
surgical procedures
are the first two days plan and the
second three days
that is the fifth sixth and seventh i
have planned local anesthesia means
exclusively
everything related to local anesthesia
the chemistry of the clinical features
everything which moves around the stuff
of local anesthesia has to be done
then 8th and 9th you need to go ahead
with the anat
and the diseases and the disorders and
the treatment plans case based
discussions everything related to
temperamental joint and 10th and 11th we
need to go ahead with maxillary sinus
first anatomy
then the diseases acute maxillary sinus
chronic maxillary sinus
and what are the other diseases of
maxillary sinus and their proper
treatment plans with
a proper case based approach 12 you need
to handle your orthognathic surgeries
cleft lift and cleft palate related
stuff and the treatments and everything
13 is the pre-prosthetic surgery 14th is
oro facial infections all your space
infections ludwig's angina carbon sinus
thrombosis
i mean the infections of oral cavity
which required a surgical approach will
be
discussed with a proper case based
approach
16 17 18 we're going to deal trauma
uh your your resistance of trauma uh
followed by nowadays so i can see more
of questions in
related to the graphs of course grafts
is a combination of your
perio and oral surgery but i mean the
oral surgery bone crafts and everything
will be discussed in detail
and 18th and 19th we're going to deal
with the recent advances and of course
instruments and tubes and everything
like these are the most commonly asked
questions in the examination so we'll
have
a a class on diagram is aspects that is
the oral surgery instruments tubes all
the emergency equipment everything
so apart from that we will learn many
recent advances where the questions are
being thrown in the few
last few years like so for example it's
like a piezoelectric surgery it's like a
cryosurgery
so there are many other recent advances
diagnostic aids as well as the surgical
equipment
or the surgical techniques where the
questions are being
asked and we need to focus on such a
risk regularly these areas are
neglected in most of the mcu mcq books
with the basic mcq books what you're
going through but make it out these are
very very important an examination point
of view and of course if you see the
uh the the syllabus of oral surgery
according to the
dci protocols okay so medical
emergencies has a great waiter so
medical emergencies has a great weight
is in your oral surgery and of course
you need to go ahead
and handle most of your medical
emergencies from
almond okay so proper video classes were
prepared from malmed medical emergencies
which has a greater importance
in the examinations and 21st and 22nd
our plan is to cover general anesthesia
with all the emergency drugs so
most of this 20 21st and 22nd will move
around pharma and the medical
emergencies of parliament
so you have a decent time for revision
and followed by your final exam
is going to be on 26th that is post
christmas you have your final exam
on this oral surgery that's going to be
on the need pattern
exclusively so you have revision time
for 24 3 4 and 25 so in detail
what to be done where to be done how to
be done will be discussed on the group
daily base so for example exodus
this is going to be personally posted on
the group okay
so i mean a brief idea like what are the
books that you need to prefer and you
need to carry
so as already discussed what are the
books that you need to buy
for exclusively specifically to oral
surgery i i want you guys to keep
these boo these two books as a reference
of choice and make a note
this book is very very important in ini
c
e d point of view okay so you can keep
like most of you
either have done neelima malik
or balaji or chitra chakravarti as a
choice of book in your uc life
so any of these books you can keep as a
reference like whenever you
had a doubt whenever you are not clear
with a particular concept whenever you
are not clear with a particular
explanation either in your mcq book
or either in the teaching modality
because it's not mandatory that you
everything should be perfect like you
may not understand the way we approach
in some cases like in such a situation
it's better to go back
to your referral book and i hope like
most of you have recently finished your
final year and oral
is is a favorite of most of you as as
as as we have discussed in the live
interaction and i hope you have done
your oral surgery at the best from your
book so you can keep your
book as a choice of reference like
whenever you are not
i mean like whenever i'm not clear with
the concept you can go back and just
have a
quick recap of that particular topic i
won't suggest you to
go ahead and read everything related to
oral surgery from the book what you have
done in your final year
but i'm suggesting you whenever you have
it out whenever you have a break
whenever you
you don't have a clear concept about a
particular topic
okay i want you to suggest uh
to go ahead and just have a glance over
this particular
topic okay so your power playbook volume
file has oral surgery content and i hope
most of you
has submitted your postal addresses and
we
we will try our best to dispatch the
books as early as possible
so you can start working on power black
books also related to the oral
surgery so apart from this there are few
other contents which
are going to be available for example
like you will have
a topic specific examination
on the website once the topic is done
for example first two days exodus will
be done
so third day you will be provided access
to that of exodus
so you can complete exodus before you
start the syllabus
on third day finish the exodus go
through the questions like 20 25
questions
then you can start the second topic that
is local anesthesia so
local anesthesia three days are done so
on the fourth day once the local
anesthesia done you will be provide
access to
local anesthesia maybe a 25 or 25 to 50
questions
on local anesthesia both the clinical
based as well as the
diagram based as well as the case based
every sort of question will be provided
so that is called as an topic specific
the topic specific exams
the number of questions will range from
uh
25 to 50.
okay so i hope you you're very very
clear about this
particular thing and the next one
on 26th
december you're going to have a grand
examination
on oral surgery in the need pattern
hope this is very very clear
and rest all secrets about oral surgery
secrets about preparation secrets about
notes making and everything will be
discussed in person
