yeah first of all uh Utley
congratulations to each and every one of
you uh who achieved extraordinary ranks
in yesterday's result I was very very
happy very delighted okay so this is the
best result I had I had very good ranks
in top hundred and very good to see most
of the interns in top 100 it's very very
wonderful and extraordinary okay very
happy for each and every one of you
because uh I was getting so many calls
uh from yesterday till today like the
session was also late because I was on
call because I cannot keep the phone in
the middle
so very happy okay so as all as always
discussed with you okay so whatever uh
the marks uh that were given to you
yesterday
and what was the rank that is given to
us today is just a number okay and of
course we we work so hard for this
member this number
will definitely have an influence on
your professional aspects but this is
not only the factor which is going to
decide your next part this is this is
what I was telling before the exam uh I
mean before the result okay so I told
you
so what I told you
post exam
okay most important is post exam
post exam is most important and post
result is most important so these are
most important rather than uh rather
than the exam rather than the result
what you are going to do with the rank
you have
what you are going to do with the marks
you have okay so that analysis what you
are going to choose which college you
are going to choose which department you
are going to choose and all these are
going to have a very very big impact on
you there were few calls a few messages
calls I tried my best to attend almost
all but few messages I have not
responded till the time uh the main
reason is I was not feeling uh well from
past three to four days I was being to
interactions for two or three colleges
after your examination
then I got flow favor so I'm not feeling
well even I'm not so comfortable to take
this life but getting so many calls from
the students and so many calls from the
parents lots of things are happening in
the last uh 24 hours so I feel like I
should come live so that I can address
few important and most commonly asked uh
areas so that most of your doubts will
be clear so that you you'll not get
tensed your parents will not uh how the
apprehension after the result and
everything so that I want every one of
you I want you to make more comfortable
because you should know few things
before you ask few things to me okay so
parents were calling me and asking
asking me questions which I cannot
really address so that is the reason why
I have taken this call of uh coming in
front of you in Live And discussing very
few important aspects related to the
counseling and related to the
re-preparation and all these aspects
guys my energy levels are low that is
the reason why I had few energy drinks
to be active for this uh 40 45 minutes I
want energy from your side okay how many
uh active guys are you active
you should motivate me now I'm very weak
okay so whatever it is it is happen Okay
most of you are calling me about
restarting the preparation
reappearing for the exam few of you were
crying on phone I tried my best okay in
handling you this difficult situation
few of you are very excited with their
success happy with their uh result
parents are calling me appreciating me
appreciating the team hard work and
everything it's good side like when
you're when you're on other side of the
coin that is the happiest side of a coin
yes it's going to be so comfortable for
me to handle but you are on other side
of the coin like your your performance
in the examination was not up to
expectation or on the day of result you
are not very comfortable with the result
okay uh because you hopes you you
expected something to happen but the
result was on other side so it's going
to be difficult as a mentor to handle
such situation but I'm more inclined to
help the people who are on uh
who are on the negative side of the coin
rather than the positive side of the
coin so this session is basically for
all those people
okay so I just want to address few
important issues that regularly happens
post result okay so in this particular
session the first and foremost important
thing is
fastest
the first biggest question is
are you happy with your preparation you
you I want you to answer your you to
answer these questions are you
are you happy
with your preparation whatever
preparation you have done are you happy
question number one
second one
how much you are going to rate your
preparation
right
out of 10. how much you are going to
rate your preparation out of time okay
so these are the two important questions
you have to answer yourself the next
comes
you are allocated in the neat MDS result
yesterday with a rank right with a rank
and a result
yes you may be happy with your
performance
but you may not get a rank which really
achieves something in the counseling
okay so then you have to check your rank
and result okay so I'm just going to
give a rough idea okay uh maybe in
general I'm going to tell you uh maybe
specific incline to a particular state
it may vary okay results uh there are a
few students like checking the allotment
list of last year no the the comparison
may not work okay the computation levels
of last year will be different and this
year it will be different the seed
Matrix of last year will be different
and this year will be different seat
Matrix of all India will be different
and this year all India will be
different
seat Matrix of individual state will
also vary so you cannot compare the last
year statistics to this year statistics
that is going to be impossible but we
can come to a rough conclusion what is
the tough conclusion so now I'll talk
about counselings before I talk about
before I decide or before I change your
ranks guys are you ready
I'll tell you how the counseling overall
counselings how the counselings will
takes place and all these things these
are very very important okay so so
coming to the counseling part
so you have something called as 50
percent is a i r all India okay so they
are going to release 50 percentage all
India rank okay whatever you get is
almost a 50 test all India rank so you
will have this 50 test all India pools
we'll have this 50 percent test all
India pool right so in this fifty
percent is all India pool there will be
two category of seats that are included
category number one is all government
Dental College seats
so throughout the country all the
government Dental College it means 50
percentage of all the dental college
seats will be included in this pool that
is
sorry that is if it is GDC Hyderabad
you take one college GDC Hyderabad as an
example if GDC Hyderabad okay in a
particular Department you have a
particular number of seats half of the
seats will be going to all India pool
to make it more comfortable four seats
are there two seats will be in State
Pool two seats will be in all India
these two seats in the all India pool
will be going to this sport so this all
India pool seats will be filled through
the counseling and the second category
of seats which are going to fill through
all India counseling is deemed colleges
so deemed colleges means you know the
deemed colleges like Savita SRM team
called as jss Mysore and all these
deemed colleges seats will be so this
counseling is called as all India
counseling
so first notification that you are going
to get probably is all India counseling
and all India counseling is going to
contend two types of seats type 1 seats
is government Dental College seats that
is 50 percentage of all government
Dental scholarships because 50
percenters will be filled by all India
and 50 percenters will be filled by
State Pool respective state will win the
50 percent receipts and the second type
of seats that are filled by all India
pool is deemed College seats there are
few deemed colleges not all the deemed
colleges there are few deemed colleges
like team College like Savita and all
these like team colleges which are again
going to fill their seats through all
India pool so this counseling is called
as all India counseling and most
probably this is the first counseling
that is going to occur is it clear first
notification preferably is going to be
all India all India two types of seats
are filled by all India one is
government Dental College six second one
is deemed deemed College seats guys are
you clear
I need your response okay so sir uh I
got a rank
can I can I apply for already anyone can
apply for all India who has qualified
but
simply if you come out with rank five
thousand six thousand sir I want a GDC
no not possible okay you can apply but
you will you will not get a seat that is
a waste of time and waste of money
be logical right so most probably I
strongly recommend students okay if you
are from open category doesn't have any
reservation till 500 600 you can apply
all India normally
thousands thousand rank 800 900 also
sometimes I play basing upon their
convenience but strongly probably uh it
never it never crosses 500 for sure okay
so you you're basing upon your
convenience you decide like you you're
coming out with ten thousand ranks I
want to apply all India you can apply
but it's waste of money hundred
percentage you will not get the seat
through all India because all India has
very less number of government Dental
College seats deemed if you're targeting
for deemed College yes 10 000 rank you
can apply you can apply your rank is
eight thousand you will not get a GDC
but you can get a deemed College through
all India and guys the most important
aspect I want to mention about deemed
colleges can you know what is the fees
of attained college
can anyone tell me what is the fees of
deemed College
the minimum phase of redeemed call is
yes it starts from minimum eight lakhs
8 lakhs to 17 lakhs per announce
so check your convenience talk with your
parents if you are financially sound
then you can proceed everyone cannot be
on the same ring right for example my
range is not deemed my range is not even
private college when I was entering into
MDS two to three lakhs is also very
impossible for my family to pay the fees
okay so basing upon your financial
limitations you can play because
what is the rank one college here
what is rank one college in India recent
rank list was released right what is the
rank one call is
yes the Savita comes under all India the
fees is going to be 15 to 17 lakhs per
annum okay so if you want you can go
there but financially you should be
strong in handling the situation right
so this is the first counseling so once
this counseling is started then slowly
individual states okay States for
example your Telangana State your Andhra
State okay your Maharashtra State your
Tamil Nadu State your Kerala set
your Orissa
your up your Bihar West Bengal
okay and all these states all the states
okay all the states all the states are
going to release their individual State
notification okay so your Gemma and
Kashmir right so Jimmy and Kashmir and
all these are going to release their
individual notifications what is this
notification is for this notification is
for the 50 percent is left over gdc's
because 50 percentage they have given
all India pool so they have leftover 50
percentage of seats so this is for the
50 percentage seats then this is again
for the leftover private college seats
so the
seats varies from uh state to state for
example you take Andhra Telangana uh you
you have it two or three category of
seats here the quality of education is
same but uh the category of seats varies
basing upon the Merit of the student the
category of seats varies basing upon the
amount of fees that the student has to
pay for example you take a few States
they have categories like a b c a b c
simple words is a is more Merit
be semi Merit
C is like a management quota the phases
will be less for a category
medium for a b category and it will be
more for a c category similarly like you
take your Karnataka Karnataka also you
have something called as K set seats K
set seats will be of less cost somewhere
around like 2.5 lakhs whereas coming to
the leftover seats will be of more cost
more than six or more than seven or more
than eight lakhs per annum okay you got
a Clarity right so next is individual
state
so as individual state is going to
release a notification every state has a
rules and regulations
so you can come and ask me for example
uh you are from Gemma and Kashmir
and you want to take seat in Telangana
you cannot take any category seat in
Telangana
okay the low cost seats will be only for
the localides for example they are
something called as K set seats in
Karnataka localides
okay so most of the seats in the state
pool will be handled or will be given to
only local it's there are few states
which are going to give seats to the
non-locklets also those States one is
Karnataka second one is Maharashtra
third one is Andhra Pradesh fourth one
is Telangana there are few seats they
are allocating not all the seats and
preferably most of the seeds which are
allocating the uh pool I mean like
non-local seats to other state people
they may not be very good okay they may
not be of good department they may not
be of good college in majority of the
situation according to the reviews of
the students and according to Old
analysis okay so are you clear till this
point about the counseling first
counseling is all India counseling
where 50 percentage of all India pool
seats will be filled
second one the deemed College seats will
be filled then individually your state
is going to release a notification
for that notification you have to apply
first
then your state Merit list will come
your statement at least then your state
Merit list will come sometimes you take
Telangana you take Andhra okay there is
a separate application for a category
and there is a supply separate
application for B category so a category
you have to keep a separate application
and B category and C category together
you have to keep a separate application
these are all things like once the
notification is out probably most of the
information will be shared on your
respective groups there is no need to
worry about it
okay but this is how the state
counseling proceeds so all India
counseling preferably you will have
round one round to round three state
counseling you will have again round one
round two round three for example you
take Telangana I told Telangana Andhra
will have a category separate and B
category separate means a category one
two three rounds will be there P
category one two three rounds will be
there for example all the seats are
filled by second round they'll close it
by second round if it is not filled then
they will push themselves to third round
no
clear friends
I don't know when the
