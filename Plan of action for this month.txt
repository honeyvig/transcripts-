Dias conquer now I'm here to explain few
important things that what we are going
to do for the upcoming one month okay I
hope you know that the new things are
going to start from February 21st okay
so from February 21st our plan is to
cover first of all we'll try to complete
oral histologic which is going to be
seven marks according to the need
blueprint followed by planning to cover
period which is going to be fourteen
marks next course with general an autumn
e which is going to cover fourteen marks
again and last planning to end with
pharmacology not completely few areas of
pharmacology basically my idea is to
cover the dental part of former collagen
and the blueprint says it's going to be
seven marks okay so this is what our
plan is to cover 14 into three marks of
240
okay so coming to the stadium look at
the schedule of MVS Comcast says for the
first few days as already discussed
we'll be covering the oral histologic
which is going to be seven marks out of
14 which combines with the dental
installation okay the first 21st
February the first day the plan is to
cover astrology of enamel and dentin
which is important and well-known the
second February we are planning to cover
development development and growth of
the teeth this development of the
biggest well-known 23rd is given as a
revision day for you and 24th the stuff
is overloaded again we are going to
cover pulp we're going to cover cement
them we're going to power PDF okay so
out of this the cementum and PDL are
again a part of your parry also as the
perio is also included in this week so
cementum and PDL will be a part of
Perrier's so you need to cover this from
two aspects so next comes is 25th
February so you need to cover bone bone
is again a part of perio you need to
cover TMJ you need to cover maxillary
sinus bone is a part of peri oh that is
an older bone whereas TMZ and maxillary
sinus are going to be part of your
channel an ottoman so you need to learn
each and every aspect related to the
anatomy of the TMJ both bony aspects as
well as the muzzle aspect coming to
maxillary sinus all the boundaries and
everything related to maxillary sinus
has to be covered from all aspects
including the histology as well as from
the anatomy point of view so 26 February
we are going to cover salivary glands
histology along with the
celery glands an autumn also what are
the different types of clients major
glands might have lands whether they're
an autumn is located what are the
Associated nerves and everything what
not has to be covered from these aspects
okay the next comes is oral mucous
membrane which is again a part of your
perio as well as your D inch Dental
astrology interior will be covered from
these aspects so the next one is 27th
we're going to cover the tooth eruption
astrology or the mechanism of eruption
and everything you're going to cover
shedding of teeth you're going to cover
some histological stains as well as
slights because recently 2 to 0 to 0
need has clearly pruned that they can
give question at any level so we should
not leave anything and has to be focused
everything ok so this is the plan of
action for the first few days where we
are going to cover complete histology
that is dental history and a part of
perio and a part of an autumn a here and
there in the most comprehensive way what
we can okay so the book of reference is
already known I mean I don't want you to
go with the textbook reading okay but
you can keep the reference book as
either advance or you can keep Dan Cates
as a reference book just a reference I
don't want anyone opening this book
reading full-time covering all the
aspects ok just try to be more smart and
all the individually each topic for
example enamel and dentin how you need
to do where you need to do in which
sequence you have to do will be
discussed on the group as most of you
know that here the preparation will go
in levels ok preferably from level 1 to
11 6 a few few cases it may go from
level 1 to level 5 okay so what you have
to do in level 1 what you have to do in
will do how the group is going to help
you in level 3 and level 4 how the
finishing and polishing of a particular
subject should be done in level 5 and
level 6 will be given on daily basis
okay so a daily basis voice not or a
video based stuff will be posted in
which particular topic has to be done
from which part the level 1 has to be
done from which area level 2 has to be
done from which area and 3 4 5 6 will be
done from which area will be clearly
explained by you by the respective
mentor you know due to worry about that
so once we are done with that so next
level is 28th February okay so the plan
is to cover start with the basics of
pareo that is defense mechanism again
the defense mechanism of the gingiva and
host response so a part of this will be
covered in your microbiology immunity
okay so try to be more focused try to
cover as much as you can and 29th
February so we are planning to cover
calculus ginger white is all these are
very very easy things which are which
you are more familiar with in your final
year and in your internship so we're
going to cover calculus ginger Vitus I
hope you remember the gingival
enlargements okay you have your ginger
well enlargements you will be covering
that you will have a very acute ginger
well infections like uh nag capital
ginger was stomatitis everything will be
covered on this day first match a short
video will be on your microbiology of
Perea will be covered and the second
March the plan is to cover again the
easy aspects that is the para don't--all
pockets
pattern of bone loss next comes is the
trauma from occlusion everything will be
covered third match you can cover
different types of para down Titus will
cover diagnosis and prognosis and the
treatment plan fourth the plan is to
cover the instruments that are used in
the perio and Clark control measurements
from fifth will be more dealing with the
surgical aspects of pareo the fifth we
are going to cover gingiva coming and
charities sixth will be covering the
flaps and mucus gingerol surgeries
seventh will be talking about the
treatment of locations different types
of locations different rates of
locations and treatments and will be
focusing on osseous surgeries the grafts
and everything what is whatnot eight
match a day of revision all your back
locks which are left over due to any
other issues will be covered so we are
done with video so perio the reference
book as you know you can go with
Carranza as a chance not to cover each
and every aspect but what to be done
wait to be done will be clearly given as
a hint and will be guided by the group
don't worry about that okay so the next
ninth we need to start an ottoman as
fast as possible and the toughest one is
brain so we are going to start an autumn
eov brain first which is regularly the
brain will be regularly avoided by most
of the people but it is simple
the examination point of view so next
one is tenth is osteology osteology is
more of diagrams more of four amends
order of four amines which knows which
arteries which vessels which things will
go in each forum in identification of
this foramen and all those things will
be discussed with diagrams in a video
based class so levant match will be
covering an autumn a of thyroid gland
mouth pharynx 12 March will be covering
larynx will be covering tongue
development of tongue and everything
whatnot so the toughest day for you is
going to be 13th March that is going to
be your vascular supply of head and neck
okay followed by 14th March you're going
to cover the muzzle supply of head and
neck and if possible we'll cover the now
supply to of head and neck
so all nose muscles and arteries veins
related to had a knack of very important
an examination point of view 15th March
is left as a day of revision so
according to the need syllabus even the
ear as well as I are a part of the
syllabus okay but most of the books most
of the people they neglect this but I am
not in a position to take any sort of
chance in regulating any topic which is
which a question can come from so eye
and ear will be covered in specific on
16th on the group 17th March is more
often my target is to focus on the
clinical an autumn or it can be called
as applied an autumn
it is a very specific topic okay so most
of these topics will be neglected by
most of the Mendes but we don't want to
take any sort of chance in the
examination hall so will be covered from
all the directions okay so there is a
18th according to the blueprint our plan
is to can cover chemotherapy part one
I'll be discussing what part one will
include 19th March will be chemotheraphy
part to 2020 first will be the revision
days and 22nd much is the exam exam on
dental histology your part of
pharmacology your perio and your chant
Leonardo so these two are going to carry
160 marks so Pharma is going to carry 40
and H is going to carry 40 so this is
going to be 240 marks exam for you so
get prepared for that
so how smart you have to be so the group
what group is going to do the smart work
for you is so all your chemotherapies
for example if I take I mean you can
keep Anatomy you can keep a reference
book reference for anatomy as chaurasiya
whereas the reference for the
pharmacology for now is KD three-party
okay so what smart thing you can do for
example chemotherapy part 1 and part 2
will contain topics like antimicrobial
drugs and tea that include antibacterial
antiviral antifungal and antioxidant i
protozoal drugs would also be covered
mostly focusing on your malaria
you're Taenia solium and you're
entamoeba histolytica okay so what what
group is going to do is group every
three days we are going to release a
video okay one video for first two days
one media will be on pencil ins the
second video will be on tetracyclines
third video will be on cephalosporins
fourth video will be on macro let's 5th
video will be on I may not like I said
so every day you don't need to do the
core work from your side the group is
going to provide you a video of 10 to 15
minutes covering all important and major
things to be focused on a particular
classification similarly anti-viral also
antiretroviral okay all these things
will be covered antifungal also okay
similarly every aspect every
classification will be will be trying to
cover from our side so that can be
revised in eighteenth and nineteenth
means the pharmacology will have an
incremental reading so apart from the
regular schedule this is the schedule
that is prepared by five or six members
together sitting but what my ideology my
suggestion for you is will do
pharmacology an incremental way means
every two or three days of this 30 days
plan every two or three days we'll be
posting one classification one small
video related to that so we'll have 10
videos and pharmacology where the major
stuff related to the chemotherapy part 1
and part 2 will be covered in prayer
means you can keep all these 5 days for
revision because we will be covering all
these incremental every day so what are
exclusive things that you have to do is
try to be more focus try to follow the
instructions that are given by the
Mantis on the group and try to be on
time for everything ok so that's what
the plan of action for the upcoming 30
or 32 days ok so try to use the things
at your best ok both the video based
discussions as well as the regular
normal mode of discussions and the notes
is exchanged on the group and the
regular examinations whatever the
examinations that is being posted on the
group please try to do everything
