hello and welcome to this session of
operator overloading in python
today we're gonna talk about this
concept and how it is being implemented
in python
this concept is not new in any
programming language it is a pretty
common concept in languages like c plus
class and java
but today we will focus on how you can
perform operator overloading in python
so what's in it for us today
what we will understand what is operator
overloading and how to overload the
operators in python we will perform
these activities in the jupyter notebook
now what is operator overloading
python operators work for built-in
classes in a predefined operational way
but the same operator behaves
differently for objects of different
classes
so you can make the operator work
differently
bases the requirement you have and the
objects you have defined
so for example the plus operator which
is the most commonly used operator will
perform arithmetic addition on two
numbers or it can merge to less
or if performed on two strings it
concatenates the two strings so it means
the programming language automatically
understands that in which context you
are using the plus operator
this feature in python that allows the
same operator to have different meanings
according to the context according to
the objects
which are calling it or according to the
data types which are being used in that
operator it is called as operator
overloading
so if you see in this example 8 and 7
are the operands and the plus sign is
the operator sign
so that is the whole goal of this whole
exercise that we will show you how you
can change
the meaning of the plus operator
depending on the kind of objects or kind
of operands you are using along with it
now how to overload the operators in
python
consider we have two objects b1 and b2
of a class batchman
now we must add these objects with a
binary plus operator
so now the task in hand is that we use
the plus operator to add objects which
is not possible until and unless we
overload this operator
otherwise it will throw an error because
the compiler does not know how to add to
objects it only knows how to add
primitive data types like in strings etc
so basically we will define a method
for an operator that process and that
process is called operator overloading
so in the example which we will be
showing you we will be taking two
objects of batsman one and batsman two
and we will be using two scores per
patchmen
and then we will add them so we will
discuss that in the examples we will
show you
now
we can overload all the defined
operators so there's no limitation
addition subtraction multiplication
division
greater than less than so there are
certain magic methods or we can call it
as the primitive methods or special
functions that are automatically invoked
when an associated path operator is
being called
so basically if you have to do the
operator overloading you basically have
to override these methods in your python
program and that's how you will be able
to
override or overload the primitive
implementations of these functions
written in the compiler of python
so
let's see here in our example right for
example when we use the plus operator
the magic method underscore underscore
add underscore underscore is
automatically invoked
in which the operation for the plus
operator is defined
now we are overloading it and in the
example you can see
we are adding
the
first score of each batchman right so we
have customized the addition function
we are adding the first score of the
first placement with the first score of
the second batchman and then we are
printing the total so in our case we are
adding
and printing the first one 66 plus 23
and if you print b3 dot s2 you will see
the sum total of 78 plus 59 so the thing
to be noted is this function add
function where you are adding self dot
s1 plus second dot s1
and you are adding s self dot s2 plus
second dot s2 and that is the whole
customization what you have done in
order to add two objects of patch now
let's take a look at some of the
examples of operator overloading we have
just discussed
so we will be executing some examples in
our jupiter notebook
now
what i'm going to show you
is about class batsman which we
discussed in the presentation
and i'm going to define the init
function
and
initialize
score 1 and score two of the patchmen
now
i'm gonna override
the magic function add
and
add the score 1 and score 2
of the batsman separately
now with this over
operator overloading
when i will pass
object for edition then only now
my object will understand that it has to
add
score one
of first batsman with the score one of
second batsman
and score two of first batsman with the
source core two of the second batsman so
we'll see how
so what we are doing is
one in the add
operator
we are adding these codes
encapsulating in a new object batchman
and then returning the object b3
now let's create
object b1
batchman1 and batchman 2.
now i am
adding two objects batsman one and
batchman two
now without operator overloading if
would i would not have done operator
overloading of add then this would have
failed because plus operator does not
understand the object's batchman but
with overloading done
now i can independently print
the score of
the new batsmen the batsman's the b3
object
sum of score one of batsman one and
uh score one of batsman two which is 66
plus 23.
okay
so now let's take an example of a simple
operator function
like for example i am going to
simply create a variable a with value 44
and variable b with 7
and
print a plus b and if i run this
this is the expected output
python plus operator knows that a and b
are primitive int variables so it's able
to add that
now behind the scenes when we printed a
plus b
actually this is what happened
in
primitive in variables add operator
overloaded method got called
and a and b got passed and 51 was
calculated
so it's automatically done because this
function is implicitly written in the
python language
similarly
i can also do this thing i can create a
int variable
and a float variable
and if i try to print it
i will get the expected output which is
50.5 because the plus operator accepts
the end and a float variable its
implicitly written so that is also
allowed
now let us take another example of
string operators
string variables
addition
now irrespective of my
i'm giving numerical values in the
string print a plus b
in string
is is meant to do concatenation so
446.5 it's a simple string concatenation
what python has done
and implicitly
python is invoking
the string
method
add operator overloaded which is
overloaded and invoking it
now i would like to show you like
suppose for example i do an addition
between an end and a string variable
right and i say
print a plus b
now this operation is not permissible i
will get an error because ideally with
the plus operator either i can say in
int float
or string string intense string is not
allowed because it's mathematically or
functionally doesn't make any sense
that's not how the way the python plus
operator has been overloaded
now
let's try
other operations on objects
let's create a class person
and i'll create a init
function to initialize
height and weight
okay
now
print 8 means it's just printing the
primitive data type
now i want to
print an object of
class person
now as i have not overridden the string
magic function python will not
understand what to print so it will only
print the
object it will it is printing the person
object which definitely
uh you can't uh figure any sense make
out any sense out of it but as we have
not overridden
the str function the magic function
that's why python is printing the object
now in order to
print a meaningful output
what i have to do is
in this class only
i can override the str magic function
correct
and i just have to say format self dot
height and weight so now when i will run
this
see
instead of object now the output is 5.5
comma 62 which are the input parameters
which i sent in this object so if you
remove this
you get the object print and if you add
this
you get the actual meaningful output and
that is the purpose of overloading
now let's take another example
we are creating a class jaguar
defining the init method
and overriding the subtract
function
okay
then i am
making another class audi
and
writing the init function
now let's create an object of jaguar
and
body
now if i
do a print call
x minus y
it will invoke the
subtract
function of the jaguar class because
it's the first variable
and it's going to subtract the mileage
of jaguar minus the mileage of rd
and that's how you're getting the output
three so ultimately in this scenario the
subtract function
of jaguar got called
it took the variable value of 18
and 15 which is is x and y
and that did the operation
similarly
i will now overwrite the greater than
function
for
checking who has a greater mileage
jaguar or
audi
so i'll overwrite the init function
then now i'm gonna overwrite the
greater than function
take values in a variable and
write the condition
if x 1 is greater than 1 y 1 then return
true
else
return false
okay so i have overridden the greater
than function jt function
and i'll close again create my class
audi
define the init
okay
initialize the variables like i did
earlier in a similar fashion create
objects
jaguar and audi
now i am going to perform the check of
whether the object of jaguar which is
mileage check is greater than
audio or not
and as i have initialized the variables
of jaguar with 18 mileage and audi with
15
my expected output should be the jaguar
mileage is
greater and that's what it is now
this has been only possible because i
have over written the gt
uh method in the jaguar class
so i think this
might have been a good learning
exercises for you and
you are able to understand the concepts
of operator overloading
i hope you had a great learning session
and i'll see to you next time thank you
