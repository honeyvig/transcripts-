hello everyone so in this presentation I
will be explaining about the anterior
part of the permanent dentition which
includes incisors and canines so in the
recent Nate examination they have urged
a diagram based question so giving some
aspect of the tooth that is either
labial lingual missile or distal and
asking you to find out the tooth so you
need to know some characteristic
features of the truth and distinguishing
features which differentiates between
the two teeth so human dentition is of
three types they are termed as petty
rodent the codon and die few don't so
what does hetero don't mean so Haiti
Road aunt the name itself suggests Haiti
row it is different types so human
dentition is of four types that is
incisors canines molars and premolars
and three codn't which suggests the
tooth is embedded in a socket and a few
don't is having two sets of teeth that
is primary dentition and permanent
dentition so human dentition comes under
the following Hetty rodent T couldn't
and I feel daunted moving on to the
permanent tooth eruption sequence here
you can see the maxillary tooth eruption
and my neighbor to the option are
different so in maxilla the tooth
eruption follows this sequence that is
the first molar followed by the
maxillary central then the maxillary
lateral and maxillary first premolars
maxillary second premolar maxillary
canine maxillary second molar and
migrated third molar that is six one two
four five three seven eight
whereas in mandibular the sequence is a
little bit changed that is six one two
three four five seven eight
so please note this eruption sequence in
maxillary and mandibular dentition
moving on to the tooth that is
the incisors are four in number so we'll
start with the maxilla so maxillary has
two types of in so that is central
incisor and lateral incisor so starting
with the maxillary central incisor this
is the labial view or facial view so
these points are the characteristic
features of maxillary central incisor
so maxillary central incisor is the
widest of all the anterior teeth means
you're distantly so this is the
important point regarding labial aspect
of maxillary central incisor so it is
the widest means your distally of any
anterior tooth and the crests of
curvature mesial in distantly this is
the Christus of curvature represents the
contact area so in this diagram you can
see the mesial outline is slightly
convex there as the digital outline is
more convex when compared to the mesial
outline whereas the very very important
point is the mesial means your incision
angle so means your incident angle of
maxillary central incisor is sharp
whereas destoy is in sense as an angle
is rounded and moving on to the root
part the root is cone-shaped with a
blunt of X so it is cone shape and
having a blunt epoch it's not a pointer
topics it has a blunt topics and the
line drawn through the center of root
and chrome so when the line is drawn
through the center of root and Crown it
is parallel to the mesial outline so it
is almost parallel to the mesial outline
so these are the characteristic features
of labial aspect of maxillary central so
remember the one point it is the widest
means your distally of any anterior
tooth that is the important point so in
all the anterior to that is central
lateral and canine so widest means
you're digitally is maxillary central so
the lingual aspect you have to remember
three important points that is the
cingulum
margin ridge and lingual frozen so
cingulum is nothing but a smooth
convexity which is present on the
lingual side and the marginal Ridge are
Meisel and distally present near the
cingulum and between the marginal Ridge
there is a concavity called as lingual
fossa
so these three are important in finding
out the difference between the central
and lateral which will come across later
so in lingual aspect you need to
concentrate on the cingulum marginal
Ridge and the lingual fossa so moving on
to the Meisel aspect of maxillary
central the important point as soon as
you see is the cervical length so the
cervical line the greatest curvature of
any tooth is maxillary central so the
mesial cervical curvature is greater on
maxillary central than any other tooth
in the mouth so remember that
so the distal aspect is slightly
different from the mesial aspect you can
see when looking the central incisor
from the distal aspect it might be noted
that the digital aspect is somewhat
thicker when compared to the Meisel
aspect so thicker because the slope of
the labial surface is destroying only
present so more of the surface is seen
from the distal aspect because of that
it is an illusion that distance her face
that is digital crown is seen thicker
when when compared with the mesial
aspect crown so when you know these
features of Magdala central incisor so
it is easy to distinguish between
maxillary central and lateral so here it
is a diagram distributing distinguishing
between the two teeth here what
differences can you find is the crown
part the labial part you as I already
told you mesial in salina angle is sharp
in maxillary central whereas in nicely
relation you can see both the mesial and
the distances are line angles are
rounded so that is the main
characteristic feature between the two
teeth the only difference between ivory
central and lateral is except the root
length everything in Masergy lateral is
in smaller dimension so I will repeat it
once again the maxillary central is
larger than the margin maxillary lateral
in all aspects except the root length so
only the root length is high or long
when compared with between these two
teeth so one more difference you can see
in these diagrams is the incisal view so
when you see the in sessile view the
maxillary central is more flatter or not
much convex when compared to the nicely
little
so nicely the central is less convex
then the miserly lateral and canine
which gives the central incisor a square
or rectangular appearance so it has a
square or rectangular appearance because
of the less convexity on the labial
surface whereas the convexity on the
labial surface on the maxillary lateral
is much more pronounced and look at the
cingulum area so the cingulum area also
is more pronounced on the magazine
lateral when compared with the maxillary
central so these are the main
differences between maxillary central
and lateral the main difference is the
mesial means you're inside the line
Angley sharp in maxillary central
whereas both means yo and disjoint so
the line angles are rounded in lateral
except for the route length the
maxillary lateral is smaller in every
dimension and one more important thing
is the route is blunt and cone shape
whereas it is sharp and pointed in
maxillary lateral and slightly distally
curved here you can see the route is
straight whereas in my very little that
route is slightly curved distantly so
that is the main difference when you
talk about maxilla later you need to
talk about the variations it has so the
variations in the Maggie lateral is very
very important so the variations are it
is peg shaped with a thin root and small
clinical ground and the magazine lateral
incisor may be congenitally missing so
these are the features which differs it
from the maxillary central apart from
the third molars
so these nice rarity laterals show that
variations much more soap egg-shaped
lateral and congenitally missing and the
third one is developmental groove on the
digital aspect extending onto the root
that is also called as palate or
gingerol groove so palate or general
groove
and in Idol amazing and big shape
littles other variations of the
maxillary lateral do so moving on to the
summary of the maxillary central and
lateral incisor in different aspects you
can see the labial aspect the crown is
longer and wider misery sternly
so I told you this meas your distantly
wider of any anterior tooth highest is
maxillary central incisor so whereas the
maxillary lateral is the crown is
shorter and narrower the only superior
feature or the highest feature in
maxillary lateral incisor is the root
length when compared to the central
insula the root length is longer than
the central and a second difference is
the mesial outline is slightly convex
with sharp Amis your insulin angle
whereas the mesial Outland is acute and
more rounded when compared to the
central incisor so distant outline is
more convex than means allowed clear in
central incisor and the crest of
curvature is closer to the Mason middle
third
whereas in ladle insider' the distal
outline is rounded and the curvature is
at the center of the middle third the
root is shorter with cone shaped and
bland topics in central incisor whereas
the root is longer with pointed epics
and distantly curved so remember this
important point whereas from mesial
aspect you can see the crown is wider
labeling early with a pronounced
curvature of cervical am so I've told
you the cervical line which is seen in
the medial side has a creator curvature
of any other tooth on the missile aspect
whereas in later Lynn says if the crown
is narrower labeling only with the
curvature of the cervical
less pronounced the digital aspect has
no developmental groove which is
extending onto the root whereas in the
lateral incisors
you can see a developmental groove which
extends from the side of cingulum from
the distal said to the palatal that is
palliative general group
and from the lingual aspects the central
incisor has well-defined lingual
features whereas as I told you the prom
there is prominent cingulum and more
concavity of the lingual fossa
so moving on to the mandibular incisors
so now we are done with the maxillary
central and the Mies resonator and the
distinguishing features between them so
mandibular Central's and mandibular
laterals so the only main difference is
the size as you can see the mandibular
centrioles are the smallest teeth in the
dental arch so the mesial distal
diameter of mandibular central is less
than half of the mesial distal diameter
of the maxillary central so that small
it is so the mandibular central
important point to be noted is the
smallest tooth in the dental arch and
mandibular lateral when compared with
the mandibular central is larger in
every dimension so mandibular lateral is
larger when compared with the mandibular
central so the main difference you need
to find or you need to distinguish
between the mandibular central and
lateral is the incisal aspect so this is
the inside and aspect watch it closely
the inside aspect when you draw a line
labial lingually so it exactly by six at
perpendicular line so the mesial distal
so the mesial distal line is exactly at
the right angle to the line r on
labeling with it whereas for mandibular
central that is not the point
so
this is not exactly a right angle the
reason why is the crown is a little bit
twisted on its a root base so this is
the main distinction distinguishing
feature between mandible our central and
later when given a diagram description
so to identify which is central or
lateral so please keep in your mind that
mandibular central when a line drawn
bisecting labia lingually it is exactly
at a right angle to the major digital
line but whereas mandibular lateral it
is not at 90 degree because the crown is
slightly twisted on its root base so it
is a main distinguishing feature between
the mandibular central and lateral so
these are the few distinguishing
features between central mandibular
central and lateral incisors so the
symmetry so the crown is symmetrical
bilaterally in central incisor whereas
it is a symmetrical in lateral incisor
so I told you Mesa and say the line
angle is sharp that is 90 degrees it is
somewhat not rounding in later on in
silver and the digital insulin angle is
also sharp at 90 degrees which is more
rounded in lateral insula so these are
the labial aspects so it is symmetry by
symmetrical bilaterally both means
you're in sizzle and disjoints is a line
angle such sharp in central incisor
mandibular central whereas both me CO
and this join so the line angles are
rounded in the trenches similar to the
maxillary so in maxillary central I have
told you only means your insulin angle
is sharp whereas differential an angle
is rounded whereas both are sharken
mandibular central so the contact area
is in cell third for both central and
lateral incisor and the inside aspect as
I told you the in cell Ridge forms a
right angle with a labial lingual
bisecting line whereas in cell angle is
italy twisted on the crown in lateral
incisor
so here are the some more ways to
distinguish between man declare little
from the central so the lateral is
larger overall as I told you maxillary
mandibular central is the smallest tooth
in the crown in the dental arch the
lateral is not as bilaterally
symmetrical as the central so central
incisor as I told you it is bilaterally
symmetrical and smaller when compared to
the mandible and later and the single 'm
on the lateral incisor that is
mandibular little is slightly distal to
the center of the tooth whereas in
mandibular central it is located at the
center of the tooth single so on the
lateral incisor the mesial marginal
Ridge is longer than the distal marginal
Ridge whereas it is at the same level in
mandibular Center and the distal
proximal contacts are more apical on the
lateral incisor whereas it is the
contacts are on the same level on the
both sides both mesial and distal on the
mandible are central and the last but
not least disjoint cell line angles are
more rounded than the measurements in
the line angle in the lateral incisor
whereas in the mandibular central both
the incident line angles are sharp so
these are the other ways to distinguish
between mandibular central and the
lateral incisor
so moving on to the cannons so whenever
we talk about cannons you need to know
one thing
so there are totally four cannons to
maxillary and to mandibular these
cannons are placed at the corners of the
mouth so these are commonly referred to
as cornerstone of the dental arch so
this is an important point to be noted
so cannons are considered as the
cornerstone of the dental arches so
because of the labial lingual thickness
of the crown as you can see in the
diagram labial lingual thickness of the
crown and root of both the cannon that
is maxilla or mandible is very thick so
the thickness is high so because of this
labeling well thickness of crown and
root and the anchorage in the earlier
process of the jaws these canines are
considered as the most stable tooth in
the dental arch so apart from the
cornerstone they are considered as the
most stable tooth and they're the law
last tooth to be lost in the human mouth
so the reason is because of the labeling
well thickness of the crown and root and
the anchorage in the annular process of
the job so when we talk about maxillary
canine and mandibular canal one thing is
always confusing is which is the longest
tooth so please go with my slurry canal
so maxillary cannon is the longest tooth
in the dental arch in the human
dentition so mandibular cannon the crown
appears to be longer which is an
illusion because of the less means your
distal thickness the dimension of mesial
distal is less which makes an illusion
that crown appears to be longer or
sometimes it is longer
whereas if both of the cannons are given
in the options go with them hogs Erica
so maxillary cannon is the longest tooth
in the human dentition so the main
aspects of the label aspect of the max
attack enemies there is just the mesial
and the distal ridges so always remember
the mesial Ridge is shorter when
compared to the distal Ridge so mesial
slope is shorter when compared to the
digital slope in both magnetic canine
and the mandibular canals so which by
which you can tell whether it is right
said cannon or the left-side cannon so
mesial slope is shorter when compared to
the digital slope so when talking about
the lingual said so the cingulum and
there are two lingual forces and there
is a lingual Ridge in the centre so
normally in 90s you saw only one lingual
fossa that is in incisors on the lingual
side whereas in the canine you can see a
lingual Ridge in the center and two
lingual foes us on the either side so
moving on to the differences between
maxilla Canyon and mandibular canal so
this slide tells you the main
differences between the two canines so
the mandibular canine is narrower
labeling only and miss additionally then
Magdelena so this is in comparison with
the magnetic inner so when you compare
maxilla the canine with mandible canine
mandibular cannon is narrower labia
lingually and means you're distally when
compared to the knives of the killer so
magnetic inin is wider labeling well en
means you're distally so when you talk
about the crown the labial surface of
the mandibular cannon is smooth and
convex and the label Ridge is not as
prominent as
magnetic anemia so the labial Ridge
which is present at the center is not as
prominent as my silicon I'm in
mandibular cannon so the greatest fascia
lingual measurement is greater than the
greatest measure digital measurement and
when you talk about the tooth root there
is only one root mostly in both
maxillary and mandibular cannon but
there is one variation that you have to
know the same way that you have learnt
about maxillary ladle which has many
variations like peg shaped lateral
missing tooth or congenitally missing or
peritoneal groove the mandibular cannon
root may be bifurcated so this is very
very important when you compare both
maxillary and mandibular canal mags
mandibular cannon has a chance of having
bifurcated root so there is a
developmental depression on the mesial
root surface on the mandibular canal
which is more prominent but in the
maxillary canine there is deeper digital
developmental depression so that is the
difference in mandibular cannon there is
prominent mesial developmental
depression on the root whereas in the
maxillary canaan there is pronounced
digital developmental depression on the
root and the important point is the cusp
tip is displaced lingually so when
you draw a line straight to the axis of
the tooth the cusper tip is present
lingual to it so that is the important
point
so the cusps tip is displaced lingually
in mandibular canine but not in
maxillary canal when you talk about the
surfaces the mesial surface of the crown
is all may almost parallel so this is
also a main difference from magnetic
Union and mandibular carrion so the
mesial surface is almost parallel to the
long axis of the tooth it's not like
this in mags Larry cannon so the mesial
outline is almost straight line and when
you talk about the cingulum between
maxillary and mandibular cannon man
Dibner canine cingulum is less bulky and
less prominent then magic in it
and the last point is the mandibular
cannon appears more slender and smoother
than the magazine canine in all aspects
so the label and lingual ridges are less
developed when compared to magazine
current so because of this it allows
them to be very caries resistant so
these are the main differences between
the maxillary and mandibular canine one
is the maxillary cannon is the longest
tooth in the arch and pronounced labial
and cingulum is present is in maxillary
canine whereas bifurcated roots are more
common in mandibular canine and Mesa
mesial angle that is mesial surface of
the mandibular canine is almost a
straight line and is parallel to the
long axis of the tooth and the cusps tip
is placed the cusp deep is pledged
lingual to the long axis of the tooth
and here also the mesial
slope is shorter when compared the
digitalgov slope which is similar to the
maxillary cannon so these are the
differences between maxillary and
mandibular canal they're short note on
the cingulum and it's situation so
cingulum is present in the anterior
tooth here you can see it is divided
into two which is when presented the
center of the lingual surface and when
presented the off-center to the center
that is two less little bit towards the
digital surface so single 'm the teeth
which are having the cingulum at the
center of the lingual surface are
maxillary lateral maxillary canine and
mandibular central whereas a single 'm
present off-center to the distal that is
little bit away from the center of the
tooth is maxillary central mandibular
lateral and mandibular canal
so please note this point
so moving on to the contact areas of all
these teeth so contact areas for
anterior teeth are different so here it
is denoted with the two letter word that
is IJ JM + JM or I I and I am so the
first letter in these two letters
denotes the mesial surface the mesial
contact area and the second letter
denotes the digital contact area so for
example maxillary central maxillary
central has mesial contact area in size
early whereas the digital contact area
is represented with J that means it is
located at the junction of insulin
middle third so i represents the mesial
contact that is in cell third and J
represents the digital contact that is
junction of insulin within thirds the
same way with all the two so this is
when seen from the labial view so
remember although the mesial and digital
context of the mandibular lateral are in
incisal third both are denoted as III
the distal contact is slightly cervical
when compared to the mesial contact so
both are inside L only but when you see
in a microscopic level the distal
contact is slightly cervical to the
mesial contact whereas on the mandibular
central even though it is both are same
they are located at the same level on
the center but in this both are in size
only but digital is digital contact is
slightly apical
thank you all we'll come up with the
other video regarding posterior
permanent dentition thank you
