cut across live to these pictures coming
in from Kazan in Russia the prime
minister's aircraft has landed he's all
set to attend that crucial brick Summit
All Eyes though however on the prime
minister's meet that is likely with the
Chinese Premier but look at these
pictures coming in from Kazan of course
a lot of excitement the Indian diaspora
gathered for the prime minister's
arrival something that is becoming a
recurring feature of the prime
minister's crucial visit in fact what
you see on the right hand side of his
screen are pictures of the state set for
that crucial brick Summit this is the
extended bricks that is meeting in
Russia various new members added
including of course Iran which is why
the focus is likely to be on the ongoing
conflicts both in Ukraine as well as
what's happening in West Asia uh
remember last time the Prime Minister
was in Russia he reiterated the point he
has made several times that this is not
the era of war and that there will be no
solutions that will be found on the
battlefield so the wars are going to be
an important topic of discussion as far
as the bricks is concerned but certainly
right now the focus is on the meat that
is likely between Prime Minister Modi
and the Chinese Premier this comes just
a day after India also talked of
disengagement and announced that some
sort of consensus has been reached as
far as the uh border dispute is
concerned and perhaps uh you know it's
now almost as if uh the the road is Cle
clear for some sort of a greater
deescalation remember the Border
situation has been pretty concerning
after the May 2020 Galvan clashes after
that both India and China have taken
several pot shots at each other but as
the Army Chief puts it now the focus is
on restoring and rebuilding trust so
India really sort of striking a
conciliatory note as many would say as
far as China is concerned which is why
the Optics of the prime ministers likely
meet with the Chinese premier become so
crucial uh in the backdrop of the Indo
Chinese deescalation along the line of
actual control but uh let's focus now on
uh all these pictures coming in from uh
Russia from Kazan the Prime Minister
second visit to Russia in just 3 months
and this is going to be crucial in more
ways than one there are several other
bilaterals that are also lined up on the
sidelines of the uh brick Summit and
this is very much a bilateral as well as
a multilateral visit in fact that's
something that India has emphasized time
and again that we need to look at
multilateralism we need to look at
taking the smaller players on board as
well uh India of course has championed
the cause of the global South that is
something that has been the big Focus as
far as the prime minister's diplomatic
Outreach is concerned and also the
neighborhood first policy and it's in
that backdrop as well that India is
looking to strike some sort of a
conciliatory note with China this is the
16th brick Summit that we are talking
about and on the sidelines this crucial
bilateral meeting will be held in fact
let's go to those live pictures of uh uh
the prime minister's aircraft that just
uh uh that just landed okay the Prime
Minister has landed these are live
pictures coming in so uh rather
ceremonial welcome there for the Prime
Minister the Indian ambassador to Russia
present there as well and various top
officials all of them present there to
meet the Prime Minister this is the
prime minister's second visit so he has
landed uh he will be attending that
brick Summit but as I said key
bilaterals also lined up uh but he will
meet the diaspora shortly is my is what
my sense is because that has been the
sort of uh schedule that the Prime
Minister has been following as far as
his visits abroad are concerned as soon
as he lands um and after that ceremonial
welcome he usually goes straight to meet
all those members of the Indian diaspora
uh perhaps they were waiting outside the
airport is what my sense is and he will
be meeting them uh shortly as well uh
but these are live pictures coming in a
lot of diplomatic undertones key
diplomatic undertones that we need to
decode of course the focus on China a
FOC the focus on the likely meet with
the Chinese Premier a major breakthrough
as many would call it a major diplomatic
breakthrough but look at these colorful
pictures so you know it's it's a lot
also about color it's a lot also about
the diaspora enthus I ASM every time the
prime ministers go the Prime Minister
goes abroad but a ceremonial welcome
certainly there for the prime minister
in Russia last time around just a couple
of months back when the Prime Minister
was in Russia uh the focus was on his
bilateral with Putin um and you know how
he emphasized the fact that this is not
a time for war and that we need to look
beyond the battlefield that's what the
Prime Minister had said back then this
time around as well I'm sure the
conflicts will be uh brought up as far
as the discussions in the bricks Summit
is are concerned given the fact that
Iran is also now a member of uh the
bricks an extended uh bricks that we are
talking about uh so both the conflicts
are likely to be brought up as far as
the conversation around the bricks uh is
concerned of course many had written off
bricks as an irrelevant organization but
there has been a regrouping as many
would call it uh a Reformation of this
entire formation which is why this
becomes so crucial but my colleague
kadini is in Kazan and she sent us this
report from
there uh this time this is an expanded
bricks first brick Summit where five
other nations who have joined recently
uh during this year they would also be
participating so it is uh a big chunk of
world's GDP and population which is
being represented here in uh brick
Summit this is also a time where uh
President Putin who who has uh who has
uh who has an opportunity to show that
he is not isolated as the West would
like to uh portray so uh there are many
many uh uh factors which would be taking
place here there would be bilaterals
between several leaders also PM Modi
would be uh doing the several bilaterals
one or two or most probably three might
be slated for today with the Russian
president as well as the head of the
state of Egypt and there might be more
but of course Indian diaspora would be
welcoming him first when he comes here
the preparations are on for that and
India and Russia bilateral would also uh
Encompass the whole gamut of
relationship as well as the focus which
would be uh mainly energy security and
uh the economic relations so coming here
uh in Kazan is uh a big brick Summit a
message to rest of the World by
President Putin and for other leaders uh
an economic block which is going to
prove very very important in Kazan
Russia kadamani Sharma for
NTV and looking now at the other major
development and that is the India China
disengagement that becomes crucial in
the backdrop of the prime minister's
visit to Russia as well given the fact
that he is expected to meet the Chinese
Premier there and now the Army Chief has
also uh spoken out on the India China
disengagement Paving the way for some
sort of Greater deescalation the Army
Chief says that we are focusing on
rebuilding trust and restoring trust and
that is so critical given the fact that
there have been uh you know various
setbacks for India as far as the
neighborhood is concerned of course what
happened in Bangladesh with Maldives of
course initially yes uh with the
election of a supposedly pro-china
president but his uh policy Vis A India
has also changed dramatically in the
past 6 months he visited India uh just a
couple of weeks back in fact and um he
also emphasized uh you know Maldives
close relations with India and how
important they are but despite that
there have been setbacks and they cannot
be ignored the challenges cannot be
ignored the growing Chinese footprint
perhaps cannot be ignored as well which
is why India perhaps striking a
conciliatory note as far as China is
concerned um India has minced no words
at all when it comes to uh you know
China or Pakistan for that matter uh but
accommodation and rebuilding and
restoring trust is extremely important
and perhaps if you look at the larger
picture of the brick Summit this is the
message that is being sent out India uh
batting for the global South yes but
India also looking to rebuild trust in
an extremely uncertain time as far as
geopolitics is concerned uh there is a
new geopolitical reality for sure given
the fact that new governments have risen
across the world conflicts are underway
whether it's what's happening in West
Asia or the Ukraine war a war that the
world seemed to have lost interest in
but it's still causing as much
destruction as it was perhaps 6 months
ago which is why his visit to Russia
becomes so critical last time uh the
Prime Minister was in Russia you know he
also met the Ukrainian president shortly
after in Ukraine uh so you know India's
role as a peacemaker also becomes
important and you know those Optics also
perhaps we need to understand the prime
minister's meeting with Putin the prime
minister's meeting with uh zilinski and
how India is perhaps in pole position to
talk about peace to talk about Global
Peace Global Harmony uh so that is
extremely critical but look at these
pictures a ceremonial welcome there for
Prime Minister Modi certainly India's
moment in the spot light as many would
say um and and a quintessential Russian
welcome for uh the Prime Minister there
in Kazan um and in the backdrop of so
many developments geopolitically of
course two active conflicts in which
India has been very clear that we have
to look at Solutions outside the
battlefield and of course the other big
diplomatic development which has been
the India China disengagement
bid meanwhile external Affairs min
Minister SJ Shanker at the NTV World
Summit also spoke a great deal about uh
you know the disengagement talks he said
that well this could pave the way for uh
greater deescalation and that uh this
comes right ahead of the prime
minister's likely meet with G which is
why it's diplomatically so important
take a look what foreign secretary has
said is what I can also say that uh for
those who have not heard that that uh we
reached an agreement ment on petring uh
and uh with that uh the uh
disengagement uh that you know we have
gone back to where the situation was in
2020 and we can say with that the
disengagement uh process with China uh
uh you can say has been completed so uh
so far I would say uh that's as much as
I can share with you I'm sure in you
know due course details so will now
India be able to patrol in the areas of
galwan di
song no uh uh you see uh there would be
there there are areas uh which uh for
various reasons after 2020 because they
had blocked us so we had blocked
them you know Bob so what has happened
is we have reached an understanding
which will allow the patrolling you for
example you spoke about de that's not
the only place there are other places
also so I think uh the understanding to
my uh knowledge is that we will be able
to do the petring which we were doing in
2020 line there J Shankar saying that
we've gone back to a pre Galvan
situation as far as China is concerned
but let me go across live to kadini
Sharma joining us live from Kazan so
kadini the Prime Minister has landed
there what's expected what's on schedule
of course all eyes on the likely meeting
with the Chinese
premier of course VI the PM is landed
here he'll be accorded the welcome he
was accorded the welcome according to
protocol on the uh on the TK apart from
that he'll be reaching the hotel soon
where the Indian Community as well as
some Russians who are closely associated
with India they'll be performing there
they are the artists who will be
performing there uh but also there would
be important bilaterals today we know
that the Summit is uh tomorrow on 23rd
but the uh all eyes on uh the bilaterals
which are taking place now one bilateral
is already uh happening that is with
President Putin here the another one
which all are expecting after
yesterday's announcement about H in
relationship between India and China and
the patroling rights agreements between
India and China after 4 years years so
that would be something which is being
expected and very very much possible the
meeting the bilateral meeting with the
Chinese president Shi Jinping so let's
see what time it does take place because
it hasn't been announced yet or or there
are no indications about that but there
is a very very strong possibility that
that bilateral might
happen other bilateral which my sources
are telling me are that with the
Egyptian head of state and that is also
going to take place today so there are
at least three bilaterals which will
happen now as far as brics is concerned
we know that this bricks is the one
where uh the recent the uh newest
members of bricks who have joined in
2024 they'll be formally welcome now
with them joining bricks it is it has
become a very strong economic power as
well and uh this the team of this bricks
is bricks and Global south building the
future of the world together as well as
strengthening multil ISM for Equitable
Global development and security so these
themes are in itself they give away what
exactly this bit is about so it would
also be a message
to the rest of the world the Western
World especially which President Putin
would like to give is that in spite of
the claims of isolation of Russia Russia
is not isolated because more than 24
heads of states are visiting here for
Brick Summit that is not isolation more
than 32 countries delegations here that
two that two is not not an isolation the
state of isolation so this Rak is
important in many ways we also have to
see what comes out of the meeting
between PM Modi and President Putin
because in in the meantime when PM Modi
had met President Putin last time he has
also met the American president as well
as the Ukrainian president so we'll have
to see what comes out on that as well
yesterday when I have talked to the
ambassador of India to Russia Excellency
Bay Kumar he had also said that there
would be issues like Global issues would
be discussed Regional issues will be
discussed so this is a whole gamut of
issues and the relationships which are
going to be uh discussed between
President Putin and PM Modi but of
course as you have said the All Eyes
would be on if a meeting takes place
between PM Modi and the Chinese
president shijin ping absolutely the
focus very much on that crucial Modi G
meet but kadini also India's role as a
global Peacemaker the Optics of the
prime minister's visit to Russia his
second in just 3 months that's also
extremely crucial India has you know
said often the prime minister reiterated
that Solutions need to be found outside
the battlefield do you expect both the
wars to be brought up in that crucial
bricks Summit as
well well usually what happens is that
bilateral issues are not discussed in
the multilateral Forum but if the
bilaterals are happening and especially
a bilateral with President Putin is
happening after he has uh met uh when he
met him last time and then of course he
met the president uh of us and the
Ukrainian president so we will of course
see something coming out of it whether
whether this uh this Peacemaker uh
effort your peace making effort is going
to pay up is difficult to say but we
have also seen how President Putin has
said that Brazil and India can be can be
uh ambassadors of peace and uh they can
be mediators but is the situation right
for that kind of pieace to come about
it's almost 3 years is uh this Ukraine
Russia War has started so we will have
to see what comes out of it of course
India has been trying its best in trying
to play The Peacemaker trying to talk to
all the parties we know that
conversations have happened but whether
uh something positive comes out of it is
still to be seen but of course the
effort is very important and that is
recognized not only by Russia but of
course other countries who are in the
play as well
