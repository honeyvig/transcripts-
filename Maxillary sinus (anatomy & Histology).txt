hi - this is dr. Street hunt from Team
MDS conquer now I'm going to discuss
about maxillary sinus so in the first
part I'm going to talk about an autumn
and astrology mostly relevant to your
examination point so the other word that
is commonly used for the maxillary sinus
is anthem of high mode
why because high mo is the person who
has given it for the first step so it is
called as anthem of high mode and the
second important point to be added is
maxillary sinus opens into middle meatus
okay so maxillary sinus is an eighth
space that is present in the maxilla and
communicates with the an ornament
outside mainly with middle meatus the
opening of max little sinus is present
in the middle meatus and the regularly
asked question is the shape of maxillary
sinus okay depends upon the ace but
normal shape of maxillary sinuses
pyramid Agra okay so during the
development of maxillary sinus it has
different shapes so they can ask you at
birth it will be tubular in the
childhood it will be all wide but adult
size it will be pyramidal and they can
ask you which of the following teeth is
present very near to the maxillary sinus
during the development during the
development it is maxillary connect okay
so during the wide shape the tooth which
is present near to the sinus is max very
cunning but regularly asked question is
in the adult so in the adult it is
maxillary first molar I hope you are
clear right so they can ask you the size
shape of the site shape that is tubular
at birth or wide at childhood and
pyramidal in the parent so next course
is a few aspects related to the
histology as we already discussed it is
a pyramidal body which is present within
the body of the maxilla and lining of
maxillary sinus is the most commonly
asked question your jungle histology
that is pseudo stratified ciliated
columnar epithelium you can see the
Celia okay but you can see the nucleus
at
friend levels so it is called as pseudo
stratified ciliated columnar epithelium
but it is a single lining but which
looks like stratified so it is called as
pseudo stratified ciliated columnar
epithelium so this is another word that
you can add because this is once - as a
question the lining of maxillary sinus
is also called as and recently as din
neat that is the volume of maxillary
sinus is 20 to 30 ml okay
so recently asked in 2019 what is the
volume of maxillary sinus is a simple
question and followed by this question
is given in comet king okay so the
dimensions of maxillary sinus is 35 into
26 into 32 okay so the dimensions were
already asked in the comet kay so just
make a note of it and they can ask you
the thickness of the body wall that is
surrounding the maxillary sinus that is
2 power 2 to 5 millimeters in most of
the pathological conditions there will
be thinning of this wall okay leading to
the expansion or leading to the invasion
of the maxillary sinus right so the
thickness is 2 point 2 to 5 millimeters
and it will be thinning in many of the
pathological issues that we are going to
discuss in further parts okay next comes
is the boundaries the boundaries were
asked in different ways like they can
ask you it is always 6 mega node it is 1
2 3 4 5 6 okay basically the other mode
of representation of the boundary seized
by base apex roof
fluor anterior wall and posterior wall
or they can ask you in this way it's
very simple the base is so the base of
this triangle will be pointed towards
the lateral wall of the nose okay so
that is the median one so this is the
base which is pointed towards the
lateral wall of the nose okay next one
the apex is the opposite one okay the
apex is the opposite one
so the apex is pointed towards the webex
is pointed towards the zygomatic process
of the maxilla okay so the epics is
pointed towards the zygomatic process of
that maxima and they can ask you the
roof the roof is this one okay the roof
is by the floor of the orbit and they
can ask you the floor the floor is by
the your teeth that is the Eldar process
okay they can ask your roof floor Epic's
base or medial or lateral and anterior
and posterior walls and already spider
facial aspect of the maxilla okay this
one and posterior wall is the max let it
show porosity
I hope it's very clear so it has six
parts base apex roof floor and the wall
and posterior wall right done so these
are the important boundaries that you
have to make you know when you're
talking about the anatomy of maxillary
cells and opening okay so as already
discussed the opening of maxillary sinus
means the natural opening of maxillary
sinus if you consider this one as a
sinus the opening will be present in the
middle meatus okay so as the natural
opening is present in the middle meatus
if there is any accumulation of the
fluid it cannot be drained it has to
fill up to this level to get it out
right so that is the reason why whenever
you plan any anthro to me or whenever
you want to keep a hold imaginary sinus
keep in the inferior Maharis so that the
drain is will be easy so the natural
opening that is ostium
of the maxillary sinus is present in the
middle meatus
whereas the artificial opening which is
done during the intro to me is done in
the inferior meter so don't get confused
natural is present in the middle so you
do artificial in the inferior right okay
the next comes is the functions of
maxillary sinus which is well known by
you in your oral history
that is due to the air-filled spaces
they reduce the weight of the skull they
help in the voice resonance they help in
warming the area and humidification
their axes in a shock observer of the
skull and they observes the pollutant
allergens or any any such stuff and
traps the battery and that mucus okay
and known functions no need to write
them again and again these are common
known functions of your oral history
okay few things are common I'm going to
mark important aspects in the red color
which has to be noted done if you feel
something new apart from what you
already know please write them don't
write heavy heavy notices by making your
stuff tough to read in the last few days
revision is important right so you have
to do multiple rounds of revision if you
have to multiple rounds of revision you
need to focus more on the memory based
aspects okay
so next one is the blood supply okay so
the blood supply goes with the facial
artery infraorbital artery and the
greater palate or not whereas your
drainage will goes with the facial and
the tech or plucks of strains
okay now supplies mostly by the branches
of the maxillary artery and drainage is
by the submandibular lymph nodes okay so
that's the reason why in a few cases of
your maxillary sinusitis you can see
lymph adenopathy these lymph nodes are
going to have some sort of swelling or
they become tender
