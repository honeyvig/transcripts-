reason why many Tech experiments find
data science to be the most interesting
job profiles apart from the IIT domain
data science has spread its roots into
other fields for instance the healthcare
sector is more inclined towards data
science and artificial intelligence to
diagnose and treat the most complicated
syndromes and robots to perform the most
tedious surgeries online stores and
shopping websites depends solely on data
science to manage the supply chain and
enhance the user experience by
recommending the right product data
science plays a pivotal role in
transportation and Logistics it provides
customized recommendations to best suit
customers comfort and manages unexpected
circumstances using Predictive Analytics

many more employed data science to
predict seismic events Reservoir
Behavior climate interpretation voter
boys to enable navigation and more
construction companies are integrating
their process with data science to
enhance bloating constructing and
automating tasks to build better faster
and bigger projects in the most
efficient way possible in the
ever-evolving field of data science new
advancements and discoveries in research
accelerate rapidly you always get to
learn something new making everyday's
work exciting new data science skills
can be acquired endlessly giving your
Competitive Edge between knowledge and
expertise the salary of a data scientist
in India ranges from 15 to 25 lakhs per
annum and in the United States of
America the salaries range from 150 000
to 250 000 per annum depicting the
future of data science results in an
unmatched potential to settle in a
secure job role as the field expense
more jobs should become available as
more data scientists are needed for
analysis individuals wishing to pursue a
career in data science can look forward
to bright future with data science data
science has a huge scope across all
Industries the global market for data
science is expected to grow all the way
up to 230 billion dollars by early 2026
opening the gates for about 11 million
data scientists job roles another
important aspect of the future of data
Sciences artificial intelligence AI will
likely to be most powerful technology
data scientists will have to deal with
in the future to put it another way the
future of data science will align itself
to make it better in the long run to
become a data scientist the
Professionals in the organizations need
to have help the data literacy powerful
programming skills mathematics
statistics logic building skills strong
foundations in data cleaning and a
comfortable understanding of data
visualization and machine learning
algorithms handling all these are
nothing less than herding cats one scale
