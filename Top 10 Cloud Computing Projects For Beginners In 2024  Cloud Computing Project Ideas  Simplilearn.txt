hello there amazing folks and welcome to
this new video on the best cloud
projects for absolute beginners this
simplified video guide will take you
through some of the most basic and yet
most important projects you can practice
and add in your portfolio if you're just
starting on the journey to cloud
computing stay tuned with us till the
end and get one step ahead in cloud
computing moving on to the top 10 cloud
computing projects we have divided this
video into three parts the first part is
for beginners moving on to the first
project for beginners we have a
cloud-based file storage in this project
you will create a simple cloud-based
file storage system similar to a Dropbox
or a Google Drive users can upload
download and manage files stored in the
cloud the part to create this project
will start by choosing a cloud storage
service select a cloud storage service
provider like awss 3 Google Cloud
Storage or Azure blob storage
the next step is creating an account
sign up for an account with the choosen
cloud provider if you don't already have
one the next step is to set up a bucket
or a container create a storage bucket
or container to store your files the
next step is to develop a web interface
create a web based interface for users
to interact with your storage system you
can use HTML CSS and JavaScript for this
the next step is to implement file
upload and download add functionality
for users to upload and download files
to or from their storage bucket using
the cloud providers SDK or API the next
step is user authentication Implement
user authentication to secure access to
files you can use services like Firebase
authentication or build one of your own
the next step is testing and deployment
test your file storage system locally
and once satisfied deploy it to the
cloud make it publicly accessible if
needed the key learning points of this
project is you will learn the basics of
cloud IT services file uploading and
downloading and user authentication
moving on to project number two we have
a website hosting service this project
involves setting up an essential website
on a cloud platform like AWS Azure or
Google Cloud you'll deploy a static or
dynamic website and make it accessible
to users worldwide let's move on to the
path to create this project the first
step is to select a cloud hosting
service choose a cloud hosting platform
like Amazon web service
Azure or Google Cloud the next step is
to design your website create the
content and design for your website you
can use HTML CSS and JavaScript for
static websites or web Frameworks for
dynamic ones then register a domain name
purchase a domain name from a domain
register for example GoDaddy name chep
Etc the next step is to configure DNS
configure the DNS setting to point to
your Cloud hosting servers IP address
the next step is to set up a virtual
server create a virtual server instance
on your chosen Cloud platform for
example aw2 Azure VM and Google compute
engine the next step is to install web
server software install and configure
web server software like Apache on your
virtual server and the last step is to
upload website files upload your website
files to the server and then you are
done with the project the key learning
points of this project you will learn
how to configure a web server you deploy
web applications and manage domain names
and finally you will ensure High
availability the next project we have
for beginners is a cloudbased calculator
create a simple web-based calculator
application and deploy it on a cloud
platform like Heroku users can perform
basic calculations using this calculator
let's talk about the path to create this
project you will start by selecting a
cloud platform choose a cloud platform
like Haku AWS or Azure for deployment
then develop the calculator create a
simple web- based calculator you can use
HTML CSS and JavaScript for this then
set up a development environment install
necessary development tools and
libraries on your local machine then
move ahead with Version Control use
Version Control Systems like get to
manage your project then create a cloud
account sign up for an account with your
chosen Cloud platform then comes the
deployment part deploy your calculator
application to the cloud platform of
your choice for Heroku this might
involve pushing your code to a g
repository and then comes the testing
part ensure that the calculator
functions correctly on the Cloud Server
let's talk about the key learning points
of this project you'll gain experience
in setting up Cloud Server environments
deploying web applications and
understanding server client interactions
moving on to intermediate level projects
these projects are for people with
decent knowledge of cloud computing
Basics the first project we have in this
category is an iot data analytics
project build a system that collects
data from iot devices sensors smart
devices Etc and stores it in Cloud
databases for example AWS Dynamo DB or
Azure Cosmos database Implement
analytics to gain insights from the
collected data let's talk about the path
to create this project the first step is
iot device setup set up iot devices or
sensors to collect data then choose a
cloud database select a cloud database
service for example AWS database as your
Cosmos database for data storage then
comes the data inje part write code to
send data from iot devices to the cloud
database then comes data analytics
Implement data analytics tools or
scripts to analyze the collected data
then comes data visualization create
visualizations to present insights from
the data using tools like AWS quick site
or data visualizations libraries and
then the last part is monitoring and
scaling Implement monitoring and scaling
mechanisms to handle increased data
volumes so let's talk about the key
learning points of this project you will
explore iot data inje Cloud database
management data analytics and of course
data visualization moving on to the next
project we have a video streaming
service so you will create a video
streaming service where users can upload
and stream videos from the cloud
Implement features like video encoding
content delivery and user authentication
let's talk about the part to create this
project you will start by selecting
cloud services choose cloud services for
video storage for example AWS S3 find
coding you can choose AWS elastic
transcoder and for Content delivery you
can choose AWS Cloud front the next step
is to design the application plan the
architecture of your video streaming
platform including user interfaces for
uploading and streaming the next step is
user authentication Implement user
authentication using services like AWS
Cognito then comes the video uploading
part allow users to upload videos to the
cloud storage and then comes the video
encoding Implement video encoding to
create different quality versions of
uploaded videos then comes the content
delivery use a Content delivery Network
or CDN to distribute videos efficiently
to the users and the last step is
testing and scalability Test video
streaming and ensure it scales to handle
concurrent users and varrying network
conditions let's talk about the key
learning points for this project you
will learn about video processing
content delivery networks and secure
user access control moving on to the
next project we have cloudbased
e-commerce website build an e-commerce
platform hosted on cloud develop
features like product listing shopping
carts and secure Payment Processing
let's talk about the path to create this
project you'll start by selecting Cloud
platform choose a cloud platform for
example AWS or aure to host your
e-commerce application then comes the
e-commerce framework choose an
e-commerce framework for example
