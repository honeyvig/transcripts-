yeah happiness this is dr srikanth from
team mds conquer
of course we are done with december 16
2020 examination okay the d-day was done
and i hope most of you are very very
happy after coming out from
the examination centers so there are few
things that we need to discuss
about this so coming to 2020
sounds so rhythmic but the year
which has hurted each and every one
in the universe okay it may be pandemic
followed by the floods in different
areas in india and most of our students
suffered suffered suffered but
there are some few positive things that
we need to talk about this
2020 preparation the one important thing
the exam was not postponed like your
medical friends because your medical
friends examination
has been postponed but uh the dental was
not postponed
and the dates were given and they're
fixed to the dates and the exam was done
so that's a beautiful
positive thing that we need to take into
consideration the second one
the cushion paper okay as for the
strategy of neet 2020
the meet 2021 question paper was as per
the prediction
so as we guided and the question paper
was
too good for students who has too good
preparation
and the second category of people like
because of the pandemic
or because of the health issues or
because of any psychological reasons
few of you has quitted the preparation i
know that and i agree with it
but all of you have to take this step
positive into consideration because the
exams trends
has been changing after seeing 2020
question paper last year
we focused and we teached everything
in and perfect integrated approach and
this was clearly proven in 2021
examination which was done on december
16th so
the big question is question paper is
easy for few people question paper is
difficult for few people
and there are different sorts of reviews
regarding this paper
i was going through the questions i was
going through the papers and i was
talking with
most of you offline and online and
extremely happy that most of you like
more than 30 to 40 people has
attended the interviews in the last two
days and i was talking with most of you
and the conclusion is very simple okay
you cannot judge a question paper
whether it is easy or hard
in general because easy or hard is just
depends upon individual perception how
his preparation is
how the mentors has guided what type of
material they have done
how many mock exams they have done what
type of exposure they have been
under the last couple of days or
it can be like how much time that you
have spent with the books and what are
the contents that you have gone through
so there are many factors which depends
or concludes that how the exam
is for you means if it is a good or a
bad it's an individual perception
means from the day one i was talking
always about the difficulty index oh
what is this difficult index means very
simple
difficulty index means how difficult the
question paper is
for you so the difficult index ranges
from
different levels to different levels for
different individuals means the
difficulty level may be i may be
i may feel the question pepper is easy
to me for example if you take neet 2020
i got so many calls one day once the
exam is done but all india second
ranker or the state toppers most of them
they called me and said the question
paper was too easy
but if i take an average student they
feel like question paper was difficult
but it was concluded and prove that yes
all india's second ranker has got
the best score out of this and it is
proven that the question paper is
difficult for
for the rest of the people but it is
easy for the individual
so difficulty level of an index
i i don't want to discuss this very
specific to you
so i don't want to judge whether the
paper is easy or whether paper is
difficult for you
but i can clearly say that this question
paper
is a good paper and the second
contradictory
that i heard so much in the social media
as well as
in most of our groups is the blueprint
was not followed the blueprint was not
up to mark the question dividing was not
proper
okay of course i agree with it okay they
have given a blueprint but they have not
followed
but can we tell that this particular
question is from this particular
department
okay for example i can ask you one
question that is given in 2020
question the drug of choice for anag is
do you want to conclude that this
question is from pharmacology
or this question is very specific to
dental pharmacology
or you want to conclude this question as
anak aperio
or you're talking about ana i mean anak
will come into
your account in oral medicine radiology
or it may be your part of your general
medicine if i'm not specific even ana
can be seen in general medicine
because if you're talking about hiv hiv
you one of the clinical feature that you
see in oral cavity hiv is ana
so similarly it comes in oral pathology
so such questions can
you cannot conclude that this is going
to be exclusively perio or this is going
to be exclusively
pharmacology so you have to consider the
examination as an integrated exam
because nowadays
every exam is being integrated if you
see nbd part 1 and part 2 just giving an
example
now they are being integrated to nbde
i and bde that is nothing but integrated
nbd
and if you see most of your uae country
examinations the license based
examinations
previously they used to ask a single
liner amalgam was invented by
ada specification number of amalgams
coefficient of thermal expansion of
amalgam is
these are the questions previously used
to be asked in most of the examination
include the prestigious examination like
aims which was now drifted to
okay so or it may be the previous aapg's
or your state entrances now being
converted to all india need pc
so whatever it is questions used to be
direct but now the questions are not
direct
it it can be of any sort of examination
throughout the country
they want to include more clinical
scenarios they want to
change the decidamental capacity of the
pay
of your of you or of of the aspirants
how well they handle the situation in a
clinical scenario
that is more important because once you
are doing once you're done with your
post graduation maybe probably you are
going to work on patients in different
different
areas in different different ways but
the main purpose of this integrated
based exam is to test the real knowledge
of the student
it's not simply mugging the numbers and
expelling out in the examination
okay so that's what the question paper
of neet
2020 or neet 2021 both are in the same
way and both are should be handled the
same way no
once you're done with neet 2020 yes it's
good people were panicked people were
disappointed
okay that's perfect but how you can
extend the same strategy for 2021
what you prepare you you go in the same
way no once once there is a drift in the
question paper you need to prepare
according to that
and this is what the strategy we have
followed and this is what the strategy
we
forced most of the mds congress students
are the people who are following our
youtube channel
this is what we have done in the last 10
to 15 days also on the group
we have provide you as many as quick
revision videos as possible
and of course it is very evident that
most of your questions are from the
quick revision
or most of your questions from the mock
examinations which i am going to
elaborately discuss
in the next upcoming videos in the form
of a paper discussion
showing proof that it was given
on which mock or it was discussed on
which video or it was discussed on
which discussion part or an explanation
but i'm going to clearly show
the maximum content of neet 2021 paper
is exclusively from what we have done
so this is how you have to utilize like
most of you i was talking
uh from the past three or four days
whatever may be your level of
preparation
i feel like most of you are still
sticking to the basic funda
in the last 15 days my senior told to do
this i want to do this what your senior
has done
probably five years back and what were
the exams now
exams are being integrated exams are
moving more to the clinical scenarios
exams are not as simple as you imagine
we need to put
lots of efforts and lots of work to make
your preparation better and you have to
do the same
reciprocating it's not like simply
sticking to amalgam
hardly like nowadays you've seen neet
2020 or 2021
hardly they are not giving on old
concepts most of them are drifting
towards the new things
for example a very very new or peculiar
thing okay smart bug
we never use a smart bar have you used i
have seen the smart bar because one of
my
co-pg was doing a thesis on the smart
butt so i have seen the smart butt but i
have never used the smart but
even in my post graduation and of course
i hope you never heard the term
one if i if if if we don't have a
smart materials class we have in the
smart materials class i have discussed
this smart but
what is the hardness what is the
mechanical hardness of this what is the
hardness number for this one we have
discussed all those concepts okay it's
okay
but how far we are moving towards the
advancements
in day-to-day dentistry life and how far
we are up to learning them
and how far we are up to executing them
in the examination hall
that's a big dynamic question how many
of you use gz rules
yeah of course i have used these rules
because i'm in indo-pg
or i'm done with my indoor masters i
have seen the gt rules
i have used the releases but it's a
question mark again like how far how
many people has used this
a question very simple question rare
question for that you no need to study
anything related to jesus if you have
used it
or if you have seen it the game is over
the question is done how many of you
have seen rubber dam how many uh have
you applied rubber dump question on
rabbit
so all these are very simple mind new
things which
moves around dentistry in day to day
life but most of you as an undergraduate
were not exposed to these levels up to
mark
so this is what i was going through the
questions most of the questions are
common clinical scenarios
common knowledge things it's not too
heavy too overloaded
i mean of course there will be questions
like 20 to 30 which are
rank deciding which are which are going
to decide the creamy crowd
okay acceptable but rest all 180 to 200
questions are
very raw means the very basics
eventually if you have a
basic knowledge or dentistry you can
handle like 100 to 120 questions very
easily
in that particular question paper so
i don't want to discuss or expel out
like whether the question paper is easy
difficult medium modern difficult no i
if it is easy for you it is easy only
for you
if it is difficult it is difficult for
you so
there is no such thing okay it just
depends upon the
perception it just depends upon the
difficulty index of
you exclusively in the examination hall
you may feel the question bible is easy
in the examination hall
but once you're done with the exam after
five days gap now the same person is
telling sir i feel that if the exam is a
bit difficult i think so
in the examination hall you feel it it's
difficult now you're coming out after
five days
telling you it's i feel like it's easy
but i feel like
difficult in examination also i can just
conclude that this question paper
is good question paper really required
question paper
because long back five years back if you
see they're going to
ask all the stupid things biological
with around the implant is
thickness of this is thickness of a
graft is
thickness of split thickness grafted i
feel like this all sounds to be so funny
which was
established in the year in india it is
established in the year
all these are number based things are
logic less questions
but of course when you are going for a
competitive exam you should be clear
with each and every corner of the
subject
that's what most of the mentors say but
i feel like 2020 and 2021
are the real quality of question papers
or questions
which are really checking the common
sense
or presence of mind or logics of the
student
which are really required in day-to-day
practice
in the clinical scenarios because once
the patient is approaching you
it should be more logical to plan a
perfect treatment plan
with a minimal invasive procedures with
a minimal
economical burden on the patient and
which is beneficial to the doctor
as well as the patient you have to plan
so that is more of a common sense
that is more of an application of logic
that is more of an application of
knowledge
with wisdom and these question papers
2020 and 2021
really qualifies filters and segregates
the quality of creamy crowd of aspirants
to the next level in the dentistry so
that's what my point of view
towards this question paper which was
given by you on december 16th
2021 signing off dr shrikan from team
