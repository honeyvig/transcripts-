analytics program that fits your
experience and areas of Interest now
without further delay let's get started
now let us quickly switch to the powerbi
platform yes so now the powerbi visuals
are on the screen you you can see we
have file home and add data to your
report visualizations filters data Etc
right for now I think we don't have any
data we can quickly import the data onto
this particular platform and start our
analysis but before we get started with
that everybody knows there are simple
tricks to create all the type of
visualizations right if you expand if I
if I could expand my screen here you can
have all these visuals and let's say if
I just dou will click here and if I want
any typee of visual it'll just show me
the visual right let's say I want a bar
graph for the sales happening in all the
regions so I'll just double click I'll
to it down give me a bar grab for sales
right it will give you and just in case
you wanted the pie chart for the country
wise you can just give country wise
sales pie chart right but now let me
tell you a few things correct so if you
are using a pie chart and if you are
dealing with let's say a lot of
companies or I mean countries a lot of
countries like 20 countries or 25
countries right in that scenario pie
chart look a little clutter right and
let's say you wanted to find out the
sales that are happening in the region
wise and you asked power to create a
line graph for that that would not give
you the proper visual that will not give
you the proper visualization to be
honest right so as a beginner if you are
learning powerbi the most fundamental
thing is not just understanding how the
tools in the powerbi work what kind of
visualizations you have the most
critical thing that you will need to
know after understanding the basics is
what type of chart is to be used for
what kind of visualization right so
that's exactly we are going to discuss
today what kind of data requires what
kind of visualization let's say I'm
working with date data type let's say
I'm working with sales data type let's
say there is a requirement where I need
to present the data in form of table or
a card then what are those scenarios and
if I want to use the pie chart or bar
graph then what kind of data types that
I need to deal with what are the
situation where I need to use the bar
graph and where I shouldn't right a few
basic fundamentals that we will be
dealing with today so we have uh a wide
variety of bar graphs in the first row
and a F variety of line graphs in the
second row which deal with the line
graph area area graph ribbons Etc and in
the third row we have ball funnel
scatter plot pie chart donut chart tree
map and next we have map and right
filled map and we have uh the gauge
cards and everything right and here we
also have a kpi right so we'll also go
through a kpi uh type of chart and if
you want to learn about the kpis
exclusively then we have have the kpi
tutorial and powerbi lined up in this
particular Series so you can also go
through that and after that we have some
slicers and we have tables and we have
Matrix right so a wide variety of charts
available correct so we will try to
understand the major ones the first r
bar graph which are the scenarios where
you need to use the bar graphs next R we
have the line right line area so all
these come under one uh kind of uh set
they are similar to one other so which
is a scenario where you can use a line
graph which is a scenario where you can
use a waterfall or a funnel chart which
is a scenario where you can use a
scatter plot which is a scenario where
you can use a pie chart right a wide
variety of probabilities a wide variety
of permutations and combinations so what
are the exact needs what are the exact
visualizations that carry a value that
carry a meaning to the stakeholder which
are those particular charts which
explain play the numbers in the right
way possible so that's the point of
today's discussion so to begin with
let's import the data first from the
Excel document so we will be using the
Excel data over here just click okay now
you have a wide variety of tables which
are present in that particular workbook
we are dealing with the data tab so just
click on it select and load if there are
any mistakes or if there are any
discrepancies powerbi will let you know
and it will also it has the caliber to
also fix those particular data rows
right so there is one or seven errors
right now you can choose to close but
the overall tutorial is about learning
the type of visualization right so seven
rows out of 10,000 will not make a huge
difference for us right now because
we're trying to just understand the
basic understanding of what type of
charts to use so I'll just quickly close
this but in case if you want to fix you
can just click on this view errors and
the power query will open up in the
background you can just switch to the
power query Tab and fix the data rules
where they really need to be fixed right
so let me close it for now and now in a
short notice you can see we have the
data loaded here now we have two types
but if you let me let us imagine that
you are on tblo and on tblo you have two
things dimensions and measures right so
measures is self-explanatory anything
that deals with numbers is called as
measure and anything that deals with
characters or names or anything such
which is not a number is considered as a
dimension right so here we have category
City Country customer ID so these are
the ones which can be considered as
dimensions and where you have a
sumission logo or a mathematical symbol
right in front of it can be considered
as a measure right now let's say we
wanted to create the month-on-month
sales report correct which deals with
the detail dat type so just uh date data
type right just remember whenever date
is included in your parameters either
you're adding it to the rows or columns
just make sure that you are using the
line chart which is over here so let's
quickly rename our page to line charts
or
graphs
correct now we have named that now you
can either choose to double click and
add that and then here you have xaxis
and Y AIS or you know you can just drag
the order date expand this order date
and the hierarchy is over here so if you
want to go with the month on month you
can simply add this to xaxis and you can
have your sales data somewhere over here
drag this to Y AIS this is one way of
creating it but in case if you don't
want to waste time in this particular
huge uh process you can just choose to
Simply double click on the canvas and
write it down here line
chart sales month click and there you go
right brilliant now if you choose to
Spotlight or you can just expand this
right and if you choose the spotlight
you can see a vertical line showing you
the numbers correctly we start from
January and all the way to December
right and here you have the
month-on-month sales so remember
whenever the date data type is included
in one of your parameters then the best
way to represent the best way to
visualize the reports will be the line
dra right with that let's switch to the
next one now since we were supposed to
discuss the bar grass first but let's
it's it's okay not a problem so let's
discuss the bar charts now let us know
the data set first so we have sales
profit discount numbers Etc right and we
have region wise city wise category wise
country wise so let us go with category
now let us go with category and try to
build a bar graph just double click
anywhere and category okay bar
graph okay if not category you can also
choose to have sub category Okay g r a p
just take care of your spellings I think
I missed an R over here bar graph
subcategory enter
saes there you go so you have your chart
right here if you just expand it you can
see we have a wide variety of
subcategories and powerbi was kind
enough for us to you know sort the data
in for form of highest uh um ticket
price or highest selling product in the
first place and the lowest selling
product in the last place so this is how
the bar graphs work but just in case if
you you can tell me why couldn't we go
with a let's say pie chart right let us
soier check there if I just click on
this what happens you can see a lot of
cluttered data right you have a lot of
subcategories here more than maybe 10
right so in this scenario the visuals
are a little displeasing and you don't
have the accurate value over here just
undo it and you have the bar graph which
is a a little clearer to look at a
little more you know decent to
understand what's happening you can just
focus on the top five over here and you
can understand what's going on right now
you can just rename them
as and you can choose to go with any
kind of bar graph vertical or horizontal
or in case if you have a few more let's
say we go with the category first and
under the category you have subcategory
then you can also go with that and you
have an overlapping type of graphs over
here stacked bar graphs which can show
you in that particular category which
was the product which was highest
selling right now you can also add that
whereas the category right you can just
choose
that okay so
I think we can open a new tab and okay
so we have the paragraph next we have
waterfall so let's open a and let's name
it this
waterfall so waterfall is uh something
which performance of that particular uh
property or that particular entity let's
say I wanted to find out the year on
year or dat wise performance of that
particular subcategory
in those scenarios I can go with
waterfall so just simply double click
and ask powerp to create a waterfall
model
chart enter space
sale there you go so it's giving you the
period over period sales report of
subcategories and the green line
indicates that it is slowly growing in
terms of sales and and sub and the the
red one shows the decline in sales which
is not happening anywhere and this is
the total the overall you know the
overall subcategories so it'll give you
a waterall model and the overall total
of that particular uh segment is this
much and now we have dealt with
subcategory uh waterall model and let's
try to create a ribbon chart so ribbon
chart and the area chart those are
similar to one other stacked area area
and ribbon chart so ribbon chart will
give you the performance of that
particular product in the uh timely if
you want to see the performance of that
particular product in measured in terms
of time let's say uh month on month
quarter on quarter year on year day by
day that can be done using the ribbon
chart similar to the line chart but
anyways let's take a look I'll name it
as ribbon and and uh just double click
the PB
canvas ribbon chart or just ribbon
subcategory
enter sale there you go if you write
order month you can also track the
monthly performance of those products
right you can see a study decline you
can see a study upline and uh so here
you can see the months and here you can
see the different colors of months the
different colors represent the months so
here are the products and based on the
products how is the monthly performance
right is it declining or is it um
increasing can or find it out you can
basically find out that and uh moving
ahead we will deal with u scatter right
so first we dealt with the bar graphs
next we dealt with the line graphs and
now we also dealt with waterfall funnel
which is something similar next we have
stack chart scatter plot chart right now
scatterplot is a little different let's
say you're dealing with numbers only
numbers nothing different usually what
we do is we carry out a dimension and a
measure right but in this scenario you
want to deal with only numbers let's say
you are providing some discount on all
your products and you wanted to know the
Prof
against the discount offer here you're
dealing with two numbers profit and
discount right so in those scenarios
what do you do so that's when you find
out by using this scat plot just double
click on the canvas write it down as
build me a
scatterplot just check the spelling s c
a t e r scatter
discount enter and profit now it will
create a scatter plot based on discount
and against the profit now you can give
some uh Dimension you can go with
subcategory there you go now you have
the profit obtained against the discount
offered based on different subcategories
just expand it and you can see in which
subcategory what kind of discount was
offered and what kind of profits did you
make so 25% uh uh discount was being
offered on accessories and you made a
profit still you made a profit of
$33,000 and here you can see almost 200
discount was offered and still you I
think that is OnePlus One offer or maybe
end of the season sale but still they
made a profit based on some parameters
and here you can see the least discount
and highest profit
okay the least profit and the highest
discount is in terms of tables which is
33% the maximum out of everything and uh
they still did not manage to earn some
good profits out there so this is how
you create a scatter plot just quickly
name it as scatter and next we can deal
with the pie chart now just double click
on the canvas pie chart
region F so you have four to five
regions here and uh using a pie chart
would make a good uh impact on this
particular visual as everything seems
clear and you can easily make out which
particular region made the highest sale
by just looking at the size of these
pieces right now let's quickly name this
as
by and now let's move to the you can
just uh you know you can use the same
data for creating a donut craft you can
use the same data used to create a tree
map and yeah those are similar to one
another let's let's quickly jump and now
let's create some maps right now when do
you need to use map type charts let's
say your data set has some geographical
data something like City something like
country something like continent right
or longitudes latitudes anything which
gets in touch or gets in line with the
geographical data then you can proceed
and build the map data types I mean the
maps correct so something which is
related to the map data type you can
build a map now let me double click on
the canvas and ask powerbi to create a
map
country
sales there you go you have as simple as
that you have the country-wise sales on
pap PI right here you can also choose to
have fill map which will show you how
much sale is happening the darkest color
will indicate the highest sale and the
lightest color will indicate the lowest
sale now moving ahead we have the cards
and gauge so cards and engage completely
similar to each other just click on the
power double click you can write card
country okay let's go with region
because we don't want to go or you can
we don't want to to have multiple cards
we just want to have three to four cards
on our dashboard so we'll go with
category save so you'll just have a card
here right you can just keep it any way
on the corner in terms of real time
dashboard using you can just keep it
anywhere and uh let's name it as card
now let's proceed and create a kpi so
multi row card you can also create a
multi row card let's say you have uh
let's go back to card and check check at
once so if you create a multi row card
we have three categories and you can
also add add the subcategories of each
category so that's similar to a multi-
row card correct now let's go back to
the last type or we have kpis and uh
table so kpis and table are completely
similar to each other let's try to go
with the kpi now we have discount profit
sale and uh
quantity correct so kpi is something
which gives you the direct real time
number of what's happening with your
real time dashboard correct now how many
number of you know how many number of
products are sold what's the overall
sale that we performed what's the
overall profit that we receive what's
the overall discount that we offer in
terms of one single uh dashport you can
create a kpi for that now let's let me
create a kpi discount first that's as
easy as that now kpi for the profit
enter there you go now double click kpi
for sale enter there you go and lastly
kpi for
quantity there you go now that's how you
create the different types of charts so
basically if you integrate
all these charts into one page or One
dashboard or one canvas that's what you
call as a realtime interactive dashboard
in Pap pi and again coming back to the
slicers if you were using Excel you
might have to interconnect each and
every single chart using the report
connection option but in Pia you don't
have to create that particular report
connection process you can just click on
the uh or slices any of the chart and
you can click on the any of the options
let's say you wanted to come find out
country wise sales you just click on the
country provided right so here somewhere
you had yeah you have Jan Feb and
everything right so if you just click on
Jan every chart available on the powerbi
dashboard will connect to it uh connect
to the different you dependent charts
and give you a real time information
without having to create or report
connection to each other right so
basically if you just add all these
charts onto one particular canvas that's
when you get the real time interactive
dashboard in powerbi and so I hope you
have understood what kind of chart you
need to use based on what kind of uh
data you have so with that we have come
to an end of this session on complete
introduction to all the types of charts
available in powerbi and if you require

to create a specific chart like the line
graph or a bar graph or a stacked bar
graph anything you can just go through
