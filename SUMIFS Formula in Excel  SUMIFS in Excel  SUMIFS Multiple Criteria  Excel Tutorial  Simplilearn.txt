now without further delay over to our
training now to execute Su of in Excel
we are on our practical mode now here
you can see we have employee ID name
designation Department salary date of
birth of employee and date of joining of
employee now for some reason you wanted
to calculate the overall salary
designated for HR department you can
simply use the sum function but what if
you had another criteria if you wanted
to calculate the salaries allocated to
HR department and only for manager
designation then the sum might not work
you might want to use some summation
formula with some sort of filter that's
when exactly the sum of functions come
into existence so so you are providing
ifs functions over here so there are two
type of su if functions in Excel one is
Su if and another one is some ifs so
some if will only take one reason but if
we wanted to provide multiple reasons or
multiple parameters as filters then sum
ifs is your ally now let's try to use
directly the sum ifs
function so equals to sum ifs select the
second one ifs right then sum range so
want to calculate the total sum range of
salary so this is your range comma Now
the condition criteria so you want the
department to be HR right so take the
entire column of the department that is
column D comma which particular value
you want to look at this is HR now close
the bracket enter there you go so a
total of 1ak 120,000 rupees has been
allocated to HR department now let's
calculate with another condition which
is the department should be HR and the
employee designation should be manager
alone now same equals to sum FS select
the formula the same the total sum range
comma the first criteria which is the
department select the entire department
comma the value should be HR now the
second criteria that is the designation
select the entire designation column
C comma the value should be manager
close the brackets enter there you go so
a total of 40,000 rupees has been
allocated to HR department and to the
manager section or manager designation

Excel for more details or if you have
