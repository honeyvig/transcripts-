foreign
is one of the emerging programming
languages according to the most recent
figures python is the most used coding
language for about 80 percent of
Developers
the syntax of this high level
programming language is simple to
understand Python's large Library System
makes it a best choice for data science
machine learning and artificial
intelligence projects so hello Learners
welcome to simple learns YouTube channel
and today we will create a mind sweeper
game using python but before we begin if
you love watching Tech videos subscribe
to our Channel like the tutorial and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an update
and now we'll see the demo of what we
will create today that is the
Minesweeper game
so this is a Minesweeper game so first
we have frame and we have a title here
that is mindsweeper game then we have
the cells left that is 36. we have set
the size of the board to 36 only so
Minesweeper features a grid of click
cable squares that we can see here
that has hidden Minds scattered
throughout the port and the objective is
to clear the board without detonating
any mines with help from clues about the
number of neighboring mines in each
field
as if I click on this field you will see
two so there would be two mines near
this box that could be here
here here
that could be like horizontally
vertically or diagonally
and that would be to the adjacent boxes
only
so here it could be a mine here here
here
so if you click on a mine the game would
be over for you so you have to click on
the numbers and be aware of not
detonating the minds and solve the
puzzle so moving on now I will have a
simple quiz
for you guys
so your question for the quiz is which
of the following concepts is not a part
of python any options are
first is pointers
second is loops
third is dynamic typing and the fourth
is all of the above please answer in the
comment section below and we'll update
the correct answer in the pin comment
you can pause the video give it a
thought and answer in the comment
section
and I have an insightful for you guys if
you are focused on building strong
foundational skills for career growth in
that case you can check out a free
course to Learn Python Basics with a
completion certificate from scale up by
simplylearn you can check the python
Basics course in the description box
below
we will give the link there you can just
go and check it out
so now we'll start with the tutorial
and now we'll create a folder
name it as Minesweeper
foreign
the command prompt
and write the command code space period
and press enter
so we will get our Command Prompt open
and here we'll create a file
and name it as main.py
and now we'll start off
code
to make a Minesweeper game so first
thing we will import the package that
would be the kinter
so from enter
we'll import all the classes
and now
we will create a root
and initialize the taken stance
and now we'll configure this window
and using configure you can change the
background color
or text
the window or any element or widget of
the Kinder widget
so here we would set the background
color
and we'll set it as black
and moving on
now we'll set the geometry
that would be the size of the ticket
window
so first I will show you our window
would look like
for that I will write the command
root Dot
main Loop
now I'll save this file
and run it
you would see that the tick enter window
has appeared and it has the background
color as black
now we'll set the geometry of this
window
so that would be
how much size
it should appear
when we just run our code
so for that we will write the command
root dot geometry
and inside
we will make the height and width of the
window static
not static will make it dynamic for
static we can simply write 400 x
700. and those would be in inverted
commas
we'll save this and run this file
you could see that 400 is the width of
the window and 700 is the height of the
window
so we have the window with 400 width and
700 right but we want the window to be
dynamic
so for that
we will set the width and height above
only
so we will write a variable width
and
set the width as 1400
and
equal to 720 pixels
now
in the geometry function
we would declate the dynamic variables
that would
take the width and height
from here
and set the geometry
first we'll clear that
and for dynamic
right
and inside we'll write the width
rows and that would be the height
we can add a new file and name it as
configure
Dot py
and inside that
we will paste these diameters
and we will import this file
that would be import
configure
and using that file only
we will set our
show here we will set it as
configure dot width
that is we are importing width from the
configure file
configure module
and here height also from the configure
module
so yeah
now we'll save this and run it
you can see that the window has taken
the geometry function and
made its diameters according to that
only that is width equal to 1400 and the
height is equal to 720.
now we'll set the title of the window
for that we'll write the command true to
Titan
and inside we will write
the title you want for this game that
would be mine sweeper game
and will also
use another function that would be
resizable
and make this
as note resizable that will prohibit to
resize the window
it would have the particular diameters
that we have defined
so to make that project
we will pass
volts and Folds to the resizable
function
and save this
and run it
so you could see that the title has
changed to main super game
and the window is not resizable now so
we can't see the arrow if we just hover
the cursor
on the edges of the window
you need not able to see that Arrow
so the window has set as note resizable
and now
in the window only
as I have shown you the demo first we
will create a frame here
and inside that frame we will have a
title that would be the Minesweeper game
and the count of the tiles that would be
on the board
and inside another frame that would be
just beneath this Frame we would set the
cells of the board all the cells number
of cells that we're going to have in the
board
so for that
first we'll create a frame
for our heading and the number of
tiles or the number of cells
so for that we will
create a variable and named as top frame
and using the frame widget
and we will pass the root inside it and
set the background color with the help
of the command BG equal to
and we'll set the color as Gray
and now we'll set the width and height
of the frame
so we can also set the width and height
with the normal method that is we can
write the pixels and we can also use the
percentage method
so for that
to fold that
we will create a file
and name it as new DOT py
and inside that we will import the
height and width
that was stored in configured.py
so we will write import
configure
and here we will Define functions for
height and the width percentage so in
the whole window if we want to set the
frame height or width we'll just set the
percentage or pass the percentage
so for that we will create the function
and named as height
underscore
prcd that would be percentage and inside
will pass the percentage
that we want to
have in the whole window
and we would do it on
that would be
configured Dot
8
and that would be divided by 100
into
percentage
so this is the function that we have
defined for the height
and now similarly
we will Define it for width
with underscore
yes ID we'll name this
and we'll pass the percentage for width
and in return
you will get
configure dot width
and that would be divided by 100
and then we'll multiply it with
percentage
so this is how we would be defining the
height and width for the following
frames or for the following any widget
in our tick enter window and in our the
project that is the main sweep project
and moving to the main.py file
here we are creating the
frame and now we'll set its height and
width
so to set the width
we will set it inside
this only
so
right width that would be equal to
configure
Dot
width
that is we are importing the width from
the configure that is the
parameter of x axis so we want that
frame to be in the whole taken term
window so for that we have imported
configured out width that was 1400.
and
the fourth height
we will import from the new file that
would be new
and we have to import this new file also
here
of course that will write import new
and now
new DOT
it underscore percentage you will just
write the percentage
for what we want to have the frame
height
so we will set it as 25.
we will save this
and run it
so you would be able to see
first we'll change the color so that
you guys would be able to see the frame
okay first we will place some widgets
over there so that you can
see the frame
first we'll place this
news third place geometry function here
for that we'll write the variable name
to open The Score frame and use the
place geometry widget
and inside we will pass it as x equal to
0 and
y equal to 0.
so after placing this you would be able
to see
a frame in the window
that is you can see that the width equal
to 1400 and height we have set it as 25
percent of the whole window
that was 25 of the 720.
so this is how we set the dynamic
height and width for our widgets
and now moving on
we will set the game title
foreign
and by the way guys uh we have taken
some reference from the pre-code camp
so now
we will set the game title
and put that we would create a label
we have used the label widget here
that is capital l a b e l and inside
would pass the top frame
that is the variable
in which we have created the frame
so we have passed it so that the label
that should be over or shifted on to the
top frame only
and after top frame we will pass
VG that would will set the background
color
for this label and we'll set it as
black
and we'll set the foreground color
as white
and now we will write the text that we
want to display
so we'll use text
equal to
lines sweeper
in game and now we will set the font
for the heading
for the title
put that tool right font
equal to and inside the circular
brackets
we would set the default font
and the font size as 48.
and no
we will place this
will use the place geometry widget to
place this label on the frame
so for that
we would use the variable game
underscore title
and use the place widget dot place
we will
set the coordinates in the place
geometry widget
and
put that right
x equal to and we'll set it in between
so for that we'll write x equal to
that is we will
use the function from the new file new
DOT
with underscore
percentage
and set the percentage as 25
and why that would be equal to 0.
10 error
okay we haven't placed the comma here
so now we'll save this
and run it
so you can see that we have the title
here that is my simple game
so here
and we will just change the background
color
to that
we'll use the hexa code for that color
that would be
I call it
light violet or light blue
you guys can differentiate which color
it is so I have the extra code for that
that is 5D
60 70.
so I have set the frame
also the label
I'll save this and run it so you guys
can see that
the color of the
background of the title has been changed
and it's light blue I guess
and we will
have the same color
in the frame for background
foreign
position
and when it goes so this is
the color for the frame and we have just
shifted it with the five percentage that
is the total is 1400 we have started it
from 30 to 1400.
so x value is 30 of 1400 and Y value is
0.
now
now we'll create
now we will create another frame that is
for the board
of the game
so for that we will create a variable
and name it as
Center frame
Center underscore frame
and
for that we'll use the widget
frame
and inside we will pass root
and after root we will set the
background color
as black
and
we'll also set the width and height of
the frame
so for width
prove it will use the percentage
function for that we will use the new
file
so that would be new DOT
with underscore percentage
and inside will pass the percentage and
we will
as the percentages
75
so the width of this Frame would be 75
percent of 1400.
and now we will set the height
we would set the height in the next line
I'm going to set the
height
that would be equal to
we will also use the percentage function
here for that we'll use new DOT
height underscore
percentage and inside we will pass the
percentage
and that would be 75 percent of the 720
pixels
now
we will
use the place geometry widget and place
this Frame
for that
we will write
X parameter and that would be
using the percentage function only so
for that we will write new DOT
width underscore
percentage and inside we will pass the
percentage as 30.
and for y dimension
we will also use the
percentage function and for that we'll
write new note
height underscore
PR
CT and inside we will pass
30 unit 30 percent
of the total height
that is 720.
and moving on
now we will create the cells of the
board
but first we'll show what we have done
till now
so this is the frame here and we have
set the title as mine super game and
here we will create the total count for
the cells and here we have also created
a frame
and we have set the background color as
black only so you won't be able to
differentiate that
so for a time being
we will make the color as white
and run it for you guys
so that you can differentiate
so this is the frame uh we have started
it
from 30 percent
just see
that was 75 percent we have
the width and 75 percent as height and
we have started from 30 percent of the
total width so we have started from the
30 of the total width here
so we have set the
Place method from 30 of the total width
now moving on
we will create the board and then the
buttons in it so we can click it and
find out the which number is there or
is there a mine
so for that we will create a file
and name it as unit
Dot py
so inside this unit dot py file
we will create the class self and we'll
create this class so that we can
name it a cell and because we know that
for each cell we also like to give some
attributes that is if the cell is mine
or not
or if this is a cell that is already
open or is it closed so that's exactly
the time that it is a great idea
thinking about creating a class
and we'll name it as
cell
so for that first we will import the
module
from taken to
import all the classes
and here we would also import
your random module
and import
new file with the new module
and import the configure
and also import the C types
and one more import sys
now we'll create a class and name it as
cell
and inside the class we will
create the variable all
and
initialize it
and now we will
create an init function
and inside that will pass self
and a variable
that would indicate whether this L is
mine or node
so first is underscore
mine and first we'll set it as false
only
now inside this
foreign
and that is equal to is
underscore mine
and now we will create the button object
so the cells of the board
would be like the button only when we
click on it whether it's a mind or it's
a number
so for that we will create a
function and name it as create
underscore button underscore
object
and inside will pass self
and the location where we want to place
the button
and here we will create a button will
create a variable BTN and inside we'll
use the button widget
and inside this widget
first we'll pass the location
and I will tell you how we'll set the
location for that and that will set in
the main file only
and we'll set the width
that would be equal to 12. and
height
that would also be equal to 12.
or no height I want
I don't want to create the square
buttons
so height equal to 4
and now here
we will use
pattern dot bind
that is
here we will use the mouse functions
and for that
[Music]
these brackets
and
button one that is the left button
and
for that
write the functioning
self taught
I will create a function for that and
we'll name it as left underscore
click under selections
and that would be for the left button
and similarly
we would use the bind function for
right button
and to Target the right pattern
of the mouse will use button
three
and we will create a function for its
functionality
and name it as write
underscore click underscore actions
now after binding
the functions to the left click and the
right click we will Define these left
click actions and the rightly actions
but before that
we will Define another function
and name it as
show mines
show underscore mine
and inside will pass self
and inside
we will use self Dot
cell underscore
button underscore object
first we will declare this
and inside the init
function only will declare this
self Dot
cell button object
equal to none
here we have created the object for the
button
that is we will create all the cells as
button only
and now we will configure this
so that will use configure
and inside
we will
use background color as red for mines
like if we detect the mind we'll be
seeing the red color we would click the
left click and if it's a mine it will
show show info box else
so if you click the mine it would show
the background color as red
and now
if you clicked on a mine the game would
be over for that you will use
C types
LL Dot user32
and we will call the message box here
message box w
and inside we will pass 0 comma
and the text
you clicked on a mine
play again
and pass another parameter that is zero
and after that we will exit the
system and for that
I'll use system dot exit
and now we will create a function
if we click on a mine so we should get
all the boxes where there is a
possibility to gather get a mine
oh
to get to guys understand I'll just run
this
and this is our game if I click on this
box
that is you click on mine and uh
game gets over
okay
so my luck is not so good so yeah I
clicked on this so these are the boxes
that have the possibility of getting a
mind so we can right click this
and
get them sorted so we will get all these
coordinates so that they would help us
assuming that there would be a mind
so we will Define a function for that
we will get back to our code
and we will
create a function that would be
surrounded cells
surrounded underscore
cells and pass self in it
and inside we will create
cells equal to
and here we will get self Dot
get underscore
we have to create
a function
get cell by access or we can name it
anything we will create cell by access
only
so first we will
create this function that would be get
cell by access that it will help us to
get the access or get the coordinates of
the button
so for that we will Define a function
and name this
I mean get
well
so
if I
access
and inside will pass self
and X and Y coordinates and if we enter
these coordinates we'll get the cell
and inside
we will run a loop first we need a SIM
it's very cold in here
and now we'll run a loop that will be
four
cell
that is the class name
cell.tool
if
cell dot X would be equal to
X
X and
cell dot y
equal to y
then return the cell
okay
if that cell is present what we have
passed as the x and y coordinate then we
would get the silent return
and now to get the surrounded cells
so and we will pass
x coordinate that would be self protects
minus 1
as if you see
we would be following the grid method
and that would be the columns and the
rows so this is 0 0
this is
on the x-axis we are going with this is
1 comma 0
2 comma zero three comma zero four comma
zero five comma zero
and that's it so this would be 5 comma
2.
okay
so to get the coordinates
uh like for this
we would just subtract it that would be
x minus 1 and y minus 1. for this we
would subtract x minus 1 and y minus 1.
so that would be
5 minus 1 that would be 4
and
3 minus 1 that would be 2.
so similarly we will write the
coordinates
self dot x minus 1
and for the y coordinate
we will write
self dot y
minus 1
and this is the
first one now we'll get the second one
that would be this and for this we'll do
no we'll get this first self dot x minus
1 and y coordinate would be self dot y
that is same only
so self Dot get underscore
sell underscore pi
underscore axis
and inside we will pass
the coordinates that would be
self.x minus 1
and
self dot y
and the next would be
self dot x minus 1 and cell dot y plus 1
as y coordinate has been increased by 1.
so we'll just copy this
and after playing coma
just paste it and x minus 1
and Y Plus 1.
and that would be
the
sorry I clicked on this
so
X would be same and Y has been increased
self.x and cell dot y Plus 1.
and now we'll move to the next one that
would be cell dot X Plus 1 and the Y
would be circled y Plus 1.
so we'll paste this
and that would be X plus one
and self dot y
Plus 1.
and the next would be self Dot
X Plus 1 and the Y would be same
just a second
okay you have to change it
so root X Plus 1 and set dot y
okay now it would be cell dot X Plus 1
and self dot y minus 1.
minus one okay
and this is the last one that would be
self dot x minus 1 and set dot y minus
1.
so these are all the coordinates
and at the end we will close the square
bracket
and we will
use a decorator here and that would be
the like
so now that we understood this that I am
going to move all those lines of code
into a separated method so that we could
have a property that is going to
represent the surrounded cells object
now property is basically like an
attribute that is read only
so we can Mark these attributes as
read-only attributes by using a
calculator
and we'll use a decorator that would be
using at the rate and name the
integrator as
property
that would be the read only
and we'll place a condition here
that would be
sales equal to
cell
equals cell
in cells
if
cell is not none
then we should get
sales in return
now we will create another decorator
and named as property only that would be
read only
and here we will Define a function
that would be surrounded cells mind's
length
that would be if we go to number two so
what would be the length of the mines
underscore length
and inside will pass self
and we'll set the counter
as 0
and
after that I'm going to run a loop
for cell
dot surrounded cells
that is we have just seen what would be
the surrounded cells here
surrounded cells
and then we'll
use the if condition if
cell Dot
is mine if it's a mine then we'll
increase the counter
that would be counter
plus equal to 1
and we'll return the counter
and now before moving on
we will create some other
variables
that would be
and before that we should Define the
grid size
that is how much it should be boxes on
the board
we are
using the square only
so we'll make the grid size as six
and we'll also Define
style count
and that would be equal to
great underscore size
to the power 2
and
the minds count
which should be the mains count
it should equal to
cell count
and
floor division so that it should be a
integer only
by four
and moving to unit dot pyth file again
now we'll create the variables
and if it is mine if it's a mine and
button object
now we'll get if the
button is opened
and we'll set it as poles only
and we'll create another
that is
is
mine candidate that is if
we have
oh sorry
that is if we have clicked on a
button or a cell and a number comes out
and if it's two then what are the
chances that the other boxes can be a
candidate to be a mind
so
we will
also set it as false
and we have set the button object equal
to none
and here we'll set cell dot x equal to X
and
cell dot y equal to y
and we will pass X and Y init
okay
here we will
get the cell count
for that
we'll use the configure file
in which you have decided
entered them
cell count so for that
values configure
Dot
cell underscore count
and then we'll create another variable
variable that would be
cell underscore
count underscore
label underscore object
and set it as
and then
and at first
will
append the list that would be append
object to the cell dot or list for that
we'll write cell dot Old Dot
append
and inside will pass self
now we will
create the functions for left and right
click actions
so for that we will create a function
and we'll name it as
left
click actions
and insideward pass self
and event
and if
is underscore mine
so we will self taught
show mine
else
if
self Dot
surrounded
cells
Minds
length equal to equal to zero
and we will set it in the condition only
and inside we will run a for Loop
for cell underscore
check
in
in self Dot
surrounded cells
cell underscore object
Dot
no underspose cell
taught
show underscore cell
and if minds count is equal to the
cell's left count then the player will
be worn
so
we will write if
cell Dot
tell underscore
count
equal to equal to
settings Dot
and it's not setting let's configure
dot mines underscore count
so
so we will do c types
Dot
window
user
32
root
message box
W and inside will pass zero
and then congratulations
you won the game
over
and then would pass zero
and now will unwind
the mouse
clicks so self taught
cell underscore
button under score object
out and bind
and will unbind the left key first
you have to move button minus
one
and then we'll
unwind
the second key
that is the right key
button three
and now
now we will create a function for show
cell
so for that
we will create the function
show cell and pass self in it
and inside
to write if
not
self
dot is opened that we have already
assigned as false
if it's not open then
the class cell Dot
cell underscore count
minus equal to 1.
now
and cell dot cell button object will
configure it
send underscore button underscore
object
and configure this
pass the text
as
cell Dot
surrounded
underscore cells
let's go mines
underscore length
man now we'll put a foundation
if
cell Dot
that is cell count level object
we will just configure it
remote configure
inside will pass text equal to
Lambda
[Music]
that would be cells
left
so we have created the function for show
cell that is in the first frame we will
be having the title that would be the
main sweeper game and then we will
having the how much cells are left
so we have created the function for that
and here
we will configure this
self dot cell underscore
button underscore object
dot configure
and we'll set the background color
and we'll set the background color as
white
oh self
Will Change is open equal to true
now it has been opened
we have clicked on that
and we have turned it as true
now we have created the function for the
show cell so if we click on the cell and
if it's not open then the count would be
-1
and now we have configured it
was planning mistake
and we have configured it
and at last we have set it as true
now we will Define the function for the
right click actions so we will name it
as right underscore
click underscore actions
and inside will pass self
and an event
if
not
self
tote is mine candidate if it snows the
candidate
we will set this as true
else
so
let me repeat yeah
if not self dot is main candidate
then
we will configure the button object and
for that we'll write self taught
cell underscore
button underscore object
now we'll configure it
and set the background color
as Orange
and now
set the is mine candidate to true
so for that we'll write self taught
is underscore mind underscore candidate
and set it as
true
how else
we will set the configuration for the
cell button object
for that we'll write
self taught
cell underscore button underscore object
and we'll configure it
and we'll set the background color as
White
and now we will
set the is main candidate to false
so for that we'll write self taught is
underscore mine underscore
candidate
and set it as poles
and now we will Define a static method
or
the randomization of the minds so that
we can get the minds in a random way
so first we'll create a decorator
and a static method
and inside this we will create a
function
s
and inside this we will create a
function
and name it as randomize
Minds
and inside that we will
create a variable and name it as picked
underscore cells
that is we will pick the cells that
would be converted to random mines
we will use the random function here
that would be random
or the random module that would be
random Dot
sample
and inside will pass cell dot all that
is
we can choose that the random function
would choose any from all the cells
and the second variable you will be
passing would be
configure Dot
mines underscore count
and that was in capital
and inside we will run a for Loop
so that it would choose mine
so for picked underscore cell
in picked cells
foreign
[Music]
and at last
we would
create a
function
and by itself in it
and return a Lambda function
that would be cell
and self protects
self.y
it's now moving to the main.py file
now we'll set the grid size here
with that will
run a loop for X in
range
configure Dot
grid size
and four
Y in
range
configure Dot
grid size
and inside we will create an object for
the class c equal to
cell and inside will pass the parameters
X comma y
and first we have to import it
import
unit
now
you will
create
button object
turn underscore
object
and inside
will pass Center frame
as these
would be there in the center frame only
and now
the errors so
okay
so from unit we will import
cell class
and Center underscore
frame
and there's a spanning mistake for
Center
so it will be Center underscore frame
and now we would set the grid geometry
that would be C Dot
where undersport button underscore
object
and reduce the grid geometry
and set the
column
as X
and row
as y
now
we'll call the label from the cell class
so that will write cell Dot
create
underscore cell
in the score count
underscore label
and inside will pass top frame
for the count of the remaining cells as
we have seen earlier
and for that
we will write cell Dot
cell underscore
account underscore label
let's go checked and use the place
geometry method
and x equal to
we have
Red Top functions
in new files so x equal to new DOT
wet underscore percentage and inside
will pass the percentage we pass it as
42
and that is underscore
and comma y
y equal to Nu Dot
right
underscore
percentage
and will pass as 15 percent
and we need that we will call the
randomize
Mains function cell Dot
randomize
underscore mines
so
our game is ready now we will run the
main.py file we will save this and run
it
so you could see that our game
is running fine
so we have clicked on a mine
so we have run it again so we have
clicked on the second column so it shows
that there would be three Minds
so this this this and this is a
candidate
for being a mind
and we are taking this we will click on
this
game over we click no never mind
so guys our project is ready
uh game is ready
so guys our project is ready and our
game is running fine
