hello everyone uh
my name is dr raina joshi and i have
done my master's in dental surgery from
conservative and endodontics from manuba
patel dental college
today's topic that we'll be discussing
uh would be pulpitis
and the inflammation within the pulp and
how this inflammation induces the pain
and
how we can clinically diagnose it based
upon the signs and symptoms
and so we may come up with the decision
making
in our clinical scenario and lead to a
successful
uh treatment outcome so to know that
basically first we must know that what
is called bending complex what is the
pulpal vascular nature
how the regulation of blood flow occurs
what is the
neural innervation and how this neural
innervation leads
to contributes to the inflammation and
the pain symptoms
and what is this equally leading to
purple implementations and
how this uh sequelae leads to the pain
which leads to peripheral sensitization
central synthesization and
depending on that what types of purple
injury and types of pulpitis
we have and how we could clinically
diagnose the patient
and how we would go for the clinical
approach to this
diagnosis so coming up to the
introduction part as we know
that albitus is equals to
inflammation to the dental pulp so pulp
itself is a very complex organ
and it is richly innervated highly
muscular rated
however in spite of that
it has a good capacity of preserving its
integrity through the pulp dentin
complex
but it's always that the dental pulp is
enclosed
within a mineralized rigid space that
and it is inextensible
right if we have a normal spelling on
skin we can get edema
but in such case it is already rigid so
there are no chances of edema
in cases of pulpal inflammation so this
is the one aspect
which leads to decreased pulpal
resistance
for heat's healing capacity next we have
that the source of blood
supply is through the arteries that
enter through a relatively very
restricted
apical opening right and the venules
also exit through the same opening
so it's a very small area
through which it enters and goes and
also it lacks the collateral circulation
which makes it difficult to survive
during that times of inflammation so the
most
important aspects we will consider that
we consider
it is a highly resistant organ
which is encased within the imminent
pulp but
also it is considered as least
resistance with least healing capacity
when there is an increased pulpal
inflammation
so two most important components that
are responsible
for the impulpitus they are the vascular
component and they are the neural
component
so the vascular component are the
component which will receive which will
lead
to the stimulation of the neural
component and neural component in turn
will give us the clinical signs and
symptoms
or will respond or lead to some changes
within the vascular component in some or
the other aspects
so in this way both vascular component
in individual neural component
individually play a role in the pulpit
inflammation however
they are intermingled with each other to
produce the sign and
symptoms clinically so
we must learn both the components and
their contribution for the
inflammation know that we first and
foremost thing that we know must know
that this is the perpending complex
the firefighting complex basically
consists of dentine organoblastic
process
predent in there uh that is the cell
freeze on the salvage zones where the
free
no endings enter the code under plastic
process inside
so if we talk about the odento plastic
cells
they are the one of the most unique
cells that we have in the dental pulp
and that the first
line of the cell defense cells which the
pulp will encounter so whenever we
having
carries it will come to enable it will
come to dentine so if what the
inventing we will have the advantage of
plastic cells which will the ones
to receive they returned and when it the
noxious stimuli
invades the rectangle tubules so they
are considered the first
most antigen recognizing cells and
to the bacteria and the toxins that are
produced or the inflammatory
pro-inflammatory cytokines that are
produced so also
as they are the first recognizing cells
and they are closely associated with the
free now endings the pulp sensory nerve
endings that are present there
so they are considered to capable of
modulating the neural activity
by a paraclean signal what is mean by
paracrine signaling is
the cell to cells response that is uh
there that one cell is receiving the
response it is recognizing it is giving
a response it is transforming to the
adjacent cell
and accordingly the
response is being transmitted so in this
way
order the plastic cells they can modify
the
local purple micro environment and
also may contribute to the healing
process
in some other aspects so
once the it is being recognized so the
next component that we have is pulpal
vascularity
so we have full mental it is richly
uh supplied and vascularized and we have
the articularis values that
arrange actually in the pulp with the
capillary loops extending out towards
the denting the range capillary plexus
that we have in the support of the
plastic layers which is well located for
the transport of
nutrients and oxygen and the need in the
functional and metabolic demands of the
authento plastic
cells as well as they also contribute in
the repair process by angiogenesis new
like neoangiogenesis of the vessels
so we have capillary capillary loops we
have terminal groups we have lymphatic
vessels we have arterial venous
anaesthetis
but as we know that there is only one
entry and one exit to go
it collects the collateral circulation
there is if
one vessel is damaged it is not
something that
that there is some another way through
which the
uh circulation or the supply or blood
supply or the demand is being
compensated so that's not possible in
the
purple vascular nature within the pulp
so how do we regulate through this
pulpit blood flow
since pulping is regulated through
various aspects so most of the times
as we have in the normal inflammation
uh the first most response that we have
that is increased capillary pressure
increased hydrostatic pressure that
leads to vasodilation right
so most of the components leads to
visodilation however
we have some components like sympathetic
fibers
and the trigeminal efferent fibers which
may have negative impact and which may
have a positive impact and cause the
vasoconstriction so uh
rather than producing vasoconstrictions
we have the more factors leading to more
vasodilation
and which may in turn sometimes
prove to be fatal because of because
they are not able to compensate
and filter and do the capillary
reabsorption
right that leads to the pressure within
the pulp and may lead to
uh pulpal necrosis
right so how the blood flow occurs
during the inflammation so whenever
there is a
inflammation must first thing as we know
vasodilation occurs as vasodilation
occurs what the other thing
comes along with the azo dilation is
increased vessel permeability as
it happens in normal inflammatory
process
right so once vasodilation occurs that
would be increased blood capillary
pressure as there is increased blood
capillary pressure
also there would be increased capillary
filtration because of increased vascular
permeability
right now all this together
will lead to increased fluid volume
within the pump
so the this increased flowing volume
within the pulp
will further increase the tissue
pressure
and this increase in tissue pressure
will lead to
uh operation
of the venues this compression of the
values will again increase the vanish
pressure
and there would be again the increased
blood capillary pressure
and the vicious cycle of
the inflammation would go on and on
right
but this can be stopped or this
can be stopped how we can stop that
there are two ways to
it the increased tissue pressure will
increase the fluid volume the increased
fluid volume will increase the capillary
free traction
and uh this reverse cycle goes on
the other way we have is that there
could be a
there would be due to this increased
tissue pressure that would be absorption
of the excess amount of fluid into the
non-inflamed area another thing is we
have the lymphatics that pass by along
with the blood vessels to absorb the
interstitial fluid
and then the lymphatics would be would
be drained through this lymphatics
and the the blood volume
will be returned to its normal state and
it can be stopped however in cases of
extreme inflamed condition if this does
not
occur then this spacious cycle will go
on
and it will act as a self strangulation
right
so what happens is we are we are
by our own inflammation only we are self
strangulating
that is of the pulpal blood flow and
that
which is increasing the pressure again
and again and it is finally leading to
pulpal necrosis right so it is
most important for to us that when at
the initial stage where we have the
facility
of capillary filtration and we have the
facility of absorption and all
we must take some actions to preserve
the pulp and prevent the
necrosis right so how this
occurs that whenever uh there is a
response within the pulp
uh right so there is a localization of
the pulpal inflammation and micro
circulation so how this
occurs is that we have a robust
physiological feedback local control
mechanism
which opens the shunt vessels and what
happens this is that there is an
increased tissue pressure within the
pulp
and there is an inflammation starts as
this occurs
there would be the opening of the shunt
of the adjacent
lymphatics so all of the interstitial
fluid
would be reabsorbed into the existence
through the lymph flow and through the
non inflamed
areas so this occurs and
thus the inflammation stays only
at the local side and is not extending
ahead and ahead and overall even if it
is extending it is a very slow
process so it has been studied in the
various studies
and they have proved that that
the pulmonary special fluid pressure
remains normal
in the adjacent pulp tissue this 1 to 2
mm
distance to the inflamed area so
if the inflammation is in the pulp
chamber then it will rely on the
chamber for up to 1 to 2 mm distant
areas more than 2 mm the pulp
flow and the inflammation was normal or
there was a mild inflammation
so this is the inflamed area and other
part is mildly inflamed
right so if we remove the irritant at
this point of time
then it is we have a chance that the
pulp may return to is the normal state
so this is the initial stage where we
can say this is the reversible stage of
the pulpal inflammation
where we may get minimal moments of
signs and symptoms through pain which we
will discuss further in this
lecture and this forms the basis
that as the pulp is responding in a very
compartmentalized manner
systematic 1mm 2ml the next one m2mm
and it is not just spreading massively
at a
single go so this local inflammation of
the pulmon
control and regulation by the micro
circulation within the pulp
through is the is what forms the basis
of the vital pulp therapy pulp repair
and pulp regeneration
then we can see the here where deep
carries approaching the pulp
and if we have a heterogeneic pulpal
exposure
so in that cases we can remove the
we can irritate or we can do the swag
pulpotomy
just of the removing that much amount of
1 to 2 mm of the
pulp chamber which is or the carious
portion of the pull
and we can just put a medical mat and we
can
go for the healing in this way the
this is the reason the localization of
the purple inflammation is the reason
for the vital pulp therapy
right so we must know it
that how we can correlate it clinically
next week is that once we have learned
about the vascular
component now then we will come upon how
neural component within the pulp
contribute
towards the inflammation and how they
are responsible
and they mingle with the vascular
component in producing the signs and
symptoms that is
pain so right the
now supply to the tissues or the dental
branches we have it through the
trigeminal now
that is by the maxillary branch we have
the superior
dental plexus through superior alveolar
now that divides from posterior middle
and anterior
and we have it through the inferior
argument now
uh and this and the mental now
which forms the uh dental branches and
inferior dental plexus
which finally enters from the particle
foramen
and in the core region we have the c
fibers which are unmyelinated
and we have the a delta and a beta
fibers which are the
myelinated nerve fibers right so and
they are present in the pulp horn
in the free now endings and the free
odentoglastic process they en
end up into this errandoblastic process
so these are the first most fibers they
are the nose receptor fibers right
what do we mean by no receptor fibers
that they can induce
pain only right so they will induce pain
and uh to the response response to the
stimuli right and uh uh
so they are the first most ada dynamita
fibers are the first most fibers they
would be receiving the sensory uh
signals through the stimulus whenever
the organ the plastic process
are affected so this sensory fibers as
we know
that a data fibers they are the fast
conducting
most conducting fibers and they have the
higher amount of velocity
and they are uh they respond to pain
temperature
and touch function as a pain temperature
and touch and they are activated by air
blast heat pole
drilling probing or hypo hispanic
procedures a beta fibers are also
there so they respond to pressure and
touch
and they are activated by vibration we
must remember
that which fibers are activated by what
to understand that how the pain
signallings are good
and other fibers we know that that there
are a delta fibers there is no fibers
and they are activated by inflammatory
mediators
however all these fibers produce a pain
that is fast
sharp short lasting it is non-lingering
and it is well localized
right but we have these are the
myelinated
fast conducting fibers we have another
non-myelinated c fibers
they have points for they are inflate
they are activated by
inflammatory mediators that are intense
that
by intense heat and cold or slow
and they are characterized by slow
dilating pain probing long-lasting
lingering and their spontaneous
right and so a dietary fibers are
basically
oxygen sensitive so in cases of hypoxia
they would be the first ones to get
destroyed and to get
uh dead so it is the real
and they have a low threshold right
on other hand c fibers they have they
are more have
high threshold and they are less
sensitive to oxygen presence of oxygen
so they are the ones that even sometimes
what happens that
uh pulse chamber we may not feel pain
but during
biomechanical preparation we when we
enter the canal
these fibers are responsive and may
induce pain
when we are fighting through the
procedure or removing the pulp in
between
so uh this forms the basis that
as uh inflammation progresses
the fibers which will be active during
this point of time would be more
would be c fibers in the intense
inflammation case
right so next we have are the neurogenic
mediators
so this neurogenic mediators they are
basically
they are induced and activated through
the sensory nerve terminals by the
vascular component
so right vascular component leads to
inflammation
inflammation activates sensitizes the
nerve
endings this nerve endings will lead to
release of this
neuropeptides which we are called and
this neuropeptides
are leads to certain functions like
vasodilation vasoconstriction
and or they may lose substance fee
and inhibit the pain or something and
ah so they play an important role
in increasing the inflammation and
passing the
nausea sector impulses to further
pathways of pain
through spinal cord and thyromus right
so this forms the basis of neurogenic
inflammation so neuropeptides
forms the basis of neurogenic
inflammation
okay so what is this neurogenic
inflammation basically
that we have both myelinated and
unmyelinated sensory axons
stored within the uh that store the
this pro-inflammatory neuropeptides in
their terminals
so whenever there is pulpal inflammation
this
sensory exons stimulate and
stimulate this neuropeptides this neural
peptides will be
released due to this activation of this
nose receptors
so ideally what this and they are
supposed to do
is they are supposed to uh create a
go through a normal orthodontic pathway
that is they are supposed to go
conduct the impulses and reach through
the trigeminal
nuclei and uh and the higher brain
sensor
to evoke the pain sensation right but
what happens is sometimes that
they go for an endodromic pathway and to
the side at which the injuries occur or
the side at which the
cells are present and they will release
the
they will release the calcitonin
generated peptide and substance p
and then vasculature aspect point only
so rather than going as we can see in
the video
that it is the impulses are generated
and they must go to the central nervous
system however
this impulses rather than going to the
central nervous system
they don't they go to the site
of the blood vessels and side of the
cells
and release this neural peptides at
their site and increase
the inflammation so the inflammation
which is produced due to the nose
receptor impulses
activation is known as neurogenic
inflammation right now once this
neurogenic inflammation occurs
this leads to increase in the pulpal
inflammation
now this comes the neural aspects and we
must now go that how
it induces to the pain eventually
through the
uh pull so the sequences of events that
leads to this pulpit inflammation
we have a bacterial exposure that will
lead to the release of toxins like
liposaccharides and
the other endotoxins and exotoxins by
the bacteria and the debris and
everything
so this will uh sensitize the free nerve
endings at the one end
and then second and it will activate the
immune system
right so this this sensitive free nerve
endings and the immune systems are
activated
this activated sensitive uh
free now endings will release the
neuropeptides calcitonin gene related
peptide and substance p
and on the other aspects it will inherit
the
go and send the impulses to the
trigeminal
nuclei this leads to the vasodilation of
the
blood vessels by the neuropeptides and
it will induce neurogenic inflammation
okay as we have discussed before on
other hand
the inner system which immune system
which is activated
will further release the inflammatory
mediators
by arachidonic acid pathways
and that is cox 1 and cox 2 and
it's increasing prostaglandins
prostacyclin
cytokines bradythinine and all those
functions and this inflammatory
mediators
will lead number one towards dilation as
we know
and vasoconstrictions uh by prostate
cycling
and also all these three aspects
will lead to symptoms of induced
pain so this is the way that there is an
activation
of inflammation occurs inflammation
activates the free no endings and
the whole cycle goes on to induce the
so as this is the same as being depicted
indian diagram this diagram is
given in uh angle so this is the point
where the initial inflammation has
occurred
and this initial inflammation is the
point where we
are supposed to this is the first order
neuron
uh pathway through which the pain
had pain is being transferred
leading to the symptoms now if we at
this point of time we do not control the
pain
then what occurs that repeated
stimulation occurs repeated stimulation
occurs repeated irritation occurs
and this repeated irritation will lead
to some
of the phenotypic changes the physical
or the morphological changes within the
free now endings itself so this spring
changes which leads to the free now
endings
it's known as peripheral sensitization
so just like you know
you tease a person for one time to time
three times the person it will ignore
kind of anything
but if you provoke that person
repeatedly for 10 to 15 times or 50
times you know
eventually the person gets sensitive to
that
matter if you tease a fat person you are
fat you are fat you are fat and then
eventually they will feel that okay we
are fat and
so even if the 50 one time you
tell that person were felt rather they
would be taking it lightly they would
respond to in a very strong way in a
very head strong way
in a very anger so this same thing
happens with our peripheral
sensitization
so how this occurs is number one
uh by
morphological changes that is it will
lead
by sprouting of the free non-endings
as we can see the dendritic free now
endings will be sprouting then the
extensions will be increasing
the next thing that could happen to them
is by
increasing the amount of neuropeptide
release
right previously five neuropeptides were
released there would be approximation
more number of neuropeptides will be
releasing
which is increasing the neurogenic
inflammation the third thing that may
happen would be demyelination of the
no fibers or a part of a nerve fibers
which will increase its sensitivity
and sometimes we have the awakening of
the silent non-receptors
so what is this awakening of the silent
nausea scepters
as we talked is uh
that and we talked about a delta slow
fibers so this
a data slow fibers are activated by the
inflammatory medial stress
so previously they were silent but now
they are also getting sensitized
and they are increasing the amount of
pain
so this is what is peripheral
sensitization
leading to the symptoms of pulpitis
so how this is
represented clinically is by elodina
that is decreasing the firing thresholds
of the for detecting the painful stimuli
so
there would be pain tenderness and
percussion on chewing and diagnostic
purpose and so
the most common uh
complaint the patient will come that oh
i cannot eat
through this side you know as soon as i
chew i have a pain so we must know that
it is a
kind of an it's a illumination the next
thing that would be in hyperalgesia
that is increase the enhanced painful
sensation to the previously
non painful senses so this is the really
exaggerated response this
is to the pulse sensibility testing is
known as a
hyperessasia another thing would be a
spontaneous
firing of the nose receptor that would
be
contributed so this is the spontaneous
pain
that is being produced so it's these are
the three clinical
symptoms that we can get to know that it
is a stage where peripheral
sensitization has
been occurred and this most commonly
gives us an idea that
all the pulpit inflammation is going
towards the
irreversible state right so
how we will go that patient is not able
to chew on that side secondly it doesn't
exaggerated response
to the sensibility testing and or the
patient complaints of a
spontaneous pain now even if we do not
take any actions during this point of
time now
this will respond to the the strongest
painful sensation
goes towards the central sensitization
right
so what is this state of central changes
that now the second order or the third
order neurons will come into the picture
so till peripheral sensitization
uh what we know is a patient is having
pain
but patient can localize the now what
happens is there is a problem
bombardment of the
nose receptive signals you know the
irritation is going on going on going on
with the c fibers
so what will c fibers do it will go and
report to the thalamus
in the medullary dorsal horn in the
spinal cord which is
in the corneal portion so it will tell
that you know it is doing
this and it will release the glutamate
and substance speed there
so this release will increase the
upregulation of the central
receptors and the central virtual
receptors within this medullary dolson
hall will upregulate and send the
sensations
through the spinothalamic threat which
is responsible for the producing pain
and pain perception to the thalamus and
the cerebral cortex that is the third
order neuron response
right so now this
all aspects will lower the
threshold of the mechanoceptors that are
present
within the thalamus and
this low threshold mechanoreceptors
which are present
within the thalamus and the local
circuit neurons
and the wider dynamic rule ones which
are present within the spinal cord
will lead to a type of pain sensation
how they will lead to the pain sensation
is
this local circuit neurons they will
decrease the plane threshold
right next the wider dynamic range
neurons
they are specifically responsible for
uh signaling the
cbrd and the location of pain that okay
it is mild moderate
is very much like you know on y scale as
we measure
so these are responsible for that so now
as this dynamic neurons what they supply
they supply to the superficial part and
they are
they stimulate the deep part whenever
they supply to the superficial part the
pain is usually localized
and as their receive input
and repeated input now the pain affects
the deeper areas of the tooth
and thus it will lead to the
also affect the superficial plus the
deeper areas along with that
so this central sensitization which will
go to the thalamus will
increase the amount of mechanical
endodynamia
will lead to there was the lower
threshold was already there
it will no lower the threshold more than
the previous one so that will lead to
secondary hyperalgesia
and it will lead to referred pain so
previously we were able to know that
okay it is 3
6 i am having pain in three six it's a
spontaneous made in three six
it is a nightmare in three six but still
eventually what happens is i am having
pain in lower region which region
i don't understand right so that is the
state
where the pain has reached its peak to
the
severe uh through the central
sensitization
part so what affects the cell referred
pain
is the central sensitization through the
wider dynamic neurons
and the local circuit neurons that we
may need to
understand and this means that it has
increased this is the state of the
severe inflammation that is
being present in the pulp leading to the
pain if we do not take actions at this
point of time
also there are high chances that we may
this condition will lead to the pulpal
necrosis
right so depending upon the dead we have
the type of pulpal
injury that is the least damaging type
like shallow cavity preparation shallow
scaling and all
and type 2 we have a most extensive
dental injuries the injurious circle
there is a local vascular response
but pulp has capacity to repair itself
and form a reparative denting
so these are the stages first type one
and two this indicates
the deep dental uh like for type two we
have deep dentinal cavity small
purple exposures heat stimulation and
all so type 1 and type 2 other stages
as we have known are considered as a
reversible stage of purple
damage and if the enough purple
uh now local repair is not possible so
this is the irreversible state so type 3
injury
is a and type 4 injury is a irreversible
state in type 4 even the periodontal
tissues are involved
and periodically tissues are also
involved
and that is other tissues in addition to
the dentinan pulse so these are the
irreversible stage of the pulpit
where we might we have to go for
uh root canal treatment however in cases
of type one and two
we may consider for the restorations or
a vital pulp therapy so clear about this
next we have is based upon this we have
the ideology which causes the pulpitis
which may be physical
chemical or bacterial so physical we
have the mechanical or the
thermal and that is by
mechanical by trauma by crack by
pathologic wear like a regional abrasion
which increases or exposes the denting
and leads to the
or perimetric changes that is
barodantalia which
reverses the pressure within the pulp
thermal we have the cavity preparation
heat exothermic heat
or the setting of the cement and all
and the bacterial toxins so these are
the etiology
which causes the multiple inflammation
based on
the different types the gradient
response of 12 pc
the types are reversible pulpit is
irreversible pulpit is
it could be symptomatic or asymptomatic
previously they called as an acute and
chronic but
acute and chronic are basically uh the
terminologies are denoted
with the duration of time whether they
are occurring
with a shorter duration 24 hours to 7
days or something
or they're occurring more than 15 days
or something so
considering a bit of controversial of
whether
the patients are sim having symptoms
better than not having symptoms and type
so better terminology has come now is a
symptomatic and asymptomatic another one
is chronic hyperplastic proprieties
so first first thing that we have is uh
the dentine hypersensitivity
so this dental hypersensitivity is the
most uh
accepted theory that we have it is the
hydrodynamic theory
which responds to the so the
hydrodynamic response to the strong
capillary force within the fine ending
tubules that occurs
leads to the rapid fluid movement this
rapid fluid movement
will uh activate the a delta fibers and
need to a sensitivity kind of pain
so whenever we blow our strong air then
or dehydration or desiccation that that
we call
that will activate the delta fibers and
induce a short
momentary kind of a pain that will lead
to a sensitivity
so this is the stage where my uh
it's affecting the dental process right
however the inflammation has not yet
occurred the next stage is the
irreversible stage
when a pulp is
capable of returning to the nuclear team
what kind of pain we have shops
shared short and sharp pin specific to a
stimulus
cold or sweet food and is instantly
relieved on the removal of stimulus and
pain occurs with extreme temperature
changes
and that is more open by a cold that is
we need to remember in this case
and what happens with the pulp
sensibility test this is the one of the
most clinical aspect we need to remember
pain will occur but it would be very
sharp and what a very very shorter
duration
of time it would not be lasting for much
lingering period of time
and radiographically the other pdl and
other
features would be absolutely normal
right next we have irreversible pulpitis
where we cannot return
to the healing we have a short term but
for a longer period of time
it maybe can have an occasional pain we
can have a
uh sensitive pain even if the mild
temperature changes are that
like for even the tap water can cause
pain
so if this is the clinical scenario that
we can ask the patients that
is it the normal water also causes pain
or view the pain occurs when you like
go for an extreme cold consumption of
water or extreme cold food
right so it is sharp severe or may
become
dull and it lingers for a longer period
of time that is more than
five minutes uh they are saying due to
with the
through the literature and
we may find that the carries are
extensive
and the breakdown is more
in such cases by thermal testing we have
a sharp painful
pain but it lingers for a longer period
of time
so and may involve medial involvement
would be there that would be widening of
medial involvement or
sometimes a particle periodontitis may
be present
in such cases chronic hyperplastic
pulpits
is a condition
which occurs young
and which occurs
during development of the granulation
tissues covered at the time with the
epithelium and results in a
long-standing low-grade irritation
which occurs so patient may be
asymptomatic and most commonly they have
a pain
when they are masticating because of the
pressure of the
opposing cast that is pro in using on
the
uh pulp polyp which is present and they
have an extensive case so
this is generally seen in children or
young adults where we see a polypoid
tissue clinically as
seen here uh the fleshy red pulpal mass
pills of the pulp chamber or cavity and
extends beyond the confines of the
teeth so particularly what diagnostic
tests
we can use for this is we have a neural
sensibility test will be
based upon the response of a data and c
fibers
and the vascularity test which will
re see the actual purple blood flow
so we have pulse oximetry laser doppler
flowmetric
and other kind of intestines we the
recent technologies we have
we are not going in detail right now for
this but how this
tests are useful to us basically thermal
tests are the pain reactions to the
extreme
temperature differences that we must
remember this is the basis
of the thermal test so we may go for a
cold test which is considered as an
ideal test for
pulp vitality or we can go for the heat
test
and uh or the pencil of ice or the highs
on the
rubber dam isolation so out of the cold
it has the most reliable
test which is considered is the co2 snow
uh that is the end of frost that we have
is the one of the
tests which can be used next we have a
heat
test to see in cases of the irreversible
pulpit is
how we can diagnose if ah through the
thermal test basically
so if the pulp is doomed normal there is
response to a stimulus provided by a
sensibility test
and this response is not uh exaggerated
it does not linger or something
it is a healthy one if we have an
exaggerated response that is producing
pain
or that produces pain right we must know
that this is pulpit
right so this if this pain
is mild and lasts for a shorter duration
we must consider every
reversible pulpit if it is severe and it
lingers for a longer period of time it
is irreversible
and if there is no response to the
my test compared to the adjacent tooth
then it is definitely a purple
necrosis or it is a tooth purple thing
or it is a previously teethed
to that we can come up to this
next we have electrical pulp test
which is the basis of electrical pulp
test we must know that it is due to the
ionic movement
so it's electrical conductivity that
causes the ionic imbalance across the
neural membrane
and this induces an action potential
and increases the rapid solidary
conduction
so additional to this neural
transmission
other things like like electric current
cannot be conducted to an iron free
solution
for example in cases of distilled water
we might have a
false response so what
response we have how we must diagnose
based upon the
electrical pulp test response so we have
a normal response that is adjacent tooth
we record the bases
at which the response was occurred that
we take as a reference
and then we take the truth which we are
diagnosing it we have same
response as to the control tooth ah
we consider it a normal truth if we have
early response
then it is reversible pulpit is if we
have a delayed response
then we have a irreversible pulpit and
if we have no response then it is a
purple necrosis
however in this case
we would always sometimes have errors
with ept
so we may have a false positive response
what is false positive response that if
even if the pulp has undergone for a
necrosis
we will get a response that it is a
inflamed
tissue for example if we have a three or
four
pulp horns and uh uh one python is
affected but the other is not affected
so we may get a response so it is a
partial necrosis of one
one part of a pulp but other pulp is
having inflammation
but we are still getting a response
where the partial pulp necrosis has
started
but still we are in the feeling that the
pulp is at the stage of
pulpit and if the isolation is not
proper if we have a metal restorations
sometimes you also get false negative
response how that even there is a
pulpit is present we think that pulp has
undergone
necrosis so which are the specific cases
we have we have the
immature pulp that is flexors of brasco
in the children is not developed the now
endings are not developed effectively
to stimulate so strongly to the
electric pulp test in the obliterated
calcific teeth
root canals in cases where we have a
recent trauma where there is a
neural injury has occurred and strong
due to this
brief period of shock we do not have a
response even if the pulpit is purple
inflammation is present
so most common amount of time
we in the routine examination we must
always go for
cold test by carbon dioxide and
combination of electrical tests but in
cases of pulpitis coal test is
considered to be
more reliable than ept and in cases of
necrotic pulp
we must go for both in cases of
purple calcifications we may go for
electrical
purpose which is more reliable than the
old test
right so based upon this clinical
scenario
we must opt for the three uh
types of diagnosis in cases of crown and
bridges
this is the most common uh clinically we
may face a problem
that uh if there is a crown and bridge
which should i do which share test
should i not do
so going to test with the help of carbon
dioxide
endo frost is considered to be the most
reliable test in crowns and bridges
so in this way we can take help of
for the diagnostic purple tests to
further diagnosis clinically how do we
approach
uh by history clinical examination
responses to pulp diagnostic tests
followed by radiographic examination
if a patient is coming to our clinic
with a history of dental health
patient may have a provoked occasional
sensitivity
to heat cold or extremely cold or extra
like most commonly too sweet and cold
or patient may come with a spontaneous
night lingering
in my or to the my temperature changes
or a patient may have no response or
patient
does not have any pain at present but
patient had pain previously
a few months before next we will go for
clinical examination
in cases of occasional pain we have a
dental carrier we may find deep dental
caries
or we may find a restoration we may find
some
break on broken restoration or crack by
on biting pressure or something so we
must rule out all this
uh the signs of crack tooth syndroming
cases
next we will come upon the pulp vitality
test which will go for thermal test and
electrical pulses in thermal test we
will get a pain
which is short sharp duration but cold
is
but we will not have any response to
heat test we must remember
right so provoked occasional sensitivity
the dental care is just extending up to
the dentine one third of dentine or
enamel
coldness we have response for a shorter
duration
not much response to heat test this
gives us an idea that okay
we are coming up to a diagnosis of a
reversible pelvis
right but uh in cases
of we are having spontaneous pain night
pain lingering pain
and either or uh
and we are having deep tendinal carries
and we have gotten called as quartz are
responsive
and positive and the pain is lasting for
longer so this gives us an idea by this
point of time
of pulpal thermal test that yes we are
uh approaching a patient which is having
irreversible perpetrators or it may have
no response
and electrical test if we have early
response
we are definitely having coming based
upon the clinical
uh aspects we are knowing that it is a
irreversible
practice and if it is having delayed
response on electrical pulp test
they are coming to the based on clinical
examination the diagnosis is
uh irreversible pulpits and if it is
having no response
and this gives us a diagnosis that the
pulp has undergone for pulping necrosis
next we will go for radiographic
examination
as we have seen that it would be
extending predenting
or then or we have normal pdl space and
everything then our diagnosis
is reversible performance if we have
signs of a bicycle period sometimes and
all and
based upon the clinical and other
aspects it is definitely irreversible
pulpitis
and if there is no response to ept no
response to thermal test and we may
find some periapicalapses apical
periodontitis and all
and periodical findings are present
basically then it's definitely telling
us that it is purple necrosis
right so this is the approach how we can
go clinically
correlate the bases and come up to a
diagnosis so as the as per a
american association of endodontic
consensus we have
normal pulp which is having a symptom
free
we have a reversible pulpit is based
upon the finding
that gives that the pulp may resolve and
return to normal we have symptomatic
irreversible pulpits
which has clinical signs and symptoms
and that is having lingering pain
spontaneous pain referred pain
we have an asymptomatic irreversible
pulpitis
as we know that is same and we have
no clinical symptoms but we have it may
be produced when we are
excavating the carries or when there is
a trauma
and we have a pulpal necrosis and a
clinically it is a
ideally purple necrosis most of the
times when we go for
our examination with themselves there is
a histological
aspect so we can have that clinically if
they are
as per this consensus the definition
says
that if they are usually non-responsive
to the pulp testing
then we can call as pulpal necrosis
so based upon our clinical finding we
define purple necrosis which is
non-responsive to the pulpal testing
so this is one of the commonest
questions that are being asked usually
uh during our practical examinations by
the examiner that the pulpit necros is a
histological
terminology how do you can you tell that
clinically based on this finding that it
is purple necrosis
so we have this definition to give us uh
our defense
answer so sometimes so we have alpine
but it is symptom free we do not have
any pain so we have we see varied
patients some patients are having
extreme pain
the others are not having pain and it's
almost gone
so this is due to some of the inhibitory
uh neuro mediators such as somatostatins
indoor genius opioids uh which activate
the gaba receptors and these gaba
receptors which are
responsible for the inhibition of those
of the
nose receptor a data activities
and this reduces the pain and it
inhibits the pain pathways
and leads to us gives us a symptoms of
silent purposes
next we have sometimes we have a heavy
occlusal forces these are the occlusal
forces leads to alteration within the
blood flow
and they are responsible for completely
blocking
the arterioles that are passing through
the article for a ml
and may lead to the increase in intra
tubular and intra pulping fluid
and in amount of fluid and interrupt the
movement
and link to the pulpits and eventually
lead to pulpal
necrosis
we have normal nausea stimuli causing
inflammation which to reversible
proprieties if we do not breathe
it leads to the irreversible state and
then
it may uh if it's a young tooth it
for chronic hyperplastic pulpits if it
is symptom or
symptomatic irreversible pulpit is or if
sometimes a symptomatic irreversible
pulpit is that is the silent
perpetrator speaker and eventually the
pulpal
necrosis the another most specific
condition
that we come across is hot tooth
so what is this hot tooth condition is
the condition with the tooth is
difficult to anesthetize ah
this forms the basis that when we have
sometimes the patient comes and we are
anesthetizing the patient but still
the patient is uh having pain so what
forms the basis of this hot tooth pain
so we have the sodium
channels 9 to 11 voltage gated sodium
channels within present within the c
fibers of this
eight nine and ten they are the channels
which are
resistant channels so uh this
last three channels so whenever we give
anesthesia
all these channels are getting uh
sensitive and sensitive to the local
anesthesia and they will be
having the anesthetic effect however
when
there is a increased amount of
peripheral and
central sensitization and hyperalgesia
state
the primary and secondary hyperalgesia
has been
in cases of peripheral sensitization the
threshold is very low
so what happens that this last three
voltage gated channel that is eight nine
and ten
they are becoming resistance to the
tethodotoxin which is one of the
component of the lignocon anesthesia
and initially they were sensitive to
this component but
now due to the hyperalgesia they are not
sent they are resistant to this
component so this channels will not
be anesthetized so due to this
non-energetic sensitive channels
they would be responding and they're
more fighting smarter the resistance you
know
and they give a rebound response to the
uh inflammation and inflammatory effect
and causing
the more amount of inflammatory
hyperisis yeah
so because they are not uh getting
anesthetized
due to this point of time even if we
give anesthesia
the patient feels the pain and we are
not able to treat that tooth
so uh we may get confused that we
haven't given the inferior
on no block properly we have given
everything properly but still the
patient is having pain
so in such cases what we may do we may
have to wait for a longer period of time
to get the effect of anesthesia or we
may ask the patient to
come taking a previous analgesic
medication which will
centrally inhibit the pathways of pain
and
will be helpful for us to treat the
patient at that point of time
so these are some of the conditions that
we have
that we know the pulp we know the
musculature it is
having the graded compartmentalized
response
which forms the basis of vital but
therapy
in which it is at the reversible state
eventually
if we are not uh treating that teeth it
is going into the irreversible state
and this way we have and accordingly
it is activating the fibers that is
initially the a delta fibers are
activated as soon as it is
uh increasing the strangulation
increasing the
inflammation there is a hypoxia because
of the initiation of the
pulpal necrosis so or or stemia within
the blood vessels the a delta fibers are
not getting
uh they are getting uh no they're
degenerated so we have the response of c
fibers which is producing the uh
increased amount of pain and then we
have a state of hot tooth
so we must go for a clinical
sign symptoms history and reach to a
proper
diagnosis in a way and plan our
treatment so hope this lecture has
helped you out to
come up to uh and clear your aspects
regarding the diagnosis
how we need to make based on the history
based on the diagnostic
tools or the sensitivity sensibility
test that we have
and come up to a proper diagnosis
and a proper treatment planning at the
end to
get a successful treatment out uh
these are my references that is uh
uh cohen engel
uh even we can read grossman for the ug
students
it is given good in the diagnostic
chapter
chapter number three or four and uh this
becomes uh
the rationale of the endodontic
treatment
that is how the inflammation and the
neural responses are there
it is given in the rationally of
endodontic treatment so
uh hope this lecture has been useful to
you
and now it's clear for you to go for a
proper diagnosis and
treatment planning in cases of pulpitis
thank you
