hey guys welcome to yet another
interesting and informative video by
simply learn
in today's video we're gonna be learning
all about single link listening but
before we begin if you haven't

without any further delay let's begin
this session will help you understand
what a single linked list is in C moving
ahead let's understand the memory
representation of a singly linked list
later let's look at the syntax of a
single linked list and finally
operations performed on a singly linked
list now let's begin by understanding
what a singly linked list is in C
a single linked list is a collection of
data called nodes where each node is
divided into two parts to store data and
address
every node in a linked list is connected
with the other through a pointer that
points to the address of the next node
unlike a risk linked lists are not
stored in contagious memory elements are
located at some random location in the
memory for example
if the first element is inserted at the
location 2000 then the next element
would be located at 2016 and then at the
next relocation and so on
moving ahead let's have a look at the
simply linked list memory representation
let's consider four elements to be
inserted into the list and for that we
have four notes where each node consists
of data part and address part to store
at some address 2000
2016 2022 and 3000.
in singly linked list
we have a special node called a head
node that holds the address of the first
node and the last node points to the
none as I discussed before every node in
a linked list is connected with the
other through a pointer that points to
the address of the next node and that is
represented by the arrows in this
diagram
for example
let our elements to be inserted be 10 20
30 and 40. the address of the first node
is stored in the head node
and the next part of the first node is
holding the address of the next node
that is 2016. similarly the second node
is holding the address of the third node
that is 2022 and the third node is
holding the address of its next node
that is 3000 which follows till the last
node that is pointing to the none in
this way they are linked together
up next we have syntax of a singly
linked list
to declare variables of a different type
and a pointer variable we make use of
structures so we have a stuck keyword
followed by a structure name called node
then we have variables decline that is
data and the struct node has trick next
a pointer variable pointing to an
elements of a structure node so with
this let's try to execute a simple
simply linked list program to understand
in a better way
as you all can see this is a program of
a singly linked list
so here we have a struct note inside
that we have a variable data of type
integer
and then a pointer variable pointing to
an element of a structure node so inside
the main function we are creating the
nodes first second third and fourth and
for this we are allocating memory to all
the nodes so for that we have a
statement first is equal to structure
node asterisk mlog is a function to
allocate memory and then size of stuck
node so similarly we are creating first
note second third and fourth and then we
are inserting values into the nodes so
for that we have
first node data part is holding the data
10
and then second node data part is
holding the data 20. and third node 30
and 4th is 40. so then we are linking
these nodes together for that we have
first
node next part is holding the address of
second node
second node next part is holding the
address of third node and similarly the
third node and fourth node but here the
fourth node is pointing to the nun which
means they are no more notes further
later we have a display function where
it displays all the linked list elements
so while pointer is not equal to null it
will print
all the elements so now let's run it
and here we got the output
the linked list elements are 10 20 30
and 40 and they are inserted
successfully into the notes
okay so now let us move on to the
operations on a single linked list
first we have insertion sort algorithm
next deletion sort algorithm and finally
traversal sort algorithm let's
understand them in detail
so first let us understand insertion
operations
under insertion operations we have
insertion at beginning so basically we
insert the element at the beginning of
the element list next insertion at end
that means it insert the elements at the
end of the element list and lastly
insertion of the specified node that
means it inserts the element of the sum
specified node
so now let's run the program and
understand these insertion operations
practically
so as you all can see this program is to
perform insertion operation on a single
link list so we have insertion at
beginning operation then insertion at n
and followed by that we have insertion
of the specified node
so first let's understand insertion and
beginning so here we have a pointer
variable that is head and a new data
so the new is a note where we are
allocating memory to it and the new data
part is holding the new value
and its next is assigned to the head so
now the head uh I mean the new is
assigned to the Head
so
that would be our first node and next
coming to the insertion at end
here we have head and again the new data
so new again we are locating memory to
it
so the last node is equal to head
assigning the head to the last node so
the new data part is holding the new
value but the next part is holding the
null that means it's pointing to the
null
so if a head is equal equal to null
that means the new is assigned to head
and written while last node next is not
equal to null then
as a last node next to the last node and
new to the last note next
so after that we have insertion after
specified node so that means if the
previous node is equal equal to null
that means given previous node cannot be
none
so here we have we are creating one more
new node and allocating memory to it
and for that
the new data part is holding the new
value and the new next
is pointing to the previous node next
and the MU is assigned to the previous
node next
so next it will print all the
linked list elements so for that we have
a display function where it Plains all
the elements
and here
we are going to insert the values that
is 11
20 13 14 44 and 15. so first it will
insert the element at the end that means
the last will be 11 and insertion at
beginning in the sense our first element
would be 20. again insertion at
beginning so before 20 there it will be
13
and insertion at n after 11 will have 44
and insertion of the node head of head
of next that means after 20 we'll have
15.
so let's execute and have a look at the
output
so as you can see
the elements the linked list elements
are 30 20 15 11 and 44. they are
inserted successfully
followed by that we have deletion
operation to delete from the beginning
delete from the end and delete after
that specific node so now let's run a
program
so in this program we are going to
perform deletion operation so basically
we are going to delete a node
so for that
we have a head and a previous
so if a pointer is not equal to null and
pointer data is equal to key
then pointer next is assigned to head
and free this space and return
while here we are going to search a data
to be or a node to be deleted
so while pointer is not equal to null
and pointer data is not equal to k then
assign pointer to previous and pointer
next to pointer
and if pointer is equal equal to null
then return
and here we are going to remove the node
so we are going to free up the space
so now let's try to run it
so as you can see here
the linked list elements already the
elements that we had inserted was 13 20
15 11 and 14. and now after deleting an
element that is we have deleted our
first node element that is 13. so now
the remaining elements after deleting
are 2015 11 and 44.
so finally we have traversal operation
in this operation we visit each and
every node at least once maybe to
display all the elements or to perform
operations on it
so let's understand it practically
so finally we are going to perform our
operation called traversal that means it
displays all the elements in a linked
list
so
it actually visit each and every node at
least once so that means it will display
all notes till it finds the none
so now let's try to execute it
so as you can see first we had inserted
the elements 13 20 15 11 and 44. so
after deleting one element we had a list
2015 11 and 44. so now after traversing
that means it displays the elements now
present in a linked list and they are
2015 11 and 44.
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on singly linked list in C
