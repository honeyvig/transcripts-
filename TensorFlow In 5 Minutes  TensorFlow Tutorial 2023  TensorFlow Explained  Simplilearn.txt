foreign
library in the world is Google's
tensorflow it is your best friend if you
have lots and lots of data if you have
tried it once but got out with a bizarre
experience saying tensorflow is too
complicated and academic then Place
think again it is not so complicated but
normal the flow can be defined as the
library developed by Google researchers
to resolve problems regarding machine
learning artificial intelligence and
deep learning now we will understand
relationship between tensorflow and
machine learning before moving forward

tensorflow and machine learning
tensorflow is used to develop machine
learning models particularly the
tensorflow API used for this purpose
machine learning researchers use
tensorflow to create machine learning
algorithm data flow graphs structures
that depict how data flows across graph
or a collection of processing nodes can
be created by developers using
tensorflow a mathematical operation is
represented by each node in the graph
and each Edge between nodes is a
multi-dimensional data array or tensor
most targets that are practical can run
tensorflow applications including local
machines Cloud clusters iOS Android
smartphones CPUs gpus tensorflow can be
run on Google specialized tensorflow
Processing Unit silicon if you use the
company's own cloud for further
acceleration but the models that
tensorflow produces can be installed on
almost any device and used to make
predictions so far we have learned about
how tensorflow and machine learning are
interconnected because both tensorflow
and machine learning are bound with each
other let me tell you a few important
things about tensorflow before you start
coding rules about tensorflow
firstly you can use Jupiter notebooks
and it can be directly run on Google
collab
tensorflow uses Keras which is a high
level Library built on top of tensorflow
Keras facilitates rapid deep learning
model development by acting as a wrapper
for low level libraries like tensorflow
because the entire system is written in
Python accessibility and debugging Are
Made Simple
lastly tensorflow library is introduced
with import tensorflow as TF abstraction
is the single most important Advantage
tensorflow offers for machine learning
development the developer can
concentrate on the overreaching logic of
the application rather than worrying
about the minute details of implementing
algorithms or working out how to connect
the result of one function to the input
of another developers that need to debug
and gain insight into tensorflow
programs tensorflow provides extra
conveniences instead of creating and
evaluating the complete graph as a
single opaque object each graph
operation can be evaluated and updated
independently and openly it is now
required to use this so-called eager
execution mode which was a choice in
earlier iteration of tensorflow coming
to Applications of tensorflow tensorflow
is used to develop mobile applications
it is used in Google search engine to
analyze vast amount of data
Twitter updated their platform to
display Tweets in the order of this
ranking after implementing tensorflow to
rate tweets by importance for a
particular user so these are the
important applications of tensorflow
before ending I would like to raise a
query
which is the most efficient programming
language to code in tensorflow
a ruby be python r C plus plus please
