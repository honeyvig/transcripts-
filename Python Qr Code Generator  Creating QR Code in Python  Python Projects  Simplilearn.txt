hi everyone welcome to the simply Lear
YouTube channel in this session we will
learn how to create a QR code and then
learn how to decode it but before we
begin if you love watching Tech videos
subscribe to our Channel like the
tutorial and hit the Bell icon to never
miss an update and before starting let
us have a simple question to brush up on
our knowledge and please answer in the
comment section below we'll update the
correct answer in the pin comment and
your question is what does QR in QR code
stand for and your options are quick
record quick response quick review or
quick restore you can pause the video
give it a thought and answer in the
comment section now moving on let's
learn a few facts about QR codes QR
codes are quick response codes used to
store information that can used to make
a call send a message or email open a
website or even redirect to a location
and a QR code can store up to 4 to 96
characters or 7089 digits in a single
code making it viable to hold large
amounts of content let's see how a QR
code is generated on web we will open
the browser and search for any free
website that is used to generate QR code
code we will search QR code
generator and we can enter any URL or
any text to just create a QR
code so we'll write simply
learn and you can see your QR code has
been generated you can download it copy
it and send to anyone and he can just
scan it and see the T simply
to check it we can
also open a QR Scanner in a mobile
phone for that we'll just write QR
Scanner in our Google Chrome or any
browser and open any free one and
just scan
it you can see that it has scanned and
decoded it as simply learn what we have
encoded in it
so let's move and create our own QR code
scanner using python for that first
we'll create a
folder and name it as creating QR
Scanner and inside it we will open the
command prompt
and open Visual Studio code
I have choosen the visual studio code as
my data you can choose any like jupyter
notebook or P Cham any and inside I will
create the
file and name it as QR
scan.
py and now the first thing we have to do
is import the python
modules so for that the first module we
would be importing is python QR
code that will write the command pip
install QR
code as you can see that it states that
the requirement is already satisfied I
have already installed the python
package you can use this command to
install that and if you face any issues
just comment down in the comment section
and we'll get back to you
now moving to our Visual Studio
code we will import the
package
import QR
code and now we'll use the function make
to make a QR code for that we'll write
QR
code do make
and inside we'll just copy any URL link
or any command any contact information
or anything so we will go to our
browser and open the
YouTube and search for creating a
virtual assistant
and
Python and
will copy this
URL and paste
it in the make function so that will get
the QR
code of our own video
that is creating virtual assistant using
python now we'll
save this into a variable and name it as
my
QR and get this variable saved as a PNG
image so that we can get it in our
folder as our folder only contains the
python file now
when we save
this let's PNG
file now you have to save your code and
just run
it you can see that my qr. PNG has been
generated so just open it you can see
that you have got your QR code
generated and you can
also make some options that is scale I
will set the
scale equal to
8 let's save the file and run
it and you can see the QR code
scanner
now we
will use a mobile phone you can use any
mobile phone Android or iPhone and just
check
it using any QR code scanner that is
available on your browser or you have
any other app you can use
that I'm using a free version on my web
and that is QR cod scanner.
in and on scanning I got the link and
when I open it
I redirected to the video that is how to
create a virtual assistant using python
so we have successfully made the QR code
scanner now we have made the QR code
scanner and we can also decode it using
the python
libraries so for
that we have to install two more
modules that is prar and and
pillow for that we'll write the command
pip
install
byar you can see that the requirement is
already satisfied as I have already
installed these modules and we also
install pip
install
pillow this is also installed and if you
face any issue in installing these
packages just comment down in the
section will get back to
you now moving on to our Visual Studio
code now
we'll use the class decode first we will
import the packages
only
from
pper
Dot pper
import the dcode
class and
From
Below import the image
class
now moving to decode the QR code we will
use the decode class from P
bar and use the image
class and
open our PNG file that is what you named
as myqr
PNG and
now we'll store it in our variable that
equal
to and now we'll print what is decoded
what would be decoded and we'll just get
the value for that
we'll get get the information at the
zero
index that is
data we will code
it in s
key so yeah now
we'll save a
code and run it here you can see that
you have got this link that that is
recorded what you have encoded in the QR
code
scanner and now I have a question for
you to just check whether a QR code is
working or not now you have to
make a task to just scan the QR code and
see whether it's working or not for that
we will create my
qr1 equal to QR
code do
make and
inside we will get a link for our
website
now we'll save the file and run
it and we get
also as a image for that we'll write my
qr1 do
save and the name of the file and add a
scale of 7 we'll save the file run the
file here you can see that the QR code
has been
generated
and we have get
it was it for you guys so just scan the
QR code and check whether it's working
or not
so just scan it and answer is yes or no
in the comment section
below if it's working just answer it yes
else no and with that we have come to
the end of this session I hope it was
interesting and informative if you liked
