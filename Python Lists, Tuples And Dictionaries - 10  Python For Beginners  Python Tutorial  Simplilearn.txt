hello everyone welcome to another video
on python series of tutorials by
simplylearn
in this session we will look at list
tuples and dictionaries in python
now let's see the agenda for today first
we will learn about the lists in python
its characteristics and explore it in
jupyter notebook then we will learn
about the pulse in python its
characteristics and we will also explore
tuples in jupyter notebook after that we
will have a look at dictionaries in
python its characteristics and will head
to jupyter notebook to understand the
dictionaries
so lets start with lists in python
imagine you have different values
you have numbers you have strings now if
you want to group them together
you can do this job in python with the
help of lists or you have work with
arrays in any other language like c plus
or java this is the similar stuff in
here which is list
a list can be defined as a collection of
objects values or items of different
types and these collections are enclosed
within the square brackets and are
separated by commas let's understand
this with the help of an example
we will create a list and name it as
list1 and insert the elements in square
brackets and separate them with the help
of commas
list 1 equal to square brackets 1 comma
adam
coma 107 comma usa
and unless we have our first element and
0th index
and we have 1 at 0 index atom at one
index 107 at second index usa at third
index
and talking about the reverse index it
starts with minus 1 index value we have
usa at -1 index value 107 at minus 2
index value
adam at minus 3 index value and 1 at -4
index value
we will explore the list with various
examples in jupyter notebook in a while
till then let's look at the
characteristics of list
first the lists are ordered when we say
that lists are ordered it means that the
items have a defined order and that
order will not change if you add new
items to a list the new items will be
placed at the end of the list
second elements of the list can be
accessed by index values
third lists can store various types of
elements for example numbers strings or
lists itself
fourth lists are mutable the list is
changeable meaning that we can change
add and remove items in a list after it
has been created
let's allow duplicate elements since
lists are indexed list can have items
with the same value let's have a look at
some methods of lists in python
the first one is append it adds an
element at the end of the list
for syntax we can write list1 dot append
and in round brackets we have to write
the element which we want to append
the next is insert it adds an element at
the specified position its syntax is
name of the list dot insert and in round
brackets will write the index at which
we want to insert the element and comma
and after data element which we want to
insert
third is extend
it adds the element of a list to the end
of the current list
its syntax is list1 dot extend and in
round brackets we will add the element
like list2
which we want to extend in the list
the next is index it returns the index
of the first element with the specified
value
and its syntax is list1 dot index and
the element which you want to fetch the
index
the next is remove it removes the item
with the specified value
its syntax is list1 dot remove and in
round brackets we write the element
which we want to remove from the list
the next is sort
this method is used to sort the list
its syntax is list1 dot sort
the next is reverse it reverses the
order of the list
its syntax is list1 dot reverse
let's move to jupyter notebook to
explore these methods
let's start with creating a list
we'll name the list as list1
and will create
equal to
and we'll start with square brackets
and we'll write our first element that
would be apple
coma
space
next element
orange
coma space the next element
banana
coma space the next element
kivy
now we will get this list printed for
that we'll write the syntax
print and in round brackets we'll write
the list name that would be list1 and
run the command you can see here that
the list is printed
now let's create a different list with
some different elements
list 2
equal to
and in square brackets we'll write
apple
now we will insert a list
in a list
for that
we will write a list in square brackets
8 comma 4 comma
6.
and coma the next element that will
write orange
the next element banana
now print this list
to print this will write print round
brackets will write list2
and run the command here we will get the
list
to print it
we can access any element in the list
so for that we'll write the syntax
print
we want to access the second element
that will be the third element from the
list one for that we'll write the syntax
print
list one and in square brackets we'll
write the index two and run the command
we'll get the third element from the
list one that is banana
now
we will access an element from the list2
for that we'll write the command print
list2
and in square bracket we will write 1
and in square bracket we'll write 2 and
run the command what we get is 6
so to access an element from a list that
is already inserted in and list we have
to write this syntax
so this syntax tells us that we will
first access the first index element
that is 846 the list and in that we will
access the second index value that would
be 0 1 and 2 that is 6.
so this is the syntax to access an
element in a list that is already
inserted in a list
now we will see a reverse index order
for that we'll write the command print
list 1 and in square brackets we'll
write the index -1
and we'll run this command and we get
tv as output
now we'll see slicing in python
we can access a range of items in a list
by using
the slicing operator
now we will see an example
to see
the slicing operator work in python
for that we will write the syntax print
list1
and in square brackets we'll write 1
slicing operator 3 and run the command
what we say is orange and banana as an
output from the list 1.
when you write 1 ratio 3 that is one
slicing operator three it gives you the
elements at index one
two and not three
so we get the output as orange coma
banana
now
we will see another example for the
slicing operator we'll write print
list 1
and in square brackets we'll write 3
and slicing operator
run the command here we can get only tv
when we write a single number before
slicing operator
it would print the value at that index
value and all the other elements that
are present in the list but in this list
we have only kv as the last element so
it would print third index value and not
more than that
now we'll see append function for that
we'll write the syntax list one
dot append and in round brackets we will
write the element which we want to
insert at the last of the list
we will write kawa and
run it and now we will print the list to
see the result
here we can see that java is added at
the last of the list
now we'll see extend function
for that we'll write the index list1 dot
extend and in round brackets
we will write
in square brackets the particular
elements we want to insert in the list
so we will write watermelon
and the next element we want to insert
would be muskmelon
that would be in inverted comas
and we also want this list to be printed
so we'll write print list one and
execute this command
here
we can get watermelon and muskmelon add
it just after the list
just at the last elements of the list
now if you want to delete a particular
element from the list you can delete it
with the syntax
dl
space
the list name you want to delete the
element
and in square brackets you will write
the index for the element you want to
delete
we have written the fifth index value
so we'll run this command
and we'll get the list printed
we can see
that the fifth index value that is
watermelon is not there in list one it's
been deleted
now
you can also do this
with another method that is removed for
that we will write list1 dot
remove and in round brackets
we will write the particular element we
want to remove we will write that
that is kv
and we also want the list to be printed
so we'll write
print in round brackets list one
and run this command
we get that the key is been removed from
the list one
now there is another method that is pop
we will write that command print
in round brackets we'll write list one
dot
pop and we'll write the index value
what we want to remove from the list
that is one
and we also want the list to be printed
so for that we'll write the command
print
list one
will run this command
okay we have not written the name of the
list correctly so now list one
now
so at the one index that was orange that
has been removed from the list
and now this is the new list
now
we can see another method that is clear
that removes all the elements from the
list
so
this we would apply on the list to
list2 dot
clear method
and we'll also write another command
that would be print
list two
and execute this command we can see that
the list two is empty now all the
elements from the list two have been
removed
now we'll see another method that is
reverse for that we'll write the command
list one
third reverse
and round brackets and we also want the
list1 to be printed for that we will
write the command
print list1 and execute this command
here we can see that the list one has
been reversed muskmelon
guava banana apple
now
if you want a particular index element
to be accessed you can
have the syntax for that you can write
that print
list1 dot
index
and in round brackets you just need to
write the element for what you want to
get the index
and just run this command you will get
the index of the element
guava that is one
we have another method and list that is
count so count is used to give the
number of times the particular element
is present in the list so for that we
will write the syntax print
so print
and in round brackets will write the
list name list1
dot count and round brackets will write
the particular element
for which we want to get the number of
times that has been present in the list
write musk melon
and run this command it would give us
the value 1
because it's been present in the list
for only a single time
now let's move to the tuples
so tuple tuple is almost same as list we
can have different types of values in
tuples
the difference in list
is we can change value because list is
mutable and tuple is immutable that
means you cannot change the value
a tuple can be defined as a collection
of objects values or items of different
types and these collections are enclosed
within the circle brackets and separated
by commas
let's understand this with the help of
an example we will create a tuple and
name it as top one and insert the
elements in round brackets and separate
them with the help of commas
so w1 equal to round brackets the first
element is one comma and the second
element is adam third element is 107 and
the fourth element is usa
now in tuples we have our first element
at zeroth index and we have one at zero
index and atom at one index and 107 at
second index and usa at third index
and for the reverse index it starts with
-1 index value we have usa at minus 1
value 107 at minus 2 sec index value an
atom at minus 3 index value and 1 at
minus 4 index value
we will explore the tuples with various
examples in jupyter notebook but till
then let's look at the characteristics
of tuple
so the first is the tuples are ordered
when we say that tuples are ordered it
means that the items have a defined
order and that order will not change
elements of the tuples can be accessed
by index
double items are indexed the first item
has index zero the second index
has one
third tuples can store various type of
elements that is strings arrays and many
other elements
the next is tuples are immutable doubles
are unchangeable meaning that we cannot
change add or remove items after the
tuple has been created
next is tuples allow duplicate elements
since tuples are indexed they can have
items with the same value
let's have a look at some methods of
tuples in python
first that is index we can use the index
operator to access an item in a tuple
with the index starts from zero
its syntax is the name of the tuple dot
index and in round brackets will write
the element for which we want to access
the index
the second is slicing we can access a
range of items in a tuple by using the
slicing operator for that we'll write
the syntax top one and the range for
which we want to slice the tuple
the third is concatenation here we will
add two tuples that is we just have to
write the name of the tuples to add them
and we'll place the plus operator just
between them
the next is repetition we can have the
same item multiple times in a tuple for
that we'll just have to write the syntax
the name of the tuple
and the multiplication operator into the
times we want that value to be present
in the tuple
the next is count it returns the number
of items a specified value occurs in a
tuple
so for that we have the syntax step one
dot count and in round brackets we will
just write the element for which we want
to count the number of times that
specified value has been occurred
we also have another method that is
indexed
it searches the tuple for a specified
value and returns the position of
that where it was found
now let's move to jupiter notebook to
explore these methods so let's start
first we will comment that would be
tuples
and we'll
move to the next column and first we'll
create a tuple
for that we'll write the command to p 1
that would be the name of the tuple and
in round brackets we'll
insert the elements that would be
apple
coma
orange coma
banana
coma
kv
now we will print this tuple
just have to write print and in round
brackets the name of the topper and run
the command
will get the tuple
printed
now
if you just want to insert a single
element in a tuple for that you will
write the command tab 2
equal to in round brackets
you will write a single element that
would be apple
and
run that command
the tuple has been created but this
tuple has not been considered as tuple
in python it's been considered as string
so
let's check the type of this tuple for
that we'll write print
type
in noun brackets we'll write the name of
the tuple we want to check
and run this command
here we can see that it is showing a
string
so a single element is been shown as
string
in python if you want that it should be
tuple
for that you just have to
insert a single comma
in the tuple and now run this command
you will get this type as tuple
now if you want to access any element in
a tupper for that you just have to write
the command print
top one
and in square brackets the index value
that is 0
and here you quote the value apple that
is at
0th index value in top1
now
you can also access the element in the
reverse order for that will write the
command print
tap one
and in square brackets we'll write the
index value -1
and run the command here we can get the
value kv
from the reverse index order
now we also have the slicing operator in
tuples also
for that we'll write the command print
f1
in square brackets
the index values
will
run this command print tab 1 index value
1 slicing operator 3
so it has printed orange and banana
so what does it means it prints the
index value 1 and 2 and node 3.
we also have a repetition method and
tuples
for that we just have to write a simple
syntax
like print
in square brackets the element you want
to repeat
we will write the element as repeat only
and
comma we just considered as tuple
and just
after the bracket we would have to write
the multiply operator and the number of
times the element should be repeated in
the tuple
now we'll run this command
you can see that the tuple has been
created with the element repeat and the
number of times is 3 that we have
written just after the
element
so the tuple has been created now we'll
see the count method
for that we'll write the command print
the name of the tuple
dot
count
and in round brackets we will write the
element for which we want to
know the number of times it been present
in the tuple
and will execute the command
it gives us zero
as our top one
doesn't consist
guava as an element
so it gives us the count as zero
now we'll see
another method that would be index
for that we'll write the command
print
top one dot
index
and in round brackets we'll write the
element for which we want to fetch the
index of that element
banana and we'll run this command
we will get the index of the element
banana that is 2
0 1 2.
so we get the index of the element
banana
now if we want to use the append method
in tuples we have to first create the
tuple into the list for that we will
write the command y equal to list and in
round brackets we will write
the name of the tuple
which we want to convert in the list
now we will use the append method
to the list that is why
dot append
and will insert an element that would be
guava
and now
we would just assign
the y list to a variable top one
we have now converted
the y list to the tuple with this syntax
that is
tuple y and we have assigned it to the
top one value
now we'll print this
tuple
and execute the command here
we can see that we have used the append
method
in the tuple
first we have changed the tuple to the
list by this command y equal to list tab
one then we have used the append method
y dot append
and appended the element cover then we
have changed the y list to the tuple
that is step one equal to tuple the name
of the list and then we have printed the
tuple
we can also add two tuples by another
method
for that
we will
write another
tuple that would be top three
equal to we will insert an element that
would be
cherry
and now
we want
it to be added in top one so we'll write
top one plus equal to
top three
and now we'll
print
the final tuple that would be top one
and run the command here we can see that
we have added
two tuples that is tuple one and tuple
three which consists of cherry and here
we get the whole tuple as double one
now
to execute loops in tuples we'll write
the command
for that we'll write the syntax
for
space
a variable x
and
the name of the tuple
colon
and then we will print
the particular element one by one and
we'll run this command here we can see
that all the elements have been printed
from the tuple
now let's understand dictionaries in
python
in list you can fetch the elements with
the help of index numbers what if you
want to specify a different type of
index for it example if you have a list
of eight values and you want to fetch
the fifth one you will use the index but
if you have key for each element then
you can use the key to access that
element example phone book if you want
to fetch a number you will use a name
and you get a number and officially if
we talk about dictionary if you want to
understand the meaning of a word you go
to that page and you look at the word
and understand the meaning of it so this
type of concept where you have a key and
corresponding to that you have a value
we can achieve this with the help of
dictionaries
python dictionary can be defined as a
collection of objects values or items of
different types stored in key value pair
format these multiple key value pairs
created are enclosed within the curly
braces and each key is separated from
its value by the colon let's understand
this with the help of an example
dict 1 equal to curly braces the first
key is a and corresponding to that we
have value and that is separated by
colon and after the key value pair that
is separated by a comma
the next is b key
and that has a corresponding value too
after that we have inserted a comma
to separate it from other values now we
have a third key that is c and
corresponding to that we have a value
three
let's see some characteristics of
dictionaries
the dictionaries are ordered from python
version 3.7 when we say that
dictionaries are ordered it means that
the items have a defined order and that
order will not change
second that is elements of the
dictionaries cannot be accessed by index
third dictionaries can store various
types of elements
fourth dictionaries are mutable
dictionaries are changeable meaning that
we can change add or remove items after
the dictionary has been created
fifth one is dictionaries doesn't allow
duplicate elements dictionaries cannot
have two items with the same key
now let's see some methods in
dictionaries
the first is clear method
it removes all the elements from the
dictionary and its syntax is the name of
the dictionary dot clear
the second is get
it returns the value of the specified
key
the syntax is dict1 dot key and in
square brackets we have to write the key
name
the third is keys it returns a list
containing the dictionaries key
its syntax is dict1 dot keys
the next is pop it removes the element
with the specified key its syntax is
dict1 dot pop
and in round brackets you would write
the particular key name
and the next method is pop item it
removes the last inserted key value pair
from the dictionary and its syntax is
dect1 dot pop item let's move to the
jupyter notebook and execute these
methods
first we'll add a comment that would be
dictionaries
and now we'll create
a dictionary
for that we will write the syntax
name of the dictionary
equal to
curly braces
first we'll write the key value
then colon
and the value corresponding to it
will write
apple
then separate it by comma
and then the second key value
colon
and
the value corresponding to that key
that would be orange
when it would be separated by comma then
we'll assign another key value that
would be 3
colon
and
the value corresponding to that would be
banana
comma next with
the key value would be 4 colon and in
inverted commas we'll write the value
corresponding to it
and we'll print this dictionary
print text one and execute this command
here we can see that the dictionary is
printed
with one key value we have the
corresponding value apple with 2k value
we have the corresponding value orange
with 3 k value as the corresponding
value banana and with 4 k value we have
the corresponding value kv
now to access a particular element
we can't do that in dictionary but we
can access a particular value with the
help of key we can do that in dictionary
for that we would write the syntax print
the name of the dictionary
and in
square brackets we'll write the key
value that would be one and run the
command would get the value
corresponding to the key value
that is apple that is corresponding to
the key value one
now
we will see a get method in dictionary
for that we'll write the command print
name of the dictionary dot
get
and in round brackets we'll just write
the key value
and run this command we'll get the
corresponding value to the key value
that is apple
now
we will use another method that would be
pop for that we will write the command
print
deck 1 dot
pop
and in round brackets we'll write the
key value
for the value
we want the element to be removed from
the dictionary
we will execute this command
and we get kvi as the output now if we
print the dictionary
print dict 1
we can see
that the fourth key value and the value
corresponding to that key value has been
removed by the pop method
now
we can also print the length of the
dictionary for that we'll write the
command print
len
and in
round brackets we'll write the name of
the dictionary
and just execute the command we will get
three as the output as it has been
considered one unit second unit and
third unit so the length is three
and we have
another method that is sorted for that
it will write the command print
sorted
and the name of the dictionary
dict 1 will execute this command
it would give us all the key values in a
sorted manner
when executed with this command
now we can see another method that is
keys for that we have to write the
command print
round brackets name of the dictionary
dot
keys
round brackets
and we'll run this command and we'll get
all the keys that are present in
dictionary
there is another method that is values
for that we'll write the command print
deck 1 dot
values
round brackets
and we'll execute this command
we'll get all the values that are
present in the dictionary now we'll see
another method that is update
that is used to update the particular
value corresponding to the key value or
update the dictionary with
more values to be inserted in the
dictionary for that we'll write the
command dict1
dot
update
in round brackets first we'll
write the curly braces
the key value
semicolon colon
and corresponding to that will write its
value which you want to update
watermelon
and we'll also
print the dictionary
we'll execute this command
we will get that the
second value that is watermelon that's
been updated
previously it was orange and now it's
watermelon
so it's been updated by this command and
we can also use this command to add more
elements to the dictionary
for that we'll write the syntax dict1
dot update
round brackets curly braces
and the key value colon corresponding to
that
we will write the value
muskmelon
and we will print the dictionary
we we'll execute this command
sorry we just
oriented the name of the dictionary dict
one dot update
now we'll execute this command here we
can see that the value has been added to
the dictionary
now we'll see another method that is pop
for that we'll write the command dict 1
dot
pop and in round brackets the key value
for which we want the value
to be removed from the dictionary and we
will print the dictionary
and execute this command
here we can see that the second key
value has been removed from the
dictionary
and we will see another method that
would be ticked one
dot
pop item
and then we will print the dictionary
and execute the command
here we can see that the pope item has
removed the last element from the
dictionary and we are left with only two
elements in the dictionary
now
we will see some loops in the dictionary
for that we'll write the command for
x
in the name of the dictionary that is
text one
colon
and then we will write print
dict 1
and in square brackets
the variable x and will execute this
command
so with this loop we can print all the
values corresponding to the key values
in the dictionary
now to print both the
key and values corresponding to it we
can run the loop for that we'll write
the command for x comma y
in
dict1
dot items
colon
print
x comma
y and run this command
we can get the key and the values
corresponding to it
now if you want to copy the particular
dictionary in another dictionary you can
write the command
first you will name the dictionary you
want to create and copy the elements
we will name it as my dict
equal to
now i will write the command dict 1 dot
copy
and then
we will print the new dictionary
that is
my dict
and will run this command
okay we have
not inserted the wrong bracket here now
then this command here we can see that
we have printed the my dick dictionary
and it has the same values as dict 1.
now
we'll see another method
to delete
the whole dictionary
for that we'll write
text one
dot clear
it would remove all the values from the
dictionary and will also
print
the dictionary after that
then this command here we can see all
the elements from the dictionary have
been removed
with that we have come to the end of
