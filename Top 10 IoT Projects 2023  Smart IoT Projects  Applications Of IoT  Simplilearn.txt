we are in a revolutionary digital and
technological era we have seen a
dramatic transformation in the world
around us within the last 10 years we
now have access to things like AI
powered smart assistance driverless
Vehicles surgical robots intelligent
cancer detection systems and of course
the internet lost things because of
recent developments in data science in
fact according to statista research
department iot is predicted to grow
Beyond 30 billion in 2020. this powerful
technology has endless applications and
introduces us to amazing projects to
control various smart electronic devices
at home or even in Industries so simply
loan has given you a list of the top 10
IIT projects with those interested in
this field who would like to contribute
and explore more but before moving on to
the list if you like watching such
interesting videos or topics then please

so now coming back to the list the 10th
position is smart parking system due to
the increasing traffic volume finding a
free parking space without incident is
almost impossible it is not only time
consuming but also quite frustrating the
iot-based smart parking system is the
solution every passing related issue
this Internet of Things based smart
parking system is intended to reduce
unnecessary travel and hassle when
looking for a suitable parking space
a great iot project for beginners is
this one divers can ride their cars
directly to the location this place is
available thanks to Technology's
comprehensive view of the region and
display awake in parking places
in the ninth position is the air
pollution monitoring system everywhere
in the world air pollution is a threat
and keeping track of its levels its
difficult times iot-based air pollution
monitoring systems can monitor air
pollution in cities and save the data on
web servers for later use the air
quality will be continuously monitored
and EDM as a part of this iot project if
the air quality Falls below preset
threshold the system sets off an alarm
with mq-135 and mq-6 sensors
these sensors can recognize potentially
harmful gases in the air and estimate
that precise concentration in role type
this smart device for detecting air
pollution encourages an economical
method of assessing air quality moving
forward in the 8th position is Smart
Alarm Clock one of the Intriguing IIT
project ideas is this one this iot based
alarm clock can transform into a fully
functional device that can carry out
additional duties and serve as an alarm
clock to wake you up every morning among
the numerous creatures including the
ability to initiate a chat voice
commands audio amplifier control text to
speed synthesizer and many more in
addition to these functions the Smart
Alarm Clock also has configurable
options interestingly the alarm clock
gives you three options for waking up by
playing local MP3 files music from the
radio or the most recent podcast of new
stories in the 7th position is the flood
detection system now natural
catastrophes like floods invariably
cause major damage in many countries the
flood detection system and iot related
technology that broadcasts flood power
in advance is a remarkable initiative
that can also help to prevent
substantial loss of property life and
other Priceless Assets in order to
estimate future losses and produce
alarms the system continuously monitors
and detects different environmental
factors such as temperature humidity or
water level the sixth position is Health
monitoring system now one of the
fascinating iot project ideas to develop
is this one this Internet of Things
power words Health monitoring system
aims to empower patients to manage their
own health actively the system allows
users to keep track of their body's
Vital Signs and submit the information
to license Medical Specialists the
doctor can then offer timely assistance
and guidance based on their patients
health conditions the sensors in the
application May track a patient's Vital
Signs like heart rate blood pressure and
sugar levels the device will promptly
notify the doctor if any vital signs are
higher or lower than usual purpose of
the system is to enable remote
communication between patients and
doctors to exchange medical information
and professional guidance up and that in
fifth position is the Smart Middle now
one of the coolest IIT project is the
smart meter a smart mirror consisting of
a monitor and tiny computer behind a
two-way mirror the display can act much
like a smartwatch showing you the time
news weather forecast or even your
calendar
the complexity of smart mirrors varies
the simplest ones provide the
aforementioned features while the most
sophisticated ones contain interactive
touch displays with voice assistance and
additional sensors you can also build
your own smart mirror using an old LCD
monitor a Raspberry Pi and a two-way
mirror in the fourth position is the
Smart agriculture system this internet
of things-based project aims to create a
smart agricultural system that can carry
out even monitor a variety of farming
shows for instance the Mind program the
system automatically to water a lot of
land or use your smartphone to spray
crops with pesticides or fertilizers
Wireless

thank you
[Music]
because you can remotely check on the
security of your home so smart unlocks
that also have other automation features
like alarms will make it much more
easier to catch bugglers
this weather reporting system is
intended to make it easier to report
wider characteristics online this is one
of the best iot projects since the
system has a major temperature humidity
and Rain sensors that contract the
weather and deliver real-time
statistical robotic it is an automatic
all these one system that uses Wi-Fi to
deliver data from a microcontroller to
the web server the internet server
system updates this information in real
time as a result you can examine the
weather statistics online without
relying on weather forecasting agency
reports the system wants users whenever
the threshold value is lost by the
weather parameters and also lets you
specify threshold values and warnings
for particular situation and in the
first position is the home automation
system I'm an iot initiators home
automation is arguably the most
discussed iot-based home automation
projects aim to operate household
equipment and objects remotely you can
control and manage every Home Appliance
connected to the internet of things
through your smartphone in addition to
being practical it allows the user to
have more freedom to operate and manage
home appliances from anywhere in the
world the home automation systems
comprises an AVR family microcontroller
in build touch sensing input pins and a
Wi-Fi connection so with that we have
come to the end of this list of the top
10 iot projects of 2020 and if you like
