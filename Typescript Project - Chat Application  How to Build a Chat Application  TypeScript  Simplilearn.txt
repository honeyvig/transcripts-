hey everyone welcome to another video by
simply learn in this video we will
create a realtime chat application using
node.js JavaScript and
typescript let's look at the chat
application which we are going to create
this is the chat application where we
have two users and from the user one we
will send the message hello
and the user to will receive it and from
the user to we'll send the message
hi and the user one receives it so this
is basically a simple chat application
how we can
create how are
you so this is basically a simple chat
application which we can create
so in this video we will learn to make
this chat application from the scratch
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our YouTube channel and
clicked on the Bell icon so you never
miss an update from Simply learn watch
the video till the end so that you don't
miss out anything so without wasting any
further time let's get started first of
all we will create a new folder so I'll
go to my D drive and I'll create a new
folder
I'll name the folder
as chat
tab so after creating this new folder so
we will go to visual studio code open a
new window in new window we will open
the folder which we
created we created the folder in D
drive we will first create create the
user interface to create the user
interface for that we need to create a
new file called
index.html so I've successfully created
the new file index.
HTML so we'll change the title we'll
name the title as IO chat
next after this we'll open the
link before this we should know what is
CDN a CDN is a network of servers that
distributes content from An Origin
server throughout the world by catching
content close to where each and user is
accessing the internet via a web enabled
device the content they request is first
stored on the origin server and is then
replicated and stored elsewhere as
needed so we will use bootstrap CDN and
query CDN for our project so we'll use
the link tag the link element allows
authors to link their document to other
resources we'll click on the
link so for this to get the bootstrap
CDN we will go to the browser and type
bootstrap
CDN so we'll copy this
link for bootstrap CDN and we'll paste
it
here bootstrap is the most popular CSS
framework for developing responsive and
mobile first websites bootstrap 5 is the
newest version of bootstrap and
bootstrap is free open-source CSS
framework directed at responsive mobile
first front and web development it
contains CSS and JavaScript based on
design templates for forms buttons
navigation and other interface
components after this next we need
jQuery CDN
next we will next we'll get the jQuery
CDN and write it in the script
TX so I'll select
script the script element allows authors
to include Dynamic script and data
blocks in their documents the element
does not represent content for the user
to get the CDN for
jQuery go to the browser
and just type jQuery
CDN and open the first
link click on
uncompressed
and copy
this go back to the visual studio code
and paste
it so after this is
done jar is fast small and featur
JavaScript library it makes things like
HTML document transversal and
manipulation event handling animation
and Ajax much simpler with an easy to
use API
that works across a multitude of browser
with a combination of Versatility and
extensibility so after this we'll take
one more script tag and this time we
will include
the we'll take one more script tag
inside this script tag we will enter the
client set socket. IO web API that will
work inside the browser you can go to
the browser and search socket do IO you
will get all the information related to
socket.io so just go and type socket.
IO here just go to the browser and type
socket. IO and on this website socket.
IO you have all the documentation and
all the details to get started with
socket.io so you can go through the
socket. iio here
so in the script tags I'll write
source and just type
socket
io/ socket. io.js
so after this we'll create a new div
tag so the div element has no special
meaning at all it represents its
children it can be used with the class
language and title attributes to mark up
semantics common to a group of
consecutive elements so inside this diff
we'll create a new
class new class
container so class is basically a space
separated list of classes of the element
classes allow CSS and JavaScript to
select and access specific elements via
the class selector or functions like the
method document get Elements by class
name so after
this we'll create another
div class
R inside this we will create one more
diff class
this colum medium 4 this class is used
when the device size is medium or
greater than 768 pixel and the maximum
width of the container is 720 pixel and
you want the width equal to four columns
that is when we use this function column
medium
4 next we'll create another
diff class
well so after this we'll provide the
heading
H3 the H3 element represents a section
heading so in this will'll provide the
heading as online
users you can change the headings
whatever you want to but I'll keep it as
online
users so after this we'll create an
unordered
list this
class list
group and ID
so after this we'll create a one more
diff in this div
class will provide column medium of size
8
this column medium AG stands for large
column then we'll create a diff another
div class chat
where ID is equal to chat
then I'll create a
form the this form element represents a
collection of form Associated elements
some of which can represent editable
values that can be submitted into a
server or
processing per form
ID is equal to
for message
form this will create a diff
class form group
next we'll create the
label so label element represents a
caption in a user interface the caption
can be associated with specific form
control known as label elements label
control either using for attribute or by
putting the form control inside the
label element
itself so use the label element inside
that we'll write enter message
next we'll create a text
area use the label text
area so inside text area we'll create a
class form
control and
ID message
so text area element represents some
multi-line plane text edit control for
the elements raw value the contents of
the control represent the control's
default value after the text
area
we just write
then we will create an input
element input element
of we'll assign a type submit
class
button value
send message in double
quotes So this input basically it
represents a type data field usually
with a form control to allow the user to
edit the
data so we have finished with the user
interface we'll just save this and run
it in the browser right click and open
with live
server so here we go we have created the
HTML but we we will now create assign
few CSS elements we just need the margin
top for the body so we'll assign that
so we'll create Styles
element the style element allows authors
to embed style information in their
documents the style element is one of
the several inputs to The Styling
processing model the element does not
represent content for the
user so in the
style we'll just write this
body and we'll assign margin
top 30
pixel save this and we'll go to the
browser and just
refresh so till now we have created the
user interface we'll just go to the
browser and run this user interface just
right click and click on open with live
server now we will create a new file
called server.js
and we'll go to the
terminal in terminal we will run two
commands first of all we need to install
socket. IO for that we'll run
npm and there is one prerequisite we
need to have nodejs installed in our
device so then run the command node
package manager npm install
install socket.
IO socket. iio is a library that enables
realtime bidirectional and even based
communication between the browser and
the server it consist of a node.js
server and a JavaScript client library
for the
browser after installing socket.io then
we need to install Express for that run
the command npm
install
Express Express is a minimal and
flexible node.js web application
framework that provides a robust set of
features for web and mobile
applications after installing socket. IO
and express you will get these two files
package.json file and package log. Json
next go to the
server.js wherein I will paste few lines
of
code in the line one creates an express
application the express function is a
top level function exported by the
express module then we have const listen
and then we require an socket. iio then
we we have created an variable app
Express method then we have created an
variable
server So This Server that is we use the
module
HTTP so it creates a module HTTP to use
the HTTP server and client we must
require HTTP the HTTP interfaces in
node.js are designed to support many
features of the protocol which have been
traditionally difficult to use in
particular large possible chunk encoded
message
the interface is careful to never buffer
entire request or responses so the user
is able to stream
data then we have another variable IO
where we require socket. IO server and
similarly we are listening in the port
3000 so in Port 3000 it starts a server
listening for connection a net. server
can be an TCP or an IPC server depending
on what it listens to
do then we have
app.get here the request is declared but
it's value is never read we have request
and
response then we are routing it on the
Local Host
3000 so in this line we are transferring
the file at the given path so
automatically sets the content type
response header field the call back is
invoked when the transfer is complete or
when an error occurs be sure to check
request response sent if you wish to
attempt responding as the header and
some data may be already been
transferred here we are connecting the
client to this server and here we add
plug details to the customer array and
here we are checking the current
connections and then we disconnect from
the
server using the disconnect
function next we delete theplug details
and the again we show the current
connection
here on the socket Doon we send messages
function data and then we console.log
the data then we emit the new
messages so then we have return
console.log server is
listening so now we will run this code
and check if the server is
listening now we'll check if the server
is listening for that we'll run the
command node server
and here we go server is listening now
we'll just go and run the Local Host
3000 on the
browser go to the new tab and just run
Local Host 3000 and here we go it's
running and when we come back to the
code we can see it shows one socket
connected so again if we go and open it
in a newow
browser and just run the local host and
go back to the code it will show two
sockets
connected so we are almost done we just
have a small part left out we'll go to
index.html and here we'll just scroll
down and above body we'll just paste few
lines of
code so here basically we are just
creating a function to get data form so
we get message form and we we are
creating variables message and we are
creating variables chat so basically in
this line we will know form between
click event handle and then we will
prevent default from submission next in
this line we will trap data for text box
and call server then we'll Cate clear
then we will clear the form text box
then we'll console.log submitted
so our program is finished now we'll
just run and check the
code so we'll save this
code go to the
browser refresh it
so I have the two browsers I have opened
it in two separate window we'll just
check if the application is working so
we'll send the message
hi and here we go we have received the
message so we can say
hello so the chat application is working
successfully
so with that we have reached the end of
