foreign
web development is the branch of
computer science that deals with
creating and maintaining a website or
web application
every website you come across is
designed with a mix of certain
methodologies a website is generally
divided into three parts front end the
section that is visible to everyone back
in the website section is not accessible
to the use database where all the data
of the website is stored a web developer
creates the website and ensures that the
website should not face any issues right
after the deployment do you guys know
that reports from glassdoor.com have
shown that a full stack developer in the
United States earns between fifty
thousand dollars to 125 000 per annum
with an average salary of hundred and
five thousand dollars so what do you
think is the most important part when it
comes to a job related to web
development the interviews right so
hello everyone and you are already
watching simply learn here we are with
the complete video on web development
interview questions this video will
cover the most frequently asked
technical interview questions from a web
development profile but before we start
if you enjoy watching such content and
are new to our Channel then hit the

Technologies starting from the basics
and progressing to the advanced aspect
of full stack web development you'll
also gain expertise in angular spring
boot web services jsps and mongodb
preparing you for a career as a full
stack developer so if you are interested
in deepening your understanding of full
stack web development or becoming a full
stack developer in a short amount of
time the Caltech coding bootcamp is an
excellent option so with that let's go
through the agenda for today's video
we'll start this video with the most
basic technology the HTML interview
questions will then take you through CSS
interview questions followed by
JavaScript angular and react interview
questions we'll finally take you through
the back end where we'll cover node.js
interview questions so let's hand over
this session to our training experts now
we are heading towards HTML interview
questions
now here a few questions like what is an
attribute in HTML so you can consider
the attribute are the properties that
can be added into the HTML tag and that
changes the way the tag behaves or it is
displayed
okay so you can see here you have a call
Button
okay so attributes are added right after
the name of the HTML tag so button is an
element form it's not an attribute okay
so what is the mark your name HTML file
so Mark is something which keep on
rotating okay let's say
for scrolling down the text Page or the
text on the web page Mark is used
sometimes you might have seen when you
want to display some very important
information okay which needs to scroll
at the bottom or else the right after
specific period of time you always use
Marquee it is one of the very very old
element available under the HTML page so
it Scrolls the image top left right
center automatically everywhere so you
always use Marquee tags for rotating it
so the next is what is the semantic in
HTML system semantics are htmls are
nothing but a call another coding style
Okay so
when you talk about a semantics so they
are basically reinforcing the meaning of
the contents like typically you have
seen we are using div and span tag but a
different span tag really don't make
sense to us as an HTML reviewer unless I
go inside those and get to know about
what they're really doing it so
semantics are nothing but these are the
standard tags are we clear so you can
see like here like bolt tag is not
useful for the board statement as well
as the italic tag is used for for what
for the italic tag so instead of we are
using strong and EM tags
I'll be clear now so this makes more
sense to us
now the next thing is how do you display
a table in an HTML web page so obviously
we have a got table tag and under the
table tag I can or align the complete
layout of my web page
because of table head table body table
row table columns there are multiple
different type of elements which are
available
okay which are the part of table it's
just to basically align the content in a
proper format
so what is SVG okay so SVG is basically
known as a kind of a graphic which is
written in a typical X7 language the
svgs are the high quality Graphics which
doesn't tear off when you basically grow
and increase or Zoom so normally what
happens if image you talk about
jpeg images after Beyond certain point
their pixel get deteriorated but here in
SVG it never happens so you go to any
level when you want to zoom and you're
gonna get accurate contents at any point
of time
okay so these vector graphics
are really typical D2D base diagrams and
give you the X and Y coordinates in a
regular systems
next how do you separate a section of
text in HTML
to separator sections of text in HTML we
always use what either br
or else we use block code or else we use
what a paragraph tag so BR means anyways
it's separate outer text
and break the current line
paragraph is used to again write a
paragraph of text and the block codes is
used to define the large quotated
sections
okay next is how do you create the
nested web page in HTML so obviously we
have a different type of options that
are available like an iframe
okay you mean to say page within a web
page okay so we can create a page within
a web page with using iframe so this is
a very very common questions we used to
receive at a time of interview
okay the difference between ordered list
and unordered list so audit list will
give you the different ways to display
the data
in German format in numeric digits or
else you can talk about like in
alphabetical order but the unordered
list it completely unordered you don't
get any options like in order list
okay so the audit list start with ol and
unordered list starts with
UL
okay so we have already seen the
difference between order list and
unordered list now it's time to talk
about our another Tapper type of
interview questions which is regards to
your CSS
now
in thesis interview the first question
they always ask you like
how do you add CSS styling in HTML
so we are different ways to include
number one we have a called inline CSS
where we use the element and within that
we try to add a CSS content that is
called inline CSS second is called
external style sheet
okay where you can just
use as a secondary or the
you know external CSS file and this
included into your existing HTML page
okay that is the additional file which
you write it in a CSS and you include it
in HTML and third is called which is the
internal style sheet which you write it
within your HTML but the only difference
happens when you talk about external it
is reusable across multiple web pages
now the different type of CSS selectors
which are available so we have a
different selectors like a universal
selector which is available where you
use asterisk sign and select all the
elements and offer the common style
second we talk about element type
selector where you have the specific
element name into your mind and you
offer that particular type of selector
ID selector is responsible to select the
particular element which is having the
proper ID
class selector which starts with a DOT
class
okay and having the class name we talk
about deciding selector so in deciding
selector you basically try to select all
the elements which are the part of that
okay so you are selecting this container
and under that all the child elements of
the box
okay so we're talking about like in what
of your decident selector we talk about
called child combinator so in this case
you are basically trying to select all
those which is a child of this container
so you are using this greater than
symbol of container.box
okay so selecting all those which are
having the child name called Box
available
then you're talking about a general
sibling selectors
with this Tinder sign and finally we
talk about like an attribute selector
where you have a proper attribute
available to you
okay so these are known as call a
general CSS selectors
followed by we have a next question like
in what is SAS lesson stylus
friends these are the advanced level of
thesis used in the industry so we talk
about like it what is a SAS which we
talk about like in systatically awesome
style sheet so we also have a similar
type of option like in less and many
more
okay so it says about the SAS saying
that it is a systematically awesome
style sheet it is basically taking the
complete CSS to the next level
so that is a third party website but
once again it is very
awesome
CSS which can offer you the mathematical
functions as well as the reusability
you talk about less okay so we talk
about linear style sheet where you can
see all statements which starts with at
the rate sign there in says every single
variable start with the dollar sign
then you talk about stylus it is also
flexible CSS so it doesn't use at the
rate or dollar for any defining
variables we can just directly use this
with the name okay and use it at any
point of time so these are the three
very popular
new or next Generation CSS
so explain box sizing property like how
you can offer the property for the Box
sizing
so here so box sizing property actually
defines how to basically Define height
and the width of the box which are
calculated
so you talk about a term name called
content box you talk about padding box
and you talk about border box typically
we use three different type of box
content padding and Border box
in a Content box these are the default
width and the height which can apply to
the elements
content which are there under the
content box
okay padding box are here you talk about
the dimensions which are added to the
Box elements of the content padding
third which is available called border
box so here the dimensions added to the
content padding and the Border
now what are the different way to hide
the element in a CSS so we have a
different way either we can use display
none
that means whatever is there inside a
Dom it won't be visible to you
second option is visibility hidden that
is another property through which you
can
eliminate the visibility but the thing
is like it is not visible to the user
but this element is added to the Dom and
takes up the space
but in display none it doesn't load in a
Dom so somewhere to
when you want to talk about performance
display none is anytime better
and second chord position absolute so
this can be made to appear outside the
screen so three different options are
available
next option what does that important CSS
mean so the important keyword actually
indicates that the highest precedence
and it overrides the Cascade properties
okay so like as you can see here we have
a call paragraph where we have a color
called important and this is one ID name
called thing color called Green so when
I talk about PID equal to what thing so
it automatically try to override
the highest precedence
okay
now what are the CSS is Sprite CSS
Sprites is a technique where you can
basically take a
larger image okay
download in a single shot and try to cut
down to the pieces and utilize the way
you always want
okay so if you're using this small small
images separately
okay so to load those images
independently you would be making
multiple HTTP calls which can be an
overhead so it is good to basically
download this a lengthy image in a
single shot
clear and utilize them as per your
convenience within your application
so it is used to minimize the loading
time of your web page by combining
multiple smaller picture into the single
image
okay that's what the CSS bytes are so
which property is used to underline and
strike through and the overline text so
we have this option textile textile text
decoration text transform okay so the
text decoration so the text decoration
is the one which will be helping you to
achieve this
okay everyone so our next example is
towards focus on JavaScript interview
questions now here we have few questions
that are available like what are the
various data types in JavaScript
so JavaScript contains different type of
JavaScript data types like if you think
about
all different types which are there
generally byte short int long
float double character Boolean these are
all different type of
data types are supported inside a
JavaScript
okay now
going ahead what is the Callback in
JavaScript so the Callback means is a
function
okay that is passed with another
function as an argument on a parameter
okay so what is the Callback callback
means don't call me I will call you
clear so the idea is like you are
passing
the function itself is in parameter to
the another function because the
JavaScript is known to be called
non-blocking which never wait for the
code to finish it continues to move on
and due to some reason if your
function it's taking some time to
you know execute so JavaScript won't
wait for that particular function to
finish so you use callback to prevent
such Behavior
okay let's call a JavaScript callback
now what is the difference between
function declaration and function
expression see this is called function
declaration
and you talk about a function expression
function declaration is just to declare
a
snap it statement within a main
JavaScript code and
you can be called before the function is
defined
okay it gives you the better readability
where the function expression are always
created inside expression
okay and it is created when the
execution Point reaches it
I'll be clear and it is used when there
is a need of for a conditional
Declaration of a particular function
now what do you understand about the
cookies in a JavaScript so it is one of
the very very common question cookies
are the one which is created by the
servers stored in a client site which is
responsible to store all the necessary
client activities so that the browser or
the application give the better
recommendation to the user
okay so it's just a
a small text file which is stored in a
browser itself
okay good one to record something about
a user activity you always put it like
that and you can also Define the expiry
time for the cookies
okay as per your convenience to decide
how long the cookie wants to be there
inside your browser if you do not offer
any time span by default the Google will
get lost immediately the moment the
browser closed
next what are the closest in JavaScript
so closures are the JavaScript is the
feature where the inner function has an
access to Outer functions variables and
the properties
okay so you can consider a closure has a
three scope chains number one it has an
access to its own scope
that is defined within its curly braces
second it has an access to the variable
of the outer function and also has an
access to the global variables
now the closure is a JavaScript features
as I told you like which has has an
access to the outer functions variable
simple example I can give it to you is a
function which is known as called inner
function and there is a function defined
on the top is an outer function so it is
having all the functionalities axis of
the outer function inside it
now what are the Imports and export in
JavaScript so import and exports in a
JavaScript is a very very common way how
in Java you use the term name call
import a package but in JavaScript it is
little different unless you export
something you can't import it
okay so if you want to access any of
your files Properties or methods outside
of your file you always use the
statement of Import and Export so here
you can see you have got one property
like an sqrt which you are exporting it
and you have one function which is
called Square this is another function
called
you can say d i AG which you are
exporting it and importing it just the
way you always want so that is how it is
importing and exporting
what is the difference between undefined
Undeclared and null in a JavaScript
see undefined means a variable that is
declared but the value has not been
assigned yet that is called undefined
Undeclared means like it is a null first
of all we talk about null null means it
is an assignment value that we can
assign to any variable that is meant to
contain no value and Undeclared means
the variables are not declared and do
not exist in the program
okay that is called what Undeclared
how to remove the duplication from the
JavaScript array so you basically needs
to use the standard filter methods okay
this is basically responsible to help
you to analyze whether we have some
duplicates available or not
so we'll be using using filter methods
okay so these are basically zones called
array and the current element and the
index of current element and by using
the for Loop it is an empty array is
used for the storing all the repeated
elements
okay so these are known is called a
typical JavaScript discussion which we
have taken place multiple questions are
there which we have already answered
okay everyone so we will go ahead with
the next set of interviews which is
related to your angular
so angular is as popular as I can react
okay so there are some questions which
are usually asked like what are the data
binding okay so the data binding is
actually the process which allows the
application
okay to have some data associated with
your
HTML page
from your typescript classes or the vice
versa
okay so the data binding is the one
through which you bind the data okay so
you can see here it says like angular
uses two-way data binding when the
changes happens in a model it will be
affected in a view and whether changes
happens review it will affect the model
also so it is used to
typically keep the model and view in
sync with each other to have the data
interchange
what is the typescript typescript is a
typical I would say a language which is
used
by angular okay to develop angular
component Services pipes decorators and
multiple things it is a superset of
JavaScript and it supports JavaScript
libraries and apis it is a pure object
oriented in nature uses object-oriented
principles better development time fast
to load and additional features to the
JavaScript for sure
okay what is an aot compilation how it
is different from jit aot stands for
ahead of time compiler which is
converting all angular and HTML and
typescript code into the JavaScript code
during the build phase before the
browser downloads and run the code Okay
so aot
is far more faster and light weighted in
the size just in time compiler is a by
default compiler Okay so
it is a process where the compiling
computer code is the machine code during
the execution of runtime so this ensures
the faster rendering the browser it also
known is called Dynamic compilation
are we clear so when you want to develop
this aot compiler you always use hyphen
hyphen aot
okay so here you always use jit compiler
because that is a by default compiler
you use when you say NG build
next what are the pipes in angular so
pipes means that they are the decorators
they never change their default value
but just for the representation purpose
they change the values okay to look more
better the way they always want
okay so pipes are ready made or else it
can be customized created angular also
comes with lot many predefined pipes
okay like it comes with the pipe symbol
here okay so you can change the pipes
together it can be provided with some
arguments at the runtime with the colon
sign
okay now you pass the input you put the
pipe and get some result
with some decorated outcome now you can
see the pure pipes uses the pure
functions
clear so this pipe doesn't use any
internal State and the output Remains
the Same as long as the parameters pass
to stay the same angle calls the pipe
only when it detects the changes in the
parameters being passed a single
instance of the pure pipe is used
throughout the all components
okay so this is how you see how the
pipes are being used so we have defined
the pipe okay which is the value called
true in Fall for the pure and giving the
class by implementing pipe transform so
you can see here the impure pipes for
the say for every change detection
actually happens in an angular and
impure is called
with regards to the changes in the input
fields
okay they will be calling every time so
multiple pipe instances are created for
the C for these pipes and push pass to
these pipes can be mutable by default
all pipes are pure only if you want to
make it impure you always say like pure
colon true
or
pure colon false
now what are the promising observables
in angular see promises it is a typical
JavaScript object okay it it emits a
single values at a time they execute
immediately after the creation and not
cancelable they are pushed error to the
child promises
okay where the observables are only
executable when subscribed to them they
won't call unless you subscribe to them
using subscribe methods so they help
perform operations like it for each
filter and retrieve and everything when
you unsubscribe this they won't get
called and won't listen anymore
what are the form controls and the form
groups see the form controls and form
groups these are two predefined objects
comes with your
angular
so these all text boxes
from you take the input it may be radio
buttons it may be the drop down it may
be the check boxes are called form
controls
okay so form controls is a class that
enables the validation for every single
input class whichever you are creating
it now so they check the values which
are touched untouched or the dirty
clear now we talk about called form
group they are basically forming a group
which
under which you have a call relevant
Fields joined together are called what a
form group
okay so form group class represents a
group of controls like you talk about
address contains city state and pin code
these all three can be together called
as a form group
okay so the form group class basically
returned true if all controls are
basically what the valid
okay and they are designed to provide
all the necessary validation errors
what is the eager and what is a lazy
loading
okay so eager loading means what it is a
default module loading strategy followed
in an angular
Eagle loadings are used before the
application starts
these are typically useful for the small
scale applications
lazy loading however is designed for
dynamic loads of features only on demand
this makes your application far more
faster so in a bigger application we
really don't make easy eager loading
because it hampers the performance and
you want only when the client asks you
want to use lazy loading
what existing interpolation in angular
see string interpolation is written
under the double curly braces it is a
typically One Way binding where you get
the data from the typescript classes and
display directly over your browser it
denotes with the curly process and it
always display the data comes from the
component to The View
well let's go ahead with the next area
that is called working with reactges
interview questions
now as we know it react.js is as
important as like an other tools which
you've already has seen so what is the
jsx here jsx called JavaScript syntax
extension
okay so this syntax extension to the
JavaScript in reactors is in the way
how you express to bind JS and HTML
together to result a js6
content so by using j6 you can write a
structure in the same file that contains
the JavaScript code that is something
more Innovative way because of that
react.js is creating a more buzz in a
market
so j6 actually helps making code more
easy to understand and debug can avoids
a lot of boilerplate code okay inside
the Dom structure
now the next thing is what is the
virtual Dom see the virtual Dom is
representing a Dom in a memory
okay that is called virtual Dom so
manipulating the real term is much more
slower and costly Affair okay because
you need to repaint the Dom over and
over the period of time when the user
changes few things so
when the state change virtual Dom
changes and only the objects which are
in real term okay
update instead of updating the entire
object so that makes your page to be
load far more faster
okay so in Virtual Dom what happens this
is the real Dom this is a virtual Dom so
the orange color portions which you're
seeing that is basically the changes
which has been made okay these are
called Changed object
okay so virtual Dom is basically compare
it's to the previous state and
understand which area it needs to send
for the updates and avoid the other
areas
okay that's what this virtual Dom really
works
so what are react extension react
extensions are many like you talk about
like in flux it is a third party tool
which is responsible to attach
the State Management feature you talk
about react native which is responsible
to develop the hybrid mobile
applications in JavaScript so these are
two very popular and there are many more
which are available okay so like we talk
about
architectural support you talk about
server side rendering okay so Redux and
there are lot many other tools are also
available
so what is an event in react and how
you're going to create that so react is
basically offering the ideas of handing
the event very fairly easy so let me
talk about clicking anything you talk
about taking your mouse somewhere so
these kind of options generate an event
so for that we typically say alert and
you click on this render you click on
this button in a curly braces you call
the function to trigger to event
now what are the components in react
so friends react components are nothing
but a call View
okay like a complex view can be divided
into the smaller portions
a complex UI can be distributed further
to create more better and reusable views
clear so it splits the user interface
into the independent pieces of code
which can be developed and joins
later on okay so that's how you define
the component in and react so in angular
and react in both the areas the word
component is very much used so the
component meaning is very simple you
talk about a view
so what is the state in a react so state
is react is nothing but is the one which
identify what was and what is now okay
if it stores the value for the specific
period of time which changes and react
is basically detecting those
so it is changing because of some
actions either taken by the users or by
the applications okay so keep tracking
about all those States what it was there
like in I'm talking about an
incrementing encounter so that is also
the state available there okay so the
state object is always initialized in
the Constructor so it can contains the
multiple properties so this dot set
state is used to change the value of the
state object and set state is
responsible
to
perform the shallow merge between the
new state and the previous state
now the state holds the data that a
component renders to the web page
certainly because every time the state
changes so it needs to be stored
somewhere so this is how the state is
accessed as you can see this example
here
in the Constructor we are defining the
super props and the state has been
initialized and you're rendering the
states there are three different steps
are involved initialize the state rent
to the state and update the states
what is a higher order component and
pure component react higher components
are the component which are typically a
function okay that takes a component and
return a new component to you by
manipulating few things that basically
designed for the reusing
okay so the higher the components are
typically a function that takes a
component and return a new component
okay so in order to perform some
reusability
or pure components are the components
okay is a variation of rear component
that doesn't
that does a shallow comparison of props
and State
okay shallow comparison basically checks
what the equality are we clear now so
that's what the main job
going ahead what do we Implement and how
do you implement react routing so to
implement a react routing react routing
also comes with inbuild uh react modules
and that particular module to import it
so
here we Define the react modules by
offering the route path where you have a
call left hand side is the name and the
right hand side is a component which you
would like to deliver it now
hello this is Matthew and we're going to
be going through some of the simple
questions that you would be asked during
a node.js interview what we're going to
do is we're actually going to break out
the section into three key areas that'll
be beginner questions there will be an
intermediate questions and advanced
questions and the expectation is as you
go through this video is that these
questions could be pushed together as
you're going through the interview kind
of think of it like this is if you've
answered the beginner questions that you
would get asked at the beginning of the
interview with confidence and Surety
then the client is going to then jump to
those intermediate Advanced questions
quite quickly and they're looking for
people who can help them serve and solve
their problems at that more intermediate
and advanced level so let's just get
started so the first question you're
probably going to be asked is you know
you know what is node.js you know do you
know what it's for and essentially
node.js is and one of the most popular
if not the most popular uh open source
cross-platform JavaScript programs and
it allows you to build out web
applications that run on the server it's
extremely flexible it allows you to
implement a lot of solutions outside of
just the the core programming runtime
and it allows you to build Solutions
extremely quickly in an open source
mindset for devops
it is used essentially for creating
client-sized web applications we'll see
this later on and you may want to talk a
little bit about using express.js and
how you can build out apis uh to work
with node.js and connecting to databases
such as mongodb
and that is also really good for being
able to store a data intensive
applications that are asynchronous and
event driven in their model and this is
important when you're talking about
creating applications that can scale
rapidly
so you can then ask be asked you know
how does node.js work well node.js
itself is actually built on the V8
engine and the V8 JavaScript engine is
the same engine that runs JavaScript in
your Chrome web browser extremely fast
it allows for high output and
non-blocking uh through your i o input
outputs and is is single threaded event
blue
so you're going to be a van asked you
know where can you use node.js and and
the reality is the applications for
node.js keep expanding but there are
some core applications that you can work
with node.js right now so such as web
applications distributed system and
network applications uh probably
referencing the web applications is a
really good starting point because here
you can actually talk about maybe some
examples that you've done where you're
building out some of these web
applications indeed one of the things
that you want to be consistently doing
and peppering your answers with is
examples of work that you have done now
it doesn't matter if those examples are
purely experimental or training examples
that you've done the fact that you've
actually worked with node.js and created
a distributed system or a web
application is really valuable because
it shows that the person that you're
meeting with that you have knowledge and
understanding and practical experience
of applying the theory of working with
new Js with the practice of working with
node.js
so we asked about you know and
essentially the i o refers to the
transfer of data in and out of a system
and that's really it you know there's a
reason why Google calls that conference
i o it's the transfer of data in and out
of our brains at that conference the
application is same here it's about
moving data in and out of systems
through using node.js and that every um
event can be tracked and whether it's on
a physical device a network or files
within a system again it's input and
output
so let's go through and you know you're
going to be asked yoga and you explain
the difference between front-end and
back-end development and this is a
question that I can ask a lot when I'm
meeting with clients and you know people
get really confused about what is the
difference between front-end and
back-end development bottom line front
end is what gets resolved inside of your
web browser or the app on your mobile
device backend is what gets resolved
essentially um what we call the the back
office or server-side applications but
that's becoming more and more synonymous
for what gets running the cloud
so web applications
um really get a lot of the functionality
of web application gets run in the front
end and I think with CSS HTML5 uh
client-side JavaScript so we can get
right on the front end everything else
such as connecting to a database gets
run behind the scenes in the back end
and so you know anything that's going to
have like Graphics is going to be on the
front end uh apis are going to be run on
the back end and then just finally some
of the scripting languages are using on
the front end so HTML CSS JavaScript
those are all Common Core scripting
languages that you would use you can use
Frameworks such as angularjs and
react.js or view those would be a
front-end Frameworks uh back-end
Frameworks would include Java PHP Python
and node.js are some of the back-end
Technologies you could also throw in
their dot net as well I mean it's just
the whole you know Litany of front-end
and back-end Technologies and Frameworks
that you can use and this is a actually
a good point to kind of explain the
experience you have outside of just
working with node.js but other
technologies that you've been working
with that potentially that the client is
also using
so another question you're going to be
asked when you're looking at node.js is
you know can you tell me about npm and
so when somebody asks you what is npm
the first thing you're going to respond
is do you mean node package manager and
the reason why you want to respond like
that is that you want to qualify that
question with understanding that you
know what they're talking about but you
want them to verify that and so node
packet manager is npm
and it's responsible for packaging all
of your modules that you're working with
in node.js and we have a whole series of
videos that we've done on node.js and
every single one of them includes
references to npm
so you're going to be asked you know so
okay you tell me what it is you know can
you go into a little bit more um details
you know so you can provide two main
functionalities and so one of them is
being able to manage online repositories
or modules and packages
um so you can go to like
search.nodejs.org and you can find a
packages that you can install Into Your
solution such as express.js and it also
provides a command line utility that
allows you to manage your packages very
quickly through terminal window or
command line
I use vs code a lot Visual Studio code
and it has a command line utility built
right into it that allows me to interact
with npm
so what are some of the modules in
node.js and so you know modules um in
node.js they're essentially like
JavaScript libraries so you can think of
some of the JavaScript libraries that
you may have used the functionality is
somewhat the same but they're designed
for node.js and to run on the server and
there are ways in which you can go ahead
and create some of those modules so for
instance if we're creating a web server
you can actually use the require
commands to be able to require that the
server be there so the example we have
on the right hand side shows that we
really do need to have HTTP which is a
web server and we require that to be
installed and so that if you're running
that npm package it will actually
install the HTTP server and then you can
actually write some code to actually
then listen on the localhost port 2000
for where you'll be running your app
application
and there are just you know there's a
whole bunch of modules that I come with
node.js now right out of the gate and
here are some of the modules that you
have and we also referenced that just
earlier on HTTP is a core module for
running a web server uh you have a
utility function that is useful for
developers to assess features within
your node.js project you have a URL
module for any URL passing you'd be
doing
and you also have a stream which allows
you to be able to stream data in and out
of your system and be able to manage how
that's been worked and then zlib which
allows you to compress and decompress
files so that you can keep your storage
of files to a minimum
so a question you're going to be asked
is you know why is node.js being
preferred over backend Technologies such
as Java and PHP and particularly gyro
it's a very mature stable language it's
been around for more than 20 years you
know PHP
um runs some of them the most powerful
and largest websites out there such as
Facebook so why would you use node.js
well the first response is kind of a
gimme but it is really fast and if you
watched any of the videos that we've
done on node.js building out Solutions
and developing the solutions you'll see
just how fast it is the second is the
really kind of the secret sauce with
node.js is the node package manager and
no package manager allows you to install
additional functionality such as Express
or as a database into your
solution really quick green and there's
over 50 000 bundles available for node
package manager
if you're building out a real-time
application that's data intensive and
you need to have apis quickly developed
then node.js is another great it's
really the great solution for you it
allows you to build out these Solutions
really quickly
and there is a easy synchronization
between the server and the client due to
the code base
and then finally because the structure
of node.js is Javascript if you are
making the pivot from being a front-end
web developer to node.js it's just going
to make it a lot easier for you to pick
up node.js because you have that common
language of JavaScript and on top of
that JavaScript is the world's most
popular scripting language
so let's talk about some of the
differences between angular node.js and
so and the reason why this question may
come up is the person interviewing you
is seeing whether or not you do know the
difference between a front-end framework
and a back-end framework and this is one
of those questions where you can go well
there are differences but the
differences are because they complement
each other so angular is a front-end
development framework whereas node.js is
a server side in framework other
differences though between the actual
Frameworks themselves is that angular is
written in typescript which is a
modification of JavaScript node.js is
written in C and C plus plus
anger is used for building out single
play client-side web applications and so
that's a keyword there is client-side
whereas node.js is about building out
fast and scalable server-side Network
applications uh so uh again the two
complement each other
angular splits web applications into the
MVC and model view control components
whereas node.js generates a lot of
database I'm crazy it does more than
that as well but you can think of
node.js as that glued to your database
so let's talk a little bit about when
you're connecting to a database with
node.js and so you're going to probably
asking what is the most popular database
used with node.js and there are a couple
mongodb is largely the most popular
nosql cross-platform database MySQL is
also very popular and that's a more
traditional relational database
you would go with mongodb for really
more modern solutions when you're
looking at creating an application
that's going to really scale into just
managing masses and masses of data that
has to be created red updated and
deleted very very quickly
for some of the other popular libraries
that you use for node.js Express JS is a
very popular one and I really like
working with express.js allows me to
build out web applications really
quickly more importantly it allows me to
build out apis very quickly and which
you know apis are essentially web
applications themselves but being able
to do that very quickly with a framework
like express.js is very useful uh
Mongoose is an application that makes
connecting to a database really
easy so here is an example of express.js
which is a in itself really a flexible
but a solution that you can do lots with
and Mongoose which is a more focused
solution which allows you know to you
make it easier to connect to your
databases
so you know what are the pros and cons
of working with node.js there's lots of
ways we explain this earlier on that you
can actually build out applications that
run on the cloud why would you you know
what's uh the pros and cons so a pro is
that node.js is extremely faster
processing thing and event based model
uh it really is fast I I can't is if you
have something that is a very heavy
computational task it's not so good at
that now I will caveat that this is that
node.js is getting better all the time
and so you might have to be provide an
example of what a very heavy
computational task is and that may be uh
calculating a risk on an insurance
application against many many variables
that maybe something that's seen as
computationally very heavy but what you
can do in that example is you can
offload the task to another solution
that's designed for it and use apis to
pass the data back and forth
Pro JavaScript is used for building out
your applications with node.js great
lots of people know
JavaScript a restriction and again this
is evolving as JavaScript itself evolves
is that when you do a callback you may
end up doing lots of nested callbacks if
you're doing something that's very
complicated again another way around the
con and so this is one of the things
that I always look for is if you have a
blocker or a barrier how do you get
around that barrier and so for instance
when you're talking uh to your recruiter
you can say look the reason why I use
node.js is that it's fast it's event but
it's driven I can use JavaScript there
are some challenges and both what I do
to get around those challenges are and
that's where you can say that you know
you may run the complex script off and
you may write that in net or Java or PHP
and then use an API to do the response
back into node.js so you get the
benefits of Both Worlds but minimize the
investment in having to manage a complex
environment such as Java versus a
relatively simple environment with
node.js the node package manager makes
it extremely easy to access just an
awful lot of functionality with over 50
000 packages there's a package for that
so from being able to have a a tool that
creates unique identifiers that you
might need to have for generating
content that gets posted into a database
through to being able to connect to
databases through you know to running so
many different solutions and the npm
package manager with its access to so
many different packages makes it great
for
um getting access to all that content
now Khan is working with relational
databases with node.js isn't as easy as
a nosql database now you can do it and
there are ways around that and what I
would do when this question comes up is
always kind of pivot to say hey this is
how you can actually then get around
building out that application
designed for streaming huge amounts of
data in and out a con is that node.js is
single threaded and so it can be CPU
intensive but again there are ways
around that and a good way around that
is scaling Your solution and elastic
environment such as the cloud
so what is the command used to import an
external library and so to import an
external Library the command is the
require command so an example we have
here is you can assign a variable and
the variable is going to be for HTTP and
you're going to then require the HTTP
service and that means that the
application itself won't run unless the
external Library the HTTP library is
installed
okay so those were our introductory uh
questions for node.js this kind of pivot
and take a look at the intermediate
questions that you would be asked
so what does event driven programming
mean so event driven programming means
that if something happens something else
will happen in response so for instance
if you click a mouse that Mouse click is
an event that means something has to
respond to that event just think of it
as cause and effect it's just the basic
motion of physics so that's what event
driven programming means
you also look at it as a callback
function so that when an element is
executed something will happen in
response
so what is an event Loop in node.js so
an event Loop in node.js is when you do
an asynchronous call and what that
essentially means is that you are
sending out data and then a non-blocking
input output from node.js is pulling
data back in
what is an event emitter in node.js so
an event meta has really two areas of
focus one is that it manages uh the
classes that hold all the objects within
your event and we have an example of
this on the right hand side and then
whenever an event actually is thrown the
functions are then called on that event
synchronously so for instance we have in
our example on the right hand side we
create an event and then we have the
functions and the executed in a series
from that event
so let's talk about the API functions in
node.js so there are two types one is an
asynchronous non-blocking function and
the second is a synchronous blocking
function and the difference between the
two of them is asynchronous is that
there is no structure to the order
if I have the API is resolved
synchronous means that when the feedback
from the API is received you have to
execute the response in a series for how
the response is sent to you
so what is a package Json file so the
package Json file is at the heart of our
node.js package when we actually will
initialize a solution a folder to be in
node.js package
you'll find that the package itself
holds all of the metadata that's
particular to the project you're working
on such as project name version
requirements it is you have to have it
installed in the root of the directory
for the project and again look at any of
the videos that we have on node.js we do
have demonstrations within those videos
that actually then go through and break
out how to create that root package and
you'll see how you can actually then go
ahead and update the instructions or the
metadata within the package so here we
have an example of what that metadata
looks like so again this kind of
continues that question of what is a
packet Json file and you may be asked
you know what is the metadata and why is
it important and the metadata is a basic
Json collection of pairing of a key
details such as name version description
and then and the custom version that you
put so for instance under name you could
create a name for your project there
can't be any spaces what is the version
and the description and what is the main
or starting path and for the solution
typically that would be index.js but it
could be anything.js but index.js is
typical simply because
index.html is the starting point for a
typical web application
so how would you use a URL module in
node.js
so with a URL module what it allows you
to do is really two things one is that
it provides the resolution passing of a
URL for Utilities in your application
and then it allows you to extend your
module with built-in Solutions and split
up the web address into a readable
format
so in this example we have the URL and
the response it would would give for
that URL which would then be a year and
month and it'll be in a readable format
so they would read out as 2020 and then
the month
so what is express.js and you've heard
me mentioned this a couple of times in
the video and we actually have a
separate video on express.js
um I would express.js is a web
application framework that allows you to
build out Web Solutions for both mobile
and traditional desktop right inside of
node.js so it's very easy to use
and being able to install and web.js is
as simple as requiring Express to be
installed in the example that we have
here on the screen it's a full solution
of showing how to actually build out a
solution with web.js so in this example
you start off the first two lines
required Express to be installed and the
store comes from node package manager
then we have a simple application that
will then send to the browser window a
hello world message confirming that
Express is up and running and then the
third block of content starting with
vars server actually will Define the
port where your application is going to
run so in this instance the port is
going to run on localhost and the port
will be Port 8081 and so you can
actually go to localhost colon 8081 and
when you do that that will trigger the
Apple application that will forward up
the message hello world and it's all
coming from express.js
so what are streams in node.js so
streams are objects that allow you to
read and write data continuously back
and forth within your application and
there's really four different types of
streams there's readable writable duplex
and transform
the readable one strength for which data
can be read
the writable streams that you can
actually write to a duplex is a stream
where it is both readable and writable
and transform our streams that can be
manipulated the data while it is being
read or written
so how do you update and delete a
dependency so say for instance we want
to install something like Express so if
you wanted to install Express what you
would do is you would just write them
inside of your project you want to go to
terminal window and write in the command
npm install Express
if you want to update the dependencies
within your node package manager to
update all of them all you have to do is
write the command npm update all
dependencies
and then if you want to explicitly
uninstall a dependency such as
express.js that's using the uninstall
command and so that would again be going
to terminal window and you would type
npm uninstall Express
and again it's really easy to create a
simple server in node.js that will run a
simple command the HTTP service is
actually built into node.js you don't
need to use express.js I typically use
express.js when I want to do a web
server because typically what I find is
that I will want to go and do something
more complicated but if you want to do
something that illustrates just the core
functionality within nodejs you can
actually just require the core HTTP
service that actually comes as part of
node.js and then you can actually then
go ahead and tell it to create a service
and then to write in plain text I
command or text string such as this case
it'll be hello world and that would pop
out and then the final line is to then
listen that if you go to a web browser
that's on
port127.0.01 or localhost and go to Port
colon 8080 once you actually go to that
that will trigger this application and
you'll get the text hello world pop up
on your screen
so explain synchronous and non-blocking
apis in node.js
so all the apis in node.js are
asynchronous which means that they are
non-blocking which means you can run
them continuously and scale around that
which is just fantastic it's one of the
reasons why node.js can scale so fast
and the eighth means that the apis can
return data send data after it's been
called and really increase the
efficiency of events as they are
triggered Within node.js
so how do you implement async and you
know JS and so the example that we have
on the left hand side allows us to
trigger async and it's using the async
function and as you can see in this
example it's actually something that can
be done very quickly in this example
we're actually making a command to
localhost and an app that's running on
Port 3000 and then depending on what we
get if there's an error message and then
we'll have error message go to the
console log which is the terminal window
and if we get a response to an
application then we'll actually get a
positive response which would be fetched
response so again very quick and easy
that you use the async function to be
able to build out and you to get your
asynchronous code
so what is the purpose of module exports
so a module export is a way to
encapsulate your the entire code for a
solution in a single package and a
single file and then you can then share
that with other developers so you're all
working from the same environment so
with this we have come to the end of
