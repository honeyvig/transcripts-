hello everyone welcome back to Simply
learns YouTube channel today we are
diving into a super important topic that
affects everyone fishing attacks as
cyber criminals get more sophisticated
it's important for us to stay one step
ahead so in this video I'll be walking
you through what fishing is how it works
some famous examples of fishing attacks
different types of fishing how to
protect yourself and what to do if you
ever fall victim so let's Jump Right In
what is fishing to start let's talk
about what a fishing attack really is in
simple terms fishing is a type of scam
where hackers pretend to be legitimate
people or companies to steal your
personal information whether it's your
passwords Bank details or even social
security number they typically do this
through emails text messages or fake
websites that seem genuine at first
glance but fishing attacks don't just
rely on fake emails they use a
psychological trick known as social
engineering now social engineering is
all about manipulating people into
making poor decisions like clicking on a
malicious link or sharing personal
information let's take an example
imagine you work in a company and one
day you get an urgent email from someone
who looks like your boss the email says
I'm in a meeting right now but I need
you to send me the financial reports
immediately click here to access the
secq file because it's your boss and the
message sounds urgent you might not
think twice and click the link but
that's where the trick is the L wasn't
real and now the hacker has the access
to the company sensitive data so social
engineering works because it plays on
human emotions like fear urgency trust
and leads you to make hasty decisions
without double-checking so fishing
attacks a serious business and they have
caused some of the most damaging data
breaches in history let's take a look at
some of the most famous examples first
let's talk about the son pictures hack
in 2014 this is one of the most
well-known fishing incidents it all
started when son employees received fish
ing emails that looked completely
legitimate some employees clicked on the
links in these emails which gave hackers
access to Sun's internal Network and the
result over 100 terabytes of data was
stolen including unreleased movies
confidential employee information and
thousands of internal emils the league
data caused major damage to Sony's
reputation and lead to loss use it was
one of the most costly cyber attacks of
its time another incredible fishing
incident involved both Facebook and
Google between 2013 and 2015 a single
hacker managed to scam these s Giants
out of over100 million how did he do it
the hacker evaldas pretended to be a
hardware supplier that both companies
did business with he sent fishing emails
with fake invoices that looked exactly
like the real thing because the emails
were so convincing the finance
Departments of the Facebook and Google
didn't question them and wired the money
directly to the attacker account so
these famous examples show that fishing
can affect anyone from Everyday People
to major corporations so let's talk
about how they work step by step when
hackers actually try to steal your
information but before that if you're

box and pin comments so how does a
fishing attack unfold let's break it
into Easy Steps step one fishing attacks
typically start with a carefully crafted
message often in the form of an email or
text this message will look like it's
from a legitimate company like your bank
a popular service like PayPal or even
someone you personally know hackers
usually use several techniques to make
these emails look authentic one common
technique is domain spoofing this is
when hackers create a domain that looks
almost identical to the legitimate
website but with subtle differences for
example instead of
paypal.com they might use PayPal 1.com
or
paypal.com because most people glance at
the sender's email address quickly they
don't notice the subtle change the next
step is to get the wi victim to visit a
fake website when you click on the link
in the fishing email you're often
redirected to a website that looks
exactly like the real thing these fake
websites are often designed to perfectly
mimic the official login pages of
services like your bank or email
provider to create these fake websites
hackers often use what's called a
fishing kit now fishing kits are
pre-built tools that make it easy for
attackers to clone real websites the
hacker then hosts the fake website on a
malicious server or uses DN poofing
where they manipulate the DNS records to
redirect users from the legitimate
website to their fake version without
the victim knowing now once you land on
the fake website the next step is for
the hacker to collect your information
so these fake pages are designed to look
identical to the real ones so when you
enter your username and password you
think you're logging in securely but
here what's happening in the background
fishing sites use various methods to
capture the information you type in one
common technique is form jacket where
the form the website is modified to send
the data directly to the attacker server
alternately hackers can use key logging
malware that records every key stroke
you make capturing usernames passwords
and even credit card information as you
type so to make the fake site even more
convincing attackers often secured it
with a real SSL certificate now this
means the website might show up as
secured with a padlog symbol in your
browser making you believe it's
legitimate so this is why it's important
to check more than just the https in the
URL now once the hacker has your data
they can use it in various ways the most
common method is using your stolen
credentials to log into your accounts
this is known as credential stuffing but
they can also use your personal
information for identity theft or they
might sell your data on the dark web but
fishing isn't a one siiz fits all
approach hackers use several different
types of fishing attacks and each one is
designed for a specific Target or method
so now let's talk about the different
types of fishing attacks first we have
General fishing which is the most common
and Broad type so in this type of attack
hackers send out thousands or even
millions of fishing emails to random
people hoping that a small percentage
will fall for the scam for example let's
say you receive an email that looks like
it's from a popular company like Netflix
the email says something like your
payment method has failed click here to
update your information you click the
link and it takes you to a fake Netflix
login when you enter your details they
are sent straight to the hacker these
attacks are sent out to as many people
as possible whoever Falls for it falls
for it it's all about volume with
General fishing next is spear fishing so
unlike General fishing spear fishing is
much more targeted so the attacker picks
a specific individual or company and
tailors the attack to that person or
group so spear fishing requires some
research and planning so it's more
sophisticated than General fishing for
example imagine you work in the finance
department of a company and you receive
an email from someone pretending to be
the CEO the email says he's unable to
transfer the money to the partner
company and asks you to transfer it so
since it appears to be from your boss
and it sounds urgent you might be
tempted to complete the transfer without
questioning it that's the goal of spear
fishing because the email is
personalized and often uses real names
or Insider informations it's much easier
to fall for it so this makes spear
fishing especially dangerous for
businesses now let's talk about whaling
which is similar to spear fishing but
with a bigger Target so whaling
specifically targets higher ranking
individuals like C CEOs CFOs or other
Executives so these attacks are often
highly sophisticated because Stakes are
so high let's say a hacker sends an
email to the CFO of a large corporation
pretending to be a lawyer representing
the company so the email contains a fake
warrant asking the CFO to click a link
to download important legal documents
because it's a legal matter and appears
highly official the CFO clicks the link
which leads to malware being installed
on the company's Network so wailing
attacks are dangerous because they often
involve larger sums of money or more
sensitive information so when high level
Executives fall for these scams the
consequences can be disastrous next
comes SEO fishing so SEO fishing takes a
different approach so instead of
targeting individuals with emails or
text messages hackers create fake
websites and manipulate search engines
so that these sites show up at the top
of search results so people who are
searching for services or products May
unknowingly click on these malicious
websites for example imagine you trying
to log to Bank of America and you search
for Bank of America login so fishing
site could show up at the top of the
result looking exactly like the original
website you fill out the form entering
your personal and payment information
but instead of going to the bank all of
that information goes straight to the
hacker so SEO fishing works because we
trust search engines to lead us to
legitimate sites hackers take advantage
of that trust by manipulating search
engine algorithms to display their
malicious sites and finally their
missing with stands for SMS fishing
smashing involves sending fraudulent
messages through SMS or text so these
texts often appear to come from a
trusted Source like your bank or a
delivery service and contain a link that
leads to a fishing site for example
let's say you get a text that looks like
it's from a delivery company such as
FedEx telling you to set your delivery
preferences the message includes a link
to do the same when you click the link
it takes you to a fake FedEx site that
asks for your name address and credit
card information to cover delivery fees
so sming is effective because people
tend to trust text messages more than
emails especially when they are on the
go and may not scrutinize a message as
close ly anyways fortunately there are
several things you can do to protect
yourself from fishing attacks so first
and foremost always think before you
click if you get an email or text asking
you to click a link stop and think does
this look suspicious hover over the link
to see where it actually leads before
you click next don't upload personal
information online be careful where you
share your personal information online
hackers often gather details from social
media or public profiles to make their
fishing attempts more convincing in so
make sure to keep your software
operating system and apps updated
regular updates include security patches
that protect against known
vulnerabilities next is use antivirus
and email Security install a good
antivirus program and use email services
with fishing filters these tools can
block many fishing emails before they
even reach your inbox and lastly use a
secure DNS service this can prevent you
from even assessing malicious websites
adding an extra layer of protection now
even with these precautions fishing ATT
can sometimes be successful so what
happens if you're already fallen a
victim let's talk about what to do after
a fishing attack so if you realize you
fallen for a fishing attack Don't Panic
there are steps you can take to minimize
the damage first report the attack to
cyber crime authorities in many
countries there are dedicated teams that
handle online fraud and the faster they
are notified the better next change the
passwords for any accounts that may have
been compromised make sure each password
is unique and avoid using the same
password for multiple accounts next
enable multif authentication on your
accounts MFA adds an extra step like a
code sent to your phone which makes it
harder for hackers to gain access and
lastly run a full malware scan on your
devices if you clicked a link or
downloaded something from the fishing
attack malware might have been installed
so it's important to remove it as
quickly as possible and there you have
it we have covered everything you need
to know about fishing attacks from how
