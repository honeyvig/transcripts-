now let's talk about the American
economy there are fresh fears of a
recession there America's fight against
inflation has stalled and that's raising
concerns here in India as well well
there could be some bad news for the US
economy a noted forecaster claims that
the country is already in recession
potential GDP is likely uh lower than
actual GDP will be so not just the labor
market the economy overall likely will
be running hotter in 24 that it's
underlying potential Michael R strein
while talking to project syndicates said
that there is still a big risk that the
US will hit recession Japan's economy
narrowly avoids recession as growth
figures are revised hello everyone and
welcome to this video by simply learn in
this video we will be talking about
recession layoff in the tech industry
and what the future look like for us so
recession so much buz so much noise
about it some of you might already know
about recession and how it impacts
everyone for those who are still
confused let me break it down for you in
simple terms there is no such standard
definition of recession but there are
two major ways to Define recession
firstly is a technical recession and the
other is indicative recession based on
the yield curve representation for
simpler understanding we will first
understand the technical definition of
recession con considered a country like
the USA some of the top exports of the
USA includes oil civil aviation Parts
liquefied natural gas and passenger
vehicles among others the export of
these things along with a lot of other
products services and non-product such
as defense and education services
constitute the GDP for the USA here's a
tricky part GDP of the USA increases
when it has a positive trade balance or
Surplus however GDP decreas es when USA
spends more money importing goods and
products than it actually makes
exporting goods and products which leads
to a trade deficit an easy way to look
at it is that in December 2023 United
States exported $168 billion and
imported $247 billion resulting in a
negative trade balance of 79.7 billion
US Imports jumped 1.1% from December to
324 .6 billion in January according to
the latest Commerce Department report in
particular Optics were locked in Goods
such as computers and semiconductors as
well as Auto vehicles and parts while
exports of industrial supplies such as
crude oil slipped now you know what
recession is and how it functions and
what causes it but you must be wondering
where the recession came from let me
explain it to you basically if the USA
has negative GDP for two consecutive
quarters in a financial year then the
USA said to be in recession whenever a
session occurs in a country it causes
layoff extended strain on economic
activities and unemployment but the
question is why since during recession
the country's goods and services are in
a low demand which in turn causes low
GDP the company startling of workers
which eventually leads to employment
decline globally more employees were
laid off in 2023 than during any other
year with more than 2.61 lakh people
being handed pink slips by companies
news8 reported citing lofs FYI a website
that tracks layoff across the world
broadly speaking layoff are a way for
any company to cut it down its operating
cost to maintain positive cash flow but
wait a minute if you think the layoff
are only attributed to a company having
less growth or Revenue then do hear me
out from the US to Europe and Asia
Global Tech Giants from Microsoft and
Google to Amazon sap and more have laid
off thousands of employees in 2023
that's despite most of these companies
being profitable headcount reduction is
a result of over hiring during the
pandemic and a slower growth Outlook
that originally forecasted according to
a report by financial services company
with with interest rates and inflation
remaining elevated consumers are pulling
back spending amid uncertainty in the
global economy but what does this
actually mean broadly speaking the
companies made a wrong prediction of how
much money they will be able to make
postco so they hired more people to meet
the predicted Revenue Target but since
they were not able to achieve the target
they had to lay off people an addition
of a Fed rate hike also stampen the
company's desire to retain or hire new
people since such rate hikes necessarily
impact the stock value investors get
lower returns and even the companies
have to pay more interest to the banks a
culmination of incorrect growth
projections low Revenue over hiring and
an increased Fed rate causes the company
to take a step back and hence the layoff
all right everyone I hope this video has
given you a fair deal of ideas about
recession layoff its major causes and
how it impacts the economy and
employment another important question
that might occur in your mind as it has
occurred in a lot of people that is is
AI the real reason why people are losing
jobs and what does the job market look
like in 2024 let's address to each of
these this is what the growth of AI
looks like as a search term on Google
Trends product app services and features
software running on AI built on AI and
being push in the market every day CH
GPT llms machine learning are becoming
top of the town and people obviously
including investors are showing interest
in these like never before IMF in its
latest blog stated that AI will affect
almost 40% of the job around the world
replacing some and complimenting others
we need a careful balance of policies to
tap its potential artificial
intelligence AI could replace the
equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs
a report by Investment Bank Goldman
Sachs says it could replace a quarter of
work task in the US and Europe but may
also mean new jobs and productivity boom
a study by the mckeny global Institute
reports that by 20130 at least 14% of
the employees globally could need to
change their careers due to digitization
Robotics and AI advancements but it's
not all dull and gloomy even though AI
will have lasting impact on over dozen
cor jobs like customer services
salesperson underwriting research and
Analysis in unison the experts have
stated that Ai and machine learning will
create amazing opportunities and even
higher paying ones in the future which
bring us to the second part of the
question what does the job market look
like in 2024 even though still fragile
economies have started slowly recovering
from 2023 recession and layoff wave
companies have already made major
restructuring efforts and now aligning
their hiring efforts with new approaches
the need of being skilled and becoming
an expert professional will be the key
factor in defining how relevant you will
be in the job market even with multiple
projections of recession scared the US
job market but the country's economy was
able to have a rather soft Landing
similarly the UK Japanese and Indian job
market also seems to be maneuvering
fairly well and adjusting itself to the
new demands of the market jobs creating
AI tools and the ones leveraging them
for the other roles such as marketing
will likely search reshaping the way
people work even though not everything
seems to be smooth right now important
economic indicators reveal a rather
upward movement in the job market people
who are still able to utilize new and
upcoming Technologies like AI gen
machine learning will be able to steer
clear any downsizing in the company and
in fact grow even further in their
career aspirations with the right skill
set continuous learning and regular
adaptation to the job market and
Technology the future seems fairly
optimistic and aspirational that's all
