hey everyone welcome back to Simply
learns YouTube channel if you are a FMA
user or a designer today's video is
going to be a game changer we are diving
into the top 20 figma plugins that will
take your design workflow to the next
level whether you new to figma or a pro
these plugins are going to save you tons
of time boost your creativity and make
the entire design process way smoother
so what exactly is a figma plug-in figma
is already an incredible design tool but
plugins are like super powers that make
it even better so there are little
add-ons you can install directly in
figma to help you do things faster and
more efficiently need to automate
repetitive tasks like aligning elements
creating mockups or exporting assets
there's a plugin for that or want to
generate dummy text icons or images for
a quick mockup there's a plugin for that
too or do you want to add cool
animations or try out different styles
without starting from scratch plugins
can handle that so essentially they fill
in the Gap Z fig doesn't cover by
default and they're really easy to use
so let's dive straight into the video
okay so let's start with AI rename
layers so have you ever looked at your
figma project and seen a mess of layers
all called as frame 1 group two and so
on so it can get really confusing
especially when you're working on big
projects but with this particular
plug-in you don't have to worry about
renaming layers yourself anymore here's
how it works you select a bunch of
layers go to plugins and run it you can
also describe the context if you want
rename the layers and boom it renamed
your layers it understood that this is
the content areas these are the content
areas and this is the main shape and
this is the image pretty cool isn't it
so like for example if there is a button
inside a frame it might rename it a
primary button or main frame making it
much easier to navigate your file and
the best part is you can do this for
hundreds of layers at once and it saves
you a ton of time especially when you
have a big project with lots of elements
and it's super handy and keeps your
layers organized without any extra
effort on your part now if you have ever
worked in Photoshop and wanted to switch
over to figma without losing any of your
design work then you're going to love
this next pluging that we are talking
about it's called kodia AI PSD to figma
so basically it lets you import your
Photoshop files directly into figma and
here's the best part everything stays
editable the layers groups masks it's
all preserved so let's just run
this so here you can just drag and drop
or you can you know upload your image
from your file so as you can see it's
scanning the
image and as you can see in just a few
seconds the plug-in is importing the
whole file into figma yes it's done
let's see wow as you can see that I can
click any layers in this particular
frame and it's editable and I can change
it the color resize it or move it around
like this just like I would do in
Photoshop so it's convenient especially
if you have old designs in PSD format
that you want to update in figma and
don't worry about the file size this
plug-in works with files up to 1 GB so
even large projects are of no problem
now next let's talk about an awesome
Creator who called double glitch and he
has developed some really impressive
Advanced prototyping techniques now one
standard project is this cursor tracking
tutorial so this basically lets you
track your mouse movements directly
within figma so this means you can
showcase how users interact with your
design like hovering over buttons or
navigating across different elements
making your project feel more Dynamic
and realistic so let's just see a few
example of this let's just run
this WOW as you can see in action how
the cursor follows along as you move it
across the design it's a great way to
make your prototype more engaging
especially when you're presenting to
clients or testing out user flows
wow this is just amazing so instead of
just showing the static screens this
adds a layer of interactivity that makes
your design feel closer to a fully
functional product this is super cool
but that's not all double glitch has
also created a technique for Parallax
effects like this right inside Vima so
if you're unfamiliar paralle scrolling
gives your design a sense of depth by
having different elements move at varing
speeds as you scroll so let's just play
this and see how it works wow pretty
cool so it's typically something you
need Advanced animation software for but
now you can do directly right inside
figma let's see some more
examples okay this is one kind of
example see so all these type of
animations Advanced animations can be
done with this particular plugin so you
can bring your designs to life with
these Smo animations and transitions
adding a whole new level to your
presentation now next plugin that we
have is HTML to design so this plugin is
a game changer for anyone looking to
convert a website into a fully able
figmma design so it's pretty simple
let's just see how so you basically just
have to type your url over here like
whichever websites design you want to
introspect and then just import it it
will take a few
seconds you can see the magic happening
in the background so you just had to
Simply input the URL of the site you
want to replicate and hit the input
button and boom and you have this the
editable Apple website so you'll have a
customizable design right in your figma
workspace now you might wonder why you
would want to convert a website to a
design rather than the other way around
so the thing is if you're just starting
out in UI the plugin is a perfect tool
for learning so it basically lets you
explore how different websites are
structured so what design elements they
use and how they achieve the Aesthetics
so that you know they you can get
inspiration from them and also get a
clear idea on how they have done it and
then use it for your project so
analyzing existing projects is a great
way to build your design skills and this
plug-in helps you so much for that
purpose as you can see all the layers is
editable you know all the layers all the
layers are editable so this is pretty
cool this is pretty helpful now next up
is a plugin that's going to be super
useful for anyone who loves Google fonts
so it's called Google fonts on offici
and it gives you direct access to the
full Google fonts library right inside
figma so here's how the trick works
let's say I have a text Block in my
design that I want to style so I can
open the plugin search for any Google
font and apply it to my text instantly
just like this how easy was that that
now you can also you know filter the
style or even find fonts that fit a
certain Vibe or look plus if you want to
download the font for use outside figma
you know it gives you a link for that
too so you can save the font over here
you can preview the font now there are
some super tools inside this itself as
you can see there are color palettes
color gradients so this is Google fonts
which we already saw then we have
illustrations you have image picker
gradients measure gradient so it's super
convenient to keep all your font choices
consistent across your projects and the
best part is that you don't have to you
know go out of MMA and search for fonts
or Styles anymore so this is pretty
convenient now if you're looking for a
plugin that gives you massive library of
UI elements then you have got to try
slide UI so it has over 10,000 premium
UI assets that you can drag and drop
into your design so basically like
buttons forms cards navigation bars you
name it we can just drag and drop so
let's see how this works so let's
so let's just run it and the cool thing
is everything is organized by theme you
know so like you can select from light
mode dark mode if you want a dashboard
you can select that if you want a
testimonial selection you can select
that you know there are tons of features
like menu Services about us pricing so
for example if I like this particular
design what I have to do is I just have
to drag it and drop it into my fitar
canvas pretty simple and even here all
the elements are editable I can edit
this particular this thing I can edit
this particular icon so this is also
pretty handy pretty helpful so you know
it's not that always if you have an idea
you have to go about designing the stuff
you can also so just see how helpful
these plugins are you know it saves a
lot of manual work and all the
components here as you see are
responsive thanks to the auto layout and
they come with frames and constraints
already set up so you don't need to do
much adjustments so whether you are
working on mobile or desktop designs
this plugin has something for you and
since all the elements are modern and
welld designed it helps you create
polish uice really quickly so now before
we move on to the next plug-in if you

now let's move on to our next plugin so
if you love playing with gradients and
want to add more flare to your designs
then you definitely have to check out
super mes gradient provided by Angelo
libero so this plugin lets you create
super Dynamic gradients with cool
textured features let's just see how
let's just run the plugin so here's how
it works first of all you have to select
the color palette so pink and green is
already selected let's select more
colors we select a bit of
gray okay this is gray we can even
change the shape
if you want we can try the rectangle you
can keep it ellipse you can keep it
Square gray doesn't look that good let's
go back to Red itself Yes red is fine
you can even change the ratio but let's
just keep it 1 is to one and you as you
can see you can just drag around the
points of gradients and adjust the
gradients direction position and you can
even add grein for that extra bit of
texture for example if you want to
increase the grein you can just increase
the
opacity let's just keep it
here yeah you can change the scale you
can blur it so as you can see as I
adjust the settings here you can see the
gradient change in real time on my
canvas so you can use it for background
buttons or any other Design Elements so
for example also you can you know save
it in different resolutions and add it
to your canvas here I'm adding to my
canvas let's see yes so here we got an
image and you can actually use this you
know for background effects or to design
your element which is pretty cool and
pretty simple so this was it about super
mesh gradient so now next we are talking
about enema so if you're into animations
and want more control over them in figma
then enima lets you create super smooth
transitions between frames so here you
can control the frame rate TW the timing
and even choose how the motion flows
from one element to another so let's see
we have two frames with two shapes so
first first thing you have to do is to
create flows between them and make sure
that the flows stays in smart animation
now after that you just have to run the
plug-in so here what you have to do is
you just have to select the elements
which has smart animation you can change
the frame per second speed size anything
and you just have to render the animate
so this might take some time so I'll
just show you how this would
particularly look like and in what
circumstances you can use Smart
animation for so these are some of the
examples where you can can use Smart
animation you can use it for rotation
you can use it to fill the colors you
can use it for
opacity like this you can use it for
scaling up and also you can use for
changing the position like this so these
are some of the circumstances that you
would use Smart animation for now next
we are talking about I chart plugin so
the I chart plugin is a lifesaver for
anyone needing to create charts in figma
so instead of manually building graphs I
chart lets you quickly generate bar P or
line charts by inputting your data
directly so whether you have a data set
ready or need to enter numbers on the
flly this plugin does the work for you
producing clean customizable sharts
right on your figma so let's just
explore this particular plugin let's
just run this plugin wow this is pretty
cool so you can actually you know enter
your data set over here and you have a
variety of charts like bar graph line
graph P charts and you can also you know
easily tweak the colors labels and
layout to match your design Style so
it'll be perfect for dashboards reports
or UI projects so as you can see if
we're regularly working with data iart
speeds up the process and keeps
everything within figma as you can see
you can fetch the data and generate the
chart so it's a must have tool for
smooth data visualization so now let's
dive into stippling plugin an awesome
tool created by figma Pro Vijay Varma so
this plug-in is ideal for adding
intricate dot patterns to your design
making it perfect for both UI work and
artistic graphic projects like posters
or illustrations so it replaces a
classic Ming our technique but entirely
by figma so this is super simple so for
example I have this image over here so
let's just work on this image let's go
to
plugin okay let's run this so as you can
see it actually created a dotted image
for me so you can increase the spacing I
think this is fine you can increase the
size you can increase or decrease the
brightness and just generate it so you
can customize everything so the Clos the
dots the more intricate the design is
spreading them out creates a more
minimalistic and artistic way so this
plug-in is fantastic for giving your
designs a textured handmade look without
needing to use any other software so if
you're looking for a vintage Artistic
Touch or just something different for
your UI then stippling makes it easy so
it's a great addition for any designer
wanting to boost creativity right inside
figma now next we have content re so
this fantastic plug-in allows you to
quickly fill your designs with realistic
text and images so it offers various
libraries containing elements like names
addresses emails and even currencies so
what you have to do is for example I
just have these two shapes so I want to
fill these shapes with images so I just
select one Avatar I just select this
design select this Avatar and boom how
cool was that so I can go to image and I
want some other avat so this is how you
can actually fill and if you want to
fill the text you can you know create a
text box go go to text choose a style
and fill it so you have text image icon
you know so many varieties the thing is
with just a click your selected layers
will be populated with relevant content
so this is incredibly useful when you're
working on prototypes or mockups and
need to visualize how your design will
look with actual data so the thing is
instead of wasting time typing in dummy
text you can focus on the creative
aspects of your design and it's a Time
Saver
now next is fast isometric so if you
have ever wanted to add some depth to
your designs this plugin is for you it
allows you to convert your 2D designs
into isometric views effortlessly just
like this so you can just you know move
around and effortlessly create isometric
views so you can create isometric shapes
by simply adjusting the parameters also
and this capability can be particularly
useful when designing Graphics or user
interfaces that requires 3D appearance
so with fast isometric you can enhance
your visual St Stelling and make your
design standard by adding a unique
perspective also you can you know
explore this Q section where you can
just rotate it by changing the angle so
this is a go-to plugin for isometric
views so moving on to unsplash unsplash
is a well-known platform offering a vast
collection of high quality royaltyfree
images so the unsplash plug-in for figma
makes it super easy to access this
Library so let's just open so you can
search for any image directly within
your figma project and import it with a
single click so this is fantastic for
those times when you need stunning
visuals like these but don't have the
time or resources to create them from
scratch so whether you're looking for
background images illustrations or any
other type of Graphics unsplash provides
a seamless way to enhance your designs
so it's also a great resource for
maintaining a professional look in your
projects without any licensing concerns
pretty handy isn't
it so next on the list is autoflow so
this plugin is all about efficiency when
it comes to creating user flow
it allows you to draw connections
between shapes and Frames quickly so
let's just open this in
figma so you just have to select an
element press the shift key select the
next element and yes you have a flow and
the best part is you can even you know
name this flow like anything I can just
add a random text and it so like this is
particularly useful when you want to
explain what the flu is like you know if
you want to explain the flow like why
this is going from here to here you can
actually give the explanation over here
which will be pretty easy for you while
you'll be giving your presentations and
also if you need to reposition your
shapes you can run the plugin again and
it updates the connections for you so
this feature is especially handy for wif
framing and prototyping user Journeys
making it easy to visualize how users
will navigate through your app or
website and it saves you from the
tedious task of manually drawing lines
from each elements and ures of flows are
neat and organized
so next we have star it is used to check
the accessibility of the designs so star
offers various tools as you can see the
color contrast Checker the vision
simulator and typography analyzer all in
one place so with the color contrast
Checker you can ensure the text is
readable against its background which is
crucial for users with visual
impairments now the vision simulator
lets you see how your designs will look
to people with different types of color
blindness and by using star you can
identify and fix accessibility issues
before handing off your Des to
developers so ensuring that your end
product is usable for your wider
audience now next on the list is icon Le
Pro so this plugin features an extensive
library of thousands of beautifully
crafted icons in six different layers
and you know what the best part is all
these icons are of SVG format which
means you can scale them without losing
quality so let's just see
so whether you need icons for navigation
buttons or any other UI elements icon
pro has got you covered with such a wide
variety you can easily find Icons that
for the athetic of your project you can
go to your right hand side and also

ability to customize in colors and sizes
makes it even more versatile so having
access to such a robust icon library at
your fingertips can really speed up your
design process and improve the quality
of your designs
now moving on to type scales if you have
ever in doubt about the hierarchy of
your typography for example this plugin
will simplify the process so it allows
you to create a proportional and
consistent type scale within just a few
clicks so let's just see the options
over here so as you can see you can
start by specifying your base font the
base size and choosing from various
other scale factors which dictate how
the other sizes relates to your base
size and once you hit the generate
button you receive a perfectly
structured type scill that that can be
applied throughout your design so this
is espcially useful for maintaining the
visual consistency in your typography
and ensuring that your text elements
work together and have some type of
consistency now next we have the mockup
plugin so it offers a vast collection of
high quality mockups that make
presenting your designs of these so you
simply have to select a design as you
can see you know there are mockups for
mobile separately for iPads for MacBook

the color contrast and text contrast in
the background elements so as you know
accessibility is a crucial part of
design especially for users with visual
impairments

designs meet industry standards for
readability so using this plugin is very
simple you have to run the plugin scan
it and here I don't have any issues like
my design is okay I don't have any
issues so basically you simply have to
select the text and background layers
you want to check and run the contrast
plugin so it instantly shows you the
contrast ratio also in between the
colors now according to the web content
accessibility guidelines your text
should have a minimum contrast ratio of
4 is to 5 is to 1 for noral text and 3
is to one for larger texts and also if
the contrast is too low the plugin will
notify you and you can experiment with
different colors right inside the plugin
and now finally we have break points so
this plugin is crucial for creating
responsive layers as you can see here so
it allows Your Design to preview how
your layouts will adapt to different
screen sizes without keeping the plugin
open so you can set break points for
various devices enabling you to see how
your design will look on mobile tablet
