yeah hi winners this is Dr Shri from
Team MDS conquer now I'm here to discuss
few important topics related to or
integrated to microbiology given in neat
2023 as a quick revision so the first
question is oral hay loopia is caused by
which of the following okay the answer
is
EBV okay it's also commonly seen or it's
also most commonly reported
with HIV
positive
homosexual males and most of us are
familiar related to
ABV is the main causitive organism
of kissing's disease because of deep
kissing that is nothing but called as
glandular favor the diagnostic test that
are useful for this glandular favor are
your monospot test and pal banal test
okay so that those are the basic things
that you have to make a note okay EBV
EBV apart from this EBV is going to
cause kissing disease kissing disease is
also called as glandular favor and
kissing disase the diagnostic Futures
the diagnostic test for the kissing
disease are monospot test as well as
palal test the next one first reported
by scientist name they're asking first
reported by scientist name name that
is green
span okay and make sure in the comment
box please do mention what is green span
lesion and what is green span syndrome
okay you have green span lesion as well
as green span syndrome please do mention
both of them in the comment box I'll
I'll I'll address you okay right it is
most commonly seen at Oral hay lcop is
most commonly seen
at
lateral borders of tongue and preferably
it is going to be
bilateral okay so coming to the
hystology the hystology is mainly
focusing on epithelial hyperplasia with
acanthosis and Hyper keratosis so these
are the important lines that you have to
make note related to the histology the
next question is kosis saroma of course
you know this is most commonly
associated with HIV positive individual
okay right so it is basically caused by
which virus okay the question is that is
the answer is
human herp
type 8 very frequently Asked question
okay human herose type 8 now few points
related to hairy black tongue or black
hairy tongue okay it's also called as
hairy tongue so these are the other
names that you have to make a note okay
so normally you have different types of
Pap that are present on the tongue
normally uh if you just uh check out
this Phil form Pap the Phil form papill
are uh approximately 1
mm in
length
but in the case of this hairy black
tongue okay you will have hypertrophy of
these philam papilla and their length
will be more than 15 mm and this black
hairy tongue is most commonly associated
in males as well as in HIV positive
individuals the treatment is you need to
just brush them properly uh by adding
40% is
Ura okay right so the next question is
Moon small
also called as mulbury
Ms okay Moon's Ms also called as mulbury
merss or Foreigner merss are commonly
seen in which of the following infection
the answer is cental syphilis syphilis
okay and syphilis we have already
discussed in the quick revision that
syphilis is basically divided into
primary syphilis secondary syphilis
tertiary syphilis and cental syphilis so
these are most commonly seen in your
cental syphilis and please do answer
what is hutchingson Triad okay here here
you have hutchingson teeth right so
please do answer me what is hutchingson
Triad okay in the comment box as well as
hutchingson pupil what is hutchingson
pupil please do comment me in the
comment box okay so uh the next
important thing is you can see this
oclusion modifications okay the
occlusion 1/3 is mainly modified and you
can see in the diagram the occlusion 1/3
modifications so coming to the uh cental
syphilis so in cental syphilis you will
have modification of both anterior teeth
as well as posterior teeth posterior yes
we are already done they are merss
nothing but called as malber merss on
Moon shaped MERS where oclusal 1/3 is
being affected so coming to the anterior
teeth anterior teeth are basically
called as hingson teeth okay they are
regularly screwdriver shaped incisors
will be seen with an epical Notch okay
so if you just check out this morphology
of the uh anterior teeth the meil and
the distal surfaces of the crown they
are going to taer and converge towards
the Inc ledge rather than towards the
cervical margin with an epical Notch so
you're going to have an epical Notch
like this on the inis ledge you going to
have an epical Notch and this is
basically due to absence of Central
tubercle or calcification Center so
among the four four uh incisors okay so
regularly maxillary lateral is going to
be normal okay your maxillary Central
mandibular Central and mandibular
lateral are affected so they can ask you
a question which of the following uh
incisor uh will be normal or will be
unaffected your answer should be
maxillary lateral is mostly unaffected
in most of the situations according to
the reference of Shaffers Okay the
reason why this Notch will be seen is
basically due to absence of Central
tubercle or calcification Center so
similarly with this uh uh with this I
want you to add a note what is Turner
Turner hypoplasia turnus teeth okay
turnus hypoplasia turnus teeth is
basically trauma or infection to that of
the disis teeth affecting the
underlining permanent dentation okay so
you will have
hypoplasia you will have hypoplasia only
a a single teeth so in the case based
question whenever you have an
abnormality only a single teeth is
associated then you can go for the
answer as turnus hypoplasia or turnus te
okay similarly you something have Turner
syndrome okay can you tell me what is uh
the chromosomal notification that is uh
that is given for Turner syndrome in the
comment box okay so what is stus
syndrome and what tell me how many
chromosomes are there okay and what is
the uh chromosomal notification I mean
uh how how it is going to get
represented chromosomally how you are
going to represent Turner syndrome
please do drop me in the uh notification
similarly uh I want you to add a note
about uh Hutchings and Tri so what is
hutchingson Tri so hutchingson Tri is
most commonly seen in the case of cental
cus and please do mention in the comment
box what is hutchingson Triad and
similarly I want you to add a note about
hutchingson pupil where you see
hutchingson pupil and what is
hutchingson pupil please do add it okay
hington Sun teeth and hutchingson triad
are seen in the case of cental cus I
hope you very very clear with that next
coming to the question number three okay
the question number three is about uh uh
gray pseudo membran okay or uh gray to
green color pseudo membrane which is
very very difficult to remove okay so
gray grayish pseudomembrane or gray to
green color pom membran which is very
very difficult to remove the answer is
CD that is K bacterium Thia okay is the
diagnosis where you will have a gray
color pseudo membrane so particularly in
these patients the coron dfia patients
are going to uh have an emergency
situation that is basically due to due
to asfixia okay that is basically Al due
to thick gray pseudomembrane will be
formed on the respiratory system which
make them to suffocate and they require
an emergency treatment of air opening
okay so that is very very important
about uh the theia patient okay and
where do you see this is again a
question for you where do you see this
grayish pseudomembrane most commonly in
the theia patients in the tonsils okay
in the tonsils you can see so in the
description part they're going to tell
you in the tron cils there is a gray
pseudo membrane which is very very
difficult to remove or resistance to
remove or painful during the remove Mo
okay your answer should be dfia okay so
similarly as we are talking gra pseudo
membran I'll just add a note about gra
gray baby syndrome okay Gray baby
syndrome where do you see this graay
baby syndrome Whenever there is abnormal
uses of choron phicol okay so this is
basically seen in the case of you can
see in the diagram based okay so this is
basically a gray baby syndrome okay the
gray baby syndrome is going to have
abnormal distinction and hydrodynamic
collapse okay so you'll have hydr
Dynamic changes in the individual okay
the baby appears gray in color okay
similarly there are other important
aspects that you have to know about D
theia this test was the diagram based
question of test was given in theia very
simple coron bacterium theia short form
is CD how your CDs long back we used to
CD we used to use CD drives right so how
they look like they look like this this
is how the CD are going to look like
okay whenever you have a diagram like
this your answer should be CD okay what
test this is you can see here it is
looking like K and this is looking like
L okay so this is
Alix gel precipitation test okay Alex
gel precipitation test okay I I hope you
can easily remember this this is looking
like L and this is looking like K okay
this is elex okay test and this test is
basically useful for the confirmation of
CD okay so the other important stains
that are useful for this are they can
ask you a diagram based question like
this okay diagram based question like
this with basil
and with the polar bodies on on both the
ends okay so this is called as
metachromatic granules with polar bodies
these are basically seen in the case of
Albert
stain or niss stain okay that is useful
for the diagnosis of CD again CD
diagnosis will be there so the serum
that is useful for the diagnosis of CD
is L for serum slope okay right so they
can ask the uh the bacteria was grown on
this particular serum or the bacteria
Stained on this particular stain which
is difficult to remove painful to remove
gra pseudo membran so such a questions
they can ask in the case of uh case
based questions okay and similarly in
the last few years last year last but
one year so there is a question again
Bulls neck okay this is due to edtis
okay you can see bull neck in the case
of deia and the most common cause of
death in the theia is due to the
circulatory failure okay right I hope
you're very very very clear so the
points are very very clear okay so so
please do mention uh in the comment box
uh that which topic you really want to
understand so that we will be taking
those things as a priority and we'll be
preparing some short Quick videos so
that's going to help you in the
preparation phase and make sure the
questions two or three questions which I
have asked please do mention them in the
comment box and I'm going to respond you
and address you the right answers for
now signing off Dr shant from Team MDS
conquer bye-bye take
care
