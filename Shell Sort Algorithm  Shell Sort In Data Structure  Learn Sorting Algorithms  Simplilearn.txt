hey everyone
i am pepper khandelwal and i welcome you
all to simply learnt's youtube channel
in this session we will discuss shell
sort
we will begin our session by introducing
shell sort
then we will discuss shell sort
algorithm
after that we will implement shell sort
in a codeurator
finally we will sum up what we have
learned from this session
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel
and clicked on the bell icon below so
you never miss an update from simply
learn's youtube channel
so without any further ado let's get
started with an introduction
to shell sort shell sort is a sorting
algorithm
that is based on insertion sort
algorithm and
it is very efficient when the smaller
value is on the far
right and must be shifted to the far
left then
this method avoids significant shifts as
in insertion sort
now let's discuss the algorithm of shell
sort
let's say we have an array we will
initialize a variable
h this edge will represent intervals
then we will divide this array into h
intervals
it will create sub sub arrays then we
will apply
insertion sort on these sub arrays
after that we will reduce the interval
edge by one
then we will repeat this process
recursively until
h counts down to one we have now
introduced
shell sort and its algorithm now
let's try to implement this algorithm in
the code editor
first we will start within function to
sort an array using shell sort
so int
cell sort we will write argument as
end arr
bracket comma
and n
will start within big interval then we
will reduce this interval by one
so
for loop
and interval
equals to n by two
interval greater than zero
interval
divide equals to two
now we will do a gap insertion sort
for this interval
so for
and i is equals to interval
i is less than n
i plus equals to 1
and amp is equals to
arr packet i
now we will shift earlier gap sorted
element
up until the correct location for a r i
is for so hint
a so for
j is equals to i
and j greater than equals to interval
and then arr
bracket j minus interval
greater than temp
and j minus equals to interval
now arr
at j is equals to
a r
j minus
interval
now we will put this stamp in its
correct location so
arr
bracket j is equals to
temp
now i will return 0.
now let's write a function to print this
array
so void
print array
and error
comma and n
so for loop and
j is equals to zero
a less than n
j plus plus
c out
arr bracket j
now we will write the function for the
main block
so end arr
is equals to
12 comma 34 comma
56 comma 85
comma comma
9 comma 11
comma 5.
now let's find the size for this array
so int
n is equals to size of
array divided by
size of
first element of this array
now see out
array
array before
sort
now print array
arr comma and
cell sort
error
comma n now
c out
erase after
sorting
we will again print array
here comma m
now let's try and execute this
as you can see we have successfully
sorted this
array let's get back to our slides
at last let's sum up what we have
learned from this session
first up shelf sort has higher cache
miss ratio
than quicksort next
shell sort is helpful when small
elements are to the farther right
next shell sort utilizes insertion sort
algorithm
finally shell sword requires fewer swaps
than insertion sort
and this was all for today's session
