in a world where we are more connected
than ever a threat Looms in the shadows
of Technology from malicious hackers and
state sponsored cyber warfare to
Insidious malware and data breaches in
individuals businesses and governments
around the world well guess what I'm
talking about you guess that right cyber
threats of course and on that note hello
to everyone and welcome to Simply learn
in today's session we'll be discussing
what are cyber attacks and various types
of cyber attacks prevented these days
but before we begin if you're into the
channel and haven't subscribed already

stay updated with all the latest
Technologies and hit that Bell icon to
never miss an update from us so let's
get started with today's topic firstly
let us have a quick introduction to what
cyber attacks are now the rise of the
digital age has brought unprecedented
connectivity and convenience but it has
also introduced new avenues from
malicious actors to exploit
vulnerabilities cyber attacks
encompasses a broad range of malicious
activities where adversaries lever
technology to infiltrate disrupt or
compromise digital systems and data so
in a nutshell you can say it is a
deliberate and malicious attempt to
compromised computer systems networks or
devices with the intention of causing
harm stealing sensitive information or
gaining any kind of unauthorized access
now having said that with cyber attacks
becoming more prevalent and severe it's
become crucial to address the cyber
security skill Gap and overcome the

box for more details so make sure you
check that out let's let us continue
with our topic today now so what is the
motive behind cyber security attacks now
that we know what cyber security attacks
are let's discuss the motives behind it
the digital age has revolutionized how
we interact work and live it has also
brought new challenges and chances for
victims now the motives behind cyber
attacks can be widely varied and they
often D are driven by different factors
depending on the attackers goals and
intentions so let us look at some of the
motives behind cyber attacks one of the
most prevalent motivations for cyber
attacks is financial gain attackers seek
to steal sensitive financial information
such as credit card details login
credentials or any kind of personal data
which they can sell on the black market
or use to commit fraud and identity
theft attackers encrypt a victims data
and demand payment for decryption Keys
the second reason is industrial
Espionage in the corporate world cyber
attacks are sometimes carried out to
gain a competitive Advantage by stealing
proprietary information Trade Secrets
and intellectual property competing
companies and nation states May Target
organizations to obtain valuable
information and insights or for
political or ideological use now
hactivism involves using cyber attacks
as a means of expressing political or
ideological views activists Target
government agencies corporations or
other organizations to protect or raise
awareness about a specific issue they
may def face websites leak sensitive
information or disturb services to make
their points personal event data or any
Revenge some cyber attacks are also
carried out by individuals seeking
revenge or retaliation against a person
or group of organizations they hold a
grudge against and finally cyber
terrorism now in rare cases cyber
attacks can be carried out as an act of
terrorism to create fear chaos and
widespread disruption these attacks
aimed to cause significant harm to
society and can Target critical
infrastructure such as power grids
Transport Systems and much more
understanding the motives behind cyber
attacks can help in developing effective
cyber sec secur strategies to mitigate
and respond to these threats now how do
cyber attacks happen exactly cyber
attacks are orchestrated processes that
aim to compromise the security and
integrity of computer systems and
Digital Data attackers gain information
about their targets such as identifying
potential vulnerabilities security
weaknesses and valuable data they can
exploit this phase involves passive
techniques like searching publicly
available information and active
techniques like scanning for open ports
on the targets Network so regular
security assessment and timely software
updates user awareness training and
implementing robust security measures
are essential in mitigating the risk of
these cyber attacks from happening cyber
criminals are constantly devising their
sophisticated techniques to exploit
vulnerabilities in systems and networks
resulting in devastating consequences
for victims understanding these threats
and implementing proactive safety
measures is crucial for safeguarding our
digital assets and personal information
here the common types of cyber threats
that we see today in no particular order
first on the list we have malware
malware ENC compasses various types of
malicious software designed to
infiltrate systems data steal and
disrupt operations and gain authorized
access it includes various types of
worms viruses Trojans ransomware and
spyware malware disguises itself as
legitimate files or software used to
deceive users and avoid detection it can
propagate through infected email
attachments malicious websites or
compromised software now one of the real
world examples of this is in 2017 the
wanai ransomware attack on thousands of
computers worldwide encrypting data and
demanding Ransom payments in Bitcoin so
what are the consequences of malware
attacks firstly data breaches and theft
of sensitive information next we have
system disruptions leading to downtime
and financial losses and thirdly
Espionage and unauthorized access to
personal or corporate networks so how
can you Safeguard or protect yourself
from malare firstly you need to
regularly update your operating systems
and software to catch vulnerabilities
and also install reputable antivirus
anti-malware software and keep them up
to date thirdly exercise caution when
downloading files from untrusted sources
or clicking on any unknown links from
the websites or Internet finally educate
users about safe browsing practices and
recognizing potential malware threats
now second on the list we have fishing
attacks fishing attacks are social
engineering techniques used by cyber
criminals to trick individuals into
revealing sensitive information such as
login credentials Financial details or
any personal data fishing emails often
appear to be from reputable sources
including Brands social media platforms
or government agencies they create a
sense of urgency or fear to prompt
immediate actions so make sure you do
not click any sort of unreputable
sources of emails that you get from any
kind of unrestricted resources now what
are the consequences of fishing attacks
firstly identity theft and un authorized
access to personal accounts secondly
Financial losses due to fraudulent
transactions by clicking unloan links
from various thirdparty websites and
finally compromise of sensitive business
data and intellectual property now in
2017 off fishing attack targeted Gmail
users directing them to a fake login
page to steal their credentials so make
sure you stay away from all these
malicious activities so what are the
safety measures you can take against
fishing attacks firstly enable
multiactor authentic a from all accounts
to add an extra layer of security Now
the next trick is to avoid clicking on
any suspicious links as discussed
earlier so you have to train employees
and individuals to recognize fishing
emails and avoid clicking on any sort of
suspicious links also Implement email
filtering systems to detect and block
fishing attempts and finally regularly
update your web browsers to protect
against known fishing vulnerabilities by
installing some sort of anti virus
system next on the list we have
ransomware ransomware is a type of
malware that encrypts our victim's data
by making it inaccessible until a ransom
is paid to the attackers this is a
threat to individuals businesses and
government organizations worldwide
ransomware often uses strong encryption
algorithms to lock victim's data
securely it may be delivered through
malicious email attachments compromised
websites or other nefarious means now in
2021 the colonial pipeline in the United
States fell victim toward a ransom aware
attack leading to the shutdown of
operation and Ransom payment to the
attackers so what are the consequences
of ransomware again now Financial losses
due to Ransom payments could be a huge
Factor where you have to pay sometimes
large amounts of money to the hackers
then there's data loss and potential
leakage of sensitive
information and finally reputation
damage to the organizations that
experience the successful attacks of
ransomware so what are the safety
measures you can take against ransomware
well you could regularly back up
critical data to an offline or secure
location to avoid data loss also
maintain up-to-date software and
security patches to protect against
known vulnerabilities next Implement
Network segmentation to contain the
spread of ransomware within the system
and finally train your employees and
individuals to exercise caution when
handling email attachments and links by
conducting regular security audits you
can protect yourself from various kinds
of ransomware attacks now fourth on the
list we have DDOS or distributed denial
of service attacks DDOS attacks Target
online services or networks by flooding
them with a massive amount of traffic
rendering them inaccessible to
legitimate users these hacks are
typically orchestrated using botnets
DDOS attackers use multiple devices to
create a massive volume of traffic
causing service disruptions attackers
often exploit vulnerable iot devices to
build botn Nets so what are the
consequences of DDOS attack firstly
let's say downtime in service
disruptions leading to financial losses
secondly damage to a company's
reputation and customer trust in 2018
GitHub experienced one of the largest
DDOS attacks in history with traffic
peaking at 1.35 tbps in 2016 a massive
DDOS attack on DNS provider Den
disrupted several major websites and
services and finally server and website
vulnerability now diversion of attention
from the actual attack to dealing with
the aftermath of this can also be a
crucial consequence where if your server
or website vulnerability has already
been caused so what are the safety
measures against
dds's firstly deploy traffic filtering
and rate limiting to detect and block
malicious traffic during an attack next
utilize content delivery networks or
cdns to distribute traffic across
multiple servers and reduce the impact
of DDOS attacks also regularly monitor
traffic and set up alerts for unusual
patterns indicating an ongoing attack
invest in scalable infrastructure to
handle sudden traffic surges and prevent
service disruptions so these are some of
the safety measures that you can take
against DDOS attacks and help yourself
to protect against them and finally on
the list we have SQL injection SQL
injection is a web application
vulnerability that allows ATT actors to
manipulate the website's data by
injecting malicious SQL code into the
input field this can lead to
unauthorized Access Data Theft or data
manipulation if the SQL in injection is
successful the database might execute
the attacker's injected SQL code
alongside the legitimate query granting
unauthorized access to data modifying or
altering data or even compromising the
entire database SQL injection exploits
poorly sanitized user inputs in web
applications which can extract modify or
delete data from affected databases so
what are the consequences of SQL
injection well unauthorized access to
sensitive data including user
credentials and personal information
secondly data manipulation or deletion
leading to data Integrity issues finally
disclosure of confidential information
and compliance violation now a real life
example of SQL injection is the 2008 SQL
injection that was used to breach
Heartland Payment Systems resulting in a
theft of millions of credit card records
so what are the safety measures that you
can take against SQL injection firstly
adopt secure coding practices such as
parameterized queries and input
validation to prevent SQL injection
vulnerabilities from happening secondly
conduct regular security assessments and
penetration testing to identify and
address potential SQL injection flaws
next implement the principle of least
privilege to limit database access
rights for application users so that the
hackers cannot easily dive into your
databases and finally stay updated on
the latest security patches and updates
for Frameworks and applications so these
were some of the common types of cyber
security threats that are prevalent
through the world at this time so let's
see what we have at number 10 from April
27 2007 Estonia the European country
faced a series of cyber attacks that
lasted for weeks this happened when the
Estonian government decided to move the
bronze soldier from Talon Center to a
less prominent military cemetery located
on the city's outskirts unprecedented
levels of internet traffic took down the
Estonian Banks online services media
Outlets broadcasters and government
bodies botnet sent massive waves of spam
and vast amounts of automated Online
requests according to researchers the
public faced dos attacks there were
conflicts to edit the English language
version of The Bronze soldiers Wikipedia
page as well although there is no
confirmation Russia is believed to be
behind these cyber attacks that largely
crippled the Estonian Society now let's
move on to the next tack December 23rd
2015 several parts of Ukraine witnessed
a power outage this was not a typical
blackout it was indeed the result of a
Cyber attack Information Systems of
three energy distribution companies in
Ukraine were compromised it is the first
known Victorious Cyber attack on a power
grid it is said that here hackers sent
out fishing emails to the power
companies 30 substations were Switched
Off and about 230,000 people were left
in the dark for about 1 to 6 hours us
investigators believed that Russia based
hackers were responsible for this
experts have warned that other countries
could also be vulnerable to such attacks
let's see what we have at number eight
in the year 1999 a Cyber attack caused a
21-day shutdown of NASA computers
unbelievable isn't it the hacker was
none other than then 15-year-old
Jonathan James he first penetrated US
Department of Defense divisions
computers and installed a back door on
its servers this allowed him to
intercept more than a thousand
government emails including the ones
containing usernames and passwords this
helped James steal a piece of NASA
software and crack the NASA computers
that support the International Space
Station which cost the space exploration
agency's
$41,000 as systems were shut down for 3
weeks he was the first person to carry
out a computer hack against the American
space agency now let's move on to the
next attack in late November 2014 there
was a leak of confidential data from the
film studio of Sony Pictures information
about Sony Pictures employees their
emails copies of the then unreleased
Sony films future propositions and other
crucia data were leaked this Cyber
attack was carried out by a hacker group
named Guardians Of Peace what did the
hackers want well they demanded that
Sony withdraw its then upcoming movie
the interview this movie was a comedy
storyline to assassinate the North
Korean leader Chim Jong-un Sony then
decided to cancel the film's theatrical
release due to their threats at his
Cinema screening the movie it is indeed
hard to trace the roots of a Cyber
attack in this case after evaluation the
US intelligence officials arrived at the
theory that the attack was in a way
related to the government of North Korea
however North Korea had denied the same
moving on to number six in December 2006
TJ Max the US retail company identified
that 45.6 million debit and credit card
details were stolen this happened from
one of its systems over 18 months by an
unknown number of intruders it was one
of the largest ever cyber attacks
involving the loss of personal data as
as a result banks in the affected
regions had to reissue and block
thousands of payment cards a group of
hackers did this Albert Gonzalez being
The Mastermind the group was from Miami
the place where the TJ Maxx Heist was
believed to have originated reports said
that the TJ Maxx data breach occurred
because of weak web encryption at two of
its Marshall stores in Miami next moving
on to our top five let us see what we
have at number five the year 2010
witnessed the discovery of the deadly
computer worm stuck net this malware's
motive was unlike any other usual cyber
attacks it aimed at destructing the
equipment the computers controlled
stucknut came with the deadly purpose of
damaging Iran's nuclear infrastructure
it infected more than 200,000 computers
including 14 Industrial sites and a
uranium enrichment plant in Iran stuck
net initially spread via Microsoft
Windows and targeted Seaman's industrial
Control Systems although it was
discovered only in 2010 It is believed
to have been silently sabotaging Iran's
nuclear facilities it was one of the
first discovered malware that was
capable of hampering hardware systems it
largely damaged the centrifuges of the
Iranian reactors this is believed to be
a cyber weapon created by the US and
Israeli intelligence although there is
no documented evidence or acceptance by
either of the countries now moving on to
number four in the year 2014 Home Depot
was the victim of one of the the
deadliest cyber attacks 56 million
payment cards were compromised along
with 53 million customer email addresses
stolen this security breach happened
from April to September 2014 criminals
were believed to have used a third-party
vendor's username and password to enter
the perimeter of Home Depot's Network
the attackers were then able to deploy
custombuilt malware on its self checkout
systems in the US and Canada moving on
to number three as you might be aware
the PlayStation gaming system is one of
Sony's most popular products
unfortunately in April 2011 Sony
Executives witnessed abnormal activity
on the PlayStation Network this resulted
in the compromise of approximately 77
million PlayStation users accounts and
prevented users of PlayStation 3 and
PlayStation Portable consoles from
accessing this service this forced Sony
to turn off the PlayStation Network on
April 20th on May 4th Sony confirmed
that personally identifiable information
from each of the 77 million accounts had
been exposed the outage lasted for 23
days Sony released almost daily
announcements concerning the system
outage in the end Sony is believed to
have invested approximately $170 million
to improve the network security to
investigate the attack and to cover the
expenses of caring for the consumers
that had been affected now let's move on
to the next attack in at number two in
May 2017 one of the most danger ous
cyber attacks took place it was known as
The wac Cry ransomware attack caused by
the wan to cry crypto worm the victims
were the users that used the unsupported
version of Microsoft Windows and those
who hadn't installed the new security
update this did not take place through
fishing like other attacks but through
an exposed vulnerable SMB Port the
attack originated in Asia and then
eventually spread across the globe in a
day more than 200,000 computers were
infected across 150 count countries the
W cry crypto worm locked the users out
of the targeted systems and encrypted
their data the users were asked for a
ransom of $300 to $600 which had to be
paid via Bitcoin in exchange for their
data this attack took a toll on both
private and government organizations it
resulted in Damages from hundreds of
millions to billions of dollars in a
matter of a few days the emergency
patches released by Microsoft halted the
attack also the discovery of a kill
switch prevented the infected computers
from spreading the crypto worm Security
Experts in a few countries believed that
North Korea was behind this attack now
finally let's see what we have at number
one more than two decades ago in March
1999 the malissa virus a mass mailing
microvirus was released it targeted
Microsoft Word and Outlook based systems
and created considerable Network traffic
Melissa virus infected computers via
emails the email would look like an
important message but it was fake if the
recipient opens the attachments in the
email and downloads the document then
opens it with Microsoft Word a virus was
released onto their computers this would
then massmail itself to the first 50
people in the victim's contact list and
then disable multiple Safeguard features
on Microsoft Word and Microsoft Outlook
this began spreading like a wildfire
across the internet David L Smith
released the virus the virus caused
nearly $80 million worth of Damages it
did not steal data or money however it
caused Havoc almost 1 million email
accounts were disrupted worldwide
agencies were overloaded and some had to
be shut down entirely and internet
traffic in some locations was slowed
down so with that we've come to the end
