welcome to Simply learn today we'll be
learning how to generate patent programs
in say before we get started I hope this
screen is clearly visible and audio is
fine if s please type in yes if there
are any issues do let us know in the
chat section so that we can resolved
I see a lot positive responses great
let's wait for some time for others to
join us
great I think we can get started
this session is on pattern programs in C
so we'll be covering star pattern number
pattern alphabet pattern programs and
some special patterns
we'll discussed almost all frequently
Asked interview pattern questions and
while we are at it please leave us a
like if you find our content helpful and
a sub to the channel would be
appreciated
first let's get started with a right
angle triangle star pattern program
patent programs are performed in the
form of a matrix where we have rows and
columns and to print the right angle
triangle pattern the star arrangements
are made in the form of a matrix
where first row has one star second row
has two stars and third row has three
strands and so on
we have inserted Stars at the cell index
U of zero zero e of 1 0 1 1 then year of
2 1 2 2 2 3 followed by a of 3 1 to a of
three four
and then a of 4 1 up to year four five
and in the rest of the cells we have a
free spaces moving ahead let's
understand the program logic
we have outer loop for rows and inner
Loops for columns so first the control
will check the condition initially the I
value is 1 so 1 lesser or equal to rows
so rows if the rows value is 5 then 1
lesser equal to 5 which is true so it
comes the control comes to the inner for
Loop and again checks the condition
initially the J value is 1 so 1 less or
equal to 1 the condition is satisfied so
it prints this statement under the inner
for Loop that is a princess task
so again the control goes back to the
inner follow and increment the J value
by 1. now J value is 2. so 2 less or
equal to 1 which is false so it comes
out of the inner for Loop and prints a
statement under the outer for Loop and
the control transfers to the new line it
again goes back to the outer for Loop
and increment the I value by 1. so this
Loop will continue until all stars are
printed so now let's run the program and
see the output
as you all can see my screen this is the
code for the right angle triangle
pattern program so here we have the
counter variable i j and rows is in
slice to 5. so as I discussed before the
first star will be printed in the first
row First Column and when this I value
is incremented by 1 then it prints the
second row First Column and then second
row second column and so on until it
prints all the stars so now let's run
the program and see the output
and here we go the stars are printed in
a form of a right angle triangle
next we have inverted right angle
triangle pattern program
so this is the image
where we have five stars in the first
row 4 stars in the second row
and three stars in the third row and so
on and the rest of the cells we have the
three spaces so let's look at the logic
and try to understand
we have outer follow for rows and in a
follow for columns so initial a i is
equal to 5 so 5 greater equal to 1 which
is true so the control comes to the
inner follow and initially J value is 1
so 1 lesser or equal to 5 which is true
so print the first star
and against the control go back and
increment J value by one so now J value
is equal to 2 2 lesser or equal to 5
again true so executes the statement
under the inner for Loop change the
second star
so this will repeat until the condition
is not satisfied so once the control
comes out and the control transfers to
the new line so again it goes to the
outer for Loop and decrement I value by
1. so now I value is 4.
so for greater or equal to 1 which is 2
so comes back to the inner follow and
this will rip it until it form a pattern
of inverted right angle triangle
so now let's execute a program and look
at the output
so in this program we have counter
variables Ing and the rows are in slides
to 5.
so in our previous program we had
operator lesser or equal to and
pre-increment but in this program we
have greater equal to and pre-decrement
operator
so as I said
first in it will print five stars in the
first row and then four stars and then
three stars and so on so now let's
execute and see the output
as you all can see
the inverted right angle triangle is
printed successfully
next pattern is Arrow shaped pattern
as you can see we are trying to combine
our previous two patterns into one that
is right angle triangle and inverted
right angle triangle
let's have a look at the code
so here
the half of the code is for the first
half of the pattern and the second half
is for the second half of the pattern
the only difference in the code is that
we have rho minus 1.
so let's first run the program to get a
better understanding
so here let's run the program
as you all can see the pattern to get 5
stars in one row
we have row minus one so the only
difference
between the previous code and this is
that we have Roo minus 1.
the code that I'm executing in this
session will be attached in the
description box below so you can have a
look at it and execute the pattern
programs for a better understanding and
if you face any issues while executing
the programs then please let us know in
the comment section below and our team
of experts will be happier to resolve
all your queries at the earliest
all right
our next patent program is mirrored
right angle triangle
let's understand this pattern in a form
of a matrix
in our first pattern program where we
had first star followed by four spaces
in this we have four spaces first and
then one star then three spaces and two
stars followed by two spaces and three
stars and so on
so let's have a look at the logic
so as you can see here in order to print
these pieces first we have a for Loop
where we have J is equal to 2 into rho
minus 1 J greater equal to 0 and then J
minus minus which is the post decrement
operator
so initially the I value is 0 and 0
lesser to 5 then comes and prints the
spaces first and then J is equal to 0 by
0 less or equal to 0 which is true and
princes Star first
and then when the condition is not
satisfied it comes out and the control
transfers to the new line goes back and
increment the I value by 1. so now I
value is 1 so 1 lesser to 5 which is
true and comes between these spaces so
this will repeat until it prints all
these tasks so now let's execute the
program
so in this program we have counter
available inj and row value is equal to
5. and this two for Loops we have for
rows and then next for Loop is for
columns
so now let's try to execute it
and here we got the output
the mirrored right angle triangle is
printed successfully
next inverted mirrored right angle
triangle pattern
it is similar to the previous pattern
but the pattern is inverted so here as
you can see
first we have five stars and the second
row we have first space And Then
followed by four stars then two spaces
followed by three stars and so on
so here let's see the logic
so as you can see here it first print
these blank spaces similar to our
previous program here also we have for
Loop to print the blank spaces and here
again we have a k counter variable to
print the Stars so let's execute the
program and see the output
as you all can see this is the program
for our inverted mirrored right angle
triangle so here we have three variables
the counter variables i j and k and the
row value is equal to 5. so initially
the I value is equal to 5 so it checks
the condition where the 5 greater or
equal to 1 which is true so comes to
this for Loop and checks J is equal to 5
so 5 greater to 5 which is false so it
will not print any blank spaces so the
control comes to this for Loop where K
is equal to 1 and checks the condition
one lesser or equal to 5 it's true so
Prince the first start and again it goes
back and increment the K value by one so
now the K value is 2. then check the
condition 2 lesser or equal to 5 which
is true princes star and this will
continue up to it prints the 5 stars in
first row and then the control comes out
and jumps to the new line that means the
control transfers to the new line then
again it goes back and decrement the I
value by one so now the I value is 4. 4
greater or equal to 1 again the
condition is satisfied comes princely
spaces and this will continue until it
prints all the stars so now let's run
the program
and here we got the output
our next pattern is mirrored Arrow
shaped star pattern
so in this pattern program we are
combining our previous two pattern
programs that is mirrored right angle
triangle pattern program an inverted
mirrored right angle triangle program so
now let's have a look at the code
so here the first half of the code is
for the first half of the pattern and
the second half of the code is for the
second half of the pattern
so to understand it in a better way
let's execute the program
so in this program we have counter
variables i j and k and the rows is 5.
so as I said
the first half of the program is for the
first half of the pattern so here we
have the for Loops for the rows and
this for Loop is for the columns and for
the second pattern we have this for Loop
for the rows and then this for Loop for
the columns so let's run the program
so here we got the output
next we have pyramid star pattern
program
as you all can see
we have first two spaces followed by one
star and then two spaces and in the next
row we have space first and then star
space star space and the third row we
have star and Then followed by space
star space and star so to understand
this pattern how it works let's look at
the code
as you can see the code here
we have I is equal to 0 so initially the
I value is 0 and 0 less than 5 which is
true so comes to the next follow where J
is equal to rho minus 1 so 5 minus 0 is
5. so 5 greater than 1 which is true so
it prints the first space
and this will continue until the
condition is satisfied once the
condition is not satisfied it comes out
of the for Loop so it checks the initial
J value is 0 so 0 letter is equal to
5 which is true so it prints the first
star
so when
it prints two two spaces and then one
star and goes back and print two spaces
again
so when the condition is not satisfied
it comes out and the control transfers
for the new line
once a control transferred to the new
line
it goes back to the first for Loop and
increment I value by 1. so now I value
is equal to 1.
so then it prints this second row Stars
so this way it repeats until all stars
are printed in the form of a pyramid so
let's run the program and see the output
so as you can see the row value is 5 and
we have the counter variable ing for
rows for printing the blank space and
then
a loop for a printing star
so now as I discussed before it print
two spaces first and then star and
followed by two spaces in the first row
so let's try to execute this program
and here we go
we got a star pattern
in the form of a pyramid
next we have inverted pyramid star
pattern program
so in this pattern
as we can see the first row we have
first star then space
then then second start and followed with
space and third star and the second row
we have space star space star and the
space and the third row we have two
spaces and Then star and two spaces it's
just similar to the previous pattern but
it is just inverted so let's have a look
at the code
so here we have for Loop for rows and
then four Loops for columns so this for
Loops is to print the blank spaces and
the next for Loop is to print the Stars
so here initially the I value is 0
and 0 lesser or equal to 5 minus 1 that
is 4 so the condition is satisfied
counts down to the next follow where J
initial value is 0 so 0 lets or equal to
4 which is true and Princess blank
spaces
and then once the condition is not
satisfied it comes out where K value is
0
so the 0 is less or equal to rows minus
1 minus I if this condition is satisfied
the star is printed
so once the condition is not satisfied
the control transfers to the new line so
now let's try to run the program
so here in this code we have three
counter variables that is I J and K and
rho is initialized to 5.
so here we have two for Loops where it
is used to print the blank spaces and
then we have the under for Loop which
prints the star
so now let's try to execute it
and here we got the pattern
there's the inverted pyramid star
pattern
our next pattern program is upper
inverted pyramid and lower pyramid
so we have already performed the
inverted upper pyramid and also the
regular lower parameter so now let's
have a look at the code
so this for Loop the first this
statements are for the upper invented
parameter which we have already executed
and then next we have the other code for
the lower parameter
so the only difference is that here we
use rows minus 1.
so let's see why do we use that
so we are trying to combine the patterns
that we have already executed that is
the upper invented pyramid and lower
parameter so for that
we have the for loops for the upper
invented pyramids that we have already
discussed and here the only difference
is that we have used rows minus 1 and
next we have the lower parameter again
here also we have used rows minus one so
let's see try to execute and see the
output
so as you can see here we have the one
star so in order to print
in this pattern we have used rows minus
1. if we just give rows then we'll get a
one more extra star in between this
so I hope you got it
up next we have right diagonal star
pattern
so let's understand in a logic so here
first we have four spaces then one stump
followed by three species one star and
then space and the third row we have two
spaces one star and two spaces and so on
so in order to print in a right diagonal
star pattern let's understand the logic
behind it
so for that let's look at the code
so initially we have I value is equal to
1.
so 1 it checks the condition where the 1
is less or equal to 5 which is true so
comes to the inner for Loop where J
value is 0 so 0 lesser than 5 minus I
which is 1 so 5 minus 1 is 4 so 0 lesser
than 4 which is true and then it prints
the blank space
so this will continue until the given
condition is satisfied once the
condition is false it comes out the
control will come out and print the star
and then it turns to the new line again
it goes back and increment the I value
and this will repeat until it prints the
right diagonal star pattern so now let's
run the code and have a look at the
so as you all can see we have two
counter variables ing
where we have the row value to be 5.
so as I discussed before
this for Loop is used to print the blank
spaces once the condition is false it
will come out the control will
come out and print the star and goes
back to the new line so now let's try to
execute
and here we go we got the right diagonal
star pattern program
next we have X star pattern program
so let's try to understand the logic
so here we have the first star and Then
followed by three spaces and then stop
and the second row we have space star
space star and space and the third row
we have one star in between the two
spaces the and similarly we have third
row and fourth row so now let's have a
look at the code
so here in this code we have I is equal
to rows then I must be greater equal to
1 that is 5 is greater equal to 1 which
is true so comes to the inner follow
where J value is I
then J must be lesser to rows so if this
condition satisfy it prints the spaces
once the condition is not satisfied it
comes to the next for Loop where J value
is equal to 1 and then it checks the
condition where 1 is lesser or equal to
2 into I minus 1.
if the condition is satisfied it comes
to the if condition where J is equal
equal to 1 or J is equal equal to 2 into
I minus 1. if the condition is satisfied
it prints is star yes it will print the
space
if the condition is not satisfied the
control comes and it transfers to the
new line
and our next half of the program
prints the lower invented V pattern so
here we have for Loop where I is equal
to 2 and I must be less or equal to rows
simply condition is satisfied it comes
to the for Loop where J is equal to i j
less it in rows so if the condition is
satisfy it prints these spaces
else it will come to the next for Loop
where J is equal to 1 and 1 must be less
or equal to 2 into I minus 1. and then
if this condition satisfied it comes and
checks the if condition where J is equal
to equal to 1 or J is equal equal to 2
into I minus 1. so this code is used to
print the lower invented V pattern so
now let's run the program
as I discussed before we have a counter
variables Ing and row value is
initialized to 5. so here the first half
of the program is used to print a V
shape and the next half of the program
is used to print the lower invented B
pattern so now let's try to run it
and here we go
so this is our first V and this is our
second invented way which is in the form
of X star pattern
the next pattern that we have is
invented V pattern
so let's have a look at the logic
so as you can see this is very much
similar to our pyramid pattern but the
only difference is that we don't have a
star here
so now let's have a look at the logic
so the logic of a program is that
the out variable is equal to one so one
must be lesser or equal to rows
so if the condition is satisfied it
comes to the inner for Loop where in is
equal to 1 and in must be less or equal
to rows into 2. so if this condition
satisfied the control comes to the if
else statement where it tries to execute
or check the condition where n must be
equal to X or it should be equal to Y if
the condition satisfy it prints a start
else it will print the space so now
let's try to execute the program
so here we have the variable out and in
where the row value 5 is initialized to
X and Y so now let's try to execute
and here we go we got the invented V
pattern
so moving ahead let's have a look at the
next pattern
and our next pattern is v-shaped star
pattern
so to understand let's have a look at
the logic
so this is very much similar to our
previous pattern but it is just inverted
so for that let's have a look at the
code
so in the given code
the difference is that
we have I is equal to n minus 1
so the I value must be greater or equal
to zero if the condition satisfied it
comes to follow where J is equal to n
minus 1 so if J is greater than I then
it prints this space
if the condition is not satisfied then
it comes out and prints the star
then it comes to the next for Loop where
J is equal to 1 J lesser than I into 2
so if J is lesser than I into 2 it
prints the space
then it comes to the if condition where
I is greater or equal to 1 if I is
greater than equal to 1 it prints is
star and then the control transfer to
the new line so now let's try to run the
program
so as I said
the N value is equal to 5. so it is just
similar to our previous program
and pattern where it is just in an
inverted form so now let's try to
execute it
so here we go the output the V Star
pattern is formed
up next we have a pyramid shaped star
pattern
so we have already executed a pattern
based on a pyramid but the only
difference in this type of pyramid is
that we have a hollow parameter so let's
have a look at the logic
so previously we had stars in between
but in this type of a pyramid we are not
going to have a stars in between of a
pyramid so for that let's have a look at
the logic
foreign
we have a counter variable i j and k so
first it checks the initial value of I
is equal to 1 where 1 should be lesser
or equal to rows so if rows value is 5
then 1 is less than equal to 5 then if
the condition is satisfied it comes to
the inner for Loop where the J initial
value is 1 so 1 must be lesser to rows
so if this condition is satisfied it
will print this space
if it does not satisfy it comes to the
next follow where K value is 1 so 1 must
be lesser or equal to 2 into I minus 1.
then if this condition satisfied it
comes to the if else statements
where the K must be equal to 1 or I is
equal to rows or k is equal to 2 into I
minus 1 so if this is true then it
prints this star pattern else it will
print this piece so wherever it is
required to print the star it prints the
start else it will print the space and
if this condition does not satisfy it
comes out and the control transfers to
the new line
and then again it will increment the I
value by 1 and this group will repeat
so here let's try to execute the program
and see the output
so as I said this if else statement
prints the star wherever it is required
in space wherever it is required so now
let's try to execute it
so as I said it can be a triangle but
it's a polo
okay next we have a inverted star
pyramid it is very much similar to our
previous pyramid but the only difference
is that it is inverted
so let's have a look at the logic it is
similar to the previous logic but it
just inverted so in the first row we
have
three stars where first star then space
again star space star and in the second
row we have two stars and in the third
row we have one star in between two
spaces so now let's have a look at the
code
so here the first for Loop is used to
print these faces
so the next for Loop is used to print
these Stars so when the condition is
true it prints this term else it will
print the space and once the condition
is false it the control comes out and
enter to the new line so then again it
decrements the I value so here we have
the I minus minus which is the post
decrement operator so now let's try to
run the program
so as I discussed before we have i j and
k counter variables and row value is
equal to 5. so this for Loop is used to
print these faces and if this if
condition satisfied it prints the star
wherever it is required and space
wherever it is required
so now let's try to run the program
and here we got the output it's a
inverted
star parameter
next we are going to have a look at the
Box pattern
so in this pattern
the number of rows and columns must be
equal so the only change is that
the first row we have five stars and the
next row will have two stars and three
spaces in between and similarly the
third and fourth row and fifth row will
have five stars so now let's have a look
at the code
so here the initially I value is equal
to one so if the condition
satisfy it comes to the inner follow
where J initial value is 1 so J must be
lesser to M so n is for the rows and M
is for the columns so here we have if
statement where I must be equal equal to
1 or I must be equal equal to n or
J should be equal to 1 or J should be
equal to m
so if this condition satisfied it prints
the star else it will print this space
and once the condition is not satisfied
the control comes out and transfers to
the new line and again goes back to the
order follow and
increment the I value by 1. so now let's
have a look at the code
so here in this program as you all can
see the N value is 10 and M value is
also 10 so that means
the number of rows and the number of
columns are equal
so here as per this effect statement
it prints Stars wherever it is required
and print space where it is necessary so
now let's try to run the program
so as you can see
the Box pattern is formed
following we have a square start pattern
it is very much similar to our previous
pattern but that was a hollow box
pattern but here the only difference is
that we have stars in between
so
now let's have a look at the code
so here we have a counter variable I and
J where initially I value is equal to 0
so 0 lesser than rows that is if rows is
equal to 5 then 0 lesser to 5 which is
true then comes to the inner for Loop
where J value is equal to 0 so 0 less
than 5 which is again true it prints the
star then again it goes back to the
inner for Loop and increments the J
value by 1. so now the J value is 1 so 1
less than 5 against 2 then prints this
second star and this will continuously
repeat until the condition is not
satisfied then once the condition is not
satisfied it comes out of the for Loop
and prints this statement under the
outer follow
and then the control transfers to the
new line once comes out it just
increments the I value by 1. so now the
I value is 1. so again it checks the
condition I lesser than prose so this
will continue until it prints the
pattern in a box shape so now let's
execute the program
so as you all can see the screen the row
value is 5.
so now we have the variables ing
so similarly as I discussed before it
prints until it make a pattern of a box
so now let's try to execute
yeah
we got the pattern a box shape pattern
now let's get into the number patterns
so first we have right angle triangle
number pattern program
so here let's understand in the form of
a matrix so here we have rows and
columns where the First Column is filled
with the number one second column is
filled with the number two and similarly
3 4 and 5. so here the first cell has
the number one and followed by the four
spaces similarly second row have two
numbers followed by three spaces we have
already discussed the
logic how the right angle triangle is
print so now let's have a look at the
code
so here let's look at the code
so this is very much similar to our
first program but the only difference is
here we are taking a j value instead of
star so it prints the numbers so let's
run the program
so here as you can see the
code the row is initialized to 5 so we
have five rows and here it prints the
value of T that means the numbers
instead of star we are using the numbers
so now let's try to run the code
and here we got the output this is the
right angle triangle pattern in using
numbers
so next we have another right angle
triangle number pattern program so here
we have a numbers as in one two three
four five six but in our previous
pattern the whole First Column was the
number one and second column was number
two so here to understand in the form of
a matrix the the first row and First
Column we have the number one and the
second row
First Column we have two and followed by
three and similarly four five six and so
on so now let's try to understand the
logic
it is very much similar to our previous
program and this
right angle triangle is also called as a
fluid strangle where we have one extra K
variable that is the counter variable
which is used to print the value
that means here
it prints the K value and increments on
every iteration so instead of using
J we are using K plus plus so now let's
try to run the program
so here as you can see it's very much
similar to our previous program but the
only difference is that we have a k is
equal to 1 so
here we are taking the K value in order
to print the Floyd's triangle
so let's run the program
and here we got the output so here we
got the right angle triangle number
pattern program
next we have the pyramid number pattern
program so which is also called as a
pascal stranger
so
when we learn in it in a form of a
matrix then it is very much similar to
The Pyramid pattern but the only
difference here is we are using numbers
instead of stars
so now let's have a look at the code
so here
as you can see we have a four loops and
we have the counter variables i j and k
so here we are using a temporary
variable so if this if statement starts
satisfied that is K is equal to 0 or I
is equal to 0. and temp value is equal
to 1 else 10 is equal to the formula is
stem into I minus K plus 1 divided by K
then it will print the numbers in a form
of a pattern that is in a paramet
pattern so now let's have a
look at the output so here as I
discussed earlier the row value is equal
to 5 and we have temporary variable
which is in slice to 1 and we have the
counter variables i j and k
so here we have a for Loop which is the
auto follow
so if I is equal to 0 there is 0 lesser
two rows if the condition satisfy it
comes to the inner for Loop where the J
value is 1 and J must be lesser or equal
to rho minus 1. if this condition
satisfy it print this space
then it comes to the next for Loop where
K value is equal to 0 and K is lesser to
I that means K must be lesser to I or
lesser or equal to I
so once it comes to the if statement
where it checks K is equal equal to 0 or
I is equal to equal to 1 by temporary
equal to 1 else we have a formula where
temp is equal to Temp into I minus K
plus 1 divided by K
so then it will print a number in form
of a pattern that is in a pyramid
pattern so now let's run the program
and here we have a pattern
which is a Pascal's triangle
up next we have
a box pattern number pattern program
so in this it is very much similar to a
box or we can also say a square pattern
but instead of stars we are using
numbers so we have already executed a
program based on a box pattern so this
is very much similar to that but there
we have used Stars so in this pattern we
are using numbers so the numbers are 1
and 0.
so we have equal number of rows and
columns so now let's have a look at the
code
so here
we have a for Loop and we have a
variable num
and we have a if statement so only if
this condition satisfied that is I
modulus 2 is equal equal to 0 then num
is equal to 1 then enters the for Loop
where int J is equal to 1 J lesser or
equal to rows and J plus plus then it
prints a number
in place of star and then it checks the
condition or a formula we can say or
this is an expression where num is equal
to num condition num is equal equal to
zero
or we have print 1 else print 0. so if
num is equal to num equal to 0 then
prints 1 else it will print 0.
then we have num is equal to 1 so
we have under the for Loop where we have
int J is equal to 1 J lesser equal to
rows J plus plus so here if J is like
equal to 1 and J is less or equal to
rows it prints the number that is the
num is equal to num is equal to zero so
if this satisfy it prints one else it
print 0. else it will transfer the
control to the next line so now let's
try to execute the program
so as I discussed before
here we have
the rows value equal to 5 and we have a
counter variable I and J
so initially the I value is 1.
checks whether I is less or equal to rho
it says then we have a if statement
where it says I modulus 2 is equal to 0
and we have initialized the num value to
zero then we have a for Loop where J is
equal to 1 and J must be less or equal
to rows it prints the number and the
number that we are going to print is
either 1 and 0. so if this condition
satisfies that is num is equal to num
equal to 0 it will print 1 else it will
print 0 similarly we come in the else
part where we have num is equal to 1.
where we have a for Loop where J is
equal to 1 1 less or equal to rows and J
plus plus it prints if this condition
satisfied that is J lesser or equal to
rows then it prints a number and here
again when this number is equal to 0 is
assigned to number when this condition
satisfy it prints one value one else it
will print the value of 2 else
if this condition not satisfied the
control comes outside prints the new
line so now let's try to execute
and here we got the output where we have
a box pattern
using numbers
now let's get into the another part of
this session that is alphabet pattern so
first let's have a look at the right
angle triangle alphabet pattern so here
in the first row
and First Column we have a similar to
the stars and the number programs that
we have worked similarly we have an
alphabets so here we have a alphabet
first and then followed by four spaces
and then in the second row we have
alphabet a b and followed by three
spaces and so on so now let's have a
look at the code
so it's very much similar to the star
pattern or right angle triangle star
pattern and number pattern but here
instead of star or numbers here we are
using alphabets so we are we have this
cat J plus alphabets so this is used in
order to print the alphabets in order or
in a pattern of right angle triangle
let's run the code
so here we have the alphabet is equal to
64. so
it takes the ASCII value
so let's run this code
as you can see we got a right angle
triangle
alphabet pattern program
next pattern is inverted right angle
triangle
so we have already executed a pattern
based on the star but here we have
alphabets
so here in the first row we have five
alphabets in the second row we have four
alphabets and followed by one space and
in the third row we have three alphabets
followed by two spaces and similarly we
have fourth row with two alphabets and
three spaces and so on so now let's have
a look at the code
so it is very similar to the inverted
star pattern but here we are using
alphabets instead of numbers
so here we have alphabet plus J which is
used to
insert the alphabets so let's execute
the program
so here in order to get inverted right
angle triangle we have I is equal to
rows minus 1 and I must be greater or
equal to 0 and we have
post decrement operator so once this
condition satisfied it comes into the
inner for Loop where J value is equal to
0 and J must be less or equal to I and
if this satisfy it prints the correct
alphabet so according to this in first
row it prints five alphabets then once a
condition is not satisfied it comes out
that means the control transfer to the
new line and then decrement the I value
by 1 and this will continue till it
prints the inverted right angle triangle
pattern program so now let's execute
and here we have a inverted right angle
triangle program
using alphabets
next we have pyramid alphabet pattern
it is similar to The Pyramid that we
have executed but here we are using
alphabets instead of numbers or Stars so
let's have a look at the code
so in order to print the alphabets here
we have
the alphabet that is a variable which is
equal to 65 and this will print the
ASCII value of a
and here
we have the
counter variables that is i j and k so
initially the I value is 0 so 0 should
be less or equal to 4 which is 2 it
comes to the inner for Loop and it says
the initial value of J is equal to 4. so
4 greater to I
that is initially I value 0 so 4 is
greater to 0 which is true so it prints
the space that is the empty space so
this will continue until the condition
is satisfied once it the condition is
not satisfied it comes out
for this for Loop and checks the
condition so the K must be less or equal
to I
if it satisfy then it will print an
alphabet that is alphabet plus k
so now let's try to run the program
so as you can see we have alphabet that
means it prints alphabets in a form of a
pyramid shape so now let's run it
yeah we got the output
now let's try to have a look at this
special pattern
so in this special pattern
we are trying to use two symbols that is
star and hyphen so using star and hyphen
we are trying to have a pattern of a
half Diamond so now let's have a look at
the code
so here this is the first half of a
program where it prints the right angle
triangle
so it is very much similar but here we
are using the hyphen and then in this
next for Loop we are using star
and in the inverted right angle triangle
that is uh the second half of the
pattern here we are using star and then
the hyphen so now let's try to run the
program
so here in this special pattern program
we are using Star Plus hyphen
so this will be
a first half of the program which will
print the right angle triangle and this
will be the inverted right angle
triangle
so using this we are trying to have a
half diamond pattern so now let's try to
run it
and here we got we have used star hyphen
star hyphen and we have formed a pattern
called half diamond
so this would be our last program for
this session this is very interesting
program so let's execute it
as you can see the Christmas tree
pattern is executed
but I want you to execute this program
and understand the logic and comment on
the comment section below don't worry
about the code I had already mentioned
that the code that I am executing in
this session will be attached in the
description box below so you can have a
look at it and execute the pattern
programs for a better understanding and
if you face any issues while executing
the programs then please let us know in
the comment section below and our team
