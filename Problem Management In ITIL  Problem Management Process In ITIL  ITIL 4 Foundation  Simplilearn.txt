hello everyone welcome to this video by
simply LA today we are going to dive
into the world of problem Management in
I which is a crucial aspect of the IT
service management before we get into
the topic let's start with some basic
terminologies and understand how I is
connected to this concept of problems
iil or the information technology
infrastructure library is a widely
adopted free work that provides best
practices for delivering high quality IT
services it helps organizations align
their IT services with businesses needs
and ensure seamless operations so what
exactly is a problem in the context of
IDL well a problem is the underlying
cause of one or more incidents on the
other hand an incident is an unplanned
disruption or impairment of a service
think of it like this an incident is the
symptom while the problem is the root
cause behind it for example imagine your
computer shows a blue screen error the
blue screen is the incident but what's
causing it that's the problem we need to
solve it could be due to a faculty
driver memory issue overheating or a bad
display adapter without addressing the
root cause the blue screen will keep
happening problem management is the
structured approach to identifying
analyzing and resolving these underlying
problems the goal is to to prevent
incidents from recording and minimize
their impact on the IT services in this
video I will guide you through the
essentials of problem Management in I we
will start by understanding what problem
management is why is it so important
then we will explore the three main
phases and the relationship with other
key I processes the roles and
responsibilities techniques used to
manage these problems key performance

start with what is problem Management in
iil problem management is a process that
helps you identify the root cause of
these incidents and find permanent
solutions to stop them from happening
again it's all about analyzing and
resolving problems proactively so your
it service runs smoothly and
consistently but there's more to unpack
let's dive a bit deeper importance of
problem management first off why is
problem management so important it
helped reduce the number of recurring
incidents minimize downtime and ensure
reliability Services it saves money in
the long run by fixing the root causes
instead of applying temporary band aids
it keeps your customers happy by
providing stable and consistent IT
services it also helps you improve your
processes by identifying the areas that
need optimization to understand the
importance of problem management let's
look at a real world example of company
where employees frequently face system
crashes due to software conflicts each
time this happens productivity takes a
hit causing delays and frustrations
initially the IT team applies quick
fixes but the crashes keep recording
with problem management the ID team
investigates the root causes of these
crashes and discovers that a recent
software update is incompatible with the
other applications by identifying the
root cause they roll back and update and
Implement a compat comptible version
this permanent fix not only stops the
crashes but also improves overall system
stability as a result employ
productivity increases and the company
saves money by avoiding repeated
downtime and support cost let us now
discuss how does a problem management
work let's break down the stages with
our example problem identification
spotting potential problems through
reported incidents or by monitoring your
system for example the ID team notices
fre system crashes reported by employees
these incidents are flagged during the
routine monitoring and through headless
reports problem logging once the issue
is identified the IT team logs all the
relevant details into their management
system this includes the affected
service the impact on employee
productivity and any error messages or
related documents categorization and
prioritization the loged problems are
then categorized based on severity and
impact system crashes affecting many
users and causing significant downtime
which are given high priority
investigation and diagnosis the IT team
conducts a too investigation using Trend
analysis and cause and effect diagrams
discovering that the crashes began after
a recent software update indicating a
compatibility issue with existing
applications workaround and escalation
to minimize disruption a temporary
workaround is implemented this might
involve rolling back the software update
on critical systems while a more
permanent solution is developed if the
problem is complex the issue might be
escalated to specialized technical terms
problem resolution the IT team works on
a permanent fix they develop a
compatible software version or a patch
that resolves the conflict test it
thoroughly and then deploys it across
the organization problem closure after
successfully implementing the solution
the problem record is closed all
relevant documentations is updated to
reflect the solution and steps taken
then we have review the final step is
review of the entire process to identify
any Lessons Learned or areas for
improvement this helps in refining the
problem management practices for future
issues but problem management doesn't
operate on its own it's closely linked
to the other ideal processes let's
discuss the relationship between problem
management and the other key itl process
Incident Management incidents often lead
to problem identification change
management resolving problems might
require changes to it infrastructure or
Services then we have the Knowledge
Management the knowledge base stores
information about known errors and
solutions continual Improvement problem
management aims to identify areas for
process optimization to make all this
happen we need a dedicated team with
with specific rules what are the rules
and responsibilities in a problem
management according to the itl
framework let's break it down first we
have the problem manager this person
oversees the entire problem management
process identifying problems assigning
task managing investigations and
ensuring issues are resolved on time
then there's the problem owner they
handle specific problems find the root
causes develop Solutions and work with
stakeholders to fix the issues
effectively the technical analyst they
dig into the technical details of
problems conducting thorough
investigations to find Solutions then we
have the service desk team logs and
categorize problem records link them to
existing incidents and find Initial
support before escalating them to
problem management the change manager
accesses how problem resolutions affect
ID infrastructure and services ensuring
any necessary changes are planned tested
and implemented correctly lastly other
it support teams like application
networks database support may also be
involved depending on the problem in I
these roles work together to identify
analyze and resolve problems quickly and
effectively minimizing the impact on the
business and maintaining the quality of
ID Services each rule is crucial to the
problem management process ensuring
everything runs smoothly and efficiently
so how do we effectively manage these
problems let's discuss some of the
techniques used to manage the problems
we can use techniques like root cause
analysis to find underlying causes then
we have the trend analysis to spot
patterns and recording issues the
fishbone diagram to visualize problems
then we have the brainstorming sessions
to generate Solutions known error
databases for quick reference let's talk
about what kpis should you track to
track our Effectiveness we monitor key
performance kpis such as number of open
problems average time to resolve
problems percentage of recurring
incidents cost of problem management
activities customer satisfaction with
problem resolution let us now talk about
some of the best practices and tips for
Effective problem Management in
I first foster the culture of problem
reporting within your organization
