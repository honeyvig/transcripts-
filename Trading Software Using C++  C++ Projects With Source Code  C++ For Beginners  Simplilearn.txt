welcome back to another video by simply
learn in this session we will be
creating a trading project in which we
will be able to buy different types of
Home Appliances like refrigerator air
conditioner microwave Etc by checking
their price and discount on each item
after buying these products a proper
bill will be generated displaying the
current time and date
we will use different concepts of C plus
plus to make this C plus project
this project will be helpful for those
folks who are at their initial to
intermediate stage
we have tried to keep this project as
basic as we could
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our YouTube channel and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an update
from Simply learn
now let's switch to our code editor
so this is a code editor Dev C plus plus
first of all let's save this one
let's type first of all we'll include
the header files so hash include
iostream
now let's try to say first of all
let's save it let's name it first of all
we want to name it let's say
project 2 dot CPP
so we have named this one and we have
saved all right now the project2.cpp is
the name of this file
now we can start with the coding part
now another header file we'll have to
include is Hash include C time so we are
including C time because we have to
display the time also that's why I will
have to include this Library C10
only Now using namespace standard
now we'll start with the main function
that is int me
now inside this function we'll first of
all initialize some variables and
functions
so let's say
we'll initialize the character and let's
name it start
after that we'll have to initialize or
declare a function Also let's say the
function name is shop
and what will be passed to it all right
now another variable would be of
character type again it is choice
so we have created two variables and
declared a function
all right so this project would be of
shopping of trading of Home Appliances
so we'll do that
for that we will ask the user to press a
key let's say for home appliances you
would press h to continue shopping
so
first of all we'll create a tag
I'll explain to you why we are creating
these tags first of all we'll create a
tag start L we have named this tag as
start l
all right now
will display a message saying that
please press h
to start shopping
for Home Appliance
all right
so we are asking the user to press h
to start shopping for the home
appliances
now here we use again another tag start
I'll explain them later why we are doing
that
now we will take an input from the user
the it that is start
we'll take the input now this input
would be H that the user will be
entering so now the user can enter small
in small case or in uppercase so for
that we will use an if condition
in which we'll write
start equals equals
H that is the lower case
or
start equals
uppercase
all right so here we will declare a
variable let's say float
and name it total now we will call a
function and store that function in this
variable so we'll call show up
all right
now time underscore t
equals
time
null
so yeah now let me write the other part
of the code also then I'll explain the
complete part so TM star
PTR
local time and T
so time T is a Time related type so
there are four types of time related
types clock underscore T time underscore
T size underscore T and TM these types
are capable of representing system and
date as some sort of integer
now here the time function with null
parameter Returns the current calendar
time in seconds
as you can see time with null
now moving on to the second that is
tms26 sign so TM is a struct type and
the local time function is returning a
pointer to the TM object
this is a local time function this is
returning the object to the TM this
returning function to the team object
right
so as you can see here we have used the
error operator so the arrow operator in
C or C plus plus gives the value held by
the variable name to the structure or
Union variable of the pointer name
so after that we can see we have used
the TM day
here TMM date so it means that days of
month ranging from 1 to 31.
and this
tmmon which means month since January
so it is we are using these variables to
represent the time
so TM Moon that is for month it will
represent it means the months from
January since January and this is for
the Days 1 to 31 and this is for the
year like TM year means year since 1900.
so we will use all of these to represent
the date
all right now we'll type print build
time
so for the build time we'll have to do
this like
P PTR
yeah
all right for this we'll have we will
use this
foreign
so here we are printing the build time
this will print the hour this will print
the minute this will print the second
all right
now we'll print total bill amount
all right now we will use an if
condition because you will have to give
some discount also
so if the total is greater than
50 000 and less than one lakh
then we will give a discount of five
percent and to give the discount we'll
do
total equals total minus
0.05
into
Tal
that would be
five percent
now the total discount will print
total discount
five percent
similarly we will do for others also
like if we if the buyer buys more than
one lakh in less than one lakh 25 000
then we will give a different discount
and different discount for other amounts
as well
so we can do that we can just copy it
and then use it
else if
so here we'll do that if the amount is
from 1 lakh
foreign
then we will give a discount of let's
say 10 percent
0.1
it would be ten percent
next I'll see if
let's just copy paste this one
125 to 150.
then we will give a discount of
25 percent which is 0.25
if the amount is more than 1.5 lakhs
that is 1 lakh 50 000.
then we will discount we will give a
discount of 0.5 that is 50 percent
now here we'll write
C out
total bill amount
and then we will print amount
that is total
now here we will use a tag again
now here we will print that do you want
to shop again or not if yes then press Y
and if no then you have to press n then
we'll have to take the input from the
user
let's see in
choice
so if the user selects
y so we'll write if Choice equals to
y smaller case for uppercase
then we can do that go to start as we
have used the tag
so these tags are used because
if the user press y then will straight
go to this
start tag like this portion will be
displayed
so as we can see this tag is used so if
the user will press yes or Y
then we'll straight go to this part
because this tag so that's how tag is
used
also we'll have to use single quotes
note the double one
now as if
and else you will write
choice
and
in this case we can print thanks for
shopping
and in else so it will act as a default
case
so this is basically a default case in
which in this portion we'll write you
have entered wrong option please press h
all right now we'll use again an else
block
for the above if
he'll write
you have entered
wrong option
please
press h
to start again
now go to
start
after that as we can see we have
declared a function
this
float total this shop function that we
have stored in total so we will be
creating the body of this function
float shop
now here we will use a tag again so
again a tag will be used which is name
shop the name of the tag is shop now
again some variables will be declared
like character choice
product again of character type
let's say
quantity
of integer type
and
bill will which will have to initialize
from zero we will be using it
then again we will be using another tag
let's say item
item level or item l
your choice whatever you want to name
the tag
now let's create a
welcome
interface kind of a thing
all right as you can see
foreign
after that and I will use
and similarly we will copy this part
and use it
let's name it to please press W to order
washing machine
free for television let's say M4
microwave
and let's say
A4 air conditioner
now first of all we'll create an if else
condition
in that if else condition we will cover
all the things like if it is not
refrigerator washing machine television
microwave air conditioner other than
those things then it will go to the else
block for that we have to create an if
condition in which we will keep all
those home appliances
so let's just do that
if choice
equals r
choice
sequence
the
equals m
okay
all right now inside this if condition
we'll use another if
in which we will write if Choice equals
r
or uppercase r
then
in that condition we will
we will mention different brand names
and different prices of a refrigerator
so for that let's create
see out in that we will write
a whirlpool
foreign
after that we will use ndel
similarly we'll do for all of these
so let's say Whirlpool Samsung will
mention it Samsung
and then higher
similarly
voltas
foreign
now the user will enter the choice like
one two three
up to six
so let's see if the user will enter
1
then we will ask the user please enter
the quantity of the product
all right now in C in we'll write
quantity we'll take the input from the
user
now
these variables we have already declared
so Bill equals to Bill
Plus
quantity
into
40 000 which is the price of one that is
whirlpool
washing refrigerator Whirlpool cost 40
000 that is why we are multiplying this
all right so
similarly if
in else if condition will do the same
If the product is 2 the if the user will
press 2
then the price of Samsung is
25
000
the rest is same
ly
for product three also
foreign
so this is what we have created for
refrigerator now we'll have to use an
else block
and this else block will write
you have entered
the wrong option
please try again
all right now go to
refrigerator
now similarly as we have done for the
refrigerator we'll do the same for
washing machine also
let's copy this part
if Choice washing machine that is w
washing machine details
all right
now let's name it Bosch
and the price would be forty thousand
twenty five thousand twenty thousand
the second would be LG
third would be ifp
higher
and last should be let's say Samsung
we can do the same we can copy this part
to save some time
we'll have to alter
the values only the rest would be same
all right if the product is one then
please enter the quantity of the product
forty thousand twenty five thousand
twenty thousand fifty eight
you will have to do 58
then 30 000.
then 45
000
similarly we'll have to do it for others
also like as we can see
we have many home appliances like we
have done RAV4 refrigerator and washing
machine will have to do for television
microwave air conditioner for these
three we will have to do the same so we
can just copy paste those things so we
have copy pasted for air conditioner
micro even television
and let's save it
let me show you this is for the
television
the code is same we'll have to alter the
digits like the price of each brand
will have to do that and for microwave
also
as you can see
and now let's have a situation where the
user enters any other alphabet rather
than these alphabets like r w m t a
then for that condition we will have to
create an else block
and for that let's create an else block
in that else block we will write
you have entered
the wrong option
please try again
all right
return
bill
all right
after that we'll have to use the bracket
let's try to run it by first saving it
now we'll try to run this execute
compile and run
let's hope it works
so there are some errors
so there are some errors that we need to
take care of
another one is this
rptr we have written it's dptr
and the TM second will have to use the
error operator here
all right
so let's save it again and try to run
this
hope it runs
so as you can see it is showing please
press h to start shopping so we'll press
h
now please follow the instructions
please enter R to order refrigerator
please enter W to order washing machine
please enter T to order television enter
M to microwave a for air conditioner
so let's say I won't want a refrigerator
only
and these are the refrigerator details
they have Whirlpool Samsung higher
voltas growth rage Panasonic and the
price ranges are mentioned so let's say
I want to order voltas
I'll click four
please enter the quantity of the product
let's say I want to purchase
four refrigerators
let's consider consider a situation
all right so four refrigerators date is
mentioned time is mentioned and the
total bill amount is 72 000.
foreign
[Music]
72 as we can see so total discount as we
have given the discount above 50 percent
is five percent so after discounted it
reduces to 68 400. now they're asking if
you want to continue shopping or not
like let's say I want to shop something
more then I I'll click why
before that guys let me show you that we
have different discounts that we have
mentioned like
let's see again
as you can see just a second
this if the total amount is greater than
50 000 and less than one lakh then five
percent discount if it is greater than
one lakh and less than one lakh 25 000
then it will be 10 percent between 125
and 150 it would be 25 percent and
greater than 150 to be 50 percent
so this is how we are giving the
discount in this project
now let's try to run this again
so we'll press h
now let's say I want to buy microwave
I'll click m
let's say
Whirlpool or Samsung let's say Samsung
microwave I want to buy I'll press six
please enter the quantity of the product
let's say I want to buy five microwaves
then 1 lakh 75 000 build date is created
build time is generated
50 discount is there
and after the discount it comes around
87 500.
all right
so this is how we can do that and let's
say I'll click on why if you if I want
to shop again then again I'll have to
click on edge now I want to buy let's
say air conditioner
so I'll press a
enter your choice
let's say I want to buy o Journal so
I'll click on four
three o General ACS
66 000 after discount it is 62 700.
and let's say if I add some wrong option
let's say I'll click
so here I'll have to click rwtma let's
say I'll click four or two something
some digits I'll enter
then it will show you have entered the
wrong option please try again
and if I'll click let's say B which is
not there
then what will it show
again it will show you have entered the
wrong option
so we have to select
rwtna from these we'll have to select we
cannot select from any other digit or
alphabet
we have to select from rwtma
so let's check
a and
taken
one only
and now I want to kind of quit the
shopping then I'll click on n
thanks for shopping
so this is our C plus plus trading
project that you can create it is quite
basic project and this will help you in
understanding C plus plus in a better
way
so this was all about our project in C
plus plus you can make this project on
your own for the learning purpose the
link of this code will be added in the
description box
with that we have come to the end of
this video so if you like this video
