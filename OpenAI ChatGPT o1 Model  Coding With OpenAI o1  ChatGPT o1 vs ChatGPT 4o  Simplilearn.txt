open AI is one of the main leaders in
the field of generative AI with its chat
GPT being one of the most popular and
widely used examples chat GPT is powered
by open AI GPT family of lar language
models llms in August and September 2024
there were rumors about a new model from
open AI code named Strawberry at first
it was unclear if it was the next
version of GPT 40 or something different
on September 12 open AI officially
introduced the 01 model hi I am m in
this video we will discuss about open
model 01 and its types after this we
will perform some basic prompts using
open a preview and open a mini and at
the end we will see comparison between
the open A1 models and GPD 4 so without
any further Ado let's get started what
is open A1 the open A1 family is a group
of llms that have been improved to
handle more complex reasoning these
models are designed to offer a different
experience from gp40 focusing on
thinking through problems more
thoroughly before responding unlike
older models o1 is built to solve
challenging problems that require
multiple steps and deep reasoning open
01 models also use a technique called
Chain of Thought prompting which allows
the model to Think Through problem step
by step open AI o1 consists of two
models o1 preview and o1 mini the o1
preview model is meant for more complex
task while the 01 mini is a smaller a
more affordable version so what can open
A1 do open A1 can handle many tasks just
like other GPD models from openai such
as answering questions summarizing
content and creating new material
however o is especially good at more
complex task including the first one is
enhanced using the o models are designed
for advanced problem solving
particularly in subjects like science
technology engineering and math the
second one is brainstorming and ideation
with its improved reasoning o is great
at coming up with creative ideas and
solution in various field the number
third is scientific research o1 is
perfect for tasks like anting cell
sequencing data or solving complex math
needed in areas like Quantum Optics the
number fourth is coding the ow models
can write and fix code performing well
on coding tests like human e and code
forces and helping developers build
multi-step workflows the fifth one
mathematics o1 is much better at math
than previous model scoring 83% in the
international mathematics Olympia test
compared to gp4 R 133% it also did well
in other math competition like aim
making it useful for generating complex
formulas for physics and the last one is
self fact checking o can check the
accuracy of its own responses helping to
improve the reliability of its answer
you can use open1 models in several ways
chat gbt plus and team users have access
to on preview and 0 mini models and can
manually choose them in the model picker
although free users don't have access to
the ow models yet open AI planning to
offer 0 mini to them in the future
developers can also use these models
open as API and they are available on
third party platform like Microsoft is
your AI studio and GitHub models so
before jumping to the demo part here is
a quick info for you dive into the
future of AI with our generative Ai and
machine learning course in collaboration

and many more so find the course link
from the description box below and the
pin comand so yes guys I have opened
this chb 40 model here and ch1 PR as you
can see so I have this plus model okay
the paid version of chat GPD so I can
access this 01 preview and 01 Mini model
okay we will go with o1 preview model
and we will put same prompts in both the
model of the chat GP 40 and the O
preview and see what are the differences
are coming okay so we will do some math
questions and we will do some coding we
will do some Advanced reasoning and and
quantum physics as well okay so let's
start with so I have some prompt already
written with me so first one is number
Theory okay so what I will do I will
copy it from here and paste it
in this
and both okay so let me run in foro
and over preview so here you can see
it's thinking okay okay so this is what
I was saying chain of
thoughts okay so these are the chain of
thoughts first is breaking down the prim
this is and then is identifying the GCT
and now see the difference between the
output C output is 561 is not a prime
number and the gcd greatest common
receiver of 48 and 180 is 12 okay here
see charge bity one preview is giving
the output in step by step first see
determine if 561 is a prime number or
not the number 56 is not a prime number
it's composite number because it has
this this this okay then Second Step
then the greatest common
divisor then they found 12 and answer is
no 561 is not composite number because
of this and the greatest common divisor
of 48 and 18 18 is 12 see just see the
difference between the two model this is
why CH G1 models are crazy for math
coding and advanced reasoning quantum
physics for these things okay so let's
go with our second step so here if you
will see you can see the attach file
option in charity 40 okay you can come
upload from your computer but here you
you will see in o1 there is no attach
file option
this is one drawback okay so here upload
from computer so this is one
small okay and let me open this and this
is the question I have okay yeah so I
will copy this I will run this and
this okay see it's start giving the
answer and o1 is still thinking solving
the equation then solving analyzing the
relationship okay so chat gpt1 will take
time but it will give you more accurate
more step by step as you
want okay so here you can see solve for
x question this this this and here the
steps you can see okay this is more
structured way you can say in a good
structured way okay cht1 preview give
you in good structur way as mini as well
okay so yeah so here they wrote just one
and two this this this and here if
you'll see question one solve for x in
this and step one is this step two is
this and step three is this then the
answer of xal to three but here simply
they wrote we know this this this and x
= 3 for the second question see
expanding the left hand side this this
but here step one square both sides of
the given equation start by squaring
both side okay it's written but not in
good way okay so this is why o1 is
better for math okay so now let's check
it for the coding part okay so I
have one question okay let me see what
output it will give to first I will
write I need
okay leave it I will copy it and I will
copy it as well here run it and run it
see start giving answer okay and still
this will adjust the parameters and
sharing the code
generation because
chpt1 will think first then it will
analyze then after that it will give you
answers okay here the code is done see
the code is in is still
thinking step one and first
here you can't see anything see step
setup development environment PP install
n PL Li then this then this and here
nothing
and but I will ask
it
okay give me code in
one
tab
okay here also give me code
[Music]
and in
single
tab okay so I can just copy and paste so
what I will do I will open one online
compiler and I will directly copy it and
paste
okay so let's finish this
I hope it will work so let me open W3
schools
compiler okay yeah same I will open for
this W3
school okay
so let me copy the code
and my
bad and paste it here same for go for
this
okay okay I will copy the code and I
will paste it here okay I
hope okay gives something yeah cool so
yes now you can see the difference
between the output
so this is the output of 40 and this is
the output of o1 preview see o1 preview
output is this and this is the out
output of 4 so this is the difference
this is why o1 takes time but it will
give you more accurate result in a good
way okay so now let's check something
else so moving on let's see some
advanced dising question okay so this is
The Logical puzzle one the first one
okay so I will copy it and I will paste
it here okay this is for o this is for
preview why I'm not comparing o1 with
mini because they both are same but
slightly differences there okay so here
we can see more difference between for
old model versus new model you can say
okay so now see the answer is end in
this much only but it will explain you
in a better way see thoughts for 7
Seconds explanation that case one then
case two okay with conclusion in both
scenarios summary and this here this one
small explanation and that's it right so
they
created o1 preview for more you know it
will describe you more in a better way
right now let's see some scientific
reasoning as well okay so let me copy it
here say still thinking but start giving
answer see thought for 16 seconds
so again I will say that you know CH gp1
is much better than chb 4 CH GPT 4 is
great for you know content writing and
all but chity 01 preview and mini are
very good for reasoning math coding or
quantum physics these type of things
okay Advanced reasoning okay chity 4 is
good for you know generative text okay
like for marketing writing copies emails
and all of those so now let's see some
comparison between on models and gp40
model when new models are released their
capabilities are revealed through
Benchmark data in the technical reports
the new open AI model excel in complex
reading task it surpasses human phsd
level accuracy in physics chemistry
biology on the GP QA Benchmark coding
becomes easier with o1 as it rents in
the 89th percentile of the competitive
programming questions code for the model
is also outstanding in math on a
qualifying exam for international
mathematics Olympiad IMO gp40 soled only
133% of problems while ow achieved 83%
this is truly next level on the standard
ml benchmarks it has huge Improvement
across the board mlu means multitask
accuracy and GP QA is reasoning
capabilities human evolution open a ask
people to compare o Wii with GP 40 on
difficult open-ended task across
different topics using the same method
as the ow preview versus gp4 comparison
like o preview ow mini was preferred
over GPT 4 for task that requires strong
reasoning skills but gp4 was still
favored for language based task model
speed as a concrete example we compared
responses from GPT 40 0 mini and O
preview on the word reasoning question
while GPD 4 did not answer correctly
both o mini and O preview did and ow
mini reason is the answer around 3 to 5x
faster limitation and wor next due to
its specialization on STEM Science
technology engineering and math
reasoning capabilities over Min factual
knowledge on non- stamp topics such as
dates biographics and trivia is
comparable to small LM such as gp4 Mei
open AI will improve these limitation in
future version as well as experiment the
extending the model to other modalities
and specialities outside of the stem
