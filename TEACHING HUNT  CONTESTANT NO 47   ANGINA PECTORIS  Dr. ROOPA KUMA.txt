hi
this is dr roopkumar and today i am
going to explain you
about a cardiovascular pathology known
as angina pectoris
what do you mean by that and in latin
the word anger means to strangle
the word vectors means chest
this is a typical appearance of a
patient experiencing anjana
this picture shows a person is suffering
with
pain in his chest region and this pain
commonly radiates towards his left jaw
region
his shoulder and back of his shoulder
what made this person to suffer with
angina
what is the reason behind it
so the main culprit is the reduction of
blood flow
so this reduction of blood flow to the
heart
makes the heart ischemic and this
ischemic heart
results in pain
why there is a reduction of blood flow
there are mainly two reasons
the number one is atherosclerosis
and the second one is muscle hypertrophy
i mean cardiac muscle hypertrophy
these are the both masterminds behind
the reduction of blood flow to heart
how these reasons are related with
angina
before going further i would like to
explain a few points
regarding the anatomy of the heart you
all know that
coronary arteries supply the cardiac
muscle
among the branches of the coronary
arteries the left anterior descending
artery
which is a branch of left coronary
artery is commonly associated with
atherosclerosis
so we can say that the tissue which is
receiving nutrition
from the left anterior descending artery
is more prone for
ischemia
this is a picture showing different
layers
in the wall of the heart there are
mainly
three layers endocardium myocardium
and the pericardium endocardium receives
its nutrition
directly from the blood which is
circulating inside the heart
and the myocardium and the pericardium
receives its nutrition
from the branches of the coronary artery
so coming to the first and foremost
reason for the reduction of blood flow
is atherosclerosis you all know that
it is nothing but a fibro fatty tissue
deposition
inside the blood vessel this decreases
the
lumen diameter and it makes the blood
flow turbulent
this picture clearly shows there is a
decrease in the diameter of the blood
vessel
because of atherosclerotic plug
this is a classical picture of an
atherosclerotic plaque
in one of the coronary branches
there is a tissue destruction
and discoloration because of ischemia
and the second important reason for the
reduction of blood flow
is ventricular muscle hypertrophy
because of three reasons we can commonly
see that
there is a hypertrophy in the ventricles
they are chronic hypertension iot
stenosis
and co-optation of iota in these three
reasons
there is an increase in afterload
afterload is nothing but a resistance
against with the blood has to pump
so because of increasing the resistance
there is a natural adaptation in the
ventricular muscle
to pump against this higher resistance
so ventricular muscle gains its muscle
strength
because of hypertrophy
this is the transverse section of a
physiologically normal heart
you can clearly see that right ventricle
and the left
ventricle separated by the
interventricular septum
this is a coronary artery it gives
branches
into the muscle of the heart from
outside to inside
and this is a transverse section of the
heart with ventricular hypertrophy
you can clearly see that there is an
increase in the muscle mass
when comparing with the previous normal
heart
and the coronary artery can't supply the
whole muscle
because of hypertrophy the
sub-endocardial region
is more prone for ischemia because
it is the last area of the ventricle
to receive blood from the coronary
artery
you can compare like when you are the
last person
in a buffet you don't you don't get the
same food
like the first person right
so what is the cause for the pain
we have already discussed that ischemic
heart
releases the chemical mediators like
adenosine
bradykinin and these cause irritation of
nerve fibers in the chest region and
this cause
angina so what are the symptoms
chest pain and discomfort is the most
common thing
and sometimes the pain is
felt in your arms neck jaw
shoulder region and that's called
referred pain
other common symptoms are dizziness
fatigue
shortness of breath and sweating
so there are mainly three types of
angina
stable unstable and variant types
stable angina in this type
the oxygen demand is greater than supply
the tissue demands more oxygen okay
but there is less supply of oxygen
because of atherosclerosis
and it takes place when coronary artery
is occluded
more than 75 percent because of
atherosclerosis
so this person experiences pain only
during exercise or stress
why because during exercise or stress
the heart rate increases
when there is increase in the heart rate
the cardiac muscle
has to do more work than normal
because of this some portion of the
heart muscle
don't receive the oxygen properly
because of
atherosclerosis and this ischemic region
of the heart
results in pain in the chest region and
this is called
angina luckily this pain release on
taking rest
this is an important differentiating
feature
for stable antenna during comparison
with other types
crossly we see sub-endocardial ischemia
in the ventricular region
in ecg we can see st segment depression
normally it is flat but we see a
depression in the sd segment
usually stable engine attacks are
commonly seen in people
in playground scenarios
this is a normal ecg pattern with flat
st segment
so when sub endocardial ischemia occurs
there is a depression in the hd segment
when compared to the flat hd segment in
normal scenarios
coming to the unstable angina in this
situation also
there is an increase in oxygen demand
but there is a decreased supply
the main reason is thrombus formation
over an atherosclerotic plaque
in this case the person experiences pain
during rest and exercise
when compared to stable antenna pain is
present at rest and exercise
and pain is relieved not by taking
but in stable angina pain is relieved on
taking rest
grossly we also see that there is
subendocardial ischemia
and hd segment depression like
stable angina so
this is a blood vessel cross section of
blood vessel
with the atherosclerotic plug in the
first image
and disruption of atherosclerotic plaque
followed by thrombus formation
so because of thrombus formation there
is
almost 95 percent of blockage of blood
vessel
and this causes unstable angina
which is not relieved on taking rest
and this unstable angina can occur
at both rest and exercise situations
this is a normal ecg pattern
and because of sub endocardial ischemia
we see
ht segment depression like stable angina
third type variant angina
physio angina or prince metal
nintendo
in this situation also there is an
oxygen demand
which is greater than the supply the
reason behind it
is coronary artery spasm
the person experiences pain during both
rest and exercise situations just like
unstable angina
and pain don't relieve on taking rest
grossly there is a transmural ischemia
which means all the layers of the
cardiac wall
that means endocardium myocardium
and pericardium shows ischemia
and because of transmural ischemia the
st segment
which is usually flat it elevates
and this is a vasospasm in the coronary
artery
and this narrows the blood vessel
diameter
this is a normal ecg pattern
here there is a transmural ischemia
which is involving
all three layers in the cardiac wall
and this shows st segment elevation
in ecg
so while combining all three types under
one roof
we can clearly see these symptoms
which are common with unstable angina
and variant angina
both these types pain episodes are at
rest and exercise
and they don't relieve by itself but
stable antenna occurs only during
exercise or stress
and it relieves on taking rest
coming to the ecg patterns stable engine
and
unstable antenna share common symptoms
like st segment depression in ecg
coming to the treatment part all the
types can be treated with
nitroglycerin which is a potent
vasodilator
unstable and princimetal types are kind
of emergencies
and should be treated immediately
severe atherosclerosis can be managed by
coronary strength placement
supportive treatment can be given by
statins which are
usually called anti-lipid mix
this is a balloon catheter stent
placement commonly done by the
cardiologists
for the removal of atherosclerosis and
to increase the diameter of the blood
vessel
this is an important note for
differentiating angina pectoris with
myocardial infarction
angina pectoris is nothing but an
ischemia
of the tissue but the cells are
viable but in infection cells are dead
this angina pectoris is reversible
unlike myocardial infarction is
irreversible
and lab investigation is one of the
important differentiating feature
in angina pectoris there is no rise in
the troponin
and creatine kinase mb but in myocardial
infarction
there is significant rise in the
troponin
and gradient kinase
one last question why should we dentists
learn about this i mean angina pectoris
types for intense examination
no just kidding
in previous days dentistry is only
concerned
about the oral cavity but nowadays
we are seeing a patient as a whole
i mean we are changing our aerotic focus
from oral cavity
to the whole body from time to time
now we know that angina pectoris is an
emergency condition
it can happen anytime in our dental
setup
most commonly persons with previous
history of attacks or more anxious
patients
are prone for another attack of angina
in our dental setup
before concluding our topic i would like
to give a few dental management tips
the first and foremost is the medical
history
proper undertaking of medical history is
the most important thing in the medical
field
if they have a positive history of any
medical condition
we should investigate the present
situation along with cardiologist
we can give prophylactic nitroglycerin
tablets
or anxiolytics with previous attacks of
angina and also emergency drug it
is commonly seen in our dental setups in
order to counteract
any medical emergencies
and thank you
it's done stay safe
