I was always of the opinion that online
course is not a good platform to get
enough knowledge after hearing about
simply learn from my manager my Approach
on online courses has changed I have
enrolled through 6 Sigma Black Belt and
completed my certification and now I'm
ready to take new responsibilities at my
career hi I'm rash Prasad and this is my
journey I am certified as a l Sigma
Black Belt from Simply learn I have
completed my in Pharmacy and right now
I'm working as a senior medical coding
Analyst at eard Healthcare Solutions I'm
from a middle class family my mother and
father they were not educated but they
have never bagged us on providing a good
education to us all our three siblings
has studied basic degree and myself I
have done Masters in Pharmacy then after
I have choose my careers through various
roles now I am into a good position
where I could explore myself in learning
new things I have planed my career in a
phase wise initially I have started my
career in 2017 where I have concentrated
on learning basic skills related to my
book as uh now I'm 7 years experienced I
want to upgrade myself and I have
learned about lin6 Sigma from my pets
and from my colleagues they have
suggested me to take the course and now
I have got the course and I'm ready to
take new responsibilities and challenges
using this
tool my manager has suggested me to take
lin6 Sigma program from Simply learn
he's also a certified Green Belt
programmer from Simply learn I even
encouraged two of my colleagues to take
the same program and even now they have
enrolled and they are taking the course
for lin Sigma Black Belt the best part
of the certification was the self-
learning it is very elegant and very
informative and the diagrammatic
represent presentations provided they
help me in getting into the course in a
easy way and understanding the Deep
concepts of Sigma and lean in my current
position my knowledge is limited up to
MS office but learning Six Sigma has
helped me in getting new Concepts from
mini tab and exploring different ways of
resolving a problem and using them in my
current position I have learned new
tools coming to Six Sigma Black Belt it
has a number of modules in applying
day-to-day challenges where I am happy
to learn this and use them in my career
and getting a good use of it and good
results from them actually I have not
had a good opinion on online courses I
opted for offline courses all the time
but after joining simple lar has changed
my Approach towards the online courses
the material they have provided and the
exams they have conducted has definitely
improved me a lot from all the
aspects I believe in self- learning I
just want to explore things myself and
get a knowledge of it then start
exploring and start working on it I
never go by others success I just
believe in myself and I go with the flow
learning and keeping updated is never a
late thing and age is just a number
keeping ourself updated is not a wrong
investment and investing our in ourself
is definitely going to help in the
career progress and getting new
opportunities
