what comes to your mind when you think
about persuasion some sort of commercial
message urging you to purchase a certain
product or a political candidate
attempting to persuade you to put their
name on the ballot but let us tell you
persuasion is not only limited to these
two things it's an integral part of our
daily lives many times we believe that
we are impervious to persuasion and we
have an innate capacity to see through a
sales pitch perceive the truth of the
situation and draw out our own judgments
but that is not the mere reality
according to psychology certain factors
impact our decision- making
tremendously so today in this video we
will delve over the five principles of
persuasion psychology in detail but
before we begin make sure to subscribe
to our YouTube channel and hit the Bell
icon to never miss an update from Simply
learn we all live in a fastpac world due
to which we rely on shortcuts or rules
of thumb more than ever to guide our
decision- making these shortcuts are the
common persuasion psychology traits that
influence one's decision- making if you
are wondering what persuasion means let
me tell you that it is the process by
which a person's attitude or behavior
are influenced by Communications from
another person so moving ahead let's
discover the principles of persuasion
one by one the first principle we have
is reciprocity to some extent we humans
value equality and balance
this means we don't enjoy feeling like
we owe other people for instance if
someone gives you a birthday present you
will certainly want to send them one in
return you'll do this when their
birthday rolls in next to satisfy your
feeling of social obligation so now you
must be thinking about how this can be
applied in a business environment well
think about the last time that you went
to a restaurant you must have received a
small gift from the waiter about the
same time they brought your bill a small
mint perhaps does that small gift affect
the amount of tip you gave them you'll
probably say no but research shows that
providing a single mint boosts the tip
by 3% furthermore if the waiter offers
another mint saying that here's one more
mint for you good people then the tip
climbs about
23% this means the amount of tip is
independent of the value of gift and
rather it is dependent on the way it is
presented the key to using this
principle of reciprocation is to be the
first to give and ensure that what you
give is personalized and
unexpected the next principle is
scarcity the less of something there is
the more people tend to want it for
example consider the scenario of iPhone
13 Pro devices due to the ongoing
worldwide semiconductor shortage Apple
announced the cut in production of 10
million iPhone 13 Pro devices after this
announcement the the pre-booking and
sales of this mobile phone went through
the roof increasing Time by about 15 to
20 days so with this example the science
behind the principle of scarcity is
pretty clear you'll have to create a
sense of scarcity around the product you
want to sell it is not enough just to
highlight the benefits of your product
you will have to tell people what is so
unique about it and what they might
stand to lose if they fail to consider
your proposal
immediately the third principle on our
list is Authority individuals who are
authoritative knowledgeable and reputed
in their respective fields are more
influential and persuasive than those
who are not part of the justification
for this is that Authority and
credibility are fundamental components
of trust and we are more prone to follow
someone we trust in many Realms of life
we witness the principle of authority in
action dentists in white coats are used
to promote toothpaste the camera
capabilities of mobile phones are
marketed with the help of well-known
movie directors even in the corporate
environment strings of signatures are
attached in the email to improve an
individual's Authority you can achieve
this in your business by recommending
others so that they feel a social
obligation to recommend you in return
the fourth principle of persuasion
psychology is consensus humans are
social by nature and they typically
believe that adhering to the conventions
of a social group is crucial this
belongingness to social proof always
impact human behavior and decision
making Hotel towels are a great
illustration of this persuasion
principle during your stay at the hotel
you must have come across small cards in
your rooms asking you to reuse the
towels for the sake of Environmental
Protection it turns out this is a very
effective method resulting in nearly 34%
compliance but could there be a more
effective way well the resear shows that
on adding the principle of consensus and
bending the words on the message card as
eight out of 10 guests whose stays in
this room choose to reuse their towel
can lead to a 52% increase in the ReUse
of towels however this principle of
consensus is challenging to apply from a
personal perspective in the workplace
you'll have to achieve this by
maintaining your Brand's reputation and
ethics the last principle we have on our
list is liking given human nature people
are much more likely to like people that
are similar to them who pay compliments
and who cooperate with them than those
who don't according to chini's research
a group of MBA students who were asked
to get straight down to business were
able to reach an agreement at a rate of
55% whereas students who were encouraged
to discuss their personal interests
before negotiation were able to reach an
agreement 90% of the time this is simply
due to the sharing of person personal
interests and the creation of a sense of
likeliness to consider this in the form
of a business context take the example
of Apple Stores it's no surprise that
this high-end high-tech Apple Store is
manned by Representatives dressed up in
jeans and t-shirts rather than typical
suits and ties Apple uses the liking
principle to its Advantage this strategy
of Apple implies I am a human being just
like you I'm casual and approachable
this strategy creates a sense of
belonging in customers to purchase
Apple's products these principles that
we discussed provide for small ethically
sound and often Costless changes that
can lead to substantial alterations in
Your Capacity to convince others to buy
your products hence conduct a thorough
analysis of these psychological
principles and Implement them in your
work life that's all we have for today
we wish you all the very best for your
future management Endeavors thank you
