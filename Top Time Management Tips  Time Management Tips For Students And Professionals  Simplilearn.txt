you may have noticed some individuals
around you who manage to acquire
everything that they have planned
imminently and you must have felt how
they can achieve a lot in a stipulated
amount of time where your date just ends
in a frenzy of activities
so here we are to help you understand
that today we bring you this informative
video on time management tips but before
we begin make sure to subscribe to our
channel and hit the bell icon to never
miss an update from simply learn time is
the most valuable and scarcest resource
for all of us being conscious of time
can result in self-improvement as well
as productivity
and this is applicable for both work
life and personal life hence it is
essential to acknowledge how we spend
our time
after careful analysis we have listed
the top 7 crucial steps for time
management which will help you organize
your time effectively first and foremost
you must keep track of where you are
spending your time
frequently there is a disparity between
what you think is taking up your time
and what actually is
this is because it is difficult to
estimate how long a task can take
for example consider a scenario where
you are required to write 300 word email
you may think email writing is simple
and you can do it in 5 minutes however
you are likely to overestimate your
speed and underestimate other related
tasks
those additional tasks can add to the
intended time span of your main task
relate this with the several tasks you
have to complete every day
don't you think this will be stressful
hence you need to think realistically to
gauge the time span for each task
you can use time tracking applications
to track how you are spending your time
on different tasks
after a week of careful evaluation
you'll have a clear picture of how you
spend your time and you can plan
accordingly
next up is setting achievable goals now
that you know how long each task will
take setting goals will be easier
while formulating your goals make sure
that they are aligning with the smart
approach of setting goals
they should be specific measurable
attainable relevant and timely you can
also add some rewards for the successful
completion of goals
doing this will keep you motivated
having said that recall a moment when
you have completed your goals well ahead
of time and mention the approach you
adopted to accomplish that goal in the
comment section below the third tip we
have is maintain a to-do list each day
since you have your goals listed
beforehand creating a to-do list will be
easier you can use any time management
application to create it but while
creating it make sure to keep it simple
and achievable as looking at partially
completed to-do list day after day can
be disheartening so it's always better
to under promise and over deliver once
you have a list of tasks in your hand
it's time to prioritize them we suggest
you prioritize tasks based on their
importance and urgency you can classify
them into four categories
important and urgent
tasks that should be done right away
important but not urgent
tasks that you can plan later
urgent but not important tasks that can
be delegated not urgent and not
important
tasks that do not deal with your
productivity
this breakdown of your to-do list can
help you manage the order of your tasks
the next step on our list is say no to
multitasking
multitasking is not profitable and it
doesn't save your time
in fact multitasking reduces your
quality of work and slows you down it
also takes away your ability to think
creatively as multitasking constantly
requires you to switch between tasks so
it's better to avoid multitasking and
focus on one task at a time our next
step deals with the progress analysis
the best way to check whether you are on
the right track or not is to link your
actions to your goals
what we need you to do is to evaluate
what you are doing is related to what
you are trying to achieve
for evaluating this make two lists
one with the goals you are aiming to
achieve and another list with the task
that you are spending time on
if these two lists don't align then
probably you are in the wrong direction
and wasting your time
carrying this analysis every month will
help you set yourself in the right
direction to accomplish your goals
next up is planning short breaks during
working hours the human brain takes
basic rest activity cycles every 90
minutes after working for more than 90
minutes our body starts draining
emergency reserves of energy to keep us
working
so scheduling short breaks after every
90 minutes can help you maintain your
focus high throughout the day
finally the last tip is not to strive
for perfection in time management there
is saying that do not let the perfect be
the enemy of good
so make sure to stop over analyzing and
rather do your best always
consider every effort you make as a
valuable step in your journey no matter
what the outcome is so those were our
tips to help you manage your time that
brings us to the end of this video i
