in this video we are going to learn all
about a Reddit sort in C programming so
without any further delay let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
and while we are at it please leave us a
like if you find our content helpful and
it's up to the channel would be
appreciated all right
we will start by understanding what Red
X sort is in C next we will understand
the working of the Red X sort and
finally to get things a little more
interesting let's run a program
practically on redixot for better
understanding well now we are good to
get started
first let's begin by understanding what
Reddit sought in C is
in red xot the Sorting is done on the
integer values digit by digit from the
least significant bit to the most
significant bit either in ascending or
descending order of arrangement so for
example
let's consider an array of four elements
to sort and they are 12 9 236 and 463.
so firstly some of the elements which
are in the units Place once they are
sorted in the proper place move on to
the tens place and sort digit by digit
and finally sort elements of the
hundreds place
great now we have an idea of what Red X
sort is in C so moving ahead let's
understand the working of the Red X sort
so let's consider this example we have
an array of five elements to sort so
first find the largest element and it is
576 which consists of three digits in it
that means we required three passes to
sort the unordered array so as I
discussed before in the first pass saw
the elements starting with the least
significant bit followed by the second
least significant bit
and later the most significant bit
elements
so here the least significant digits are
8 2 0 4 and 6. so considering digits 0
to 9 we use counting sort to sort the
elements and place them in the right
order and are the proper position so
since we have 0 in the list let's place
this element first
and then search for the next list
element in LSD
and it is to
and followed by 2 we have 4.
and then 6.
and the last element is 8.
and finally the digits are sorted
and the sorted elements are in the
ascending order of 0 2 4 6 and 8.
so now moving on to the second least
significant bit the elements are 1 2 5 7
and 0.
so the least digit we have in a list is
0. so let's place the digit first
and followed by digit 0 we have one next
then two
and followed by that we have five
and seven
so here finally the order of sorted
elements is
0 1 2 5 and 7.
similarly let's move on to the most
significant bit
so let's place the least digit first
which is digit 1.
so followed by that we have another one
so let's move that next
then the next list digit is three
followed by three we have 4.
and then 5.
finally the elements are sorted in the
right order
the array elements are sorted in the
ascending order and they are 108 110
354 422 and 576.
okay so let us now move on to the
implementation of red x.nc
so it is a implementation of a red X
sort so first we have the two function
declaration that is display and redx
sorting
so first moving on with the function get
maximum element so find the maximum
number from the given array elements so
to find we have the variable declaration
Max element initially a of 0 is assigned
and for I is equal to 1 till I less than
n
if the condition e of I is greater than
Max element assign e of I to Max element
and written Max
the next function is the counting sort
so using counting sort algorithm we
perform a red X sort
so the variable declared at array size
and place so first we are creating the
output array of size plus 1 then we are
creating a Max variable is equal to
array of 0 divided by place of module
10.
and in this for Loop
this for Loop is to sort the array
elements so for that we are taking
disadvantages starting from unit place
to 100 place
so the condition is
for I is equal to 1 till I less than
size
if condition array of I is divided by
place of module 10 must be greater than
Max then assign array of a to Max and in
count Max Plus 1 creating another
variable called count
and then for I is equal to 0 to I less
than Max the initial count of I is equal
to 0.
the next for Loop is to calculate the
count of elements so I is equal to 0
till I less than size count of array of
I divided by place of module 10 plus
plus so incrementing the count by 1.
and the next for Loop
is to calculate the cumulative count
which is nothing but the sum of all
count generated so far
so here for I is equal to 1 till I less
than 10
count of I is equal to count of I plus
count of I minus 1. and in this for Loop
where I is equal to size minus 1 and I
greater equal to 0
so basically in this for Loop we are
taking one digit at a time from the
input array that is this a array of I
and placing them in the output array at
proper place so the output array is this
and the condition is count of array of I
divided by Place module 10 minus 1.
and count of I divide by Place model 10
minus minus so we are also decrementing
the count by 1.
and finally the last for Loop is for
assigning all the sorted output array
elements in the input array that is
whatever is stored in output I is now
moved on to the array of I array
and the Red X sort function here
so whatever we have we are calling the
get Max element and that Max element is
given to Max variable here
and we are calling the counting sort
and display function is to display all
the sorted array elements and then
moving on to the main function here we
have the array of five elements that is
522 98 232 and 140. so in this main
function we are calling the Red X sort
and the display function so now let's
try to execute
and as you can see the screen the arrays
are sorted in a proper ascending order
so starting from 5 98
122 140 and 232.
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the Red X sort Instinct
