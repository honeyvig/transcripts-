foreign
models before the data is being
transmitted it has to go between
different protocol check at the
transport layer
this layer identifies any error or
corrupted data that is being transmitted
over the network channel
hi guys and welcome to yet another
interesting video by simply learn but
before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update from us
now without further Ado let's take a
look at the agenda for transport layer
in the osm model
to begin with we will look into what is
an OSI model
moving forward with what is the
transport layer in the OSI model
continuing with the functions available
to the transport layer
and lastly we will look into what is the
TLs in transport layer
now let's take a look what is nosr model
The OSI model is a specifically designed
set of protocols that govern
communication channels through which
network devices share input and data
this task of sharing information is
divided among seven layers of DSi model
for micro level network communication
now let's move on to the core topic for
this session that is what is transport
layer
the transport layer is responsible for
overseeing the data being transmitted
and check there is no error in the data
using different network protocols for
example UDP and TCP
then these data segments are shared over
the connection and non-connection
Network Services
it also identifies suitable
Communication channel for the data
now let's move on to the next heading
that is the functions of Transport layer
before we begin with the actual
functions of the transport layer let's
take a look at the data flow that occurs
between the multiple layers of the SM
model and the transport layer
to begin with the session layer
will share data packets over to the
transport layer where it will be checked
for various errors
or corruption in the data received
it is then transmitted into smaller
units over to the next layer
in between this multiple Protocols are
applied in the transport layer for
example TCP UDP a CTP
and then these data segments are shared
over to the bottom layer
now let's take a look at the functions
available for the transport layer
the first is process to process delivery
multiplexing and deep multiplexing
congestion control
flow control and lastly error control
let's move on with each of them in
detail
the first is process to process delivery
function in this function it is one of
the main tasks of the transport layer
that is designed to effectively deliver
data segments to the correct process
among all the working application over
the sender site
this task applies a 16-bit port number
to identify the sender destination
application correctly to transmit data
over the network channel
now let's move on to the next function
that is multiplexing and demultiplexing
the first term is multiplexing it is
also one of the core tasks of Transport
layer to allow simultaneous use of
multiple networks over the sender side
and this is known as multiplexing
whereas
demultiplexing is executed at the
receiver end to obtain data from
multiple senders application
now let's move on to the next function
that is
congestion control
this function is used to handle traffic
of data in the network model which
arises due to access data being
transmitted over the network channel
the congestion control of data is
handled in two parts
the first is open loop control which is
applied to stop congestion condition in
the network channel
whereas the second control is known as
closed loop control
that is applied to eradicate the
congestion situation in the network
model
now let's move on to the next function
in the transport layer
the next function is known as flow
control
the transport layer performs flow
Management Services in the TCP Network
model in a communication Channel
this channel applies the sliding window
protocol principle
to handle the data flow in the network
model
to know more about the sliding window
protocol principle you can watch our
previous videos
now let's move on to the last function
of the transport layer
the last function of the transport layer
is known as error control
the transport layer also checks errors
in the information received from the
upper layer in the osm model
error detection is performed using the
checksum method or error detecting codes
to check corrupted data
acknowledgment and no acknowledgment
services are used to inform sender if
the receiver has received corrupted or
dams data through the network channel
with this we have cleared all the
functions related to the transport layer
now let's move on to the last setting
for the session
that is what is TLS
TLS stands for transport layer
Securities the TLs service is
responsible for providing enhanced
security to the transport layer in the
network model
to ensure that the external services do
not affect the data being handled in the
transport layer TLS performs a main role
let's take a look at some of the TLs
services in the transport layer
where the first is known as encryption
which performs encryption procedures for
sensitive data being handled in the
layer
next is hidden many of the TLs services
are invisible to the client side and are
only available to the transport layer
for being used in data
compatibility most TLS services are
available for multiple web browser and
are compatible with multiple devices
with this we have created all the points
regarding the transport layer in the SM
model

topic you can ask them in the comment
