so in my almost two uh decades plus
career what I real realized is that
success is not just in terms of the
years of experience what you have spent
industry it's more in terms of being
constantly learning and upskilling
yourselves and be relevant to the
industry so when I look back at my
career journey and evaluate it a little
bit what I see is as I consciously
decided to always keep myself upskilled
and be a continuous learner so that has
also helped me to grow myself from just
an individual contributor to a leader
also and also become a more equipped
person and a professional is what I feel
hi everyone my name is Chandra shakar
and this is my journey uh basically from
Bangalore so a local karda so basically
in terms of Education I have done my
engineering in computer science in my
postgraduation I did in Ms in manipal
University uh in terms of my personal
interest basically I like uh trkking
going out on travel some Wildlife
photography not too much har a little
bit and also I like reading a lot I
started my career almost 21 years back
so I started as an individual
contributor and Technology like Java J2
got an opportunity to work with some
huge Brands organizations clients and
part of being some exciting teams and
being introduction into the software
development life cycle and Engineering
deliverable so that's a little bit about
myself see now coming to Simply learns
is Prince 2 see basically Prince 2 is
about project management how do we uh
govern a project so that it goes towards
a successful outcome uh anybody may ask
you why PR to why not PMP or something
like that but I'm not here to compare
anything else but with my experience in
working with some leaders I found that
they were very well equipped to handle
crisises in a project in very proactive
Manner and they had those principles or
guidelines on which they were making the
execution very smooth and very good
feedback from customers and all those
things so that made me think that of
course I am learning all this I'm
applying all this that's fine but where
where is there an official way of saying
that I'm equipped with this knowledge so
that's where I thought that having a
certification would be an added
Advantage along with the knowledge and
experience of doing a leadership Ro
that's where it all aligned is what I
feel see simply learn is not new to me
but I had been part of a free membership
of Simply learn from almost four to 5
years if I'm right i' I've gone through
so much cataloges of their learning
materials and see that they're very
simple to the point and the experts who
provide those knowledge are really from
the industry background not just
theoretical they have a real good
industry experience which is relevant
and very practical that's what I felt I
mean there there are so many good things
to talk about it the whole experience
itself starting from purchasing the
program till the successful completion
of my certification I found the
experience was very smooth they had a
very competent team in terms of
Technology support faculties
infrastructure everything was up to the
mark and the flexibility in terms of
having the classes taken in such a time
so that your personal life and
professional accomplishers balanced and
even they used to upload the recordings
if in case you couldn't attend for some
personal reason you can still go through
them and the faculties availability was
at the fingertips like if you just don't
have any question you want to go to them
you're welcome anytime through a channel
and there was a self- learning self
testing capabilities in LMS which you
can anytime take and see how ready you
are for the exam so I had my own share
of setbacks and challenges the major one
I would like to mention is like around
2007 when there was a Slowdown it
impacted my job also and I was uh like
exited from a company and a project so
that time it was very difficult to get a
new opportunity and uh it took a while
to get back things to normal but I use
that as an opportunity to become a
better learned or equipped person or a
knowledgeable person I would like to
thank my family who had always been a
strong backbone to whatever I do
whatever good I do so they had their own
uh support system in terms of following
me to work or read or practice late
nights without disturbing my spee days
or time see basically I see that this
industry is definitely going to stay
forever so don't get panicked that okay
I have to earn so much in the show short
time and exit from the indust not not at
all so give an opportunity or a time to
anything and learn deliver do good be
good and mature I'm sure with each
organization change you guys will mature
in terms of what is the reason for
change what is the learning you and what
did you contribute to that uh
organization and how is that solution
you developed is going to help the
society or the humanity at large think
have a bigger Vision have a open broader
mind so with that whatever you do I'm
sure it's good for the Mankind and
continue to do that that's what I would
like to say as a message
