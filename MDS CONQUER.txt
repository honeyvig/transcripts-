yeah hi I'm back here with some more
stuff what I'm going to cover with for
you so today I am going to cover all the
aspects of diseases of pulp that are
very very important in your the final
exam point of view that is neat okay so
today I am just going to highlight only
the stuff which are important an
examination point of view come to the
first part okay the cells are present in
the pulp they are or under blast
fiberglass undifferentiated mesenchymal
cells and the differences and the
question here is the which is the most
common cell which is the most common
cell that is present in the pulp answer
is you can go for the fibroblasts and
which is the second most common cells
that are present in the pulp that answer
is and differentiate and mesenchymal
cells that can be differentiated into
any type of cell okay so please make a
note about the defense's that are
present in the pulp and coming to the
nerves particularly I want to
concentrate much on the nose nose are
very important there are two types of
nerves that are present in the pulp one
is a delta and second is C fibers okay C
fibers are going to be present in the
course so you can remember it as C C and
a delta fibers are the fibers that are
responsible for the pain okay
so they can ask a question like which is
the most fastest fibers that are present
in the dental pulp the answer is a delta
okay in general human body they can ask
two questions one is pulp and one is in
general okay in general the answer is
going to be a alpha and in help the
answer is going to be a delta okay so
please make a note of this the in
general the fastest conducting fibers
are a alpha fibers engine and in the
pulp the fibers are going to conduct the
fastest now impulse or a delta fibers
and a delta fibers are myelinated
whereas C fibers are unmanned later it
means the the rate of conduction will
also be fast in the a delta when
compared to that of the C fibers and
they can ask a question like a spear
as I already told that see fibers are
unmyelinated fibers they are not going
to have any myelin shoot of them
so whenever a lar local anaesthetic is
given the mode of action will be fast in
the see fibers because they are
unmyelinated so that the action will be
fast okay here with the C fibers whereas
with a delta fibers the action will go
very very slow because they have myelin
sheet around them okay
coming to the next is about the
functions of the bulb it anywhere we are
going to go the same stuff in the dental
histology but just make a note of these
points like these are the four functions
of the dental bulb that is in debt to
which helps in differentiation of the
dental lamellae and the enamel are
conformation and form a two it is the
one which induces the formation of the
dentin okay and next is protect to the
sensory receptors with paint will
protect the pulp from all the types of
students in the form of an a pain
whether it is cold heat or anything the
pulp is going to give the response in
the form of an a pain and the next is
like in deck 2 okay next is like defense
ooh and repair a token formation repair
to our ask a rotted dentin the help of
yes now we are going to cover some
ecological etiology that are causing the
pulper diseases according to the
grassman's I just want to stress from
the stuff which are important an
examination point of view if you go in
detail okay you need to cover coming to
the trauma where you need to cover these
classifications and Anderson's
classification of wh-wha and the next
important thing is like that is cracked
tooth syndrome okay the cracked tooth
syndrome is very very important okay it
is nothing but an idiopathic it's
nothing but an idiopathic incomplete
fracture through the body of the lesion
causing mild to severe pain on the
release of the pressure when the
instrument that is used is
tool stone okay you will ask the patient
to bite on this when he is complaining
of any pain
on biding on this then there is some
sort of epical para down that is are
somewhat defecting the pension if the
pain is relieved upon biting on this
then you can suspect it as in a cracked
tooth syndrome and you can suspect or
visualize this cracked tooth syndrome
with a light okay that is a
transamination test where you can see
how the crack is propagating and how the
crack is going indeed into the tendon or
enamel or you can go within a methylene
blue dye or two percenters of iodine
also to to clinically visualize this
crack apart from these there are many
other diagnostic tests but these are the
parameters where the power sector is
going to concentrate and come to the
teeth okay coming to the treatment point
of view of this cracked tooth syndrome
the pulp in this teeth may become
necrotic okay we can't account
differentiate whether it is a normal
apartment we need to go for the pulp
vitality test where you need to
differentiate whether it's it is
necrotic or I mean it's vital or non
whiten if the tooth is not completely
fractured a full crown restoration is
recommended if tooth is factored
involving the pulp then you need to go
for root canal treatment followed by the
post and round restoration so the next
category is barometric changes which are
associated with the pressure changes a
very important note is they can
encounter when there is a change above
5000 okay there is a change about 5000
they can encounter but preferably means
most commonly you can see this only
above 10,000 so these are two MCQs most
commonly this complaint is seen only
about 10,000 feet okay there will be
chronic pulpitis which leading to the
adverse conditions so the next is a
thermal thermal that is heat produced
from the captive preparation that's the
reason why we use the water coolant to
prevent this an exothermic heat from the
setting cements many of the setting
cements they release exothermic heat so
whenever
we need to we need to go with these we
need to go for the protectants okay
conducting of the heat through the deep
feelings without any product two ways
there will be chances of this
transmission of this thermal
confessional heat generated by polishing
with the registration particularly
amalgam registration okay
amalgam where any registration seed is
generated so necessary steps to be taken
to prevent this heat generation so the
next is chemicals that are phosphoric
acid or acrylic monomers or air erosion
which is called geo to the chemicals so
we need to take care of this the net is
like bacteria that stock since release
from the carries or direct invasion of
the pulp from the from the carries or by
the drama and this peculiar word is very
very important we'll learn it in the
next step so this is retrograde
infection whatever is coming is ortho
grid
okay ortho grade means directly from the
enamel dentin and involving the bulk
retrograde is reverse okay reverse is
retrograde and these retrograde
infections associated with the pulp are
holders named endo pareo lesions okay
we'll have a separate class on this end
of the relations a meanwhile you just
try to know what is a retrograde in
ortho grid okay retrograde he is from
the this direction and ortho grade will
be same goes with like retrograde
filling ortho grid filling orthogonal
filling retrograde filling we will be
with MDA okay so next is like I don't
like we're going to discuss about this
is all about like bacteria bacteria
gaining access through the vascular's
mostly this is the definition and it is
not mcq bacteria graining the access
through the vascular changes okay next
next heat produced during the cavity
preparations make a note that heat
generated by grinding process of the
tooth structure is one of the greatest
single cause of the pulper damage okay
so there should be a care bear is a good
histological vasodilatation that and
increasing in the interoperable
temperature of about 20 degrees for heat
may resulting in a reversible pulpit
so make a note whenever the temperature
changes about 24 feet then there is a
chances of irreversible pulpitis means
the bulb can not be reverse back it has
less than this there can be reversible
by this after some times the pulp can
reverse back and next is impression
making impression making due to the
negative pressure I mean there are many
types of impression making but due to
the negative pressure there will be some
sort of pressure that is developed
resulting in the Orient of plastic
aspiration ok leading to the
inflammation so this is the case the
negative pressure concept is a reason
behind the inflammation of the pulp so
these are some of the disorders that are
also sated with the animal and dentin
which lead to the purple infection that
is transmittances invaginate residence
in Bosnia - some denser resonators
please make a note of these and this is
a radical or lingual groove ok peridot
peridot ginger will grow which is most
common in the case hopefully this is
most common the case of namond maxillary
central whereas in a parrot or ginger
group with the groove extending below
the gingival and rendering the pulp that
is most common in the case of a neck
lateral incisor maxillary lateral
incisor and some sort of orthodontic
moments can cause a sparkle damage some
some periodontal therapies can cause
purple damage and these are very
important in examination point of view
that is sickle cell anemia and we know
that the sickle cell anemia the normal
half-life of an RPC is 120 days whereas
in sickle cell anemia it will be in and
around 30 to 40 days it's less okay 30
to 40 days and same goes with a sickle
cell anemia sickle cell anemia the most
common finding
pulper status of a sickle cell anemia is
without any like clinical evidence of
enamel carries or intentional carriers
of a deep lesion you can see that you
can see the necrotic pulp means without
any lesion the tooth will be very
perfect but
the teeth on why daddy will be non
whiten so there is a peculiar feature of
sickle-cell anemia
means there will be microvascular racial
damage inside the bulb and leading to
the necrosis of the pump means the pump
doesn't response to the white oddity in
the case of sickle-cell anemia
same goes with the HEPA source to
infection have purged infection there
will be at a geminal ganglion means a
hat persuade she is going to be much
concentrated the trigeminal now and we
know that the rhizome nanou is the now
that that sensory that gives a sense it
is applied for many of the teeth so
through this gangly on it may sometimes
leads to the damage of multiple bumpity
for example the trigeminal had preserved
his infection is there so the nose or
the nerve which is supplying all that
peep a particular group of teeth all the
teeth the pom-pom encloses can occur I
mean it's not in all the cases but it
can be okay it can be same goes with the
HIV the dental pulp from a patient with
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as
examined to determine the presence of
human immunodeficiency virus the results
found a higher concentration of an a pro
viral HIV DNA okay and the fibroblast
has been implicated as a major reservoir
for HIV in the body and please make a
note this is a very very important point
and I have seen an obscure Asian face in
PGA coming to the pathophysiology is
very important as they have covered few
MCQs in APG 2016 okay so we'll learn
something related to this is very
important concept okay so coming to the
vascular changes that occur when palpate
is initially started okay so so the main
reason of the pain for the pain in the
pulp is due to the pulp is a closed
encapsulated structure with the pressure
increases which leads to the pain so
this is a simple logic and measuring the
blood flow in the dental pulp is a
difficult procedure okay during a blood
flow in a closed cavity is a difficult
procedure but Kim at all reported 40
percent is okay 40 percent is increasing
in the blood flow in a moderately
inflamed up
okay but 35% is reduction in the
peripheral necrotic pulp okay so this is
very important this is in a study that
was done in the rats so logically
whenever there is whenever there is
increasing in the blood flow means if
the pulp is inflamed there will be
definitely increase in the blood flow as
well as there will be increasing the
pressure in the inflamed pulp means pulp
can be vital it may be reversible or
irreversible and second thing is like
completely necrotic necrotic there will
be reduction in the pressure or the
reduction in the blood flow there will
be no blood if it is necrotic so this is
the primary concept that you need to
learn from this and followed by the
interstitial fluid pressure okay so
these all are MCQs which are there in
your dental pulse or any sort of mcq
books so please try to concentrate on
this the healthy dental pulp has an
interstitial pressure of five to ten
this is the star mcq phi - 10 mm rhe one
of the key changes during the
inflammation is a movement of the fluids
from within the cavity capillaries I
mean from within the capillaries to the
interstitial space by the law of physics
increasing the amount of the fluid in a
rigid chamber the rigid chamber is
nothing but an encapsulated foam leading
to increasing in the pressure the reason
for the activation of the nose and the
pain in during the pulpitis is
increasing the pressure such a pressure
raise in the pulp would cause
compression of the blood vessels and
leading to the vascular statuses and
further necrosis of the pump so this
table is started okay this is a star
table the many questions from this table
from 2016 and 2015 or and Axl so first
what is the pressure in the normal pump
the pressure in the normal pump is
around 8 to 5 mm of head G or in and
around like 8 10 mm of head G in the
case of reversible pulpitis
it is 13 mm of Ag in the case of
irreversible pulpitis it is thirty four
point five mm of Ag in the case of non
vital dehydrated it will be negative
it will be sucked so it will be negative
so just go through these clinical
considerations and the nature of the
pulp okay but these values are very very
important an examination point of view
in response to the toxins and injury the
afferent fibers in the trigeminal
ganglion reaches two important
neurotransmitters okay
the two neurotransmitters are the system
P and the calcitonin gene related
peptides okay this is Comet k201 Phi
question so please make a note of these
two neurotransmitters that are reason
that is released okay both both these
causes the vasodilation and increasing
the permeability leading to the engaging
in the powerful pressure causing the
compression of the veins and Stratasys
and necrosis coming to the
classification I just want to finish the
things fast okay basing upon the
severity and according to the
involvement coming basing upon the
severity it can be reversible which can
be reversed back immediately after the
stimulus is removed basing up next is
irreversible the reverse which cannot
reverse backs once the stimulus is
removed there will be generations means
make for a pulp degenerative changes
starting and the necrosis and bay
reversible can be one is like
symptomatic and second is asymptomatic
okay means symptoms means the pains will
be present the symptomatic there will be
no sort of any symptoms irreversible can
be acute again abnormal response to the
cold an abnormal response to the heat
and irreversible can be chronic that is
asymptomatic with palpable exposure and
hyperplastic chronic hyperplastic
pulpitis that is nothing but fall polyp
and internal resorption too and pulp
degeneration that is calcifications and
pulp necrosis according to the
involvement according to the extent and
according to the severity and according
to the presence or absence of direct
communication with a gentle pulp and the
oral an oral amend this is one of the
important thing according to the extent
they can be focal or sub total or
partial pulpitis total or generalized
pulpitis according to the severity acute
chronic
and according to the presence or options
of communication that can be open pulp
ideas or closed pulpitis these two words
are very important in pep Rosetta really
like these typical words and palpable
diseases coming to the cross pens
classification very important we have
already discussed about this in the
previous video but now I am going to
concentrate much and give importance
because this is one really the paper set
is like okay hot tooth
I already already make another hot tooth
generally represents to the pump that
has been diagnosed as irreversible
vampiress means definitely there is a
need of root canal treatment with the
spontaneous to modern pain a classical
example of one type of hot tooth is a
patient who is sitting in your in your
waiting room okay who is completely or
who is keep on taking a ice cube ok cool
water or keeping an ice cube on the
tooth surface to control the pain this
is this is a peculiar thing peculiar
thing that you can see like this is the
only thing that can give the relief to
the patient even even an analgesic or
even a local anesthetic cannot relieve
only only a cool water can relieve the
pain and few consideration should be
kept in mind with the teeth diagnosed as
in a symptomatic irreversible pulpitis
whether adequate local anesthesia has
been achieved before the treatment is
important so whatever like why we want
to proceed if we want to proceed to the
root canal treatment definitely a
necessity and anesthetic effort is
required and that is the first
consideration where you need to take a
tangent during the hot dog the first
consideration should be change the local
anesthetic agent logically we use lick
no kind right so what to change is the
next question the next strategy would be
change the injection technique
attempting to block the inferior no okay
okay the next is like either we need to
change the local anesthesia or either we
need to change the injection method
okay so accessory nerves can have been
implicated as a potential reason for the
failure of the vasa construction before
inferior block before going the die
JustGive explain like what are the
reason for the carpet
okay it is due to the accessory
receptors that are present that is T t
ax okay show diem generally with sodium
channels are the channels that are
responsible for the early action but
these the typical receptors which are
additional receptors they cannot get
sensitized with the local anesthetic
with the normal lead or kind local
anesthetic so to anesthetize these
channels we need an accessory that is
either we need to go for an F article
our boobie what kind either we need to
go for these two local anesthetics which
has a better action on this TTA X sodium
channels when compared with the normal
sodium channels and increasing in the
volume of the local anesthetic delivery
during the eye a and B block has been
found not increasing in the incidence of
the pulp al and ste share if you don't
have a proper where there is no point of
getting yesterday's how much local
anesthesia a view
they will not I mean these receptors
will not get any stress the
supplementary injection techniques are
the intra ligament area injection
technique please make a note of this
diagram this diagram is very important
to notice previously asked as a diagram
based question in one of the exam the
success of the supplementary para dental
injection in helping for in achieving
the anesthesia for endodontic procedure
has been reported to be in the range of
50 percentage to 96 percent days and
next is an interosseous okay
interosseous injection uses 1.8 ml of
two percenters of lidocaine with one is
to one lakh epinephrine and has a
ninety-one percent success rate and the
mandibular buckling filtration injection
with article okay
that again is a word you need to catch
it and the last lastly sort of infection
is in a interoperable injection and the
next thing is like the chronic
hyperplastic polyp is already discussed
in today's exam too so chronic have
agnostic malpractice is called as in a
pulp polyp one pet is virtual
okay causes may be due to the deeper
extent to carious lesion leading to the
exposure of the egg bulb it is most
commonly seen in the case of may
children and and and development of a
granulation tissue covered by epithelium
resulting from a long stand low-grade
infection it is a long standard
infection and it is low layered
infection these are the peculiar words
of the chronic hyperplastic polyp eiders
usually the symptoms symptoms except
during the medication there will be some
sort of discomfort due to the pressure
that is applied on the vulva a diagnosis
most commonly involved the deciduous
molars and the first permanent molars of
the children lengths polypoid tissue
easily bleeds so a bleeding is in a
peculiar feature of this there will be
very I mean chronic - last pulpitis the
blood vessels will be very high so it
bleeds fast and the nose will be very
less so it doesn't pain and the tooth
may responds or not at all to the
terminus sometimes the pulp will be
white up sometimes and the more current
then the normal current is required to
elicit the pain so the differential
diagnosis is a is a perforating gingival
tissue that is nothing but a changeable
polyp which injured polyp doesn't bleeds
whereas an hyperplastic pulpitis means
pulp polly blitzer - the first
difference the second difference is
whenever you want to diagnose the pulp
polyperchon jowl polyp you need to go at
the starting point means the stack of
the lesion I mean the origin of the
lesion so once you go over the once you
go for the staff you will get an idea
okay it's coming from the gingiva so it
is a ginger will bonnet it's coming from
the pulpits a panful pollen and the
management is the elimination of the
polypoid tissue that is nothing but a
root canal treatment and followed by the
expectation of the pulp and perfecta me
have plastic tissue bleeds and
can be controlled by pressure or if the
tooth structure is very very weak and
you can because as the lesions are very
deep and open cavities so chances of
post hundred-degree situation will be
very less so in such situations basing
upon the prognosis you can go for the
extraction
so prognosis is favorable after ended
all the treatment but we need to see the
amount of tooth structure that is left
the next is internal resorption it is an
idiopathic slow or fast progressing
resort to process occurring in the
dentin of the pulp chamber of the root
canal the causes can be can be history
of trauma okay can be a stray of trauma
and the symptoms asymptomatic completely
manifested as in a reddish area called a
sniping spot okay pin spot are just
corners may pink teeth is internal
resorption there is one more word like
pink disease okay pink disease is make
your poisoning so pink t these internal
desorption and pink disease is mercury
poisoning can also be called as mischief
disease okay so just we'll learn it when
we are dealing with in a heavy metal
poisoning and the diagnosis is is it's
very slow it's very slow you can see the
internal resorption i mean there is
slight the communication externally but
it's an internal resorption case slow or
it may develop rapid and may cause
perforation here i mean in this in this
it can it can perforated because they're
very thin walls missile and distilling
the radiographer and it's most commonly
in the maxillary anteriors why if it is
if anyone is asking the reason that is
trauma even ridiculous cyst is also most
common in the mandibular interior's
because of the trauma and diagnose
during the routine radiographic
examinations because the patient is not
going to have any symptoms or any sort
of things the first symptom that a
patient can encounter is
is a pink color teeth okay that's what
he can complain but occasionally we can
see this on the radiographic because and
the thickness is during the rector in
radiographic examination and the pink
spot occurs in the latter stages okay
that a patient can recognize
radiographically there will be round to
all radiolucent areas and the thing you
need to concentrate value are going with
an internal resorption or explanation
because these teeth okay this state
right now in the IOP is very typical you
can't diagnose it definitely it started
as an internal resorption but it
communicates extra min to differentiate
it you need to apply slow brutal means
first of all you need to take a
radiograph okay you need to identify the
lesion whether it is encountering the
periphery and second thing is like you
need to change the angulation is you
need to go for a meal or a digital view
so once you go in for a me shall we is
there any change in this resolution see
if these radial lucency is moving is
moving in a different direction or it
moving in our direction then you can
diagnose it as an external resorption if
it is still in the same place if it is
still in the truth's itself then you can
diagnose it as an internal desorption so
please make a note you can use slope
Rufus and the differential diagnosis is
yes obviously external resorption you
can differentiate the external or
internal desorption by using this slope
will already discussed come into the
management first of all you need to
remove the irritant you need to remove
the irritant or the etiology that is
causing this resorption the irritant is
pump so first of all in the first
appointment you will expect all the
remove the pulp all the pump
analytical treatment request / disease
gotta watch your technique okay this is
a type of observation technique because
generally like root canal would have an
attacker will have an attack tapper
I mean biomechanical preparation whereas
in the case of this peculiar internal
resorption original resorption you will
have in a different morphology of a
different way of BMP so for such things
you can't go for a normal garbage are
lateral condensation technique so it is
better to go for a plasticizer
but your technique and sometimes it can
communicate externally as we discussed
so at that time you need some sort of
empty air and best-before perforation of
the tooth I mean after if it is
communicated externally so the chances
of the prognosis will be less the next
is the pulper degeneration which can be
seen in the case of an older individuals
as we already discussed the pulp storms
or one of the signs of the degenerative
changes and which can be seen after 50
years of a general results of persistent
mild irritation in the teeth of an egg
pulp in early stages normal two vital
tests and are not discolored and as
degenerative progresses the pulp will
not respond and there will be
discoloration
next is the calcifications we already
discussed the pulp stones denticles
these are raisins which causes
calcifications okay and the pulp stones
you can see the pulp stones here there
are three types of old stones one is
free attached and embedded these pulp
stones a symptomatic or asymptomatic and
and it will increasing the size as as
progress is very important one size of
pulp stones will increases because the
parents initially started as a thin I
mean a small knobs on which there will
be deposition of the calcium and it
grows in size as it increases it goes on
increasing in the size next is diffuse
linear classification okay these are not
much important okay but make a note and
this is very important where where are
the pulp stones seen pal stones have
seen in the case of net dentin dysplasia
type fun peculiarly in type 2 2 and in
purple dysplasia 2 and in a multiple
perps stone sourcing in the case of
rubber man
little pulp stones okay this is very
very important I'm secure and the Red
Cross is nothing but a depth of the pump
may be partial or totally depending upon
whether the part or the entire pump is
involved the causes can be a sequel of
inflammatory reaction but these two
words are very important there is a
coagulative necrosis and liquefaction
necrosis coagulative necrosis is a
soluble portion of the tissue that is
precipitated or converted into a solid
material whereas liquefaction necrosis
is resulted when a proteolytic and gems
convert the tissue into soft and mass
liquid or an amorphous Tabriz clinical
features there will be no pain because
it was already degenerated and the
discoloration of the teeth indicated in
the pulp death diagnosis radiograph
shows a thick laminate aura this is very
important and vitality obviously the
vitality
there will be no response to the
vitality management is a root canal
treatment followed by the oxidation of
the canals and sound with a proper ended
on to treatment these are my references
I have taken the references from this
stuff and thank you I think we covered
as much as stuff as possible in the case
of Anna diseases of pulp in examination
point of view and rest over we are going
to solve in our discussion part ok thank
you all have a good day
