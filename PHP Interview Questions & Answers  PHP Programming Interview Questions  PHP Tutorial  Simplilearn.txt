hey guys and a very warm welcome to
simply learn in this video we'll discuss
some of the frequently asked questions
in php interviews
now the questions are categorized in two
sections beginner and advanced questions
so without any further ado let us get
started with the beginner questions
now the most basic question
is what is php
so php stands for hypertext preprocessor
it is a server-side scripting language
that is embedded into html and is
generally used for dynamic web
development
php is also a very compatible language
that is it also works efficiently with
almost 20 different databases such as
mysql post resequal etc
next question
what is a session in php
now sessions in php are used to store
data for users under a unique id which
can be then used across multiple web
pages of a website
next what is peer in php now peer
stands for php extension and application
repository
it is a framework and repository for the
reusable components focus on reusable
components of php containing code
snippets and libraries
next
is php considered a case sensitive
language so this is a very often asked
questions in interviews
so php is partially case sensitive since
variables in php are case sensitive
while functions and user defined
functions are not
next
name different types of data types in
php
so different data types in php include
integer float
string
boolean
array object
null and finally resource so there are
total eight different data types that
exist in php
next question
how is echo different from print
now echo it can output multiple strings
at a time while in case of print it can
output only a single string
now echo does not have a return value
while print always returns one
that is the reason that is echo is
faster because it does not have to
return a value
while it is print is slower in
comparison to echo because it always
returns a value now as you can see
both of these commands echo and print
are used in the exact same way
next
what are the rules for naming a variable
now there are certain rules which you
have to follow or certain
good coding practices which you have to
follow while naming a variable in your
php code
so variable name must always begin with
underscore or a letter so it cannot
begin with a number or a special
character for that matter next variable
names can include numbers but not
special characters so suppose you want
to name your variable number one to
three so you can use this variable but
you cannot use number at the read one
two three since special characters are
not included
next a variable in php is declared using
this dollar sign followed by the
variable name
now as you can see this is how we
declare a variable dollar my underscore
variable you can also put a number in
between or at the end while naming a
variable just not at the start
next
name some popular php frameworks so some
of the popular php frameworks include
symphony codeigniter cake php and
laravel
moving on how to check if a defined
variable is null or not
so is a thank function is used to check
if the defined variable has any value or
not so to use this suppose you have this
block of code in front of you so
suppose you want to check if this x
variable that you've defined is null or
not so what you do is you put the is it
function inside the if condition
and it will return true if it's
not null
while it will return false
if it is a null value since it is not
null it returns true and we can display
echo as variable x is not null while in
the case of variable y it is a null
value synth so
the if condition will be false and it
will not display anything
next
how are objects in php passed so objects
in php are always passed by value not by
reference
next question
how to display output directly to the
browser now
in cases you want to display your output
directly onto the browser while running
a piece of code you can use it use
these special tags
to display an output directly to the
browser now as you may notice
these tags does not contain the php
written you can use them directly and
replace php with an equal to sign
followed by what you want to display and
end it with a question mark and a
closing bracket
moving on
what is defined function used for in php
now define is used to declare a constant
in php
also in contrast to the variables
there's no need for a dollar sign before
declaring a constant since the value of
a constant does not change
this is how you can use the defined
function to declare a constant suppose
you want to declare the value of pi
as 3.14 throughout your php code and
which cannot be changed so we can use
define for that
next question is related to this
question since
what is constant function in useful in
php then so constant function returns
the value of a constant it is not used
to define a constant but it returns the
value of a constant so
suppose you define a function constant
using this defined function and you want
to return this value
you can use this constant
function for that
next
is multiple inheritance supported in php
so php only supports single level
inheritance which means a class can be
extended from only one class using the
keyword extended
next
what are the different types of loops in
php so php consists of a while loop
a do while loop a for loop and finally
up for each loop so php consists of
total for loops
next question
how to concatenate two strings in php
now
two strings can be easily concatenated
using the dot operator in php now to do
that
i'll show you with the help of a code
suppose you want to concatenate or join
these two strings str1 hello guys and
the second string would be and welcome
to simply learn and want to display
these strings together so to do that you
need to use this dot operator in echo as
you can see
this dot operator so first you write
this name of the first string then
followed by the dot operator i've given
this space
and then the next order operator because
this is also going to considered as a
string and then the third string
variable
and this is how you concatenate two
strings
next question what is the use of
function num ar argument
now this function as you can see
is used to return the number of
arguments pass in a function
so suppose you pass a certain number of
arguments in a function and want to know
how many
values or arguments for past
you can use this function for that so
suppose
in this sample code you want to know how
many
arguments were passed in this
sample function so to do that we declare
a variable number of arguments and we
will equal it to the function of number
function number argument
now we will display it
and this sample has passed three
arguments so the output would be three
moving on
what are super global variables in php
now some predefined variables in php are
known as super global variables because
they are always accessible from any
function file or class regardless of
this code so in all in all they are
globally accessible so suppose you write
a piece of code and you declare a
variable inside it it would be a local
variable and could be accessed only in
that part of the code but in case of
super global variable they are
accessible throughout the entire code
they include
global server requests posts get files
enb cookie and session
moving on
how to invoke single line and multi-line
comments
now a single line comment in php can be
made using this hash followed by the
comment or
double slash followed by the comment
while in case of multi-line comments you
can use this hash star and write your
comments in multiple lines and enclose
it with a star and slash
what i'm going to do now is i am going
to show you
the
use of these comments in actual vs code
now let us take this block of code for
example now suppose you want
to add a com single line comment after
this variable so what you will do is
you can use this double slash
this
is
a
variable
also you can use
slash
this is also a
variable so this is a single line
comment now if you try to write
something else after this in the next
line it will take it as part of the code
not part of the comment
so what do you do
when you need to write multiple lines of
comment so suppose
you need to write two three lines about
this
line of code what you'll do is you'll
use a slash
star
now write the comment
this
is
displaying
simply learn
so this is a three line comment which
you can end simply
by star and a slash
this is how you write single line and
multi-line comments now let's move on to
the next question that is
name some common applications of php so
some of the
most commonly used php applications are
system functions
firm handling so php is very commonly
used to handle the forms that you see on
the web pages
cred tasks now crud tasks are create
read update and delete so when you will
be working with databases this is a very
important part of using databases that
is crud and php is used very commonly in
that next accessing cookies variables
and set keys
and finally data encryption php provides
security through some of its frameworks
which can be used
and is used very commonly throughout a
lot of websites
so now that we have gone through the
beginner level questions that are
frequently asked in php interviews let
us now move on to the advanced level
questions
so
the first question would be how can you
execute a php script from the command
line now a php script from a command
line can be executed by by opening the
command line
and inside the command line you have to
specify the name of the script or name
of the php file that you want to run
suppose you want to run a php underscore
script.php
so you type in the name
of the php script that you want to run
and that particular php script will be
executed
next
differentiate between a dollar variable
and double dollar variable so what is
the difference between the two
now in case of a single dollar variable
is it is a simple variable that is
simply used to store data so as we
discussed earlier
it is a variable that we defined to
store different data types such as
integer float strings etc while a double
dollar variable is a reference variable
of variable so
this is used to reference already
existing variables
now to use
or to understand how these two work
you can see this particular block of
code here now in this code what you need
to focus on is this is a simple variable
hello which contains the string welcome
to learn and we have defined another
variable as where
which contains a string hello now in
this
echo as you can notice what we are doing
is we are using this
also before that you need to notice is
this is
the same string as the name of this
variable so first we are displaying this
variable
and then we are referencing this
variable here
so what it is doing is it is referencing
the value to another variable so hello
variable is being referenced so
when you execute this block of php
script what you get the output is hello
since this is the variable hello and
after that what you'll
get is welcome to simply learn since
this variable is a reference to this
variable
next
differentiate between get and post
method
now
get method is used to submit form data
while post method is also used for the
same feature
so the difference between them is get
method sends data as part of php page
url
sorry web page url while a post method
sends data through http header
in get
the data since the data has been sent
through the url it is displayed in the
url of the web page so it is not secure
while in case of post method it is a
secure form of
data transfer
hence
when developing a website for some
security purposes
usually we prefer post method
next up
how to connect to a database using a php
script
now suppose
if you
are asked this question in an interview
what you need to do is you need to just
write this block of code and explain it
to the interviewer now suppose we have a
php script
and we want to connect it to a database
what we need to do is we will create
three different
variables that is server name username
and password now
what we're going to do is we will create
another variable con that will be used
to connect it and then we'll use the
mysqli functions which will then pass
these variables to create a connection
so these variable values are localhost
username password these are the default
values now to check if the connection is
connected
what we're going to do is we will
use an if condition
if the con variable
gets and connect error we will display a
error message that is connection field
if not we will display connected
successfully
now as you can see here
these names can be the name of the
server that you're trying to connect i
have used localhost username password
for the default values you can use the
name of the database that you're trying
to connect your php script to
next up
what does final class and final method
mean in php
now a final class in php means that the
class cannot be extended
while a final method means that it
cannot be overridden
now as you can see in this block of code
we have used the final keyword for a
class and the final keyword for a
function now suppose
this final class is
being inherited by this child class what
the program will return is an error
because once you use this final keyword
this class can not be inherited and
similarly
suppose this function is trying to be
overridden
by this part of the code
it cannot be because we have used the
final function
next question
differentiate between function
overloading and overriding
now function overloading the same
function is used for different purposes
based on the number of arguments inside
the function while in case of function
overriding
the same name and same argument function
is used in parent and child class
respectively to change the behavior of
parent class method now let me show you
and demonstrate the difference with an
example
so
let us look at this code so suppose you
have a function named show title which
does have contain a single parameter and
displays when called upon using this
parameter displays function1
now if you want to use the same
name of the function for a different
purpose what you can do is you can
increase or change the number of
parameters inside the function that is
it now contains two parameters so when
the same function is called using two
parameters it will function differently
and display function overloading so this
is how function overloading works
next from this piece of code we can
understand
function overriding suppose you display
a function demo in a base class and you
want to override this demo function
inside the
derived class so what you do is you make
another function with the same name
inside the derived class with some
different properties as you can see it
displays something different
now you create an object for the base
class and when you use this base class
object to call this demo function you
can use the properties of this function
here while if you create another object
that is object 2 for the derived class
and you use this object to call upon the
same demo function
you are overriding this base class demo
function that was inherited instead what
it will use is it will use the
properties of the derived demo function
so that is how you overload or override
a class
function in php now let's move on to the
next question that is differentiate
between equal to equal to and triple
equal operator
so a double equal operator is generally
used to check if the value of two
operands are equal or not it is
generally used in case of conditional
statements
while a triple equals to operator
performs a type save comparison which
means that will that it will only return
true if both operands have the same type
and the same value
so
you can understand this more with this
piece of code so suppose
in this case
since they both are equal it will return
true
while in this case they both have the
same
type hence it will return true now
let us
next check this equals to equal so since
they both are one and in php it will
display as true since they are equal
while
when you are type checking that is you
are checking if they're equal with the
same type and same value it will display
a false since one is an integer and the
other one is a string value
also if you check two different strings
with the type save it will also display
true
next question
how does exception handling work in php
so when an exception is thrown
code following the statement will not be
executed and php will attempt to find
the first matching catch block so if an
exception is not caught a php fatal
error will be issued with an uncaught
exception an exception can be thrown and
caught within php
so what we do is we use this try and
catch
method to
try the code and if an error occurs we
can catch
if an exception occurs we can throw it
and the catch function will catch
the exception and if doesn't we do not
include the catch function it will
result in a fatal error
next up
differentiate between require and
include
now require if a required file is not
found it will throw a fatal error and
stop the code execution while in case of
include if an essential file is not
found it will produce a warning and
still execute the remaining scripts so
as you can see both of these include and
require i use in the exact same way with
different functions next up
explain different types of errors in php
now php consists of mainly three errors
notice
warning and a fatal error now notice is
a non-critical error which means that
something minor went wrong during
execution and
a lot of times you just don't pay
attention to it
a warning is a critical error now it is
given in condition where suppose an
include function
that we just discussed in the previous
question
then to retrieve a non-existent file so
suppose you use an include function and
the file does not exist it will display
a warning and final is a fatal error so
it is a critical error resulting in
termination of the code so as we discuss
in the try and catch part of the
question if an exception is thrown and
we do not have a catch function for it
it will display a fatal error which will
return in termination of the code
next question
how to call a function by a reference so
ampersand sign is used to call a
function by reference now in case of
reference the actual value is modified
if the value passed inside the function
is also modified while in case of value
the
value of the original
value does not change
so this piece of code here is
an example of how you can call a
function by reference here as you can
see this ampersand sign will call this
function by reference and any changes
made in the variables here will affect
the original ones next question
create a singleton class in php so how
do we create a singleton class in ph
before that let's have a look at what is
a singleton class now a singleton class
in php is a class that can have only one
object and hence provides only a single
point of access so in generally
generally in class you can create as
many objects as you want and it will in
turn create
different access points into that block
of code
so in a singleton class you can only
create a single object hence
singleton
so this piece of code as you can notice
is used to create a singleton class
now in to create a singleton class
you need to have the constructor
function private
now here
as you can see a singleton class is
created using this private construct
and it then checks
if there's only one instance created and
if it is
it functions properly and displays
initialize only once
next question
how to encrypt a password using php so
php
can be used for encryption techniques
now the password underscore hash
function creates a hash password from
the password string using hashing
algorithm so suppose
you create a password string and enter
your password as password at the right
one two three and you put it inside the
password has hash function
so what it will generate is we are
echoing this generated hash
so what it will generate is
this so this is the this is random it
changes every time you generate the
password since it is encrypted and
same when you pass
this password to the database using
hashing algorithm even in the database
the password will not be visible so your
data is secure
next question
mention different sorting functions for
errors in php now let us understand this
question in the vs code so php consists
of different sorting functions which you
can use to sort and give an array
automatically so if you want to sort an
array in ascending order what you need
to do is use this sort function so it
will sort this array in ascending order
now if you want to sort it in descending
order
use our sort that is reverse sort
similarly suppose you want to
sort an array in terms of value in
ascending order so you need to use a
sort function that is this
so in terms of value what in terms of
value means is suppose in a given error
there are keys and values so it will
sort the array based on the values that
is this 22 27 and 37 so the array will
be the same since
the values are already sorted
now if you want to sort the array in
according to key that is this
you can use k sort that is key sort
function that is provided in php so in
case of key sort
what it does is it will sort the array
in key that is the first one would be d
that is duke second m mac and the third
r that is raw
now if you want to sort
this
array
in descending order in terms of value
you use instead of a sort you use a
reverse sort
similarly if you want to sort an array
in terms of key
in descending
you use k instead of k sort k r sort
that is k reverse sort so these are the
different sorting functions that are
inbuilt into php moving on
what will be the output of the following
code now
if this code is given
let me give you some time and try to
pause this video and think of what will
be the output of the following code
so the output of this code will be 21
comma 21 or 2 1 comma 2 1
how did it happen
but before that if you got it correct
congratulations
but if you want to understand it see
a is a variable that contains the value
1 while a b is a variable that is
getting the value of a variable through
reference
now we make changes in the b variable
with 2
followed by this variable again which is
calling the value of a by reference so
if we make changes here we also make
changes in the value of a now if we
display this since the value of a is
already changed by reference it will
display 2 1 that is the value here and
again since the value of b is already 2
1 it will again display 2 1.
moving on
what are construct function and destruct
function in php so a constructor or
construct function is automatically
invoked when a new object of a class is
created and then can be used to
initialize value in class
so when you create a object
an object for a class a constructor
function is automatically invoked
but this can also be so it does not
contain any value when it is invoked but
you can also use this construct function
to initialize some properties to give
some properties to the class
which will act as its default properties
if nothing or
no new properties are given to the class
next is a destruct now a distract is
automatically invoked when an object of
a class is destructed suppose you end
the part of the code of a class you want
you are destroying the object when
you're ending the piece of code a
destruct function is automatically
invoked to clean up the resources
next
is how can php and javascript interact
now php and javascript can not directly
interact with each other since php is a
server-side scripting language while
javascript is a client-side language
but there is a way that these two
wonderful languages can interact with
each other so we can swap variables
since php can produce javascript code to
be implemented by the browser so yes you
can produce javascript code from php
which can then be implemented by a
browser and then it is probable to pass
those precise variables back to php
via a url next question is
explain type hinting in php
now in php type hinting is used to
specify the expected data type that is
array object interface etc for an
argument in a function declaration
now during a function call suppose if
arguments does not match the expected
data type the run time will display an
error and the probe that is a fatal
error and the program will then
terminate now in this code here what we
are doing is we are type hinting so this
is this code is for string type hinting
and this code is for integer type
hinting now if these
particular set of functions that have
already specified the type they are
expecting does not
receive the same type of variable inside
them the
program will return in a fatal error and
it will terminate so
moving on to our final question of this
video
write a class so yes this is a an
assignment a kind of assignment for you
guys so what you need to do is you need
to write a class to solve the following
question which i'm going to say so
implement a class named basketball we
all like basketball right so implement a
class name basketball with an attribute
named baskets so you have to create an
attribute name basket and initialize it
to 0 as the starting position
and then
create a method name score now when the
score method is invoked the baskets must
increase by 1. so let's see the solution
now so this is how you create a class
that is basketball
now
inside this class what we are going to
do is we are going to initialize the
number of baskets that is this variable
as 0 as the starting position so to do
that what we're going to do is we will
be using construct function as we
discussed to initialize some
default properties for the class
so this construct function is
used to initialize this basket's
variable to 0. now suppose we do not
call this function score which is
increasing the number of baskets the
default value will be displayed as 0
every time now suppose we invoke this
core function every time a basket is
code
this will increase the number of baskets
by one
so this is pretty simple and this is how
you create a simple class which will
perform
the following question
