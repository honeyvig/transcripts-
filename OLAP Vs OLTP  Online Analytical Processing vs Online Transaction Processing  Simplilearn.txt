online analytical processing olap and
online transaction processing in short
oltp are two popular database systems
that have evolved separately to serve
distinct purposes while both systems
offer data storage and retrieval
capabilities they differ significantly
in terms of their architecture data flow
and performance characteristics olap is
designed specifically for data analysis
and Reporting while oltp is designed for
online transaction processing such as
online banking inventory management and
order processing olap is optimized for
analyzing large volumes of data and
Reporting metrics while oltp is
optimized for quickly processing
individual transactions there are many
other differences between these two
crucial data processing systems so in
this video we'll be discussing the major
differences between these two and how
you can Implement these in large
transaction processing systems so
without any further Ado let's get
started also if you're an aspiring data
analyst looking for online training and
certifications from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply lands postgraduate program and
data analysis from Purdue University in
collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details use the
link in the description box below and
with that in mind over to our training
experts
approaches stand out in data processing
and data analysis online analytical
processing that is olap and online
transactional processing oltp although
they share the common goal of handling
data these methodologies differ
significantly in their purpose data
structure performance characteristics
and design principles olap is a powerful
tool for organizations seeking to
extract valuable insights from vast
volumes of historical data its
multi-dimensional data model organized
in cubes comprising dimensions and
measures allows for sophisticated
analysis and in-depth Exploration with a
focus on aggregating and summarizing
information
olap empowers users to identify Trends
patterns and correlations across
multiple Dimensions despite longer
response times which are acceptable due
to their analytical nature all AP excels
in providing flexible ad hoc query
capabilities for inputs data
Explorations conversely oltp is designed
to handle real-time transactional
processing ensuring the integrity and
consistency of daily operational
activities by adopting a normalized data
model oltp optimizes the storage and
retrieval of individual records in high
speed environments its primary objective
revolves around efficient data
modification such as inserting updating
and deleting records to support
concurrent transactional operations with
a focus on rapid response times and
maintaining data accuracy at record
level oltp caters to the needs of time
sensitive business operations
understanding the distinctions between
olap and oltp is crucial for
organizations to choose the appropriate
data processing approach based on their
specific requirements today we will be
understanding the difference between
olap and oltp by going through the
following details mentioned in the
agenda we will get started with the
first one which is its purpose then data
structures data volume response time
query complexity data modification data
granularity concurrency data backup and
recovery and finally the system design
so with the briefing of olap and Olt we
discussed and the agenda for the session
discuss let's put the point of today's
session that is the major or top 10
differences between ol apple and oltp
firstly we will go through the purpose
open reporting enabling users to gain
insights from large volumes of
historical data it focuses on providing
aggregated and summarized views of the
data oltp oltp is designed for real-time
transaction processing handling
day-to-day operations such as inserting
updating and deleting individual records
its primary objective is to ensure data
integrity and support high-speed
transactional operations
next is data structure olap uses a
multi-dimensional data model called a
queue it organizes data into Dimensions
such as time geography and product and
measures such as sales and profit to
facilitate multi-dimensional analysis
and drill down capabilities
then we have oltp oltp uses a normalized
data model with tables and relationships
aiming for efficient transaction
processing it minimizes the data
redundancy and ensures data consistency
through the use of normalization
techniques
next ahead we have the data volume
olap deals with large volumes of
historical data typically containing
years of data it focuses on analyzing
and summarizing this vast amount of
information
next is oltp oltp deals with relatively
smaller volumes of data usually
representing real-time transactions
happening within a shorter time frame
moving ahead we have response time olap
allows for longer response time since it
deals with complex queries and large
data sets users expect analytical
reports to be generated within minutes
or even hours
coming into oltp oltp requires vast
response times to support real-time
transaction processing users expect
quick responses usually in milliseconds
or seconds a lot faster than Google AP
moving ahead we have query complexity
olap queries are usually complex
involving aggregations grouping
filtering and calculations across
multiple Dimensions users need flexible
ad hoc querying capabilities to perform
data analysis moving ahead we have oltp
oltp queries are relatively simple
primarily focused on retrieving or
modifying individual records based on
specific transactional needs queries are
typically short and transaction oriented
moving ahead we have the sixth one that
is data modification olap is read-only
or minimally updated data is loaded into
Old AP cubes periodically example daily
or weekly to update the analytical
database with the new information
coming into oltp oltp involves frequent
data modification including insertions
updates and deletions it ensures that
the transactional database remains up to
date and reflects the current state of
business
next in the docket we have data
granularity olap deals with aggregated
and summarized data providing with a
high level view of information across
various Dimensions it focuses on Trends
patterns and overall performance
analysis next we have oltp oltp operates
at a detailed level capturing individual
transactional data with a focus on
maintaining accuracy and integrity at a
record level
next we have the eighth point which is
about concurrency olap involves a low
level of concurrent users since users
typically perform separate analysis and
Reporting tasks that emphasizes on
analytical activities rather than
concurrent transactional processing next
oltp oltp requires a high level of
concurrency to handle multiple users
simultaneously accessing and modifying
the same data it focuses on maintaining
data consistency and isolation amongst
concurrent transactions nine point data
backup and Recovery olap is usually
derived from oltp system and backup and
Recovery are less critical it can be
generated from the transactional
database if necessary in case of oltp
oltp data is critical and backup and
Recovery processes are essential regular
backups are taken to ensure data
integrity and provide the ability to
store this system in case of failures
and lastly we have system design all AP
systems are typically designed with a
focus on read intensive operations they
employ specialized data storage and
indexing techniques optimized for
analytical queries and aggregations all
AP databases are often denormalized to
improve query performance and in case of
oltp oltp systems are designed to handle
a high volume of concurrent read and
write operations
they prioritize data consistency and
transaction Integrity often using
normalized database structures to
minimize redundancy and ensure data
accuracy with that we have reached to
