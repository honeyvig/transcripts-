foreign
models before the data is ready for
transmission over the network channel it
is important to secure and Safeguard our
data over the network channel for
transmission this task is performed by
the presentation layer in the osir model
hi guys and welcome to yet another
interesting video by simply learn but
before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update from us now without further Ado
let's take a look at the agenda for
today's session to begin with we will
look into what is an OSI model
continuing with what is the presentation
layer moving forward we will look into
the functions of the presentation layer
and the last topic that is protocols in
the presentation layer let's take a look
at the first setting that is what is an
OSI model
The OSI or Open System interconnection
model is a specifically designed set of
protocols that govern communication
channels through which network devices
share information and data this task of
sharing information is divided among the
seven layers of the USA model which
works at the micro level network
communication in a network model now
let's look into the next setting that is
what is presentation layer
the presentation layer perform the task
of inverting data into an uncomplicated
form for the application layer
it is also responsible for encrypting
and decoupling data which is shared over
the network model
it also executes the task of compressing
the data transmission over the network
channel for the lower models now let's
move on to the next setting that is
functions of the presentation layer
before we begin with the functions of
the presentation layer let's take a look
at the general functioning of the
presentation layer
to begin with the application layer will
share the data with the presentation
layer where the presentation layer in
DSM model is responsible for handling
the translation and conversion of data
based on the network protocols and
architecture
some of the protocols applied in the
presentation layer are AFP ICA and lpp
after which this processed data from the
presentation layer is transferred over
to the session layer
now let's take a look at the functions
of the presentation layer
the first function is data
representation
then we have data compression
and the last is network security
let's take a look at the first function
that is data representation
the data storage and the process is
handled by the American code of
information interchange and binary coded
decimal in the presentation layer
it takes data so that the receiver can
understand the data effectively and use
it efficiently
it is also responsible for encrypting
data for data transmission
now let's move on to the next function
that is data compression
the presentation layer also applies
multiple compression techniques to
minimize the data required to present
the information over the network model
the compressed data is much more easier
to transmit and is also transmitted at a
much faster speed
then we have network security
the presentation layer is responsible
for adding encryption at the sender and
the receiver side so that the data is
transmitted with proper encryption over
the network model
it also encrypts data sent over the
network and provides multiple security
protocols for maintaining the encryption
state
for the network model now let's take a
quick recap of all the functions of the
presentation layer
the presentation layer is responsible
for exchanging data among computer
devices
and applying multiple encoding
techniques for safety purposes
it is responsible for dealing with
presentation part of the data and
integrating multiple data formats for
efficient data transmission
the presentation layer is also
responsible for formatting translation
and delivery of the data shared from the
upper layers as well as the lower layers
in the osr model
this layer also manages high level
information increasing data transmission
efficiency over the network channel with
this we have completed all the functions
of the presentation layer now let's move
on to the next setting that is Protocols
of the presentation layer
the presentation layer is responsible
for maintaining the security of the
transmitted data and ensuring that the
received data is accurate and effective
for the receiver end
this is handled by the multiple
protocols available for the presentation
layer in the network model
some of which are
apple filling protocol AFP
this protocol handles basic Network file
control and is specifically designed for
mic based platforms
then we have lightweight presentation
protocol lpp lightweight presentation
protocol provides PCP products with ISO
presentation services in the network
model
then we have network data representation
ndr
this type of presentation protocol is
used to implement the presentation layer
in the OSI model and the last protocol
is secure socket layer SSL as the name
suggests this protocol is applied to
provide security to the data being
transmitted over the network channel
by encrypting the data link between the
web page and the data service with this
we have covered all the important points
regarding the presentation layer in an
osr model if you have any questions
regarding the topic you can ask them in
