yeah hi everyone I think it's after a
long time that I'm taking a video for
you uh so uh because of the request from
you guys okay coming to the pharmacology
pharmacology is one of the toughest part
as everyone things as I even I agree for
this pharmacology is one of the toughest
one and it is completely memory based so
not only pharmacology there are many
subjects which are completely memorized
in fact complete 240 marks examination
of neat is going to be completely
memorable it's not logical way what we
think in or physics or chemistry or
mathematics where you can sit and come
out with a formula and you can come out
with an answer it's not like that it's
not a concept oriented and few questions
very few questions or concept or smart
smart way of answering like apart from
the 40 odd questions where you need to
go for the elimination based method rest
all questions or in fact every question
is a memory based question so uh from
the past 10 days we are going with lots
of basic stuffs and I mean everyday we
are having few sorts of good revisions
good good classes and it's all like
making the stuff very simplified means
subjecting them to easy to eat like easy
to understand the things so it's all
like whatever the basic things the you
have to be perfect with the synopsis
first of all you need to have a proper
synopsis where you need to organize each
and everything and then you need to read
them then you need to solve problem mcqs
then you need to uh go through the
synopsis again interact with each other
so this is how you need to go with the
basics right so apart from the decent
result what we have made in the recent
neat examination with 44 gdcs out of
which 17 gdcs are from Andra and
Telangana and rest from all India and
state counselings so that's a great
achievement because last last year we
have only 21 gdcs and uh the team uh
with the students with the last last
year students we made a we made a move
like at least by next year we need to
enter and we need to make gdcs so it's a
very good result that 30 is our Target
but we made 44 it's very decent enough
so we keep a target for this year that
is 60 gdcs conquers we need to make 60
gdcs this year at any cost and the team
is ready for that for you guys to work
day and night and this 6 months you need
to make it very hard you need to work
hard in hell and we need to end up with
at least 6 CG that's the target okay so
going into the today's class that is the
anti anti HIV drugs or anti- retroviral
drugs or a part of viral therapy so I
just want to give this brief
introduction that is how this HIV is
going to affect the individual and how
the process and the drugs of the
classification of the category of these
Antro retroviral drugs where does they
act and everything so once the HIV is
there this is the HIV cell and this is
the commonly infected CD4 or the helper
cells this is a CD4 or helper cells like
with this code protein that is
gp41 uh the HIV cell is going to enter
the CD4 and the CD4 they will have
receptors these are the receptor that is
ccr5 and
cxcr4 these are the receptors which are
ass out of these this five receptor is
the main receptor it is the main one uh
which is responsible okay so once it
enters it's the viral RNA is going to
convert it into viral DNA by a simple
enzyme well-known enzyme that is reverse
transcript as enzy and once the viral
DNA is going to be integrated with human
DNA this is called as an integr is the
enine that is used and finally an RNA is
formed a combination of DNA and a viral
DNA the RNA I mean the DNA is formed
which is again going to converted into
RNA the RNA is going to give you the
proteins which are initially inactivated
and this process is called as an
translation and the proteases are going
to act to active these proteins that is
the inactive protein is going to be
converted into active protein and this
active protein will goes out and again
it's going to infect the new CD4 cells
so at each step there is a particular
drug acting and inhibiting this process
one here one here one here and one here
right so this is a basic stuff or the
basic logical whatever like you feel
like it if it is a concept thing uh just
related to your Concepts so and next
moving to the basic classification okay
uh in this basic classification it's
very easy coded classification where you
need to remember uh there are many vids
in this classification actually but you
need to remember the three for now we'll
remember just two that is one
here and one here means you need to
remember these two drugs for now okay so
please try to practice once or twice
we'll go further into the
classification so first is uh nucleoside
reverse transcript is in
Inhibitors
uh okay uh what are they nucleos
transcript as Inhibitors you can
remember you can solve once the
classification is done for now you
remember because it is nucleoside right
all are not nucleoside there is one
exception that is a nucleotide this is
nucleotide where you can remember it is
very easy uh very easy
one t t t okay it is very easy okay all
of these are nucleus side except one
that is related to T that is nucleotide
simple done we are done with the first
category so we are going to the second
category second category you can
remember with the word
Den d e n done so second category is
with the word den and third category is
protas Inhibitors and you can remember
with the word n
a v i r all protes will have n a v i r 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and after this class I
feel like the most easiest question is
identify which of the following is a
proteas inhibitor right simple because
you will have an V in it and you can
identify easily without knowing anything
so the next categories are these three
categories I was talking about you have
to remember two WS right uh one in the
first category and third we is
this okay uh these are most commonly
asked questions okay entry inhibitor you
can break this entry inhibitor okay uh
en en means envelope the envelope is
nothing but what we have discussed
because HIV has a protein which helps in
entering into the CD4 count with this uh
The receptors that are available on the
CD4 that is gp41 that is the envelop and
inhibits the I mean the fusion F fu is
called as a fusion and it's going to
play
with the T Cell so you can remember this
this is the most one of the most
commonly asked question and coming to
the last category because I I'm I have
previously told that CCR is the main one
right main receptor that is responsible
and you can remember this m m done
you're done with that and integrat
inhibitor uh if you go like uh you'll
have TR we'll have TR that is the integr
inhibitor right so this is a simple way
of of uh going with the classification
of anti HIV so I mean uh I have seen
many questions related to these
particular drugs there are three or four
drugs most of the questions are related
to this uh this is the most commonly
used drug in the case of HIV and
whenever there is a needle stick injury
uh for the patient as well as for the
doctor the immediate prophylaxis should
be done with this
drug or whenever there is a chances of
vertical transmission of HIV from the
mother to Fus you can advise this drug
but the major side effect of this drug
is bone marrow suppression and this drug
is contraindicated whenever the patient
is having less HP anemic patient because
there is a bone marrow suppression so
that that is the key question I have
seen this key question in the recent
neat examination so one more add-on
point is like refampin is going to
increase the clearance rate of this
particular drug and with this drug there
are few uh adverse effects like lipo
drro fix syndrome nail
hyperpigmentation and lipop
so there is a few side effects coming to
the next most commonly asked question
the most commonly asked question is a
dose limiting pancreatits okay so the
bio availability please just go through
the rest of the points so this is one of
the most commonly asked question and
there is an indirect question related to
this question in the recent need
examination so this is the third
category this is also related to the
dose limiting but it's related to the
peripheral neuropathy and it causes
lactic acior is because it's going to
affect the mitochondrial toxicity so
indirectly it's going to cause or
decrease the ph and increase the H+ ion
levels and it also results in the ban
but the most important point is like
lipo distrophy
is among all the antiviral drugs this is
the one which is having the best
lipodystrophic
syndrome okay yeah done for now so I
feel like this
uh video is useful uh to come out with
new pneumonics and Cotes and make this
uh classification very simple and easy
uh guys uh this classification is very
very important because uh I have seen
many many questions related to this
classification in these recent
examinations okay so recent examinations
they're very concerned about this
classification because HIV is very very
related to the dentist right it is
related to the dentist so so it is must
you have to go through this
classification okay and uh definitely we
are going to come up with few more
videos very soon please try to uh follow
the group give your best and please try
to work please try to spend as much as
time as possible with the group in this
span of 6 months you have left over with
6 months and your target is to be done
okay so thank you all the best and take
care
