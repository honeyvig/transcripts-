there is a line from bhagat Gita which
says atam which means let the man be
lifted by his own
terms hardship and failure are part and
parcel of the life how you react to them
it's what differentiates you from the
her hi my name is Rahul Paar and I am
from nasik Maharashtra my father worked
in nask thermal power station I have an
elder brother who is very close to to me
and my go-to source of inspiration I
have studied electronics and
telecommunication engineering and post
that I have joined Indian Air Force as
engineering
officer nearby to our house there is
Army artillery Center and Mig aircraft
manufacturing in Oar I have lived
watching the defense Personnel around me
that instilled a feeling of joining
forces someday when first time I
received a letter from Services
selection board it was a very
challenging time for me the dream which
I have seen was right in front of me but
the situation in my family didn't allow
me to proceed I return a letter to
Services selection board explaining them
my challenges and my
incapability I never expected such an
huge organization will rever back to me
but some sometime magic happens and they
they given me another offer for service
selection board at
deun coming from a small City I have
never experienced traveling but I took
it as a challenge went there and got
selected in that SSB as a part of short
Service Commission initially we serve
for 10 years with the option to extend
four more years which I did after
dedicating my heart and soul in service
to the nation I decided to explore for
other fields and to broaden my Horizon
that is why I decided to upskill myself
it might wonder to civilian that there
is no study in the military but let me
tell you it's exactly opposite there is
a constant learning in the military some
may wonder what army or Air Force does
when there is no war but for us every
day is like a war we must be prepared
every minute simulating Wars and staying
ready at all times this requires
continuous study strategizing and
regular standups to maintain this level
of preparedness we must constantly
update our knowledge over the period of
years I have progressed myself to the
position of a program manager I decided
to upskill myself while in service
during my research I came across simply
learn website I made an inquiry and one
of the counselor got connected with me
on phone and given me the overview of
the course I checked then ratings
offerings and
flexibility and then I decided to join
my PMP certification course my
experience with simply learn was great
my trainer Mr Ravi Krishnan and Mr
Sachin goswami has explained the concept
of project management in very simpler
terms they have given examples from our
day-to-day scenario which made
interaction very interactive I have got
a huge support from my wife and two kids
in not just upskilling but for every
challenges that comes in an officer's
life as I completed this program I can
correlate with many things that I was
doing while in service just to give an
example what was daily working period
for me is the standup meeting in scrum
methodology like this I can correlate
with many things of service and
corporate world as I dwell in I
developed a solid understanding
understanding of agile methodology that
is used across various Industries as the
famous dialogue from movie Om Shanti Om
says if you are manifesting something
from bottom of your heart whole universe
makes those opportunities fall in front
of you you just need to be smart to
utilize them I daily start my day with
workout suan namaskara and yoga I have
keen interest in badminton and table
tennis after after my working hours I do
spend a quality time with my family I
have had my own set of failures and
success in life but one thing was common
will to do something better
