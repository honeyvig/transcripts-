hi everyone welcome to the simply learn
YouTube channel meta is a social media
Giant and Tech Powerhouse it is
estimated that 2.6 billion people use
the platform far more than any other
social networking site it's a dream
company for many graduates to work in
millions of people use the platform
daily which makes their employees work
incredibly impactful you can be a part
of this too you just need to drive in
the right gear and reach the stop
practicing meta interview questions will
help you land your dream job at meta
many developers look to grab this
opportunity of working with a 52 000
strong Workforce since the competition
is fierce you'll have to prepare
everything for the interview from how to
answer questions to what are the answers
to the questions go through the
comprehensive meta interview questions
and the step-by-step preparation guide
before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update so in this session you'll learn
about meta its interview process and the
top meta coding interview questions next
you will come across the technical
questions and finally you'll learn about
some tips for meta interview preparation
and at the ending we have FAQs before we
head to interview questions let's go
through the meta establishments So Meta
is one of the top social networking
sites globally created by Mark
Zuckerberg in 2004. it's an American
online social media site owned by meta
platforms which believes in delivering
change community building and better
growth it ranked fourth in global
internet usage in 2020 with around 2.8
billion monthly active users in 2010
meta became the most downloaded mobile
app many well-renowned computer experts
aim to get a job at meta because the
latter takes the matter of employment
benefits and perks seriously that makes
people think about how their lives will
be as software developers if they get a
job in meta and get the opportunity to
learn prosper and build an amazing
career for themselves
and here we have a simple question for
you guys when was Facebook launched 2006
2004 2003 or 2002 answer in the comments
section and we will update the correct
answer in the pinned comment
let's go through the key stats about
Meta Meta has raised more than 5 billion
dollars to support the causes they care
about they have inaugurated more than
one billion stores worldwide they have
more than 200 million connected
businesses who use their services and
they run a platform where more than 100
billion messages are sent every day
let's understand the meta interview
process
connect with HR the candidate's profile
or resume should directly connect with
HR further rounds take place once the
candidate passes the HR around
interview rounds meta conducts technical
behavioral and situational interview
rounds for various job positions there
are seven rounds the first two are
conducted over the phone and the rest
are taken on site candidates get to
interact with other employees in these
rounds to learn more about the company's
culture
post interview process the interviewers
judged the candidate based on their
resume and the interview conducted
another round may be conducted to
discuss the final call with the
candidate results if the candidate
successfully creates his first
impression and is selected the offer
letter is sent to him by the recruiter
with the understanding of the interview
process let's go through the interview
rounds
interview rounds phone screening HR
conducts two telephonic interviews the
initial call is to decide whether the
candidate is the right fit or Not by
asking them behavioral questions and the
second is the technical phone interview
where the candidate is supposed to
answer DS algo oriented questions a
coding or technical rounds there can be
four to five coding and Technical rounds
each interview round can last from 30 to
45 minutes the freshers are asked fewer
questions than the experienced ones to
judge their skills and abilities
another question for you guys which of
the listed platforms is acquired by meta
platforms Snapchat Instagram Tick Tock
or LinkedIn answer in the comments
section and we'll update the correct
answer in the pinned comment
now be ready to get started with the
coding questions
number one you're given a set of random
numbers write a code to shift all the
zeros to the left so let's see the
approach to solve the question create an
array ARR and store the numbers in it
now Traverse the given array ARR from
right to left while traversing maintain
count of non-zero elements in the array
let the count be count equals zero and
for every non-zero element arri put the
element at ARR in minus count and
increment count
after complete transversal all non-zero
elements have already been shifted to
the right and N minus count is set as
the index of first zero now all we need
to do is run a loop which makes all
elements Zero from count till end of the
array
number two write a code to merge
overlapping intervals
now let's see the approach to solve this
question here's the explanation given
intervals one three two four six eight
nine ten we have only two overlapping
intervals here one three and two four
therefore we will merge these two and
return one four six eight nine ten
a simple approach is to start from the
first interval and compare it with all
other intervals for overlapping if it
overlaps with any other interval then
remove the other interval from the list
and merge the other into the first
interval repeat the same steps for the
remaining intervals after the first this
approach cannot be implemented in better
than Big O of N squared time
number three you're given a binary tree
can you in place convert it into a
doubly linked list
let's see the approach to solve this
question this can be achieved by
traversing the tree in the in order
manner that is left the left child root
right node
transverse left subtree and convert it
into the doubly linked list by adding
nodes to the end of the list in this way
the leftmost node will become the head
of the list then convert the right
subtree into the doubly linked list
algorithm Define a node class which
represents a node in the binary tree it
will have three properties data left and
right where the left and right represent
two children of a node root will
represent the root of the binary tree
head and tail node represent the head
and tail of the doubly length list
binary tree to dll will convert the
given binary tree to a corresponding
doubly linked list perform in-order
transversal of the binary tree by
converting the left subtree first
number four
can you print the given binaries tree
nodes level by level in other words
print all nodes of level 1 first then
level 2 and so on
level order transverse of a tree is
breadth first traversal for the tree a
simple solution is to print all nodes of
level 1 first followed by level 2 until
Level H where H is the tree's height
the basic solution to this is use
function to print a current level there
are basically two functions one is to
print all nodes at a given level print
current level and the other is to print
the level order traversal of the tree
print level order print level order
makes use of the print current level to
print nodes at all levels one by one
starting from the root
number five the sky is dark blue can you
reverse the order of the string
to do this we first calculate how many
words are present in the string then we
shift each word at the end of the string
to the left ensuring the words we
shifted already remain unaffected sounds
simple but no
first we shift the rightmost word by
shifting each letter in the word to the
left of the string now the tricky part
is handling the space after the word
blue we need to move the space at the
end of the string right after the word
for this we shift just once only within
the substring the sky is so the space at
the end of the stream moves before the
letter t once the word is shifted we
need to repeat the same process but only
for the substring the sky is
number six you were given four words
apple pear peer and pie
can this be completely segmented if yes
then how
you're given a dictionary of words and a
large input string you have to find out
whether the input string can be
completely segmented into the words of a
given dictionary you can solve this
problem by segmenting the large string
at each possible position to see if the
string can be completely segmented to
words in the dictionary if you write the
algorithm in steps it will be as follows
number seven
here is a list of daily stock prices
return the buy and sell prices to
maximize the profit
Max profit with at most two transactions
equals Max Max profit with one
transaction and sub-array price
0 to I plus Max profit with one
transaction and subarray price I plus 1
to n minus 1 I varies from 0 to n minus
1.
number one create a table profit zero to
n minus 1 and initialize all values in
it 0.
number two transverse price from right
to left and update profit I such that
profit I stores maximum profit
achievable from one transaction in
sub-array price I to n minus 1. number
three transverse price from left to
right and update profit I such that
profit I stores maximum profit such that
profit I contains maximum achievable
profit from two transactions in subarray
price 0 to I and number four return
profit n minus one
those were some main recurring coding
questions from meta there's a set of
technical questions that are asked more
frequently
let's start with them
number one how will you convert decimal
numbers between 1 to 3999 to Roman
numerals also can you do the reverse how
one thousand nine hundred five hundred
four hundred one hundred ninety fifty
forty ten nine five four one base value
which is just smaller or equal to the
given number will be the initial base
value or largest base value divide the
number by its largest base value the
corresponding base symbol will be
repeated quotient times the remainder
will then become the number for future
Division and repetitions the process
will be repeated until the number
becomes zero
number two can you find the triplets
whose sum is zero now here's the
approach the naive approach runs three
loops and check one by one that sum of
three elements is zero or not if the sum
of three elements is zero then print
elements otherwise print not found
the algorithm run three nested loops
with Loop counter i j k the first Loops
will run from zero to n minus three and
the second loop from I plus 1 to n minus
two and the third loop from J plus 1 to
n minus one the loop counter represents
the three elements of the triplet check
if the sum of elements at the ith jth
and kath is equal to zero or not if yes
print the sum else continue
number three what is the largest subset
whose elements are Fibonacci numbers a
simple solution is to iterate through
all elements of a given array for every
number check if it is Fibonacci or not
if yes add it to the result
number four calculate the maximum value
using the Plus or multiply sign between
two numbers in the given string the task
is pretty simple as we can get the
maximum value on multiplying all values
but the point is to handle the case of
zero and one in other words on
multiplying with zero and one we get the
lower value as compared to adding with
zero and one so use the multiplication
sign between any two numbers except
numbers containing zero and one and use
the plus sign if any of the numbers is 0
and 1.
number five how will you convert the
ternary expression to a binary tree
if we see the symbol question mark then
we add the next character as the left
child of the root if we see the symbol
colon then we add it as the right child
of the current root do this process
until we Traverse all elements of the
string
number six how will you count all
distinct pairs with differences equal to
K
a simple solution is to consider all
pairs one by one and check the
difference between every pair
following program implements The Simple
Solution we run two Loops the outer loop
picks the first element of the pair the
inner loop looks for the other element
the solution doesn't work if there are
duplicates in the array as the
requirement is to count only distinct
pairs
number seven
given is an array of positive integers
can you find the smallest subarrays
length whose sum of elements is greater
than a given number k
a simple solution is to use two nested
Loops the outer loop picks a starting
element the inner loop considers all
elements on the right side of current
start as ending element whenever the sum
of elements between current start and
end becomes more than the given number
update the result if current length is
smaller than the smallest length so far
number eight you have to find if the
string is K palindrome or not can you do
that
explanation string cannot become
palindrome by removing only one
character
the task is to transform the given
string into its Reverse by removing at
most K characters from it the problem is
basically a variation of edit distance
we can modify the edit distance program
to consider the given string and its
reverse as input and the only operation
allowed is deletion since the given
string is compared with its reverse we
will do at most in deletions from the
first string and in deletions from the
second string to make them equal
therefore for a string to be K
palindrome two times n is less than or
equal to two times K should hold true
below are the detailed steps of the
algorithm
process all characters one by one
starting from either the left or right
sides of both strings let us Traverse
from the right corner there are two
possibilities for every pair of
characters being traversed if the last
characters of the two strings are the
same we ignore last characters and count
for remaining strings so if we recur for
links M minus 1 and N minus 1 where m is
the length of string 1 and N is the
length of string two
if the last characters are not the same
we consider removing the operation on
the last character of the first string
and the last character of the second
string recursively compute the minimum
cost for the operations and take a
minimum of two values remove last
character from string 1 recur for M
minus 1 and n and remove last character
from string two recur for M and N minus
1.
number nine how will you find the
minimum depth of a binary tree
the minimum depth is the number of nodes
along the shortest path from the root
node down to the nearest Leaf node the
idea is to Traverse the given binary
tree for every node check if it is a
leaf node if yes then return one if not
Leaf node then if the left subtree is
null then recur for the right subtree
and if the right subtree is null then
recur for the left subtree if both left
and right subtrees are not null then
take the minimum of two heights below is
the implementation of the above idea and
another approach is level order
traversal
number 10 you're given an unsorted array
of non-negative integers and an integer
sum can you find a continuous subarray
that adds to a given sum
explanation sum of elements between
indices 1 and 4 is 4 plus 0 plus 0 plus
3 equals seven
the idea is to consider all sub arrays
one by one and check the sum of every
subarray following program implements
the given idea run two Loops the outer
loop picks a starting point I and the
inner loop tries all subarrays starting
from I Traverse the array from start to
end for every index start another loop
from I to the end of array to get all
sub-arrays starting from I keep a
variable current sum to calculate the
sum of every sub array
for every index in inner loop update
current sum equals current sum plus
array J
if the current sum is equal to the given
sum then print the sub array
number 11. you can see two unsorted
arrays how will you find all pairs whose
sum is X
a naive approach is to Simply run two
loops and pick elements from both arrays
one by one check that both elements sum
is equal to given value X or not
number 12. given are the 10 activities
with their start and end times compute a
schedule where the greatest number of
activities take place
greedy approach can be used to find the
solution since we want to maximize the
account of activities that can be
executed this approach will greatly
choose an activity with the earliest
finish time at every step thus yielding
an optimal solution
the greedy choice is to always pick the
next activity whose finish time is least
among the remaining activities and the
start time is more than or equal to the
finish time of the previously selected
activity we can sort the activities
according to their finishing time so
that we always consider the next
activity as minimum finishing time
activity so number one sort the
activities according to their finishing
time number two select the first
activity from the sorted array and print
it number three do the following for the
remaining activities in the sorted array
a if the start time of this activity is
greater than or equal to the finish time
of the previously selected activity then
select this activity and print it
number 13 what is the next number of the
sequence 1 11 21 1211
in each number one is increasing and
decreasing the ones place if you look at
the two numbers in the tens place it's
also increasing after each sequence then
see the third line after the two the one
is also increasing and decreasing and at
last we will add one as the one is added
every time as with the two
number fourteen
given our two strings with binary
numbers find the result obtained by
adding those two binary strings and
return the result as a binary string the
idea is to start from the last
characters of two strings and compute
the digit sum one by one if the sum
becomes more than one then store carry
for the next digits
number 15
rearrange the given string of alphabets
in sorted order and all the integers
present in the Stream
number one start traversing the given
string a if an alphabet comes increment
its occurrence count into a hash table
B if an integer comes then store it
separately by summing it up every time
two using hash table append all the
characters first into a string and then
at the end append the integers number
three return the resultant string
number 16 map the digits of the given
positive number corresponding to the
alphabet in the mapping table also
return the count of the total number of
decodings possible take suitable
assumptions before coding
the possible decodings are a b a a u l a
input the digit sequence initialize
count equals zero
if the last digit is non-zero recur for
the next remaining n minus one digits
and then add the result to the total
count
if the last two digits form a valid
character or smaller than 27 recur for
the remaining n minus two digits and add
the result to total count
number 17. can you rotate the given
Square matrix by 90 degrees in a
clockwise Direction the transformation
should be done in quadratic time and in
place
to solve the question without any extra
space rotate the array in form of
squares dividing the Matrix into squares
or cycles for example a 4x4 Matrix will
have two cycles the first cycle is
formed by its first row last column last
row and First Column the second cycle is
formed by second row second to last
column second to last row and second
column
the idea is for each Square cycle swap
the elements involved with the
corresponding cell in The Matrix in
clockwise Direction
here's the approach the approach is
similar to In-Place rotate Square matrix
by 90 degrees set one the only thing
that is different is to print the
elements of the cycle in a clockwise
Direction in other words an in by n
Matrix will have Floor N divided by two
square Cycles for example a three by
three Matrix will have one cycle the
cycle is formed by its first row last
column last row and First Column for
each Square cycle we swap the elements
involved with the corresponding number
18 state which histogram has the largest
rectangular area also return the area of
the largest histogram
a simple solution is to one by one
consider all bars as starting points and
calculate the area of all rectangles
starting with every bar finally return
the maximum of all possible areas time
complexity of this solution would be Big
O for N squared
we can use divide and conquer to solve
this in Big O for n Log In Time the idea
is to find the minimum value in the
given array once we have an index of the
minimum value the max area is the
maximum of the following three values
maximum area in the left side of minimum
value not including the Min value
maximum area in right side of minimum
value not including the Min value number
of bars multiplied by a minimum value
the areas in the left and right of the
minimum value bar can be calculated
recursively if we use linear search to
find the minimum value then the worst
case time complexity of this algorithm
becomes Big O for N squared in the worst
case we always have n minus 1 elements
on one side and zero elements on the
other side
and if the finding minimum takes big O
for in time we get the recurrence
similar to the worst case of quick sort
number 19 you are given integers in the
form of an array how will you print the
largest sub-array sum having at least K
numbers
a simple solution is to generate all sub
arrays of size K compute their sums and
finally return the maximum of all sums
the time complexity of this solution is
Big O for n times k
an efficient solution is based on the
fact that the sum of a subarray or
window of size K can be obtained in Big
O for one time using the sum of the
previous sub-array or window of size k
except for the first array of size k for
other sub arrays we compute the sum by
removing the first element of the last
window and adding the last element of
the current window
number 20 return the product of the two
integers represented as strings we start
from the last digit of the second number
and multiply it with the first number
then we multiply the second digit of the
second number with the first number and
so on
we add all these multiplications and
while adding we put ith multiplication
