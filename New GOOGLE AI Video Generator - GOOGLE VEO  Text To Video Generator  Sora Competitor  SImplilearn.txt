hello everyone I amank and welcome to
simpl YouTube channel Google hosted its
annual developer conference Google iio
2024 and we link many new features for
developers and users key highlights
include making its AI model Gemini more
context aware and integrating it into
the search engines Google also introduce
exciting new project like project estra
and imag 3 which leverages AI for
smarter future applications among these
announcements Google introduced its new
video generation AI model vo capable of
creating stunning cinematic shs in
various visual styles from Simple Text
prompts so this model aims to compete
with openi Sora launched earlier this
year so here is a summary of what Google
vo can do and when it will be available
so Google highlighted that vo gives
Creator unprecedented creative control
over their project the AI model
generates high quality 1080p videos in a
wide range of cinematic Styles
accurately capturing the tone and
details of the user text prompts VI
understand cinematic terms like time
lapse and aial shorts of a landscape
creating realistic and coherent footage
where people animals and object move
naturally so here are some glimps of
Google
VI e
vo is designed to make video production
accessible to everyone from season
filmmaker to aspiring creators and
Educators it unlocks new possibility for
storytelling and education so here are
some capabilities of Google Vu first one
greater understanding of language and
visual to create a cent scene generative
video models must accurately interpret a
text prompt and blend this information
with relevant visual references with an
advanced understanding of natural
language and visual semantics vo
generates video that closely follows the
promt it captures the nuance and tone of
phrases accurately rendering ingate
details in complex scheme so here is
Example The Second One controls for film
making when provided with an input video
and an editing command such as adding
kayaks on an aial shot of a CO line vo
can apply this command to the original
video and produce a new edited version
so here is an
example third consistency across video
frames maintaining visual consistency
can be challenging for video generation
models as correctors object or entire
scene May flicker jump or morph
unexpectedly between frames disrup in
the v experience vu's Advanced latent
diffusion Transformer minimize these
inconsistencies ensuring that correctors
object and style remain stable and
realistic just as they would in real
life so here is an
example the fourth one long form content
the model also create video clips that
exter to 60 seconds and Beyond it
achieves this either from a single
prompt or by using a sequence of prompts
to tell a cohesive story so here is an
example
e e
so here one question arises when will
Google V be available for use currently
Google V is only available in private
preview to a selected group of creators
however interested users can sign up for
a weight list for future access
according to google VI might soon be
integrated into platform like YouTube
shorts and other products before we
conclude this video here is a just quick
info for you the AI is moving and the
big tech companies are racing with each
others to develop AI tools like sh GPT
