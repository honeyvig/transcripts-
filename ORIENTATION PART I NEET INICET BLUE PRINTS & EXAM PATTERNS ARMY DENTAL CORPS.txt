okay I hope uh everything is visible
right shall I start okay so we're done
with s's introduction so like I was uh I
was into in this this pattern uh like uh
from past 10 years and 20126 is going to
be the 11th batch and I have seen so
many interns
personally uh and and uh I have
interacted with them and I personally
have wasted so much of my time in
exploring the things in dentistry okay
right so so this is basically more
useful for an intern and of course uh
this video what we are going to upload
will be definitely useful for so many of
you even if you're doing Masters even if
you're doing PG open the clinic so
there's lots of Dentistry Dentistry is a
very very huge thing okay our profession
is a very huge thing so every time we
need to explore Dentistry at different
different
levels and when I was an
intern uh we don't have this uh
interactive sessions or we don't have
this social media impact or something so
my uh our goals our plans are very very
simple right something like you once
your finally result is out you start
your internship okay uh and you talk
with the senior who is close to you then
you you start doing like whatever your
senior Has Done Right mostly just copy
Bas the strategies of your senior
nothing more than that because we don't
have this Instagram we don't have this
impact of social media that 11 to 12
years back so and after a phase of time
because the only source 15 15 to 10
years back is in uh is the senior you
don't have proper information in the
Google also but later comes to a St uh
in the initial phase of this impact of
social media normally most of us
immediately after finally result or
after a certain level into Dentistry I
feel like what is your vision is the
straight straight away whatever you can
see is a blurred vision means you don't
know you're going somewhere you're going
somewhere you're directing yourself in
some way but uh your vision is not clear
okay uh I hope the people of those
Generations will definitely accept this
then comes the Next Generation the
present generation right
everything we don't watch uh a news we
don't watch anything everything whatever
like you get the information through the
social media okay the most happening
information will be social media right
do you accept this guys most of the
information whatever you're getting
something happened there something
happening here okay this is happening
that is happening politics while every
stuff now the only source that you are
getting is through social media and even
like the options after Dentistry the
opportunities after Dentistry jobs
opportunities coaching centers exams
even some sort of preparation is
happening like reading for an exam is
happening on a social media okay top 10
questions okay this is the easy book
that is the difficult book we see lots
of stuff in social media and my answer
for the present generation because I
have seen the lab between that one to
two two to three generations this is the
most horrible generation okay do you
accept this more confusions rather than
like someone who is preparing for an
entrance exam sitting on R preparing for
an entr exam now you get so many
suggestions this is good that is good
Germany is good Africa is good Egypt is
good so this lead to more confusions
okay the problem of social media on the
impact of Dentistry is the the stuff is
not being organized well okay you don't
have this stuff being organized okay but
once you find these things organize
yourself then the social media
usefulness to your life or to explore
the Dentistry will be more okay so the
present generation the best suggestion
what I can give you is okay you
following something social media you're
following something from the social
media you want to htain something from
social media related to Dentistry make
sure it should be organized well it
should be filtered well or else it will
lead to more damage it will lead to more
disadvantages than advantages okay right
you see like until unless I finish my
final year I don't have any plan that
what I am going to do after my final
year exams in internship what I need to
do I have planned after final year now a
first year BDS graduate or a person who
is about to join into Dentistry is
planning everything because everything
is arranged is available in social media
but it is arranged in the most
disorganized way okay so clear you you
get you can get the information but it
has to be arranged in the organized way
to be successful okay that is the first
thing I want to start now normally
people start the journey okay they make
take their life serious into
consideration after their final year
some people after their internship they
start taking things seriously into
consideration and we have an impact
right past impact will be there what is
going to be the future you have lots of
confusions okay yes definitely past is
going to have an impact okay knowledge
wise or an attitude wise or a subject
wise or something XY Z but past will not
decide your future it will have an
impact okay but it will not decide your
future
what you are doing present today what
you're doing and what you are planning
for tomorrow what you are planning for
your future today what you are planning
for your future is going to cause more
impact okay so guys please organize your
things properly okay that's is the most
most important thing rather than sitting
hearing one or two hours of class what
is the future and all this stuff doesn't
make any sense on a larger scale what
makes a sense is you explore the levels
okay Dentistry is something like like
you explore the levels Dentistry is very
huge okay world is very huge and people
are moving from India to different
different countries getting settled down
in the last 10 to 11 years of my uh
teaching and all these like yesterday I
got a call from my old student that she
has cleared ADC Australian Dental
Council exam one of the toughest exam in
the world okay she fighted so much and
finally yesterday she cleared the exam
we are very very happy that's what I'm
telling like tough things are there but
opportunities are there for the people
who are working hard okay and and she
was from sesai vikarabad okay long back
as an intern uh work hard ups and downs
in the preparation then crack the
entrance in the last three four months
she worked so hard she got telanga state
fifth rank she has done uh MDS in pedo
from GDC Hyderabad uh then she used to
work then she got married then she moved
to Australia then she had all those
pregnancies and everything all the stuff
fighted part one done part two failed
again fighted finally yesterday the
result was out she has cleared the exam
in different levels that's what I'm
telling like you may think I nowhere
related to Australia you may think I'm
nowhere related to LDS or I'm nowhere
related to o or I'm nowhere related to
Canada I have my closest senior she
never have a thought of going to USA but
that's what happened like topper in the
state done with MDS in Endo used to work
in the
clinics had a own Clinic then suddenly
she got married to US US based citizen
then she moved up cleared the exam done
with DDS now working now planning the
upgrading okay we it's good to know
everything okay it's that's what my
suggestion like you may preparing for
MDS exam there's nothing wrong you know
what are the opportunities are there
like how you can go for UAE you want to
settle down in Gulf countries what are
the options what are the exams there's
nothing wrong in low the information so
this is basically called as exploring
the dentistry in an organized way okay
right so my first question is what do
you know in dentis this knowing in
dentistry is different for different
individual is different for different
colleges few colleges they have more
exposure for example there is for
example I can give a a rough example
like for example a particular individual
is from a good deemed College like Sav
or SRM okay you have S biology so lots
of good college
there Dentistry what their practice is
slightly different from what the
Dentistry is practiced in regular
colleges in the state level one I'm not
talking about Dentistry exposure to the
Dentistry I told you right exploring the
Dentistry so exploring the Dentistry is
different means you have people of
different ideology over there sharing
their ideas but normally if you see a
state a particular State a particular
College most of them they have the same
idea that copy paste idea okay so first
thing is what do you know about
Dentistry okay that is very very
important and the second one is I want
everyone who want to restart their
journey in dentistry or let it be a
final year student no problem let it be
a third year student no problem let it
be a fresh intern or let it be an intern
who's done with internship okay the
first and foremost important thing
that's going to create a great impact on
you is you start take take a white sheet
take a notes a beautiful notes okay
start writing what you know what you
know about Dentistry what do you think
Dentistry is what you are good in
dentistry like for example as a final
year and done with the final year if you
ask me what I am good what what which
aspect I am good in dentistry yeah my I
am good at one important aspect is I am
very very good at notes making okay so
if you if you question myself okay being
an intern so what are good things in me
and one is notes making a very good
notes maker I am okay I used to make
beautiful notes where my junior seniors
used to come photo that they used to
take that okay so notes making is a very
good quality and
talking talking I talk well okay I
Community
programs everywhere I talk well okay
next the third good quality I have I can
sit for a longer duration of time I can
sit for 5 hours 6 hours at a stretch I
can read and the next important thing is
I got to know during my final year okay
because my final year I have have a qu
in my oral medicine radiology department
that we need to address two seminars and
we have a qu in community Dentistry I
need to address two seminars then I got
to know as my teachers are telling your
teaching skills are good okay so these
are my qualities like what are my bad
qualities is I'm very good I'm very very
bad at hand skills hand skills were not
up to Mark according to me like my
conclusions so now now this is what
exploring yourself what you are good at
indstry what you know about Dentistry
you start writing your own story take a
take a good book start writing about
your own story in dentistry then
whatever you know for example you're
attending a session you're attending a
class you're attending or watching a
YouTube video write down yes Australia
this is a pattern okay is there anything
now I cannot go to Australia yes most of
you cannot go to Australia now most of
you cannot go to USA now most of you
cannot go to UK now but maybe after 10
years you can go as intern I still
remember I don't have an opportunity to
dream about USA I don't have opportunity
to dream about any country but now after
a journey of 10 to 15 years yes now I
can go people are going I've seen my HB
are going I seen my see professors are
going seniors are going no that's what
like you should know you should know
something in the future you can dream
you cannot dream now but in the future
once finances are settled down once the
things are settled down around you I
think you can so a good quality is
writing your own story in dentistry
rather than reading other stories there
is no need to read any story you write
your own story take a take a white sheet
you know what what you know in this four
years or five years of
Dentistry okay what you want to be for
example you're exposed to so much of
surgical cases and you have a passion
towards surgery okay I want to become a
surgeon I want to do MDS in this
particular College I want to do
Fellowship after my MDS you dream and
the dream should be in this book and
this book is the one which is going to
carry you to the next level okay guys do
practice this this is going to create
wonderful impact on your professional
life trust me this is going to work out
so wonderful okay clear clear shall I
move to the next
part I want your response on the chat
box a quick response on the chat box
okay right I'm audible right clear right
yes anha has
responded friend has responded okay
right Sha right very good okay right so
please use this okay let it be you are
preparing for entrance now nothing wrong
you're doing a PG now nothing wrong you
opened a clinic started your clinical
practice going to consultations nothing
wrong start writing what you know what
you want to be and whatever information
you see something which is motivating
you in dentistry write down write down
that okay it's not simply watching a
video hitting a like my suggestion is
write down write down one day you're
going to rewrite this again one day
you're going to be the updated version
of many of the people who are inspiring
you in
dentistry that's what I'm telling like
Dentistry has different layers the layer
what you're exposed to exposed in your
college is different and whatever like
you you I I I hope like the mode of
approach the mode of handling will not
be same for all the teachers you expose
will not be same for all the department
so it is a layer by layer exposure will
be there so the most important aspect is
you should explore the Dentistry at all
the levels possible that that is the
most important criteria means even you
settle down well you have five or six
branches of very beautiful clinics you
may become a HW okay or you may become a
principal of a college okay in the
future maybe probably 10 15 20 years
from now as most of your hws and
principals are there even at that level
you should have this quality of
exploring this is what I have seen from
my uh teachers from my uh teachers from
my HW from my principal like they always
find something new try to learn move
here and there learn something I
question them themselves why you're
doing all this you're done you're
settled down you have all everything you
have in your life why you're doing this
then I got to know this quality like you
should always upgrade for a better
practice for a better individual in
dentistry so Dentistry is all exploring
till you are in dentistry or till you
are on this Earth till you are on this
Earth or till you are in dentistry you
should always explore Dentistry there is
no there is no end point to learn in
dentistry there may be Commerce no full
stops this is one important quality that
you guys could develop and this is a
Time internship Maybe time maybe a third
year or final year watching this video
as a recorded version this is a time you
start exploring the layers of
Dentistry now you you learn right you
have your beautiful book your book of
Dentistry now you you you should plan
like I want to reach this I want to do
this can I make this sit with someone
who can guide you let it be preparation
let it be planning to give any sort of
license exams Australia LDS o
you're planning to give DDS inbd Canada
license Dubai license Gulf licenses
whatever it is take a proper Mentor a
positive Mentor who can guide you even
at the worst situation okay it's not
about like when you're comfortable Zone
anyone can help you when you're in the
most uncomfortable Zone also select a
mentor select a senior who is going to
guide you is going to push you who's
going to drive you through this in all
the ways possible that is very very
important so plan according ly and every
plan okay you see like your dreams for
something and dream should have a proper
plan okay so my suggestion for you guys
okay most of your dream I told you to
write all this stuff right so you write
all this stuff so your dream should have
a plan and plan should have a mentor or
a senior or a
friend you cannot do sometimes you will
come to a situation where you cannot
drive yourself so you need to have some
a very good Mentor or a senior senior
can act as a mentor or sometimes your
friend can be a good source of Mentor so
this combination is going to work out
well in dentistry okay you need
psychological support at all the time
okay so goal without a plan is just a
wish so yes you guys will wish I know
that but what is my recommendation is I
want you to work for your goal with a
beautiful plan okay so that is my
suggestion guys okay so like I see like
this is a very common thing that I
encounter I see like U people always
says Dentistry is saturated no Dentistry
is not saturated maybe normal Dentistry
can be saturated but good Dentistry is
not saturated and we are in a country
where the country is standing first in
the world in the
population and we we will never have
saturation trust me saturation will not
be there for any sort of profession
saturation will be there for dummy
profession okay I I hope you can you can
sense what dummy means means there may
be a group of a few of your batchmates
who may not be great in the work who may
not be great attending the college who
may not be not much interested in
dentistry those are dummy professions
means they are called as dentist but
they don't do Dentistry they don't value
Dentistry so normal Dentistry is
saturated but good Dentistry is never
saturated saturation there will be no
saturation for a good Dentistry you see
like we stay in Hyderabad we stay in the
uh the most density area of Hyderabad
and if you just open go out and just
walk just for 1 kilometer you have 10 to
15 multip speciality hospitals are there
not Dental I'm talking about medical so
according to us if you tell dentist is
saturated yes medical profession is also
saturated
but uh last couple of days uh there was
an emergency and we went to the nearby
hospital we wait for almost like half an
hour 45 minutes 1 hour for the doctor
you see like we are in a country where
the population stands high so there's no
saturation for good things good things
will always have demand so my Sugg is so
the tagline for your book for your for
your book should be you should become a
good dentist or you should become the
best dentist in your surroundings or you
should become the best
dentist in your department you have your
departments right Department segregation
will be there I want you to be best in
that okay so for that what we should do
I have only one one golden formula
trust is directly proportional to
consistency and is inversely
proportional to time okay means you
achieve great things in less time people
will have trust on you you can have
trust on you and you do the same thing
repeatedly over a period of time from 10
years you doing root canal therapist yes
you have so much of trust and I have so
much of Trust on you rather than a fresh
a very simple formula a wonderful
formula that's going to control your
professional life trust is directly
proportional to consistency and
inversely proportional to time so now um
so what I thought is like uh I I don't
want to at a stretch discuss everything
so uh like we are planning one more
session which will be upgraded on that
particular group that group link will be
given in the description ion part of
this video which will be uploaded on the
YouTube okay uh one day maybe one
Saturday we are planning uh to have a
session on exclusively DDS which will be
like 40 45 minutes with question and
answer session uh by a group of people
who has cleared the exams recently plus
who has entered into dental school
recently so that you will know the
recent up updates or recent
considerations or recent key points that
will uh influence your selection
criteria I told you right I'll I'll try
to arrange one more Saturday I'll try to
arrange a call with Dr Vali who has
cleared this ads recently I told you
right so an inspirational uh it's an
inspiration for us okay she she will
guide us for ADC and I have Dr Mai who
is going to help us uh in the process of
this LDS because in UK you have two
exams two Pathways to clear the uh to to
start the practice one is LDS and second
one is uh second one is oi okay madri is
going to take one Saturday so we are
planning like three to four Saturdays
and uh like you want to know anything
about a particular uh license or
something like you want to out of box
you want to learn make sure you try to
drop on the comment session that you
want to know about this and we'll we'll
try to arrange a particular session on
that uh that's what like it is going to
be more organized and more informative
okay information should be proper okay
it's not like I'll do you will learn
like this you will do that you will do
this I don't want to tell all these
stories because when something is
tough or when something is of high price
when something is of high reach it is
going to be tough okay reach wise it is
high but study wise or approach wise
it's going to be tough so none of these
things like ADC or DDS whatever I'm
telling they are not takeaways you need
to struggle lot you need to spend lot
you need to work lot about that okay so
that's what like I I talked about the
the deer layers telling you both
advantages as well as disadvantages I
hope this is clear so all the schedules
will be shared on that particular uh
group both the telegram as well as the
WhatsApp groups the links will be shared
in the uh description part of the MDS
conquer so uh like normally you take
Dentistry Dentistry is categorized into
like options are categorized into one is
domestic options second one is
international options let's consider
it's a national IDE you want to stay in
India approach is going to be different
you want to go to other countries where
dentist is doing good for a better
lifestyle for a better practice of
Dentistry okay so then the approach is
going to be
different but all these approaches they
decided by three factors so I I I
personally consider three factors Factor
number one is
time how much time you going to take
before you settle down Factor number two
is
money time Factor number one is time
Factor number two means how much you
need to spend the reason why I said like
DDS or any of these Australia ADC are
not a cup of my coffee during my
internship is I'm not financially strong
my parents are ready to give time but
they are not ready to give money okay so
that is the reason why it was a it
wasn't it was a dream for
me which which I D which I don't dare to
dream also which I don't dare to dream
okay right so the third important factor
is the person who is balancing this time
and money the person who is balancing
this time and money the third factor is
your parents and family means you may
have a dream but they may have a
different dream on you so whatever your
dreams should be convey to them because
parents are the one who are going to
provide you time parents are the one who
are going to provide the money clear
clear guys so whenever you're planning
or whenever you're thinking of to go to
other countries to clear the license
exams or extend your Dentistry these are
the three important factors to be
considered one is time second one is
money and third one is
parents okay right cello the next one is
so everything has a positive side and a
negative side of the coin positive side
means means for example I'm just giving
a rough example don't take these things
into L consideration for example if I'm
planning for DDS I need to clear inbde
okay so what is the pros what is the
pros lifestyle is a
pro so in USA the lifestyle the quality
of lifestyle is good one Dentistry is
good two third one you earn more you
earn more okay right you earn more
somewhere around like you can make 10 to
15 lakhs Indian currency
per
month if you if you're if you're having
a tag of DDS right coming to the other s
okay the the disadvantages of uh the
disadvantages in this process what are
the disadvantages in this process it is
going to take more
time parents sometimes may not give you
more time because they have some
responsibilities to be done okay or it
it take more money you need to spend
more money and the conversion
rate conversion rate is less for example
if you're planning to do MDS if you're
ready to work hard conversion rate is
more conversion rate is 60 to 80% is
means out of 100 people who are planning
or dreaming of MDS 60 to 80 people are
achieving it 60 to 80 people are
achieving it conversion rate is more for
MDS same now I'm talking about
conversion rate for DDS out of 100
people who are dreaming to do DDS okay
how many are doing DDS is somewhere
around like 10 to 15 percentage of
people conversion rate is less the
reasons are different that's what like
it may be time at one point it may be
money at one point for girls it may be
marriage at one point okay so conversion
rates 60 to 80 is very huge in number 10
to 15 is very Less in number so every
option whatever you choose has both the
sides of the coin so how you overcome
this like like for example few people
they have a quality right yes I want to
work hard sir sir I have a quality of
working hard I'm ready to work hard Let
It Be take 10 years no problem from 10
years I'll keep a Target I want to get
settled down with a DDS tag in USA this
is my goal I'm ready to give 10 years of
beautiful time want to work hard get
settled down in dentistry or I want to
give six years I want to give five years
so people have a criteria so if you can
fight with your criteria then you can
fall under this 10 to 15 percentage you
once or twice you start quitting it then
you can fall on the other side that is
90 to 85% okay so that is what like for
every option in the in the upcoming
sessions I'll be discussing about both
the positive sides as well as negative
sides then you can plan your preparation
accordingly okay now uh I'll be talking
about very two important aspects as G
sir has already mentioned one is doing
MDS the second important criteria is
there is something called as Army Dental
cops so I'll discussing about those two
along with the here and there we have
some sort of uh government job based
examination so I'll be talking about
those three exams three three categories
as of now so in
India how can we do MDS okay we have two
examinations okay it's exam is mandatory
with money you cannot buy an MDS seat
even if you have money you have to write
an exam minimum is you need to qualify
the exam to buy a seat and do MDS in
India so the two gateways uh one the
major Gateway is need MDS examination
okay right and the second Gateway as s
said is ini C MDS in C is including like
three institutes one is a whever MDS is
there second one is PGA and third one is
jipmer jipmer is having two seats PJ is
having nine seats okay as different
branches are going to have different
seats that turns around like uh 25 20 to
25 seats roughly I'm telling okay so
neat MDS is going to occupy 98
percentage of the MDS seats in the
country 98% of seats of MDS will be
filled by neat MDS examination
only so in SE occurs twice an year one
is May inic C second one is November in
neat occurs once in a
year preferably it will be happening in
March of every
year okay clear guys if you want to do
MDS you have two options one is neat
second one is inct inct happens twice an
year neat happens once an year okay NE
happens probable in the march with
slight uh deviations here and there in
is going to happen twice one is the Maya
and second one is November
one next uh seats WI is uh throughout
the country we have somewhere around
like 6,000
6,500 MDS seats are there okay and out
of which
550 to 600 government Dental College
seats are government Dental College
seats are free seats and in almost all
the government Dental College you are
having stifen they're going to give you
stifen per month do you know what is the
highest stifen in the country anyone
highest
Typhon government I don't know how many
of you are from gdc's okay GDC every GDC
PG is going to have a stifen so monthly
wise they're going to give a stifen any
idea about the highest stifen in the
country K is telling 80k no not
80k someone is telling yes it is around
1 lakh 16,000
one lakh 1 point you can consider it as
1.2 lakh per month stifen is there in
few colleges central government colleges
in the country okay right no information
that's what I'm telling like there's
nothing wrong knowing the information
there's nothing wrong dreaming about it
there's nothing wrong planning for the
dream and trying to achieve it okay
right
so we have 550 to 600 okay and the
highest stance is 1 lak 16 to one lakh
one lakh 1 lakh 120,000 per month I'm
talking about per month this is stifen
per month from a college if you work
hard
right which is more than uh a salary of
a Raider in your college as a PG maybe
one one and half year from now if you
work hard in a guided way with all the
commitments you can achieve this goal
can achieve this
dream and now uh I'll be talking about
uh very important aspect Okay so
guys uh you're from which states can you
can you can you message me on the chat
box State you from which state yes we
have students from Andra Pradesh
Karnataka Tamil
Nadu Maharashtra Kerala utak
jaran any any other states yes Karnataka
is
done yeah
Telangana yes very beautiful okay very
beautiful so now this criteria is common
criteria yes we have students from ma
Pradesh also this criteria is a common
criteria so in our telegram group as
well as in our WhatsApp group that we
have uh we have recently opened we'll be
sharing the information of number of
private seats number of government seats
available in your state mdsa I I'll be
telling you but as of now I'll be
telling you uh for example I'm telling
you uh for example GDC C Bangalore I'm
just telling an example to make the
things very simple GDC Bangalore Endo
Department Endo
department for example is having four
seats four seats are
there so all India we have a
rule which is called as 50% is all India
what is this 50 percentage of all India
is telling the 50 percentage of all
India is telling in any college in the
entire country including Jammu and
Kashmir if you have a number of seats
half of the seats will be going to 50%
as of all India pool okay means two
seats will be going 50% as of all India
pool and two seats will be for the State
Pool means two seats will be exclusively
for Karnataka students in Karnataka
State counseling and two seats will be
going to all India pool means even a
Karnataka student who got a good rank
can can get this
seat and your state seats that is 2%
State counseling is only for Karnataka
guys it is clear for
example you have GDC indoor GDC indoor
pedo department is having two seats for
example one seat will be all India pool
and one seat will be for State Pool only
MJ Pradesh people one seat in entire
India including MJ Pradesh everyone take
one more seat clear guys this is very
very important
so the second thing is sometimes there
are few departments in a college in a
state may have odd number of seats for
example you just consider GDC
Hyderabad is having three Endo seats so
what is going to happen they cannot
split it into 1.5 and 1.5 so what they
will do one year they are going to give
two seats the next year they're going to
give one seat seats for all India means
whenever they give two seats they use
one seat for State Pool whenever they
give one seat for all India they use two
seat for the State Pool guys this is
very very important this is very very
important quas are different counselings
will be different reservations are there
lots of things will be happening in the
counselings okay so you should have a
basic idea what is happening okay so two
questions are there how many GDC seats
are present per year year in your state
this I'll be posting Statewide on the
telegram group and how many of those
belongs to you half of those belongs to
the state and half of those belongs to
the National Pool Guys clear this is I
want your quick
response right right very good next one
next important aspect is uh like you see
like I was talking so much I was talking
about need I was talking about inic I
was talking about government jobs okay
right I was talking about government
jobs three options I was talking about
there is something called as Army Dental
cops four options there are many such
options in the country country wise I
mean National
wise and second thing is I told you
International the most popular
international options as of now are DDS
in
USA you can have a license exam Canada
Canada you can practice ADC exam in
Australia you can right LDS or o in the
case of your UK and you have many sorts
of license exams in different different
locations so the most important thing is
most of these examinations in fact all
of these examinations they have they
have exams pakka they are going to
conduct exams and most of these exams
will move around mcqs with few uh here
and there like Australia uh for few
areas you will be having single liners
also but most of these exams will have
exams only means mcqs only but
patterning of exam is different pattern
exam pattern is
different patterns are different even
you take inic pattern is different meat
pattern is different government job
exams in the country pattern is
different okay and sometimes the
selection criteria will be different the
selection criteria is going to have
reservations the selection criteria is
going to have ews St SC obcs
and if you come to Karnataka people are
there from Karnataka right people are
there from Andra people are there from
Tamil Nadu you have reservation
subcategories Karnataka you have
different
categories Maharashtra you have
different categories Andra you have BCA
b d e and Tamil Nadu you have different
categories service so lots of things
means exam will be there mcqs will be
there pattern of mcqs will be different
time duration may be different selection
criteria may be different and most of
the National examinations I mean most of
the international examinations will have
an interview also means selection
criteria includes an interview means not
only exam they're going to call you
they're going to make you sit they're
going to ask you some questions they're
going to judge you and they're going to
decide you whether they have to give a
seat or not right so every exam whenever
you're planning to approach whenever
you're planning to dream know what are
these criterias what are these patterns
what are the sources okay means again
the sources will be different
inic is not a balanced paper need is a
balanced paper means needs requires a
balanced preparation inct is not a
balanced p and similarly you see like
I'm talking about
ads or I'm talking about for example
I'll be talking about uh inbd inbd is
more inclined to
clinicals questions will be more
inclined to most of the questions will
come in from the clinicals and you take
ADC or LD s you have a different papers
like you have a basic paper you have a
you have a clinical paper you have a
practical exam so most of the
international exams you'll be having one
more part as a practical exam means you
need to give a practical exam so
criterias patterns and everything are
going to be different but knowledge wise
maybe most of them they overlap but
pattern of reading pattern of
preparation is going to slightly vary so
be clear means a person who is preparing
for neat can also prepare for DDS but
the pattern of exam content may be
slightly okay same but pattern of exam
or selection of selection pattern of
exam will be totally different guys is
it clear it should you should know about
this you cannot simply open uh a book
which you are reading for neat or in and
you cannot prepare for uh Canada exam or
Australia exam Australia exam has a
different standard books uh USA has a
different standard books so mode of
reading will be different for different
different examinations okay right that's
a very very important thing to to be
noted so as I said like uh people who
are planning to give this this uh
session is basically for 2026 bat
students so 2026 bat students the
Karnataka students Kerala students MP
students and people who has recently
done with their final year exams
resulted out and they started their
internship the first exam that you are
going to be eligible which is going to
be there after 13 months from now is in
C November in C November is going to
have 20 to 25 seats including all the
branches of as and it's going to be for
200 mcqs questions will be for 200 time
duration is 3
hours and uh inic has recently changed
its pattern means how it like inct is
going to
have four parts Part A Part B part C and
Part D each part is going to have 50
question
questions total 200 and each part will
be 45
minutes means for first 50 questions
will be accessible in the first 45
minutes then first 50 questions will
disappear after 45 minutes then you have
access to second 50 questions for the
second 45 minutes and in the last 45
minutes you'll be having access to only
last 50 questions guys this is clear
very important change pattern pattern
has been changed long back the pattern
is different now the pattern is
different okay a very important thing to
be noted the next one is negative
marking is minus
1/3 and
uh the result will be in the form of
percentile what is this percentile okay
so you you have a Topper on the day of
exam right the topper is getting for
example for an 100 marks exam let's
consider 200 marks exam the topper
got 150 or 150 questions right so this
fellow is considered as 100 peral okay
now for example your score is 90
percental means you got 90 percentage of
topper score percental is how much
percentage of topper score is your
percentage guys clear you got right what
is percent inct result will be available
not in the form of marks it is available
in the form of
percentile I said like in C exam is not
a balanced paper you don't have a
balanced paper 60 to 7 percentage will
be on the clinicals okay and you'll be
having diagram based questions also okay
so this pattern slightly varies they
don't follow any blueprint there is no
blueprint that is given by am or PGI for
in
C the next exam that most of you are
familiar most of you are going to attend
uh is yes of course it is 2006 that is
neat March 2006 for people who are
preparing for 200 2005 exam will be in
the math slightly here and there n be
will give you last minute twists
everything like how it has is given for
Medicals okay so it hand all GDC seats
all private colleges all deemed
colleges your army Dental cops okay and
uh everything are included in this
particular examination the total number
of questions will be 240 time duration
is 3 hours same like as but questions
are more than as as in I you have 200
questions here you have 240 questions as
of now we don't have any new
modification in neat MDS but
there was one unofficial notification
that is came from nbe officially
probably they'll be releasing in this
December or January about this 2025 exam
so they also have plan of splitting the
entire paper into multiple Parts either
four it can be 4 into 60
240 or it can be 6 into 40
240 same like inic pattern but as of now
we don't have any official notification
from this it's wait and
watch for every right answer you'll get
plus4 marks for every wrong answer
you'll get minus one so it is 240 into 4
so this exam your result will be in the
form of
marks guys what is your result in the
form of personel right inic your result
will be in the form of person and for
your neat examination your result will
be in the form of of marks guys clear
clear for now people who are planning to
restart their preparation people who
want to explore it is very very
important you should know what exam you
are preparing for you should know how
many seats are there you should know
what are your chances if you have
reservation what is the probability of
your reservation what are the cut offs
of your reservation of your dream
college or your dream Department you
should know so that you can run run in
that particular direction okay right
so luckily by God's grace
nbe who is the body conducting this neat
MDS examination has given us a blueprint
and they're going to follow this
blueprint each subject is going to carry
14
marks physio plus biochemistry 14 Dental
Anatomy Dental histology 14 General path
7 micro 74 pharmacology 14 Dental
materials 14 general medicine 14 surgery
14 oral path oral microbiology 14 omr 14
pedo 14 Oro 14 pero 14 proo conservative
Endor 7 plus 74 surgery 14 and public
health 14 okay so most of the subjects
are going to carry 14 marks which turns
totally to
240 marks which is an official blueprint
that is given by NB people which is the
organizing Committee of doing these
examinations guys clear clear clear
right so what books you need to read how
you need to start your preparation what
are the things that you have to consider
all these are stepwise it is it doesn't
make a very great sense you know about
all these things on the day one that is
my and previously we used to take like
two two and half hours brainstorming
session where we are going to saturate
the brains of the students but this time
what I thought is let's give time
understand what you are going through
understand what your pace is at
understand what you are dreaming for
what your goal is at what your plannings
are okay so with this uh okay so I'm
just going to introduce my core team
faculty of uh mentors which are in
association with MDS conquer so these
are group of
mentors okay who are going to guide us
in all the ways so what books to be done
and
uh how you need to start reading and
everything I'll be taking as a level
wise okay I just want to add I told you
right I will be talking about neat and
inic done and two important aspects both
are combined very simple I'll be talking
about there is something called as Army
Dental cops okay right there's something
called as Army Dental cops uh any idea
guys about Army Dental cops okay so
selection criteria of army Dental cops
is slightly different so Army Dental
cops basically the first important thing
is you need to write neat MDS
examination so you need to get a good
rank so followed by once the neat MDS
exam is done army people are going to
release a
notification so they're going to release
a notification stating that a 35 or 40
posts of army Dental cops are open and
people are open to apply for it with
your neat rank so I have my neat rank so
what I'm going to do
is I'll be uh I'll be applying for okay
so I'm going to I'm going to apply for
Army Dental CS so I'm going to apply
Army Dental CS with my neat
rank similarly you have so many
applications that are going to come so
many applications will be there okay
that are going to come so now Army
Dental cops so they have some 35 40
postings will be there post will be
there every year they have so they are
going to pick around like into 10 or
sometimes into 15 they pick okay for
example they have 40 Post 40 into 10 is
400 or 40 into 15 is 600 means 400 to
600 Merit list they are going to release
mean means all the students who has
applied for this Army Dental CS with a
neat rank so they're going to categorize
according to their neat ranks and they
give a separate ranks and they are going
to release a cut off of 400 to 600 so
this cut off of 400 to 600 basing upon
the neat rank is First Merit
list is First Merit list of army Dental
cops clear guys till this point this is
the first step means first you have to
give a eat then the notification will be
out then you need to apply after you
apply so they are going
to release the First Merit list of the
top 400 600 rankers who has applied for
arm guys clear step one then step two
they are going to call all these
individuals they are going to call all
these
individuals for the interview okay so in
this interview is again splitted into
medical part part means they're going to
see the medical Fitness and everything
and followed by the next one is they are
going to take the personal interview
which includes both professional as well
as the personal so once your medical
test medical tests are done your
personal and professional interview is
done they Again release a merit
list Merit list to this is called as
final Merit
list this is a final Merit list the top
40 to or basing upon the basing upon the
number of posts the top 35 to 40 people
who are interested in this Merit list
can be a part of army okay so it's a
guested post okay so initially you're
going to start with a three years
service it can be extended up to 10 13
years of service and you have all the
Privileges being a part of Army and I
mean people have a few people few of you
may have the passion to work with army
for a few years dedicate some something
to the nation and the country so such a
people can try for this uh the initial
pay scale ranges from 990,000 to one
lakh and it can go as your experience
increases and you have many sort of
internal examinations basing upon your
qualifications and everything I have
many of my friends colleagues after MDS
also they have they are serving the
country uh they doing the job over there
so I have many exams by which your
starts will be increased okay you have
stars right in Army the Stars the
positions will be increased okay so that
is one important
aspect the next important aspect is I
want to stress on the next important
aspect
is there are some government job based
examinations okay intents are not
exception to this intents can also get a
government job that's what I'm telling
like few government jobs are solidly
based upon the exams only few government
jobs they have exams followed by an
interview sometimes
in inter we require experience they will
ask you the experience two people are
fighting for the same
position experienced person will have an
upper hand intern may have a lower hand
okay so yes you have exams okay so you
have ps's okay PSC exams will be there
so every state is going to release but
Army every year they're going to release
a notification of 30 or 35 or 40 but PSC
it is not mandatory okay means for
example there is a requ requirement of a
particular government Post in a
particular sector or in a particular
state so most of these PSC based exams
are Statewide okay recently uh there are
few States who has released this okay
right and as of now to my sense like we
don't have any PSC based exams uh in in
Karnataka Jone or in Andra Telangana we
don't have these exams okay so recently
like we have few exams in few States
like we this is wait and watch okay it's
wait and watch it's not mandatory neat
yes every year neat once exam is done
inic twice exam is done army cops yes
they are going to release a notification
for 35 to 40 people so they have a
timeline criteria but this is
requirement based criteria so they need
to keep a bill once the bill is approved
then they're going to release the
notification so it's wait and watch okay
so as keeping goals we can't go for an
option which is wait and watch so but
the pattern is this like you have an
exam so probably a few State exams
they're going to conduct for 100 marks
few State exams they're going to conduct
for 200 I have seen few States
conducting for 150
in in few of these states uh uh I mean
uh they try to include the History part
also gender knowledge also will be
included okay uh mathematics and all
these steps are not included in most of
these exams but the few States they
include the history of the state okay
they include the history General
knowledge of the state general knowledge
of the country for 10 to 20 marks
sometimes we have we have the sources we
have the materials available to read for
those examinations nothing to break your
head once a PSC notification is coming
from a particular State and luckily you
belongs to the particular State because
most of these PSD based examinations
they have doile they require domicile
for example bear is releasing a
notification most of these post posts
will be given to Bear dois means you
have to born in born in bear or you
should have uh any sort of connection to
the bear then you are eligible for this
I mean criterias are different that's
what like I I initially I told you right
exam patterns selection patterns
criterias inclusion criterias exclusion
criterias they're slightly different
from uh state to state guys clear right
you you got some idea right you got some
idea regarding
this so next session that's what I told
you the next Saturday I'll be updating
you all this information on the telegram
group as well as WhatsApp group and on
the Instagram page okay all these links
will be shared in the comment box below
okay so probably we'll be taking a
session exclusively on DDS it's going to
take one hour explaining all the
important aspects then I said like there
is one more examination called as ndeb
that is for Canada okay you want to move
to Canada you have a different
patterning we will be conducting a sort
of live on that uh then goes for the UK
I told UK uh to start your practice you
have two options uh one is O exam or
second one is you can go for LDS okay
again or is having different subp parts
okay LDS is having three parts part one
part two part three you have to clear
those examinations and everything if you
are practical based if you are Basics if
you are clinicals I'll be explaining you
all those things ADC I told you right
ADC will be taking one more
session and UAE countries and most of
the gulf countries we will be taking a
session okay right how to start the
preparation is let's start let's start
okay how to manage the time what to be
read how to how an in has to manage the
time uh how a housewife has to manage
the time how a repeater has to read so
it is patterning is different okay it's
going to be uh the guidance will not be
same for all okay that's what like in my
10 years of experience what I strongly
believe is guidance cannot be same for
all guidance will be different for
different indiv idual even it cannot be
ideal for two individuals also like you
need to analyze talk fix the goals then
you need to start working so I strongly
recommend all of you uh who has already
started their Journey for 2026 batch or
people who are attending for 2025 B
whatever it is like intern first BDS
whatever like you see this video
anywhere from The
Source sit and talk with someone who has
a knowledge over this then you
start you start driving into that
particular direction don't randomly see
some YouTube video don't don't randomly
do it okay you see this video make sure
you get a good source a good senior or a
good batchmate or a good Mentor or a
good teacher who has a knowledge over
this sit with them talk with them plan
accordingly and make sure you take the
guidance guidance is very very much
important to reach Heights in a
minimalistic typ we don't want you to
reach Heights after 10 years after 15
years less time more result okay less
time more accurate result the faster you
grow without wasting any times is the
most smartest thing that
the the present Society has given us
okay you should be smart right the world
is moving smart and you should be smart
so so I'm I'm concluding this session
the next session uh probably we'll be
announcing you on all these platforms
The Links of uh the WhatsApp group group
the Instagram page and everything will
be shared on the descriptive part of
this video in the YouTube uh make sure
uh you try to follow us so that you'll
get more organized layer layer by layer
information which is very very important
for us to be successful in dentistry

very soon okay bye guys I don't want to
extend this for two two and a half hours
