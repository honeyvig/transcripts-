the exciting topics in c sharp that is c
sharp interview questions and answers
but before we begin let me tell you guys

this tutorial video has 50 interview
questions and all these questions are
divided into three levels beginner
intermediate and advanced levels so
without further ado let's get started
with the first topic
now before getting into any interview
questions i would like to reveal the
first type of questions that are
recording interview questions it is
obvious that in any technical interview
you will be asked to code some or the
other program so we have bought the most
frequently asked top five coding based
questions in c sharp which are write a
program in c sharp to reverse a string
write a program in c sharp to find if a
given string is a palindrome or not
write a c sharp program to find the
substring from a given string write a c
sharp program to find if a positive
integer is prime or not and lastly write
a singleton design pattern and how to
implement them in c sharp
so these are the most frequently asked
coding based interview questions based
on c sharp and if you want we would like
to share these quotes with you please
feel free to share us your email ids in
the comments section below so that we
can share you all these codes
now let's start with the beginner level
interview questions
so our first question is how the c
programming language differs from
c-sharp programming language the first
difference is that the c programming
language allows for procedural
programming whereas c-sharp programming
language provides object-oriented
programming the second difference is
that c programming language supports
pointers whereas in c sharp pointers are
only used in unsafe mode the third
difference between c and c sharp is that
garbage collection is not supported in c
whereas in c sharp garbage collection is
handled by the common language runtime
or clr
the next difference between the both is
the c programming language is cross
platform in contrast the dot net
framework is required to run on the
c-sharp language only fifth difference
between c and c sharp is we can achieve
a low level of abstraction using c
programming language whereas in c sharp
we can achieve a high level abstraction
the last difference between the both is
the c programming language is primarily
used in commercial industries and
engineering whereas c sharp on the other
hand is used for software development
and other network related goals
the second question is what is an object
and a class in c c-sharp
the answer for this question is a class
is a collection of properties and
methods used to represent a real-time
entity it is data structure that groups
all the instances into a single unit
whereas an object of a class is defined
as an instance technically it is simply
a block of memory that can be stored as
variables arrays or collections for
example the car is working as a class on
my screen and the objects are ford and
rd which are the car manufacturers
next is what are the fundamentals of
object-oriented programming
the answer for this question is the
object-oriented programming language or
oops in c-sharp is divided into four
concepts that is encapsulation
abstraction
inheritance and polymorphism
let's take a closer look at each of the
four object oriented programming
concepts first encapsulation
encapsulation is defined as when an
object's internal representation is
hidden from the view outside its
definition it is said to be encapsulated
only the necessary information is
accessible while the rest of the data
implementation is hidden
next abstraction abstraction is the
process of identifying and eliminating
irrelevant details from the object's
critical behavior and data
following the oops concept inheritance
is the ability to create new classes
from existing ones it is accomplished by
gaining access to altering and extending
the behavior of objects in the parent
class
lastly we have polymorphism polymorphism
is defined as a name that means one name
many forms it is accomplished using
several methods with the same name but
different implementations
now we have the next question that is
what is the common language runtime or
clr so the answer for this question is
the common language runtime manages the
execution of dotnet programs clr the
just-in-time compiler translates
compiled code into machine instructions
this is the program that the computer
runs clr provides memory management
exception handling type safety and other
services now let's look at the next
question
what is managed and unmanaged code
so manage code is executed by clr common
language runtime on which all
application code is based the internet
platform because of this is regarded as
managed internally the dotnet framework
uses the garbage collector to clear
unused memory whereas unmanaged code is
any code executed by an application
runtime in a framework other than dotnet
the application runtime will handle
memory security and other performance
operations
next we have
what exactly is an interface
in c sharp an interface is a class
blueprint it is like an abstract class
and that all the methods declared within
the interface are abstract
it cannot have a method in body and
cannot be instantiated instead it can be
used to achieve multiple inheritances
that can't reach
the following example demonstrates an
odd even class has access to both the
even and odd classes
now we have the next question
what are the different types of classes
in c sharp so the answer for this
question is there are four different
types of classes in c sharp the first is
partial class which states that its
members can be divided or shared across
multiple files the keyword partial
denotes it
the second class is abstract an abstract
class is one was object cannot be
instantiated the only way to get the
class is to inherit it must include at
least one method the keyword abstract
denotes the abstract classes the next
class is sealed class a sealed class
cannot be inherited to access a sealed
class members we must create a classes
object then the keyword seal denotes it
the last and the fourth class in c sharp
is static this class does not allow
inheritance the classes members are also
static the keyword static denotes this
type of class the keyword instructs the
compiler to look for any static class
instances created by accident
now the ninth question
what is the difference between equality
operator and equals method in c sharp
the difference between the equality
operator which is double equals to and
equals method in c sharp is the the
double equals operator and the equals
method compare two values or reference
type data items
this answer explains the fundamental
distinction between two the comparison
operator is the equality operator and
the equals method compares the contents
of the string the double equals to
operator compares the identity of
reference whereas the equals method
compares the only reference
now we have the tenth question
explain code compilation in c sharp
the answer for this question is in c
sharp code compilation consists of three
steps the c-sharp compiler compiles the
source code into managed code putting
the newly created code together into
assemblies
then the common language runtime is
being loaded and clr is carrying out the
assembly
now we have the 11th question what are
the differences between a class and
struct
the answer for this question is
the first difference is class can
inherit whereas struct cannot the second
difference is a class is passed by
reference type whereas struct is passed
by value type
the next difference is class members are
private by default whereas in struct
members are public by default
the fourth difference is class is
appropriate for large complex operations
and objects though struct is appropriate
for small isolated models the last
difference between the boat is we can
use a garbage collector to manage memory
in class whereas a struct cannot use
garbage collector and thus cannot manage
memory
the next question is what is the
difference between virtual method and
abstract method
virtual method is default implementation
of virtual process is always required it
can however be overridden in the derived
class though this is not required for
example the override keyword can be used
to override it
though an abstract method has no
implementation it belongs to the
abstract class therefore derived class
must implement the abstract form
although an override keyword is not
required in this case it can be used
now the 13th question explain namespaces
in c sharp
namespaces are employed in organization
of large code projects for example in c
sharp the most common namespace is
system we can create our namespaces and
use one namespace with another known as
nested namespaces the keyword namespace
is used to identify them
following the c-sharp interview
questions and answers the next question
is what is the using statement the
answer for this question is the using
keyword indicates the program uses the
specified namespace as an example
consider system the system is a
namespace in this context
the class console is defined in the
system module so in our program we can
use a console write line and read line
now the next question is explain
abstraction
one of the object oriented concepts is
abstraction it is used to display only
the classes essential features and hide
unnecessary information
let us use a car for an example
a car driver should be familiar with the
vehicle's details such as color name
mirror steering gear brake and so on he
doesn't need to know about the internal
combustion engine and an exhaust system
as a result abstraction aids in knowing
what is required and concealing internal
details from the outside internal
information can be hidden by declaring
such as parameters as private and using
the private keyword
the following question is explain
polymorphism polymorphism in programming
means the same method but different
implementations it is classified into
two types compile time polymorphism and
runtime polymorphism the compile-time
polymorphism results the call in
compile-time polymorphism is also
referred to as static binding early
binding and overloading
the compiler does not resolve the
runtime polymorphism call and is also
referred to as dynamic binding late
binding or overriding
for example a man acts as a father a
husband and an employee all
simultaneously the next question
how is exception handling implemented in
c sharp in c sharp exception handling is
accomplished using four keywords try
catch finally and through
in try try contains a block of code that
will be checked for exceptions in catch
a program that catches an exception with
the help of the exception handler and
finally it is a block of code written to
run regardless of whether an exception
is scored or not and finally through
throw is when a problem occurs it throws
an exception
followed by exception handling we have
another question
that is what are the c sharp input and
output classes what are commonly used
for input and output classes
the system.io namespace in c sharp
contains classes used to perform various
operations on files such as creating
deleting opening closing etc
the following are some of the examples
of commonly used input output classes
which are file stream writer stream
reader string writer string reader part
etc
file aids to with the manipulation of a
file
stream writer is the class that is used
to write characters to a string
the stream reader is used to read
characters from stream the string writer
is used to write a string buffer the
string reader is used to read the string
buffer the path is used to perform
operations on path information followed
by that the next question is what is
stream reader or stream writer class the
answer for this question is
the name space system dot input output
contains the classes stream radar stream
writer which are used to read and write
character 90 database data
members of stream reader are close read
and read line members of stream writer
are close right and right line
there is an example on my screen where
you have code block to read and
a code block to write using stream
reader and stream writer now the next
question what is a destructor in
seashore destructor are used to clear
memory and free resources in c sharp
however this is handled by a garbage
collector on its own internally system
dot gc dot collect is used to clean up
but it may be necessary to implement
destructors in some classes manually
the following is an example of vehicle
acting as a destructor using the tide
symbol following the 20th question we
have the 21st question which says what
is an abstract class
so the answer for this question is an
abstract class is denoted by the
abstract keyword and only be used as a
base class this class should always be
inherited it is impossible to create an
instance of the class itself if we don't
want any program to create an object of
a class we can make it as categories
abstract there are no implementations of
any methods in the abstract class they
must be implemented in the child class
here's an example that shows an abstract
as abs then the child as child class
that inherits the abs abstract class and
finally an object as c is one of the
accesses
the addition function via a new process
called submission
and abstract classes methods are all
implicitly virtual as a result the
virtual keyword should not be used with
any abstract classes methods they must
however be implemented in the child
class the next question is what is the
difference between boxing and unboxing
codes
boxing is converting a value type to a
reference type at the same time unboxing
is the explicit conversion of the same
reference type back to the value type
the following is an example val 1 is 50
which is going through boxing process
and val 1 is converted into object
boxing val which is then converted back
into an unboxing variable after the
boxing process
the following question is what is the
difference between continue and break
statement the break statement terminates
the loop it causes the program control
to exit the loop in contrast the
continue statement instructs the
program's power to go only to the
current iteration however it does not
affect the loop
following is an example for break
statement in which the break keyword is
used to terminate the loop going from 0
to 10 immediately the continue block of
code is used to skip the current
iteration of 2. the final question for
the beginner level is what is difference
between final finally and finalized
blocks
final is a keyword that indicates that a
variable method or a class is
unchangeable to put it simply finally
like try and catch blocks it is used for
exception handling the final block is
always executed regardless of whether an
exception is raised
this block is mainly used to close
database connections input output
resources etc lastly the finalized
method in java.lang protected method
object type it is passed down to every
java class you create therefore the
garbage collector thread calls this
method before removing an object from
memory now we have reached the
intermediate level
the 25th question on our list is what
exactly is an array so the answer for
this question is an array is a data
structure that stores multiple variables
of the same data type it is a set of
variables stored in a single memory
location here's an example of marks
array with 5 integer values 10 20 30 40
and 50. a single dimensional array is a
linear array that stores variables in a
single row the preceding example is a
one-dimensional array arrays can have
multiple dimensions rectangular arrays
are another name for multi-dimensional
arrays we have a multi-dimensional array
as numbers with three rows and three
columns with one two and three in the
first row three four and five in the
second row and four five and six in the
third row
now the next question is what is a jack
arry
a jagged array is an array with array
elements it is also known as an array of
arrays and can have a single dimension
or multiple dimensions here's an example
of jack arry a jagged array with four
rows
in the first row we have two values one
and two the next row contains values
three four and five and six the third
row includes three values seven eight
and nine and the fourth row contains
five values that is three four five six
and seven
now the next question name some
properties of arrays
an array has following properties that
is length this function returns the
total number of elements in an irene
size
this indicates whether the array's
length is fixed or not
read-only this indicates whether the
array is read-only or not
now we have 28th question
what is an array class
arrays can be created manipulated
searched for and sorted using array
class however the array class does not
belong to the system however the
collection's namespace is still
considered because it implements the
list interface therefore the ira class
serves as the foundation for area
supporting language implementations
we have an array class called colors and
we have four colors red blue green and
yellow we print those colors in this
array class example
now the next question is what exactly is
a string what are the characters of
string class a string is the grouped
character objects string variables that
can be declared in c sharp a string
class in c sharp represents a string in
the following example we have a string
called name that is inserted by c sharp
interview questions and answers the
string class has the following
properties
character returns the current strings
character object the length function
returns the number of objects in this
current string
another 30th question
what is an escape sequence named some
strings escape sequences in c sharp in c
sharp a backslash indicates the escape
sequence the backslash indicates that
the character should be interpreted
literally or unique
an escape sequence is treated as if
there were a single character first we
have backslash n which means newline
character next we have backslash b which
is used for backspace then we have two
types of backslash which represents
backslash itself after that we have a
single backslash code and lastly we have
backslash double quote now the 31st
question
what are regular expressions search a
string using regular expressions
a regular expression is a template that
can match a set of input operators
constructs and character laterals can
all be used in the pattern for example
regex is used for string passing and
character string replacement an example
occurs 0 or more times before the
preceding character as a result
a star b predicts is equivalent to b
comma a b comma a a b comma a aap and so
on
following is the code language program
in which we have strings as c c plus
plus and c sharp then we have c l as an
object and try to find the string c
sharp as we can see c sharp is present
in the following string so we will print
as a match as found now the next
question what are the fundamental string
operations explain the following are
some examples of basic string operations
the first operation is concatenate a
system can concatenate two strings
string concatenate or use the plus
operator the next string operation is we
have modify replace x comma y is the
function that replaces one string with
another the trim function is used to cut
a string at the end or beginning third
string operation is compare operation
system dot string comparison is used to
compare two strings either case
sensitively or not at all it requires
two parameters the original string and
the string to be compared with the last
operation is a search operation used to
find specific string using the start
with and ends with methods
following question is what exactly is
passing how do you pass a date and time
string the answer with this question is
parsing is a process of converting a
string into another data type for
example consider the string value 100
which we are attempting to convert into
a number variable of integer data type
using pass function
as a result the pass method
converts string 100 into its base type
that is integer
following the same method to convert
date time string string date time is
equals to date july 24 2011.
datetime past while is equals to date
time and past method
date time
we will now move into the advanced level
interview questions
now the first one in advanced level
interview question is what is a delegate
explain
a delicate is a variable that holds the
reference to a method hence it is a
function pointer or reference type all
delegates are derived from
system.delegate namespace both delegate
and the technique that it refers can
have the same signature
declaring a delegate public delegate
void some numbers and number following a
delegate's declaration the
representative must create the object
using new keyword
some numbers sn1 is equals to some new
numbers of number the delegate acts as
an encapsulation for the reference
method which is called internally when a
delegate is called now the next question
how to use delegates with events
delegated authority is used to initiate
and manage events a delegate must always
particular at first following by the
events
this diagram gives three functions to
delete and the delegate to generate an
event that is an event generator
the next question is what are events
events are user actions that cause the
application to receive notifications to
which it must respond user actions can
include mouse movements keypress and so
on
a class that raises an event is known as
the publisher and the class that
responds or receives the event is known
as a subscriber
if an event does not have one subscriber
it is never raised events are declared
using delegates
in this example we have delegates as
print and os and event names as my event
1.
now the next question is what are the
different types of delegates and there
are three types of delegates the first
one is single delegate a single delegate
is a delegate that can only call one
method
the second type of delegate is the
multicast delegate a delegate that can
call multiple methods is known as a
multicast delegate the plus and minus
operators are used to subscribe and
unsubscribe the third type of delegate
is the generic delegate it does not
require a definition of an instance and
it is classified into three types that
is action function and
predicate
so the action is in the preceding
example of delegates the events we can
use the action keyword to replace the
definitions of delegate and even
function a function delegate defines a
method that can take arguments and
results and lastly we have predicate a
method that can be called with arguments
and always returns a bool
now followed by that we have the 38th
question
what do multicast delegates mean
the answer for this question is in c
sharp multicast delicate is a delegate
that holds the references to a multiple
functions when we invoke the multicast
delegate we gather all the tasks that
the delegate prefers for example if you
want to use a delegate to call multiple
methods all the method signatures must
be seen let's see a code example to
multicast delegate
this program uses a namespace delegate
and then declares delegate as a
multi-delegate with formal arguments a
and b
we define the addition and subtraction
functions in the class program which we
declare and calculate as class b and a
minus b respectively then in the main
function we create a class program
object p1 then we declare md1 and md2
objects for addition and subtraction
operations
then we assign md1 to md1 and md2 giving
a value of 100 to a and a value of 200
to b
now let's try to execute the program and
see the output
now the next question is what are
synchronous and asynchronous operations
so the answer for this question is
synchronization is a technique for
writing thread safe code in which only
one thread can access a resource at any
given time before continuing with the
program flow the asynchronous call waits
for the method to complete in
asynchronous mode the method calls
return immediately so that the program
can perform other operations while the
called method completes its work the
async and await keywords are used to
achieve asynchronous programming in c
sharp
our next question is what exactly is
reflection in c sharp reflection is the
ability of a code to access the
assemblies metadata during runtime a
program reflects itself and uses
metadata to inform or change its
behavior
system of namespace reflection includes
methods and classes for managing the
information of all loaded types and
techniques it is primarily used in
windows applications such as viewing the
properties of a button in a windows form
the class reflection members inform
object is used to discover the
attributes associated with the class
following that we have reached the next
question that is the 41st question what
is the generic class
generics is also known as gender classes
create courses or objects with no
specific data type for example the data
type can be assigned in runtime that is
the program uses it
let's see a simple code for generic
class
in this program we have name space as
generic class public class test class
and g to represent the generic class
after that we define an array namely
object 1 of generic type with length 5
then we have int variable as count 1
then we have a function as some adding
items mechanism into a generic type next
we have to keep adding items to an array
until the count plus one is less than
six then we have to keep increasing the
count value by one following that we
have an index variable for each
statement iteration in which we have to
get and set properties the get property
is used to return the index value and
the set property is used to set a value
with the same name as the index value
finally we instantiate a generic with an
integer with the object name int obj in
the main method then we add integer
values to the array and finally we
multiply all the values in the array
now let's try to execute this code and
see the output
now the program got successfully
executed and you can see the output
right on my screen
now the next question explain get and
set access properties
get and set are referred to accesses
properties make to use these the
property implements a mechanism for
reading and writing the value of a
private field these accesses are used to
gain access to a private field the get
property method is used to retrieve the
value of a property to change the value
use set property accessor and let's see
an example to understand this in a much
better way
we have a class name as a person name in
this program followed by two variants
firstly we have a private variable as n
for the person's name then we have
public variable
as name one we have get property that
returns variable n and finally we have a
set property that assigns variable m to
the variable value next the value
keyword denotes the value that we
transfer to the property n next in the
main function we have an object name as
my name where we give the name as abc
and finally we display the person's name
as abc
now the output is on my screen right
over here
now let's get back to the ppt
the next question is what exactly is a
thread
and what is multi-threading a thread is
a collection of instructions that can be
executed to allow our program to perform
concurrent processing confident
processing will enable us to perform
multiple operations at the same time
c-sharp has a thread by default however
the other threads can be created to run
code in parallel with the original code
this is accomplished by having different
threads handle different process
referred to as multi-threading to handle
multi-threaded operations several thread
methods are used start sleep about
suspend resume and join are all options
the next question is name some
properties of thread class
some of the properties of thread class
are first we have is alive property
it has work then when a thread is active
this value is actual
the following property is name which
returns the thread's name also can set
name for the thread following that we
have the next property as priority which
returns the prioritized value of this
task set by the operating system the
background is the following property of
thread class it gets or sets the value
that indicates whether a thread should
be a background process or a foreground
process last property is we have thread
state which describes the thread state
on the next question we have what are
the different states of a thread so the
different states of thread are
unstarted state which means a thread has
been created next we have running state
which means that the threat begins
execution weight sleep joint is the
third stage
in which a threat called sleep another
thread calls weight and another thread
calls join next we have suspense state
the thread has been halted about it is
the next state which the thread has died
but not being changed to the state
stopped
last is we have stop state which means
that this thread has come to a halt
followed by this we have the next
question which is what is a deadlock
a deadlock occurs when a process cannot
complete its execution because two or
more methods are awaiting the completion
of another
this is common in multi-threading
followed by that we have another
question explain lock monitors and mutex
object in multi-threading
a lock keyword ensures that only one
thread can enter a specific code section
at a time the preceding example lock ob
jx indicates that a lock placed on obx
until this process releases it at which
no point no other thread will be able to
access obj mutex is like lock but it can
work across multiple processes
simultaneously for example weight one
method is used to lock the lock and
release mutex is used to unlock it on
the other hand mutex is slower than lock
because it takes time to acquire and
release it monitor enter and observe
internally exits implements a lock a
lock is monitor shortcut internally and
lock objects is called you can see an
example right on my screen
the next question on the list is what is
race condition
a race condition occurs when two threads
access the same resource and attempt to
change it simultaneously it is
impossible to predict which thread will
be the first to access the resource if
we have two threads t1 and t2 both
attempt to access a shared resource
called x if both threads try to access
or write a value to x the last value
returned to x is saved
49th question in the list is what is
serialization and dc realization the
answer for this question is converting
code to binary format is known as
serialization once converted to budget
is simple to store and write to a disk
or other storage devices serialization
is most valuable when we don't want to
lose the original form of the code and
want to retrieve it at any time in the
future
dc realization refers to recovering
c-sharp code from binary form now the
50th question
what are the different types of
serialization now there are various
types of serialization which are as
follows
the first type of serialization is the
xml serialization the second one is soap
and the last and the third one is the
binary serialization
another 51st question what is an xsd
file
so an xsd file is an abbreviation for
xml schema definition it defines the
structure of an xml file it determines
which element should be represented in
the form of xml and in what order and
which property should be current
during serialization of c sharp code and
x sd.exe converts the classes into xsd
compiler form
now as discussed initially we will go
through some coding based interview
questions the document of code will be
sent to you feel free to write your
emails in the comment section below so
that we can respond to you at the
earliest
now program one is string reverse
so you can see that it is converting
simply learn into the reverse string
which is here
now let us go through the second program
real quick
now on my screen you can see the second
program the second program is based on
converting or checking if the string is
palindrome or not let's quickly execute
this
you can see that it is asking for enter
string
let us enter
p op pop
and it is saying as the string is apalan
rom now let us quickly execute the third
now the third one is based on substring
operations let's quickly execute the
code let's enter a string here simply
learn
so here you can see the substrings that
can be created using simply learn
now let's execute the fourth code so
this program is based on if checking the
number is prime or not
so now let's enter a number let's enter
7 which is a prime number which says
number is prime now the fifth question
is based on single ton
now let's try to execute this code and
see the output
now you can see the code got
successfully executed and the output is
over here hello and hi
now don't you worry about the code
please feel free to let us know your
email ids in the comments section below
and we will have this quote sent over to
you at the earliest
now with that we have come to an end of
this session on
c-sharp interview questions if you have
any queries regarding any of the topics
covered in this session or if you need
the code that we have executed in this
particular session then please feel free
to let us know in the comment section
below and our team of experts will be
happy to resolve all your queries until
next time thank you stay safe and keep
learning
