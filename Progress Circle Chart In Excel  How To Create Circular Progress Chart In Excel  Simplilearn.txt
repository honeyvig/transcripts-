hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel right on my screen you
can see a circular progress tracker so
it is tracking the percentage of the
first student that is stacy now let's
try to change the marks of stacy from
engineering subject from 55 to 75
and
engineering subject 4 from 68 to 84
then you can see the percentage is
getting changed and also the same is
getting implemented on the progress
tracker interesting right would you like
to create a similar circular progress
tracker
yes that can be done that's exactly what
we're discussing today so let's get
started with our one point agenda that
is circular progress tracker in excel
now let's get back to the practical mode
so let us enter into a duplicate sheet
which has all the marks of the students
so now we are on the duplicate sheet
where we have all these students names
and the marks list and also the
percentage
now let us create a new column
which states the actual percentage minus
the overall percentage so the overall
percentage is 100 and the actual
percentage is
75 76 and so on let's try to calculate
this or let's try to convert it into the
percentage format
now
let's try to change some values
yeah cool
let's try to change this yeah we were
supposed to add the percentage symbol
which we forgot now it's implemented
there now let's drag it again
so there you go we have the remaining
percentage as well
so we have the actual percentage and the
remaining percentage so we need both of
them to apply the donut check so we have
selected both the percentages and now
we'll enter into insert menu then you
can see a
pie chart icon over here click that and
you have a donut chart over here select
that and you have the donut chart
so now let's remove the
symbols which we don't need so we have
removed the
uh details of one and two there and
let's change this to circular
progress
tracker
so we have removed the legends and we
have
renamed the chart name as circular
progress tracker and now let's try to
insert
the percentage icon
or the texture so you have the text
chart or text box option over here
select that drag and drop it here
yeah we have the text box here select
that go to the formula bar select equals
to and now select the address cell
there you go you have it
now we have the percentage in the text
box
now you can make your edits
i'll bring it to center alignment to
center text color to
blue as we have it on the
outer circle
and you can change the font you can make
it bold increase the font size
there you go so we have the progress
tracker
okay let's try to group the text box
with the chart so that we can move them
all together
okay
so now you can make some changes and see
if that's working or not so let's make
the change to the engineering subject 1
from 32
to 68 and press enter there you go the
changes have been applied the percentage
got changed to 78 from 72 and the same
has been implemented here and even the
progress chart is also working on the
same way so that's how you create the
circular progress charts in excel so
with that we have come to an end of this
session on circular's progress chart in
excel if you have any queries regarding
the topics covered in this session then
