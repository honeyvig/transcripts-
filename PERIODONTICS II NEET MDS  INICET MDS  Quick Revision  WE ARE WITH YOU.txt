yeah Hiers this is Dr Shan from Team MDS
conquer now we'll be having a quick
glance over the subject
periodontics so I hope you're done with
this this is a pick directly taken from
your PP Books Okay so please do uh make
a note of all these uh important
points so hope you are most familiar
with biological width biological width
is a combination of epithelial
attachment and connective tissue that is
0.97 + 1.0 7 that is total in the range
of 2.04 okay the same question can be
asked biological width around the
implant okay so biological WID around
the implant is 4 to 4.5 mm according to
karanza so this is a question that is
given in 20120 neat okay so the defects
so defects are classified basing upon
the number of Walls that are left over
here it is one wall that is left over
here it is two walls that are left over
here it is three walls that are left
over so basing upon which the defects
are called as one wall defect two wall
defect and a three wall
defect then comes the surgical ho
surgical chisel as well as the ho so
please do make a note of this uh this is
a chisel okay so this is a this is a
different chisel this is a road chisel
so please do make a note how they are
used okay hes are used by pull motion
whereas chisels are used by push
motion then comes the types of oous
surgeries okay so that is a positive
architure negative
flat and idle so please do make a note
of the diagrams also nowadays they can
give a diagram based pick over this area
then comes the universal curates and
most of you are familiar with this
Universal curates make a note this is a
2018 neat question that examples of uh
the universal curates they have given so
please do make a note of the example and
the basic uh the basic structure of the
curate then comes the double-ended G
curates okay these are uh area specific
okay so 1 2 3 4 are useful for the
anterior teeth 56 are useful for
the anterior and the and the prolar 78 9
10 are useful for the posteriority that
is facial lingual surface 10 11 are
useful for the posteriority meal side
and 13 14 are useful for the
posteriority the distal side okay so uh
I mean like what are the specific
features that you have to make the four
design features that makes the G curate
very unique they are area specific which
we have discussed already and the second
one is the only one Cutting Edge on each
blade is used and the blade is curved in
two planes the blade is curved in two
planes okay then comes the uh uh the
blade is offset okay so these four
points are very specific to for these
four points are very specific to G
curate then comes this uh recall visit
this is called as Marin classification
so recall visit basing upon which the
patient patients are classified into
that is either first year class A Class
B okay means the Reco Rec call visit
within 6 months to 1 year they comes
under class a recall visit 3 to 4 months
they comes under Class B and uh the C
there the recall visit is 1 to 3 months
so please do make a note conditions
these are the conditions where you have
to go for the visits just have a glance
this is very very important
area then comes the microorganisms in
specific so already discussed that
microbiology along with oral
microbiology is going to carry 14 marks
according to the ne plint so oral
microbiology has its weight is as
already discussed on the groups so these
are uh these are the microorganisms
specific for occurrence of a particular
disease for example if it adult gingeri
is adult pertis for example if it's anug
okay so these are the organisms which
are very specific for occurrence of anug
for example localized juline peridon
this is a question given in 2017 as well
as 18 neat so please do make a note and
again uh antibiotics in specific so
which antibiotic has to be given for
which organism for fre Ginger you have
to go for ayin so see sarly please do gr
negative organisms you have to go for
clomin so please do make a note of these
antibiotics that can be given as a case
based question like giving upon upon
microscopic examination this particular
organism was identified what is the drug
of choice for this organism can be a
question for you so I hope you're well
ver with this that
is
kand knife which is useful for
the ginger rectomy what is radius of
action regular value for the radius of
action is 1.5 to 2 mm okay sometimes it
goes beyond beyond 2.5 millim so larger
defs Beyond 2.5 mm can be seen in the
case of two conditions one is your
localized Zine parodontitis and second
one is your PL
syndrome the next comes as already
discussed these are again uh must read
aspects okay so uh like Jolan Peron dat
is the first option is AA the second
option is PJ jaalis so basing upon the
preference like uh the underlined stuff
are more important when compared to the
rest uh tooth breast specifications okay
so tooth breast specification numbers
ads specification number is one uh 119
and 120 are the ads specification
numbers and ads specification dimensions
of the length is 1 to 1 to 1.25 in uh
withth is 5X 16 to 3x 8 in 2 to four
rows 5 to 12 tfts per row and the
surface area please do make a note of
the surface area too
and of course the brzil hardness is
directly proportional to the diameter
inversely proportional to the length and
coming to this the soft that is 0.2 or
0.07 in 0.3 or 0.12 in is medium hard is
0.4 mm or 0.14
in okay so already discussed what are
Lifesaver shaped okay these are most
common in the case of Canon and the
prolar these are basically due to the
trauma from occlusion or inflammation
next one is stillman's clifts which are
most commonly seen on the facial surface
these are due to Trauma from occlusion
or
inflammation then comes the difference
between the sub jingel and Supra ging
calculus do make a note of this then
comes uh MMP MMP 1s are basically
concerned with the fiberblast myoides
macrophases and epithelial cells and
they called also called as collagin one
mmp8 is mostly concerned with
neutrophils it is called as collin2 mmp4
are meman type and uh the bone uh the
bone resorption interlukin is interlukin
1
F7 and I hope most of you are very
specific to this very clear about this
okay St states of gingivitis initial
stage early stage established stage
established is 14 to 21 days the
difference between the established and
the early stage is uh except the blood
statuses and coming to the or uh
predominant cells the plasma cells are
predominant in the established phase
whereas polymorph nucleosides are
predominant in the initial phase and to
the clinical features they can ask blood
Ginger blood flow will be more in the
initial phase whereas the change in the
size uh color texture are more in the
case of an established relation coming
to the types of grafts already these the
types of graphs are already discussed
recently on the group that is autograph
same individual different part allograph
taken from a different different
individual it can be taken from a
different
individual alloplastic is taken from a
non- living Zen graph is taken from a
nonhuman of different species examples
of autograph allograph xenograph and
alloplastic graft isograph isograph is a
common as equ question like the graph
between the
identical same genetic material best
option is same genetic material or
identical twins identical twins means
they have the same genetic material that
is called as an isograph and I hope you
are well familiar with these types of
Jones which are given by the scientist
four zones bacterial Jone neutrophilic R
Jone necrotic Jone and Jone of lucos
cytic Jone of SP infiltration and this
question was already given okay Spyro
kits can be seen found as deep as 300 mm
from the surface the majority of the
spites in the deer Jones are
morphologically different from the
cultivated cultivated strains of dromia
microen okay so the next one is uh again
you can they can ask you the stage what
is stage one stage two stage three stage
four stage five stage six stage seven so
stage seven is necrosis peripher of the
cheek okay your stage seven is called as
Noma make it not your stage seven is
NoMa okay finished station deance
question given in 2020 this question is
commonly repeated what is finish station
what is deance diagram based types of
extraoral fulcrum okay Palm up Palm down
okay when they used everything this is
the common question for both your
operator interest as well as your period
Eva system a very important thing a old
question but uh like anything can be
given in the examination hall right so
it's the most effective and least
traumatic instrument for correcting the
overhanging registration not regularly
the regularly your Composites but these
are useful for the Alloys like amalgam
your crowns okay all these whenever you
have overhanging registration this
particular system can be used to correct
them primary colonizer secondary
colonizers already discussed on the
group do make a note of it this is a p
Electric ultrasonic
device and coming to the functions uh
functions and futures of ging epithelium
do make a note of this what are the what
are the cells that represent and
everything then comes the diagram based
question they can ask you the sequence
followed by this followed by this they
can ask you the diagram based question
by giving labeling then comes the
magntic ultrasonic device uh please do
make a note about these important lines
which are under Lear in relation to the
cementum what are the thicknesses what
is hypercementosis what are they and
what is the treatment of hyper cmosis no
treatment is required but care should be
taken when you're planning for the
extraction of hyper sosis
teeth then next comes is a few important
points related to Ginger cular fluid
okay and the relationship of the smoking
on the perodontal pathogenesis all these
are discussed and given in various Mo
examinations so please do make a note if
you're not clear like most of the stuff
what I have included as of now in this
quick revision or in this quick recap is
the memory based of what I feel in my
point of view so underline stuffs are
very very important and most of these
were repeated as questions in our mock
exams
too so what is the amount required and
uh so this is an electronic device
useful for measuring the
fluid these are different
tests so this is a working side uh for
set next comes is the for locations so
grade one grade two grade three grade
four what is the difference between
grade three and grade four what is the
difference between two and three okay
these are the most commonly asked
question do make a note about the
treatment plans for FC also so okay uh
coming to The intraepithelial Bu are
seen in the case of following these
conditions and uh subepithelial are seen
in the case of these conditions please
do make a note this is a common question
for both per as well as your oral path
and oral medicine the next comes the
difference between the peral absis and
perodontal absis and Ginger lapsis and
perodontal lapsis most of you are well
familiar with this okay if you're not
clear and if you have a doubt just have
a glance but questions on these areas
can be easily handled if you're done
with marks and you have a proper
revision a few diagrams okay so please
do make a note of this four steps and I
hope you are well familiar with this
already discussed in Oro quick revision
so this is uh melad incision and uh this
is the different forceps to make a not
of forceps this is right angle forceps
this is an incision so please do make a
note about all the incision all the
suturing techniques and all the surgical
that is oral surgery and general surgery
related stuff so these are the different
types of embur and the devices which are
used to keep the Embraer clean so this
is the Russian tissue forceps this is
sub uh this is sublingual hematoma which
is very specific to the body of the
mandible facture that is col Colman sign
this is a towel clip and ghost cells are
seen in the cas of these four okay and
see what question was given I think in
2017 if I'm not
wrong done for now signing off Dr Shri
from Team MDS conquer guys stay positive
okay uh uh everything will be on your
side on the day of exam trust me this is
going to happen Magics will happen in
the examination Hall we don't believe it
but it happens and don't get panic okay
so because examination is very very
simple format you have a question you
have four options and you have to orient
your brain in a in a pleasant way to
identify the best among the four that's
only the game so it's completely mind
game okay it's not a memory based game
it's a mind game even if you don't
remember the exact value if you if you
know if you know if you have a basic
knowledge okay okay it's going to be in
muers it's going to be in micrometers
it's going to be in nanometers it's
going to be in centimeters you can just
rule out the options and you can
conclude with the right answer trust me
it's going to happen it's going to work
all the best and do well
