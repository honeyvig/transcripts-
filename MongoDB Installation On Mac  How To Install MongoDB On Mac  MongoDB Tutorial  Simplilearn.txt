hello everybody
so today we will be discussing about
how to basically install mobo db
inside your macbook
many people today use macbook and
there's a common question we receive
like how to do the necessary setup
it is very simple
first of all
you have to
go back to your terminal
okay
and inside this terminal to just type
the command name for
brew
space update
number one
in case
if you do not have a preview
i would like to request you
that you
first of all try to install the brew
first
okay so make sure that you install the
grid first
and in case if you do not have the
success or the privilege available to
you so you first use sudo command before
to make it possible
okay number one so you have to just say
brew update
well
next step while the brew update is
happening next step will be you have to
use the same command called sudo in case
if you do not have a privilege
we can use sudo space brew
space
install space
mobile
db
so brew installed mongodb that is the
first command you need to type it
once
you say pre-installed mongodb the
mongodb will get installed in your
system it will take some time
depends on your intent speed once it is
downloaded then in next step what you
have to do you have to basically go back
and create a new folder where because
since it is a nosql database so it has
to have some folder in which
you have to
provide the location where the data will
get stored
so after downloading you have to create
a db directory
this is where the files or the
mobile data files will actually stay
you can create
this directory in the default location
by running this call mkdir
okay space hyphen p
and say slash
data slash db
i'll be
clear and also you have to make sure
that you have
the proper right permission because in
macbook this is one of the very very
common challenge
okay you do not have a permission so
make sure that the data db have a
correct flight permission
so in order to do this you have to use
this command called sudo
space
okay ch1 and after that you can say
hyphen r
and then
you have to use
id
space hyphen
um
okay and then you have to use slash
data slash tb so like this you'll be in
position to give the permission so it'll
ask you the password post that you have
to give the password whatever the
password of your macbook it is
and that's it
and once it is ready
your mobile db is all set
and to start this mongod or mongodb you
have to start the mongod as a server
so if i just have to start so you have
to start with this
 d
i'll be clear now so mobody then after
after you hyphen iphone db path
after that you have to give the standard
sign slash data slash db
you hit enter and you can see now your
mobile database is now
starting up and is now waiting
for your
 client to get connected to
so you have to open the other terminal
parallely
i'm saying
new tab
and here we are just typing
and there we go you
are connected successfully
just type show
dbs
and you are done so friends it is a very
simplified way of how the mongodb can be
installed
into your
macbook very very simplified steps i
told you there are other options are
also available but this seems to be more
better i would recommend to use this
step to make your mongodb installed in
your in
