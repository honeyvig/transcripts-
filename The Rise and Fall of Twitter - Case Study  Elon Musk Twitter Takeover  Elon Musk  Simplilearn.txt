of the staff is catching most of the
attention but what led him to do this is
it a good sign or is Twitter heading to
a downfall today we will dive deep into
the facts about Twitter and Elon Musk to
understand how Twitter built its Empire
and how Elon is revamping it Twitter is
a famous social media website which was
originally a podcasting platform named
odeo based in San Francisco it was built
by Nova Glass Evan will and Jack Dorsey
in early 2000s the launch of podcasting
on iPods by Apple in 2005 caused a pause
for odeo but without giving up Jack
Anova introduced the concept of Twitter
to the rest of the staff it was on March
21 2006 at 12 50 PM Darcy posted his
first Twitter message just set up my
Twitter which was sold for 2.9 Million
Dollar last year initially Twitter had
just won 40 users but in 2007 Twitter
completely dominated a conference named
South by the Southwest interactive
conference a screen was purposely placed
in the conference Hall which was
exclusively used for streaming Twitter
messages during the event Twitter usage
went from 20 000 tweets to 60 000 and it
received the festival's web award prize
from here Twitter began to pick up steam
and instantly became the platform for
knowing what was happening along with
this Fame Twitter raised 1 million
dollar at a 5 million valuation and also
Mr President Obama thanked the Twitter
followers for their support following
the farewell address to the nation which
has become the most popular tweet on the
presidential account seeing all this
popularity and growth Facebook tried to
acquire Twitter in 2008 but Twitter a
growing social media platform rejects
Facebook's offer and becomes a
billionaire Company by getting a raise
of 100 billion dollars at a one billion
dollar valuation in November 2013
Twitter went public with shares valued
at 26 as the market opened and 44 dollar
when it closed today Twitter has become
a popular social media site with 290.5
million monthly active users and a
revenue of 5 billion dollars as the
World Series itself in the middle of
covid-19 social media has become
overloaded with content related to the
virus although Facebook and Instagram
currently provides medical scope perhaps
no other social media platform
consistently recreated a most
significant role in the medical world
than Twitter during this time Twitter
also had 139 million to 186 million
users and 3.4 billion dollar to 3.7
billion dollar in Revenue along with all
this popularity and start them Twitter
also faced some hardships during covet
19. as the Indian government asked
Twitter to remove all the URLs and posts
that criticize the way Indian government
was handling the pandemic situation in
response to these Twitter withdraws 50
posts and content and officially
notifies the account holders
nevertheless Twitter has become one of
the top trending social media platforms
making it a very active in the business
world where so many big investors and
business tycoons are interested in
investing in Twitter shares on that note
Here Comes Elon Musk who was also
interested in buying shares on Twitter
yeah on January 31st 2022 Elon Musk
started to take Twitter share reaching
more than five percent stake by March 14
2022 now what do you think why did Elon
Musk buy shares on Twitter as we all
know Elon Musk has 80 million followers
on Twitter which he will use for
marketing his brands for example Hyundai
has to spend 1.5 lakhs for its
advertisement whereas Tesla needs 20
rupees this is because Elon will do most
of its advertising on Twitter reducing
Quest last advertising costs according
to American Securities and Exchange
Commission the shareholders name Will
publicly announced if the shares take is
more than five percent by April 4 2022
the stake rate Elon reached 9.2 percent
which was announced publicly on April
5th Twitter offered Elon to become one
of the board members after many
controversies Elon said yes to Twitter
offer and after a few days that is on
April 14th he offered to take the entire
Twitter for 43 billion dollars finally
on October 27 2022 Elon took Twitter for
44 billion dollars right after Elon took
over Twitter he made Twitter a public
company to a private company remove the
CEO paragagawal with other Chief
security members who were controlling
misinformation and harmful content in
Twitter he also announced that the
verified Blue Tick Mark which will be
given to people who are public figures
and influencers it is given to anyone
who pays Eight dollar per month as a
consequence of these changes made by
Elon Twitter had a rapid loss of 4
million dollar per day it lost the
biggest Advertiser on Twitter like
General Mills General Motors and 15 plus
other companies who stopped giving ads
on Twitter the number of spam accounts
increased on Twitter due to which the
rates of hatred speech raised all this
leads us to think what was elon's Vision
to do all these changes on Twitter he
learns main objective was to make
Twitter more profitable by making it a
WeChat a Chinese app where users can
tweet chat with each other video calls
play video games and make payments bring
the freedom of speech by giving the
power of free speech to every user of
Twitter make Twitter get a revenue of 26
billion dollar with 931 million active
users by the end of 2028. the key
takeaway from this is firstly never to
give power to someone who can't handle
it and doesn't know its value second
good businesses only have ice on the
price but only great businesses will
focus on the values and lastly the great
business always prioritizes people not
the numbers what do you think will be
the next move of Elon Musk and the
future of Twitter let me know in the
