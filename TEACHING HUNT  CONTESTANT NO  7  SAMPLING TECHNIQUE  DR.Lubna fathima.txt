today i'll be speaking about sampling
techniques
now the sampling techniques will be very
useful for
the researchers
particularly the researchers all the pgs
because these is very compulsory
for them uh to finish the pg so
before doing any study
let it be shorter or shorter
or pieces or any anything
sampling technique plays a very major
role
in doing a proper study with proper
protocol
so that time something technique is very
useful for them
not only for them for all the
academicians
academic staffs who are interested in
doing research
and then last but not the least all the
dental graduates because sampling
techniques is one of the
important questions which will be this
every exam so these are the contents i'm
going to speak
in sampling first i'll tell you about
introduction
uh types of sampling in that there are
two types
uh one is probability sampling another
one is non-property sampling
and probability sampling just simple
random sampling
systematic random sampling stratified
bottom sampling
cluster random sampling multiples and
multi-state non-probability sampling it
is quota sampling
purposive sampling convenience sampling
slow falling sampling
sampling by us an advantage of something
conclusion
introduction in introduction you should
know
clearly about these three terms first is
what is a sample third is
a sampling frame
so i'll give you an example first
this is a universe from the universe
a sample will be obtained a sample
and from a sample the sampling frame
will be obtained
so how it will come is this will be a
perfect diagram for it
so this is a universe
this comes a sample
and this is a sampling frame
for example i do a study
in hospital-based study okay so my
hospital-based
hospital all the hospitals will be my
universe so from
that i particularly select chennai
hospitals
so they will be my
sample and from chennai hospital i
started clearly
this will be a continuous step first you
have to select
a universe then goes the population
and then goes the sampling frame so
without this process
you can't go into the sampling technique
now let us move in classification of
sampling
so i told you probability sampling and
non-property sampling
so probability sampling is nothing but
all
the members
of the sample are a representative
whereas non-probability something is
all the members are not a representative
r not a representative of
whole population okay so this is the
main difference between probability and
non-property samples
and probabilities having resistive types
simple random sampling systematic random
sampling stratified random sampling
cluster and assembly
multi-stage and multiples whereas the
non-probability sampling
judgmental or purpose of sampling quota
sampling convenience number
and snowball now let us move on to the
next slide
and i'll tell you in detail about what
are the different types of property
sampling
merits and demerits and more probability
i'll tell you
on what is judgmental quota convenience
snowball sampling
the types of sampling techniques first
moving on to
probability sampling probability
sampling simple random sampling
systematic random sampling quantified
random sampling
cluster multi-phase and multiplication
what's that tell you what
simple random sampling is nothing but
for example
you take a group of people okay group of
people the group of people you select
randomly randomly one
two three four five randomly if you sell
it
this is called simple random samples in
the simple random sampling there are two
types
lottery method table of
elements
in lottery method you put like a lottery
cheap like we play raja and like this
now you put a lot we gate of
1 to 10 and in that randomly in the
lottery whether whatever comes select
this is called lottery method table of
allowances
you put a table of three into three
tables and in that randomly if you
select
the one
for example you take a class
standard for attendance order
in that they are lalita
lavinia
nazia
these are all the names you randomly
select means
this is simple random sample okay
next moving on to what are the merits of
a simple random sampling and what are
the demonstration
simple random sampling is the earliest
method and commonly used because it's
very easy
to select randomly so this is very
easiest better and commonly used
not any additional information is not
required for example
i do standard for name list i take and i
select the population okay
i don't need about the gender difference
or don't need
in age or nothing i need no information
only standard for nameless is enough
so there is no addition such as gender
geographical area from where they came
from
india or uh uh of whatever state or
district nothing i need about them
other than complete list of members as i
told i need the name display
so complete this along with the contact
information
analysis of data is reasonably easy yeah
analyzing a name list
is definitely easiest but this advantage
is not make no use of auxiliary
information
for example you don't need any
additional information rather than the
name risk for this
type can be expensive and unfeasible for
large problems
for example you are going to do survey
in india so that time
how can you obtain a full uh database
you can obtain a full database of
nameless but obtaining from them is a
difficult task
so it's one of the major name the team
is not not to be represented obviously
they can't be a representative of all
population
i randomly choose them without any
information so that time they are
not a representative of a whole
population
next moving on to systematic sampling
so in systematic sampling here you can
see
uh systematic sampling you
first allocate nine individuals
in that you randomly select the nth
number and number for example
if i take 3 as my enter number so i
randomly select the third individual
got my point so this is the nth number
so systematic sampling you select the n
number this is very simple type of
sampling
and the major merits and demands for
this type is
no mistakes can be obtained now because
it's a nth number you know so no
mistakes can be obtained
more precise than simple random sampling
yeah at least here
you select an nth number but then it's
not precise but here it is this is
present because it comes with the nth
number
more eventually spread yeah obviously
when it's this if list has periodic
arrangement then samples
collected may not be accurate up to
whatever yeah
if they are periodically collected if
you're periodically arranged for example
if i arrange under a distribution
5 years 10 years 15 years and years
and i arrange them like this
for example
so 16 are there right so i i take the
third number
for example these are method so all i
take this 15 age group only
so they are not a accurate
representation of the entire population
now starting by random sampling is a
easy type
nothing much starting
from each stratum you select
randomly you select randomly
so this is starting by random something
i'll give you another example
for example standard for
there are three sessions
section one
section two and section three
in each section you randomly select 20
individuals means
this is first ratified each section
becomes a stratum
there is merits of this is control of
sample size and state that can be like
yeah
see if there are three statements
i can control taking 20 20 each
i have the control and next is
increased statistical efficiency yeah
because my sample size lead statement
is equal statistical efficiency will be
more provides data to represent and
analyze
uh the sub groups enables use of
different methods in stata
okay the b minutes are increase error
will error if subgroups are selected at
different days yeah
for example now i select
a school in that i select
standard one standard six
and standard two well these are my
different stratas
and from them randomly i select 20
people
20 people and 20 people now what happens
the subgroups are of different rates
standard
is nearly six years old for example this
is nearly 12 years old for example and
this is the only 17 years old for
example
so when they are differently
different so this might be your
important evil high cost because
when the strength are differentiated
this is three statements okay when you
different
into a numerous strategy
you might need a high cost effective
cost money should be needed next is
especially expensive of state among
population may be created yeah
if i create a special statum
on population then the
procedure might become cluster random
sampling this very easy one
for example standard four
section one two
and three pradisamai
strata as i told you before
but in cluster random sampling what i'll
do is
i'll take the whole stata as
one cluster got my point
but in stratified random sampling i
don't take whole statum
i take individuals from each state but
that's the time with something
i take this as a whole cluster
so only one cluster i select here is a
typical example
avenue one avenue two avenue three the
people
from avenue one fully as a whole if you
take
then this is called cluster something
then from avenues
if you take this faster this is
called
as a cluster you take you don't pick
from straight up
okay this is a reduced field cost yeah
if i take as a whole number my uh
efficiency that is easy for me easy
with a less decrease
cost
applicable with no complete list of
units available yeah obviously
when i don't have a complete unit then
this feature will be helpful for me
the merits of clusters may not be a
representative of all population yeah
obviously
have anyone ever needed to have anything
with so many age groups and so many
geographies they might not be a
representative
analyze this is more complicated than
stratified example
you analyze this is a little complicated
here you select the stratum you select
randomly
but when you select a cluster you need
some analysis
next uh difference between stratified
and cluster
as i told you before population are
divided into few sub groups
here many sub groups homo density within
those subgroups is very necessary
but in cluster heterogeneity within the
subgroups is seen
whereas heterogeneity between subgroups
within the subgroup is different
between the subgroups is seen homo
density between the subgroups is same
here choice of elements from within each
of two but you know
your random choice of some groups got it
here
from there you select like this three a3
but there it's not like that you said
the whole whole
population
now this is a typical example this is
a stratified and this is cluster now
this
is called a straight um
so in stratum you randomly select
from each cluster from each statement
okay but in cluster is as a whole you
choose as a whole youtube
you choose
as a whole cluster
next now next moving on to multi-state
sampling
in multi-state sampling you divide into
stages
from state you select districts from
district you select villages
from villages you select the household
from household also you can select it as
low solution economic
meet a high socio-economic middle social
economy it's our
rishma sure now we say this so like that
he does it this is called multi-state
something
this will be done in survey system
when a survey in india is done
from india you select some districts
from the streets you select some
villages
from villages you sell itself how those
got my point
merits is no complete list of population
is required
more feasible approach for large
population is required yeah
completely you don't need a complete
list of nameless or something list
is not required your
more feasibility approach for large
population yeah it is most feasible
approach for
large population that population means
example survey
females are several sampling units are
included obviously
places districts uh states all
these are like uh something even
sampling error is difficult to measure
when there is an error it is very
difficult to measure but no
choice for a survey
this method is very
couple is very
applicable but my point
next let us move on to multi-phase
sampling
in multi-phase sampling that it will
move on in
phases in phases okay i'll tell you an
example for example
you go to a school you examine
thousand students this thousand students
almost 800 students have
oral problems
in that 800 students 400 students
needs treatment and in 400 students
200 students it definitely needs
follow-up
follow-up so how it goes like it goes
like
phase of treatments from
thousand you select 800 from 800 you
select 400
from 400 you select 200 so it moves on
like a face
so you call it as multi-face
something okay next moving on to its
merits and demons
this may be adoptive when the interest
is in any specific disease
for example dental caries or oral health
or tuberculosis or leprosy any specific
disease
okay that time this might be useful
less costly less laborious more
purposeful
whereas the medicine is not applicable
if your findings
are not a specific disease of interest
and features like what i told you oral
health problems
but that this might be effective from
any specific
okay now next moving on to non
probability sampling
what i told not probability sampling it
is not a representative
of whole population
so four types judgmental sampling quota
sampling convenience something and
stonewall sampling
judgement system being also known as per
person
okay
okay in non-probability sampling first
moving on to
judgmental supplements so judgmental
sampling
is nothing but i judge the people
accordingly
for example i do
a study a gap study
on students
to examine
their academic performance what of
academic performance okay
performance by an app so what i do
i need effective results
effective in the app results should be
effective enough
so i get bright students
so that the academic performance will be
very good
very good so judgmental i judge
the individuals and take into account
whereas our sampling as we all know
there is a quota for our final year bbs
endo we have a class 1 filling
20 class 2 filling 10
and a composite killing 20 i like that
in surgery we have quota like
extraction we have to do simple
extractions
uh 20 and complex since extraction
step we have quarter eight so that goes
in quota sample for example my quota
is male about 50 means
i select this as my quota and sell it
for samples
okay convenience sampling is very easy
sample
this sample not property sampling this
is the commonly used sampling technique
where according to my convenience
what according to my conveniency i
select the samples
for example i do a study
gap study among the undergraduate
students
and i distribute
according to my conveniency
among the students who are available
right now who are
available at that particular time so
according to my convenience
i select the sample now next moving on
to
snowball sampling so snowball sampling
is nothing but
for example do you do your study on oral
cancer patients
that particularly you do smokers so what
you do is you identify
a single smoker and from that smoker
you tell him that please prefer your
other friends
who smoke
so they refer to
smokers and from that two smokers
you get six smokers from that six
smokers you get two
smokers from that 12 smokers you develop
develop develop kepler
so from a single this you develop
so many you form a cluster
you form a big cluster so this is not
snowballing something snowballing this
you
roll a dice
and make everybody fall into your sample
frame okay this is called snow falling
sampling on as i told you before change
reference
so i tell them to refer refer forever so
the chain
goes on by referring one another so now
next moving on to advantages of
something
the first advantages is that cost
of the investigation will be
reduced for example you do a survey in
india you can't take a whole lot of
india that then what happens
your cost will get increased so this
will help
you to reduce the cost second is a
tarot investigation
it allows us to know the thorough
investigations of
units of samples
third is a sample
can be covered more adequately and then
more depth more depth
and adequate information
info can be obtained by
sampling okay so next moving on to
errors in something first is the absorb
error second is
instrumental
subjective error
second is objective error now what is
subjective
error is nothing but when you
do a party interrogation in the
individuals
what do you do you ask the questions and
give four options
you tempt them and give them a hint that
this is the correct option so that then
comes on the subject error
objective error is i don't know
do not know to record
pp but what i do i record the vp
so what happens fault p
records gets obtained so this comes the
objective error instrumental error is
a pp apac this spectrum monometer is not
working
a record in that it's not properly
working so that comes comes under
instrumental error next this sampling
error is
we have to not choose
small samples
non property error non-probability
sampling is such
is a error only so biased
samples should not be selected by the
researcher okay next is
las vegas a conclusion of sampling
techniques i have discussed in detail
about
all the sampling errors where is the
merits of
all probability and non-property
sampling but you know
the sampling technique will overall help
all the researchers
all the pgs all the students who are
doing
research for a perfect protocol to be
followed in a study
when you don't obtain the sample uh
technique though when you don't seek a
help of a sample technique
what you do you don't get into a
localized population like this you have
to get a specific population
when you do randomization if you don't
do randomization properly
then you will go to non-probability
sampling where the results can't be
applied to a generalized population so
sampling
is very essential for an individual for
a researcher
to obtain results generalizedly okay
so these are my references in which
uh i thank each and everybody who's
listening my uh
lecture patiently and i uh
honestly thank
who gave me such an opportunity to
address you
all and get some knowledge about
sampling techniques
thank you uh each and every one thank
you
