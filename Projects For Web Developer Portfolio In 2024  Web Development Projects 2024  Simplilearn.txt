Now find the course Link in the
description box do you know friends that
building a robust web developer
portfolio involves showcasing a diverse
range of projects that highlights your
skills creativity and problem solving
abilities here are few project ideas
that we are going to discuss today which
will help you to build your portfolio
and it is categorized based on different
aspects of web development and the
different aspects are the first one is
artificial intelligence second one is
blockchain third one is augmented
reality and virtual reality and the
fourth one is internet of things now
let's move on and disc about this domain
artificial intelligence so guys let's
move on and discuss about this domain
which is called as artificial
intelligence and machine learning
integration projects there are certain
projects which you can do it and the
first and the most important thing is
the inclusion of AIML projects in a web
developer portfolio adds a significant
value in a resume so here are certain
projects which you can add up the first
one is predictive text generator second
one is image recognition app let's
discuss about it its feature and
functionality so guys if we talk about
predictive text generator what are the
features for this app you're going to
build a web application which is going
to utilize machine learning models to
generate contextually relevant and
productive text you are going to train
the model on a diverse data set to
enhance its language understanding
capabilities you will be implementing
natural language processing or NLP
techniques for more advanced and context
aware text generation the next one is
image recognition and classification app
here are certain feature and
functionality that you have to add in
this app so if I talk about this app
you're going to develop a web
application which is going to integrate
with pre-trained machine learning models
for image recognition and classification
you're going to use popular Frameworks
like tensorflow.js or py. JS for client
side image analysis you're going to
implement features such as image tagging
object detection and real-time
classification now let's move move on
and discuss about blockchain and
cryptocurrency projects here are certain
projects that you can add up so the
first one is decentralized identity
verification system and the second one
is cryptocurrency portfolio tracker
let's discuss each one of them one by
one so if I talk about decentralized
identity verification system you're
going to create a decentralized web
application which is going to leverage a
blockchain technology for secure and
tamper proof identity verification you
are going to implement a smart contracts
for identity management and use
blockchain Network for validation you're
going to explore integration with
decentralized identity standards like
did which are called decentralized
identifiers now let's move on and
discuss about the next project that is
cryptocurrency portfolio tracker if I
talk about cryptocurrency portfolio
tracker you are going to develop a web
application that is going to allow users
to track and manage their cryptocurrency
portfolios you're going to integrate
with cryptocurrency apis to fetch
realtime price data and historical
performance you're going to implement
features such as portfolio rebalancing
suggestions based on market trends this
is a very amazing project and I hope so
guys you should definitely try this out
now let's move on and discuss about web-
based augmented reality projects if I
talk about these project they are very
niche in their own domain the first one
that comes up to my mind that is
web-based AR shopping application sounds
so amazing right and the second one that
we have all over here is virtual reality
based interactive storytelling I hope so
you would have seen certain application
in today's scenario based on this now
let's move on and discuss about its
feature and functionality on by one so
if we talk about web- based shopping
experience you're going to create an
augmented reality shopping platform
where users are going to visualize
products in their real world environment
you're going to utilize augmented
reality libraries like ai. JS or A-frame
to enable immersive shopping experiences
directly from the browser you are going
to implement features such as product
scaling rotation and placement now let's
discuss about virtual reality based
interactive storytelling in this
application you are going to develop a
virtual reality web experience that is
going to combine storytelling with user
interaction you are going to use web VR
or similar Technologies to create an
immersive virtual reality environment
which is accessible through web browsers
you're going to implement interactive
elements choices and branching
narratives for captivating storytelling
experience now let's move on and discuss
about projects based on Internet of
Things So if I talk about Internet of
Things guys you will be surprised to
know that around 2025 41.6 billion
devices will be connected to the
internet now let us discuss certain
amazing projects which you can make the
first one that comes to my mind is smart
home or automation dashboards it's a
very amazing project and I will
definitely advise you to try adding this
project in your portfolio the next one
is environmental monitoring system it is
also a very amazing project let us
discuss each one of them one by one so
guys if I talk about smart home
automation dashboard here you are going
to build a web based dashboard that is
going to integrate with iot devices for
smart home automation you are going to
implement features such as remote
control of Lights thermostats and
security cameras you're going to explore
realtime data visualization for
monitoring energy consumption and device
status now guys let us discuss about
environmental monitoring system if I
talk about this project guys there are
certain feature and functionalities
which you can include in this what
you're going to do in this project the
first thing is you're going to develop a
web application that has interfaces with
environmental sensors for monitoring air
quality temperature and other metrics
you you are going to integrate with iot
platforms like AWS iot or Azure iot for
data storage and Analysis you're going
to implement features such as data
visualization to display historical
Trends and real-time environmental
conditions so guys after making all
these project you can add these project
to GitHub or other version control
system which will be very beneficial for
showcasing your skills and getting
shortlisted in the software development
industry it not only provides evidence
of your coding abilities but it will
also demonstrate your Proficiency in
both front-end and backend development a
well-documented and organized repository
showcases your project management skills
and commitment to producing quality code
employers often look for candidates with
practical experience and a portfolio of
fullstack projects on platforms like
GitHub which is going to serve a
tangible representation of your
capabilities potentially setting you
apart from other candidates in the job
market so that was all for today's video
