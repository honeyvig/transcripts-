program that fits your experience and
areas of interest and now we are on our
Excel spreadsheet so here we have some
text boxes on the column A and on column
V we have lower and upper okay so um we
have a mix of uh uppercase and lower
case in our text so first we'll try to
convert them to lower case and then
we'll try to convert the entire text
into uppercase so for that you need to
press on equal symbol and select the
lower formula tap and you selected the
function and now click on the cell A3
that's your cell address and press on
okay now all the letters are converted
converted to low case so we had J in the
uppercase which is converted to low case
now all you can do is drag the formula
to all the cells and it will be applied
to all the cells right now let's
similarly try to convert into uppercase
and tab space and there you go you have
selected the formula now the cell
address press
enter and drag the same address I mean
drag the same formula to all the cell
addresses and the echo all the cells are
converted to uppercase now that's how
you can Inver the cells or data in Excel
to uppercase or lowercase in Excel now
we are on the Excel
spreadsheet now here we have some sales
data based on a store now what we're
going to do is we going to add some
multiple rows or a single Row in this
particular data so here you can see the
region wise category Wise statewise
subcategory Wise and the sales and
quantities right now let us imagine that
you must have to add a sale data here
right so let us imagine that on the row
7th you were supposed to add some detail
for example some technology related sale
happened on that day and you missed out
to add it right so how do you create a
new rule now so for example if multiple
sales happened on the same day like 3 to
four and you missed out them so how do I
add three to four rows in between the
existing data right so don't worry about
it it's completely simple all you have
to do is select the row and right click
and press on the option insert now this
will insert one single row if you wanted
to add one single uh row or you know
toule and if you wanted to add multiple
rows for example you wanted to add three
rows all together then it's also simple
all you have to do is select three
rows and right click and press on insert
and then you have three rows so there
you go so that's how you you add
multiple rows in a Excel spreadsheet or
that's how you add one single Row in an
Excel spreadsheet now we have started
our Excel worksheet and here you can see
we have employ details on our worksheet
now all of a sudden uh you wanted to add
employee second name as well or a last
name right so you are a beginner and you
don't know how to add a column or you
know you might be a little ambiguous
right so instead of using this simple
step you might end up creating a whole
new sheet or maybe other approaches as
well which are time consuming so let me
give you this simple step all you have
to do is select the column so here you
wanted to add a last name right so B is
your column with the first name and here
you wanted to add a second name or the
last name which is in between the
columns B and C so remember that Excel
adds a column always towards the left
side of a column so here if I if you
wanted to add a column next to V then
you want to select the column C and
right click and select the insert option
so that it can be added in between B and
C which is adjacent to B so let's look
at it right so you have added the next
uh column or a new column right next to
the column V and it's in between the
designation and employee name now you
can add your you know second name so
that's how you create a new column in
Excel now in case if you wanted to you
know create multiple columns Al together
so uh here we have or here we needed a
second name also here you have a
designation and you wanted to add
another column which you know assigns
manages to the employees right so let's
delete it uh Delete the second column
and let me explain you how what I want
to do so here you wanted to add the
second name of the employee and also the
manager of these employees right so here
you wanted to add two columns Al
together right uh and now you might be
wondering could I add two columns
together or will it work only for the
one column thing right no it works for
two columns and also more than two
columns alt together so you wanted to
add two columns here right so select the
two columns you you can select or you
can click on the column C and hold that
left key and drag it along the right
side okay so here I've selected two
columns and here it's three right so you
can see here uh it's
10485 676 R cross 3C that means you have
selected three columns if I navigate on
the four you can see we have selected
four columns right now right click and
select on insert and you'll have four
columns in between employee name and
designation now you might have to add
your second name manager's name manager
employee ID you know and the department
everything or you can add anything or
any number of columns in between the
existing columns now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet now you might want to you
know add uh some extension to your data
since we have sales here you might want
to add the dollar logo right so if you
have like five to 10 rows then it's easy
but if you have multiple rows then it
might be a little time consuming in such
scenarios you might want to select the
entire column right so how do you do
that in a shortest method so there are
multiple methods to do it so the easiest
one the first and the easiest one is
clicking on the column number or column
name so here we have the column name
that is e and if you click on it the
entire column is selected and here we
have numbers so let us imagine that you
wanted to select the row number two
click on number two and you have all the
rows I mean the entire row selected all
the cells are
selected right so this is one way and
again there is there is another way
where you can just you know uh click on
the first table header and press control
space bar so the combination key is
control space bar for columns and if you
want to select the entire row it is
shift space bar so this is the method
two and another method so you might have
a doubt here right so when you click on
the column name or when you click on the
row number the entire row or entire
column gets selected right and you
wanted to select only the cells which
have data so we have another way for
that so you can select the cell now hold
the control and shift key and press the
lower Arrow key to select the entire
column with cells having data so there
you go you have selected all the cells
in one single column with only data and
all the cells which do not have data are
not selected same applies to rows as
well control shift right arrow key or
left Arrow key based on your rows and
all the rows with data will be selected
I mean all the cells in a row are
selected not the entire row and U coming
back to the first question that is
adding the dollar symbol so here we have
General so go to the data type and add
currency so you have rupees here so
currently we are in India so we have
rupees now what is the advantage of
selecting the entire row when you don't
have any data in the 57th row or the
next cell right
I'll show you now let us add the number
100 and press enter there you go let us
add another number like 1,000 and press
enter so the data formatting is
automatically applied to all the cells
so most of the time your cells or the
data sheet will be varying you might
have to add or remove elements or
numbers right so in such scenarios this
will be helpful now comparing two
different columns or multiple columns
happens to be an important job when
you're working in data analytics as you
you have to come up with some decisive
decisions based on the data now if you
had to do it manually then you might end
up taking hours or even days based on
the data set you're working with but if
I say that you can do it within minutes
then it would be interesting to work
with right now we'll be doing the same
now we'll work on a sample data set
right on my screen so here we have
column 1 and column two now our job is
to compare the column one and column two
and come up with the result now the
first and the simp simplest way to do it
is use the built-in conditional
formatting which comes with Excel by
default now all you have to do is select
all the data and navigate to home and in
the home go to Styles group and select
conditional formatting and in
conditional formatting you can see
highlight cells so in that you can use
duplicate values when you click on
duplicate values a small pop-up window
will come on your screen and here you
have have an option of choosing whether
duplicate or unique so duplicate means
you're comparing the cells and you can
see there are some duplicate cells which
are present in column one are also
present in column two now you can also
check how to uh you know find out the
unique values which are only present in
column one but not in column two so you
can just press unique and there you go
you can find it now you can also try to
you know change the color by filling
with green for The Unique columns and do
duplicate cells with color red now this
was the first method and you can also
work out some different ones like uh you
can just directly uh press equal to and
select the cell and equals to and the
next cell press enter and if there is a
match it will give you true if there is
no match then it will give you false now
you can drag it down and see which all
are matching and which all are not now
you can also make some minute
modifications to this so uh if in case
you didn't find the data then you can
say not found so for that uh you can try
if and inside brackets and then you can
give the value as not found if true it's
found first you have to give the True
Values so for true you can write it as
found and in case if it's not found then
you can write it down as not
found there you go close the bracket
press enter and there you go if there is
a perfect match you will have found and
if there is no match then you'll get not
found now so far we have discussed uh
comparing two cells using conditional
formatting and also by using equals to
operator and trying to uh add some
tweaks to the equals to Operator by
involving with if operator and apart
from those we also have another way to
compare two columns in ex Excel so
another way is using the lookup
functions so we'll use a simple V lookup
function to compare both the cells so
for that let's type in equals to we look
up space and uh select the cell you want
to check for and then the range of
elements you want to uh compare and then
I'll press F4 to log
them
now uh you want the data from column
one and now you want the exact match so
zero press enter so there you go so the
elements which are present in column 1
and column two are been displayed here
so but in case if the elements are not
found you'll get an error so let's look
at that simply drag the formula to all
the cells and there you go so the
elements which are matching will give
you the proper result but the ones which
are not matching will give you not
applicable or error message this can be
fixed we can make some minor tweaks to
the same
formula so uh we can add if
error
comma simply write an as not
found
and close the bracket so that should do
so we have closed the bracket and press
enter there you go now simply drag this
and soon you can see the data which is
having no match is shown as not
found now uh there is another
possibility okay let's get back to
another different sheet so this should
work so uh we we already have the
formula so let's erase that first I'll
erase the whole
data and even this
one yeah now we have the clear column
for so here you can see we have Ford
India and here you can see we have just
Ford and similarly here you have
Mahendra and Mahendra and here you have
Mahindra right so in some situations you
might have to compare two different
columns but the names might be a little
different right so for example uh if
you're working with Oracle and if you're
working with Oracle America and you have
in the first case is Oracle and in the
second column is Oracle America then
those are one and same but you have some
minor text changes right just like here
you have for India and here you have
Ford so what if you had such kind of
issues so you can also make some minor
tweaks to it so using the same lookup
formula you can add equals to we look
up and also the comparision cell which
is this one and you're not you're not
stopping there you're trying to add the
wild card here so the wild card is HRI
which means if there is anything like uh
if you get the comparison between the
first cell and the second cell which
matches and if there is anything extra
rather than the actual cell please try
to consider it so that's what we going
to do so after entering entering the
wild card symbol you'll select the range
of columns which you have to uh you know
fetch the data from and then try to fix
them using function key
F4 you're looking from the column number
one and then you're finding the exact
match now you can close it and
enter now let's try to drag it
there you go so you have the data
Mahindra and Mahindra hindai India Honda
India so that's how you try to use uh
comparing cells in Excel now you can see
I'm on my Excel worksheet and I have one
table on my worksheet right now so you
can you know transposing or you know
converting rows to columns is a very
simple task I'll explain you in two
different ways so the first way okay
select all the sales that you have on
your sheet and press on contrl C so it
will give you the copy option and then
you can also paste in the same sheet or
if you want you can go to a whole new
sheet and select the paste option over
here but before selecting the actual
paste option you can see a small drop-
down icon click on that and navigate to
paste special and in this you can see
transpose option click on that or you
know make sure that it's checked and
press okay now you can see all your
columns have been converted into rows
and all your rows are converted into
columns so this was the first way and uh
what is the second way you ask me so
it's really simple select one cell
somewhere and you know you can or let's
create a new sheet as well so here you
can you know write down the formula as
transpose
and select the array which you want to
transpose so this is the
array so transpose is basically an array
function in Excel so once you are done
with you know selecting your data press
enter there you go so all your rows are
now columns and all your columns are now
the rows now on my spreadsheet you can
see some data which is the sales data of
quarterly basis and the four different
zones that is northwest southeast so you
can you know make things look better by
hiding these columns and if you hide
these columns it's critical for the end
user to identify which columns are
exactly hidden right to make things a
little easier for your end user you can
select the columns and then go to the
data option and in the data option click
on the group option so this will group
these columns and you will have the
symbol of minimization which will help
you hide these columns automatically and
unhide these columns automatically now
let's also try to group GH J
columns and there you go now similarly
let's also try to group the rows of
North and rows of
West then you have the row of
South and row of
East right now all these rows and
columns are been grouped now all you can
can do is just click on the minimize
button and those will be minimized
similarly the rules right and to unhide
them all you can do is click on the plus
icon and they will be
unhidden you can also try to ungroup the
columns and rows all you have to do is
select the columns and click on the
ungroup option similarly the row as
well and that's how you can group and
ungroup rows and columns in Excel now we
are on our spreadsheet and you can see I
have some sample data on my spreadsheet
and it does have some blank rows now how
do I eliminate these blank rows so one
step is you can you know select the
entire row and try to right click and
delete
it again this sort of method might take
hours to get rid of all the blank rows
and most of the time you might end up
even selecting the rows with data in it
right so if I want to select multiple
rows then I'll be selecting some rows
with data as well which might be a
little Troublesome in the future now
let's try to use the easier way now for
that go to the find and select option
select the go to special option and in
that select the blanks option and press
okay now hold control key and press
minus key and you will have an option of
deleting the cells now select the entire
row now we are selecting the entire rows
with blank data and press okay and the
cells will be shifted now this was
simple but let me show you another
example so even here we have some blank
rows but in between those blank rows for
example take cell 17 or cell d17 or row
17 we have some data testing and here in
the employee ID we have some data in
a26 and again in b39 we have some data
that is first
name right in such scenarios how do I
eliminate data so we have a simple Logic
for it so all we need to do is add
another row which is to count the number
of cells in the row now that can be
count now here equals to the function is
Count
a let
Tab and the Cs will be from A2 to
G2 press enter now you have 7 so now we
are basically calculating the number of
cells so if you apply the same to the
entire um data set let's drag
it
and there you go so there are certain
places where you find zero which are
basically the empty columns right now
let's do some formatting if you
need let's try to add
filters crl a contrl d and now table
will have filters and headers
now here you can see the drop down icon
click on that now instead of select all
what you can do is Select zero now you
will be highlighted with all the rows
which do not have any data select all
those and press on delete or what you
can do is the same way control
minus there you go
now clear the
filter now all you have is the data
without any kind of blank rows so all
the rows that had some amount of data
retrained and all the data or all the
cells or all the rows which do not have
any data which are completely blank they
have been eliminated so here you can see
columns and rows so especially the
fourth row and the column C right so uh
currently we have data on our uh
spreadsheet and it is exceeding the
number of rows currently visible on our
screen right so when you scroll down you
can see that the header or the headers
of all the columns are getting vanished
or scrolled up along with the data right
and you might want to keep that so that
you'll have reference to every single
aspect of or every single cell data
you're referring to right so for that
reason you might want to freeze this and
also you might have a doubt what if uh
even even I had this data in the column
section right and what if I had to
freeze that and you know when when you
scroll this and keep that data uh set on
the column as it is right so we can also
do that let's look at both of them so
there is a simple process to do that all
you have to do is select the cell uh for
which you want to uh you know set the or
free the column adjacent to it or the
row adjacent to it right so currently I
want to let me expand it so currently I
want to freeze this particular row right
and this particular column so the cell I
would be selecting is the first cell
here that is
D5 right so when I select this
particular cell I can be able to freeze
this particular row and this particular
column so now you need to navigate to
the toolbar and then select the view
menu and inside view option you can see
there is an option of freeze pains right
so click on the drop- down so you can
see three different options as we
discussed earlier we can either choose
to freeze an entire row that is a second
option or you can freeze the entire
column that is the third option or you
can freeze both that is the first option
right freezing rows and columns so let's
select this one and see if our rows and
columns are frozen or not right so now
let's scroll down and you can see our
row is successfully Frozen there right
and similarly scroll towards right and
you can see our column has been
successfully Frozen right so this is how
you freeze rows and columns or you can
freeze panes in Excel now here on my
sheet you can see we have some numbers
that is $10 or
$10.20 $22 $ 53.1 $12 and $110 now the
task is to convert these numbers into
word format that is representing the
numbers alphabetically right this might
be a little curious and we also might
end up searching for a predefined method
which is not readily available in Excel
but there is a way where you can create
a function using Excel VBA or macros now
again creating a macro is completely
complex now identifying the trouble
Microsoft has already come up with a r
available macro code on their official
website which will support the various
versions of Microsoft Excel starting
from Microsoft Excel 365 to all the way
up to the older Excel version that is
2010 now you can scroll down and use
this particular macro function which
Microsoft has readily made us available
and use this to create our own macro in
Excel VBA now let's get back to Excel
and you can create a macro using the
developer option now developer options
will not be readily available in
Microsoft Excel to activate developer
option go to home and go to the options
menu in the
last and here go to customize ribbon and
here in the second drop- down menu you
can see developer option by default it
will not be checked click on the check
option to activate developer options and
press okay now you have your developer
options ready click on developer options
click on Visual Basic and here to insert
a new macro click on the insert button
click on module and a new macro window
is readily available for you now contrl
V to paste your code and your function
is with the name number to text right
now close the
macro and here your function will be
readily
available equals to and the function
name number to text press tab to select
the function and select the cell where
you have the data close the function
press enter now drag the same formula
across all the cells and here you have
the text converted from numbers so here
we have $102 and you have $102 $22 and
no cense $53 and 12 cents $12 and no
sense and $110 with no sense now that's
how you can convert numbers to words
using the macro which is predefined for
excel in the Microsoft website so for
example uh let us imagine that you
wanted to create one single cell for all
the employees in your company which does
the first name second name or last name
including the email IDs at one place
right if you want to do so like let us
let us let me show you how it looks like
so let me copy this here
then that's the first name now it's your
second
name along with the email ID now let us
imagine that you wanted to store all the
employees in the same way right so you
can do this by using combined operation
in Excel now all it takes is just a
simple formula that is equals to and the
first cell
address that is
A2 and you can use an enter sign
now you can use the next cell reference
that as
B2 and then colon and the last s address
that is E2 now press
enter so when you press enter or tab you
will get this particular answer but this
data is completely uh in a state where
you can't understand it right the first
name last name name and the email idid
has got combined all together so you
want to use some spaces right so all you
need to do is just make a little
modification to this particular existing
data so you can press another ENT and
include
spaces and then you can separate the
email ID and the name with some
colon so now we have separated the first
two cells that is the first name and the
last name with the space using the ense
and then again we have used an ENT to
include the colon and see that we have
also included a space between the colon
marks that it gets separated cleanly and
now let's try to press Tab and see the
result so there you go the first name
and the second name is separated by
space and the email ID and the complete
name is separated by a colon now you can
use this to all the
cells and there you go all the first
name last name and the email IDs have
been printed here so that's how you use
the combin operation in Excel and you
can see on my screen we have the sales
data of one single employee in the month
of January okay so this is the sales
data of John and January sales now let
us imagine that we have the same
person's or same John's data of sales of
all the 3 months okay so here we have
the sales data of John for January
February and March and you wanted to
Club all these three months and write it
down as quarter one right so let us try
doing
it now you can see that uh only January
is replaced as quarter 1 and February
and March are still uh remaining the
same so let us try to delete them so we
have deleted them and I think now it
looks like uh this is a sales data of
one single quarter that is qu 1 but
again qu 1 is under column B and anyone
who looks at it feels like this data is
of January February and March and all
the quarter 1 details are only present
in V column but C and D are completely
you know different from this one right
so you don't want that kind of an
impression on your uh you know the one
who presenting to you so in those
situations you want to merge all these
three columns and make sure that the
quarter one is present somewhere in
between the cells so that all the data
looks relevant and uh it it defines that
these data elements belong to qu one
right so there is an option in Excel to
do that so select all the Ts that you
want to merge and going to home button
and in home button get into the
alignment group and select merge and
center so you can do it directly also
you have a couple of more options that
is merge and center merge across merge
sales and unmerge so we'll go through it
one by one so first we'll go through
merge and center so there you go the CES
Cod merged and it has been aligned into
center now again if your manager or
anyone Superior to you wants this to be
you know independent like they want it
to be in terms of January February and
March so that they can have access to it
and month-wise so you want to unmerge it
back right how to do that now so the
same menu and select unmerge and there
you go you have your data back in the
original form again all you have to do
is you know rename a few
cells there you go and you have it back
right so in a few situations okay you
can also add the BS so that it looks
more relevant now um you know now let's
try to March this again and Mar in
Center yeah
now again uh let us imagine that you are
going through an appraisal cycle and you
also wanted to add some comments about
the sales happening in your company uh
regarding uh all the employees right so
also we have that here now let me expand
a little
bit Yeah there so again let's Marge and
center
now uh you wanted to you know uh you
wanted to take a review of your level
one level two and level three managers
so you have all the three um rows here
but you can see the cells are not merged
and uh you wanted to merge every single
row so merging and centering everything
rowwise would be a little time consuming
I mean three columns is okay but what if
you had like uh you had to take a review
from a couple of more managers like 5 to
10 right or imagine a you wanted to
write some random comments apart from
review you wanted to write some random
comments based on month-wise uh sales or
something like that so it would be timec
consuming right so apart from that you
have another option where you you know
select all the sales and come over here
and select the option of merge
across and all the sales will be merged
all together at once and you will be
having those individual rows where you
can write down your reviews like review
one and so on review
two right so this is how the option of
merch across works and we already have
been through the merge and center and
merge is completely similar to merge and
center so this is how merge and center
merge cells and uh merge across and
unmerge cells in Excel now there are
multiple ways to add date to Excel
spreadsheet for example equals to today
this is a shortcut method and you can
enter the done you will have today's
date but again there is some problem
with this kind of approach so today's
date is 4th of September 2022 now if you
open the same spreadsheet after today
that is tomorrow or day after tomorrow
then you will have a concurrent date
that is 5th of September or 6th of
September right the date will always
vary or get updated according to time
now you don't want to change that or you
don't want that to be happening with
employees state of joining right it
should be stagnant it should not vary
right so there is another shortcut way
apart from using the datetime functions
there is a keyboard shortcut where you
can add date to excel that is control
semicolon so this is the shortcut way to
add date to your Excel spreadsheet and
this particular date will not change
this will remain the same constant date
throughout the time now there is a
chance where you might also have to add
time to your spreadsheet that is date of
joining and time of joining right so
there is another simple shortcut where
you can add time by just pressing three
keys that is holding control holding
shift and pressing semicolon then you'll
have the time so this is how you can add
date to your Excel spreadsheet and add
time to your Excel spreadsheet and this
date and time will remain constant it
will not varry like the 3D function that
we have used here so you can see on my
screen we are on the Excel spreadsheet
and on my spreadsheet you can see dates
in column A and different formats in
column CDE E and F respectively Now by
default the data type or the data
present in the a column will be
considered as general and there are a
few situations where even if you try to
format the date in your format like you
know the customized format you may not
be able to do it because it's still
under the general data type so for that
for being on the safer side what we will
do is select the data and navigate to
the data toolbar and in that you have
the text to columns option press that
and remember to have the delimited icon
you know you might be having the dash as
your icon or slash as your icon for the
delimited thing and select that and next
next and here you can see right it's in
general mode so you can press on date
and DMI will be your date format that is
date month and here now click on finish
so it's been formatted now now let's
copy the same data and paste it in all
the four formats so that we'll see the
different formats that we can change to
or customize to right so there you go
let's expand the columns a little bit
now we have day month and year so now
you might want to change a couple of
things right for example you wanted to
change okay let's see the menu so the
way is to select the CES and right click
and select the format sales option and
in here you can see the date function
and in here you can see different types
of modifications that you can do to your
data right
so you might want to also change your
dates based on the location so right now
we are in India and imagine if you
wanted to you know change something
based on us or if you if you're having
your client in us and he wants the dates
in US format you can also change that so
here you can see English United States
and press on that press okay and you can
see it's been changed to us format where
you have years in the first place months
in the second place and dates in the
last place right and now let us imagine
that uh your client does not want the
dates all he needs is just months right
you can also do that get back to the
format sales option go to custom and
here instead of uh you know uh month
date and year all you can do is just
write down month and year here and
select okay so you'll have only month
and year not the dates now your client
is being a little more you know he wants
a little more detail and he wants you to
add a lot of granularity to your data
which includes day time Etc everything
right so you can also do that so the
same way go to format sales custom and
here I think it's in date itself so
let's navigate a little yeah here so you
have the day date month and year press
okay so there you go right so that's how
you can do it and now let's try a little
bit more if we have a few more options
pending so go to format
cells and
custom and you also have
timings so here you have date month year
and timings press okay and there you
have all the timings as well so since
these dates are you know I created them
just a few moments ago to keep it simple
so I did not have to add the diamonds
here so if you are Keen about adding the
timings you can also do that for example
if you wanted to add the timings of the
employees logged in and logged out you
can also do that using the same format
and you can see now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet and you can see we have a
column of dates and on the column B we
have age now how do you calculate the
age using the date of birth so this is
completely simple all you have to use is
the dated IF function or you also call
it as date diff function based on your
choice we also have a specific entire
tutorial based on date diff in Excel for
further information that video will be
linked in the description box below you
can go through it or you can use the end
screens and I Cuts linked to this video
to get back to the tutorial based on
date diff in Excel now let's calculate
the a of these dates or these people
with these date of births so all you
have to do is type equals to and type
dated
F and open a bracket we need three
parameters here that is the date of
birth that is the first parameter now
the second one is the today function
because you're calculating the age of
these people as for today right so we
have a today function in Excel press on
Tab to select it and give close bracket
now comma and if you wanted to calculate
the age in terms of days you have to um
you know give d as the
input yeah here it should be D as the
input and don't forget to use the double
codes here and if you use the single
codes there might be an error so use
double codes if you want it in the Days
part you can give days and if you want
it in months you can give months for now
we want an ear so we will be giving y as
the third parameter and press enter
there you go you have the age here in 26
years you can drag the same function and
you have the ages here as you wanted
right so this is how you calculate age
in Excel and on my Excel spreadsheet let
me expand
it we have two different timings that is
in and out so here we are considering a
scenario where we are calculating the
total number of hours worked by an
employee in an organization so the in
time will be the time where the employee
logged in and the out time will be the
time when the employee logged out so
here we have made some minor cell
formatting so when you right click on
any of the cell you can get back to the
formatting sales option and in that
option we have selected the am p.m so
there is also another option of choosing
the 24-hour timing that is
1320 uh 1330 so this represents the
24hour
format
but since we are you know working on
Office timings let's keep it as Am
Pm okay so there you go so we have our
uh timings of in and out now to
calculate the time difference between
the in time and out time so this
particular calculation is completely
simple all you have to do is press
equals to select out time minus select
in time so there you go press enter and
you have the total number of ask the
employee has been working in your
organization so here all so we have made
some minor cell formatting so usually it
comes out as Am Pm right but instead of
that we have made a minor cell
formatting we have navigated into time
and we have selected the 24-hour
formatting so that we have just hours in
our output however if you are looking to
get certified then hey there we are here
with an amazing course through which you
can catch the eyes of top Recruiters in
the industry allow me to introduce
postgraduate program in data analytics
by simply learn so what are you waiting
for hurry up and enroll Now find the
cost Link in the description box so you
can see that I've got some data which is
first name of the employee last name of
the employee and phone number and let us
assume that uh your manager has given
you a task to identify all those uh
employees which did not give an phone
number so you wanted to identify them
using a check box right like you will be
providing a check for all the employees
that we have received the phone numbers
and you will not be checking the
employees which did not give the phone
number right so let's try to do that so
to include a checkbox you might want to
get into the developer option but for
few reasons Microsoft has disabled
developer option by default to enable
developer option all you have to do is
just navigate anywhere on the ribbon
here and right click and then you can
see customize the ribbon option when you
click into it you will be redirected
into the ribbon option and here you can
see the developer option on the right
side right this one so by default you
can see that your developer option is
not enabled to enable it you have to
check in it and there you go you have it
now so press okay and you'll have the
developer option now go to the developer
option and select the insert option and
and there you can see the checkbox now
draw the checkbox
anywhere I'll draw it over here and
there you go you have the first check
box right now if you want you can even
customize
this so carefully click
it
you can edit the
text and write it
as
done
okay now you can even copy this to all
the
cells just select and drag and there you
go now you can go ahead and check all
the employees which you have received
the phone numbers and you can eliminate
the ones which did not provide you with
the phone
numbers that's how you can do it and
there's also another option where you
can use this to include it in a formula
since this data is only of 25 rows you
can manually check in the data data and
you can leave the data which is you have
not received but what if you had 2500
right then you might need formula so in
such scenarios you can use a formula so
how do you use that so for example uh if
this particular box is checked then you
will get a True Value here and if it's
not checked you will have a false value
then you can use that Boolean value to
include in your formula right sounds
interesting now let's try to implement
that you can right click the cell and
you can find format
control then you can see here you have
an option called cell link here select
the cell
link and press okay so here you can see
if you have checked this the value is
true and if you uncheck
this you can see the value turned false
now you can use this particular cell
reference for including this in a
formula now let us also check how to
include checkboxes on Google Sheets in
Google sheet it's really simple all you
have to do is get into the insert option
and you can see a readily available
check boox you don't have to use any
developer options over here and there
you go you can just check now let us
assume that you're giving an important
presentation and you're also requested
by your manager to add the Excel
document that you have used to create
that particular report which would be
something like this when you click on it
it will open a new Excel document or
Excel Window with all the data in it
right so how do we do that let's look at
the demo now let's have a blank slide
and let's get back to the source where
our Excel file is located that is in my
documents so we are currently in my
documents and we have the Excel file
which we used for creating that
particular report now if we copy and try
to paste it on our Excel document it
would look something like
this and clearly it's not visible and
it's not accessible right so instead of
this there is another way where you can
directly add the Excel document in the
form of logo which is a rather simple
idea all you have to do is just click on
the insert option in the toolbar then
navigate to the text group and here you
will find the option called object click
on the object and it will give you a new
window where you can identify which type
of document or object you want to add
either create or create from file so we
have the file in our local system so
we'll choose create from file browse and
from browse we will go into the
documents section where we have our
Excel file click on the Excel file and
click on okay now if you want the data
or Excel file to be displayed in the
form of an icon then click on the
display as icon section and here you can
change the icon so you can choose any
one of the given options let's choose
this particular one and click on okay
another okay and there you go the icon
will be now displayed on your Microsoft
PowerPoint PPD which is completely
clickable as the previous one whenever
you click on this the Excel document
will be opened so that's how you add
Excel document into Microsoft PowerPoint
now we are on our Excel spreadsheet and
here I'm trying to insert some images
onto my spreadsheet so here we have
company logos and Company brand names so
since we already have the brand names
what we need to add here is the brand
logos okay so how do I add such kind of
an image into an Excel spreadsheet that
you might be thinking that Excel
spreadsheets are just for data not
multimedia image of files right so no
it's not it's completely wrong you can
also add your images onto your Excel
spreadsheets it's completely simple so
click anywhere on the Excel spreadsheet
navigate to the insert button select the
illust ations option from the addin
group click on that and you know in the
drop down you can see the pictures icon
or the pictures uh button click on
that and select from this device or if
you have an online stock image you can
take that or you can also check out from
online pictures for now I'll select the
device this
device and here I have some images the
images what we need are simply learn and
simply code logos press okay or insert
so here you have
them now you can also adjust the size of
the image using the small buttons
here as it over
here and
done so you might be wondering is it all
done is there anything more to do or
just adding an image is done no most of
the times when you create or you work
with Excel spreadsheet you will not just
you know add some data and add a
relevant image to it most of the time
you add some graphs or you most of the
time you'll add some charts uh to
showcase the data dashboard right so it
will be something like this so this is
how you add the image or graph onto your
uh uh dashboard and sometimes you might
not have enough place to uh display your
entire dashboard during those situations
what you do is you try to hide the row
or column so now let's try to hide this
particular row let us imagine that you
wanted to show only uh two uh charts and
there is no space for your third chart
in such scenarios you might want to hide
or remove that third chart okay so let's
try to hide it and see if gets if it
gets hidden or not when you try to hide
it you can see the column A has no data
and the row number four is been hidden
so we have three and five but what about
the image it is still present right so
if you want to make sure that the row
also hides the image then you might have
to do a little formatting with it so
select the image go to picture
format or you can also right click and
directly navigate to picture format
this opens up a set of options and here
you might want to go to the U third uh
one which is picture format third and
select the properties and here select
the option of move and size with celles
so when you select this when you try to
hide this it will also I mean the graph
of the image will also hide along with
the R so that's how you do it so how to
insert PDF in Excel now there are
multiple ways to insert a PDF into Excel
so we will go through a couple of ways
first is here let us imagine that we
wanted to insert some PowerPoint
presentation in PDF format into our
Excel sheet so that it belongs to excel
Basics now click on the cell where you
want to add the PDF or just click any
cell in the Excel spreadsheet then go to
the option of insert in the toolbar then
navigate to text option click on it and
select object and here you can select
create from file and then you can browse
and here you have your Excel Basics PDF
in my documents click on that select
insert so here you can just press okay
and the PDF will be inserted now you can
minimize the size of PDF to fit the
cell there you go the PDF code
successfully inserted into your Excel
spreadsheet now let's discuss about the
second way now the second way is
completely same the only difference is
you can add some logo to your PDF so you
can see it has been added in direct form
of a PDF like what's the first slide of
the PPD but instead of that if you
wanted to highlight it as an icon then
you can select the display as icon
button here and press okay now you don't
have to reformat the size of your PPD or
PDF all you have to do is add the logo
to your PDF and it will also include the
title so this is another way of adding
uh you know PDF to your Excel sheet now
another way so a few times you don't
want the first page of the uh PDF to be
visible or any kind of logo of that PDF
reader to be visible on your spreadsheet
sometimes all you want is some dedicated
image or a dedicated logo right so this
time let's try to add a dedicated image
to our PDF so go to insert again here
you can you can see the illustrations
option click on picture and from this
device so I will select the simply Lars
logo and now you have to resize the logo
a little bit to fit the
cell there you
go you can uh you know click on the
right click button and and select the
option of Link now um select the
existing file or web page option so if
you are interested to learn more on
hyperlink and Excel we have a dedicated
tutorial on that please go through
hyperlinks in Excel by simply learn
which will explain you everything about
hyperlinks in Excel how to insert them
different types of documents to be
inserted and how it works in real time
for now let's try to insert the existing
web page and uh go to documents navigate
to documents and inside this you have
the Excel basic page PDF click on okay
and it has been added to your image so
when you click on it it will open the
PDF document attached to it so when you
hover over to the cell you can see it
will ask you a permission do you want to
continue or not just click on this
ignore the warning so you can see the
PDF has been successfully open convert
PDF into
Excel now to do this let's get back to
the Practical mode and try to convert
some PDF data into Excel now you can see
the PDF document which I'm looking to
convert from PDF to excel so this
particular PDF document has a table so
this is the statewise GST collections
that happened during March of 2020 now
we need to convert this tabula data from
PDF format to excel format now we are on
the Microsoft Excel now to initiate the
process we might want to choose a blank
workbook for this so now we are at the
blank workbook and the complete sheet is
empty now let's go into the data option
in the
toolbar and in the data option of the
toolbar we
have the ribbon of get and transform
data in this ribbon you can see get data
option select that and you can see
various options here from file from
database from eure from other sources
Etc now we need the first option that is
from file
and in that we have a drop- down and in
that drop- down you might want to select
the PDF if you have a Json file you can
also choose from a Json and if you have
the data from XML you can choose that
and even you can extract the data from
text or CSV as well now we need the PDF
option so select the PDF Now navigate
where your file is existing so my file
is on the desktop and now let me select
the PDF document select import now X
Excel will automatically analyze the tab
data in the PDF format and give you the
results now according to excel there are
multiple tabular of formats table one
table two so basically this table is one
in the same so all the 29 states are
fixed in one table itself but since the
PDF is divided in sheets this particular
document is considering the first table
as a separate table and the table which
is present in the third page as a
separate table so we have table one
table two and there are a few more
tables which Excel is assuming that it
might be table but it's not and another
table which is page number 002 it is a
table and another one is right here now
there is an option of selecting all the
tables all together at once or you can
select only one table which you want to
select so if you select multiple items
Excel will automatically give you an
option of choosing your tables you can
just take and select the tables you want
or you can directly select the table you
want on your Excel
sheet so right now let's try to select
multiple tables so I'll be selecting 1 2
4 and five and this particular one is
not a table so I'm eliminating that now
you might want to choose the load option
so Excel is now loading the
data now all the data has been
successfully loaded
loed
now yeah it is giving us a notification
that all the data has been successfully
loaded and now just right click on it
and here choose the option load two and
here select table option and if you want
the data to be U you know loaded to a
new worksheet you can choose that and
select
okay now you can see all the data is
been successfully loaded in the form of
tabular format in the new Excel
sheet similarly let's try to load
another
page in the table
format new
worksheet select
okay and the third
sheet
now get ready to impress your boss by
converting all the PDF data into Excel
sheet just in a matter of few seconds
with few steps and there you go all the
four tables have been loaded
successfully in the form of excel in
just a few steps now this is how you
convert PDF to excel that is how to add
tick mark in Excel now on my spreadsheet
you can see some employee data so
they've been assigned a task and they
want to update the task status as done
and not done using symbolic statements
that is tick mark and into marks now how
to do that it is really simple we'll
discuss two different ways the first way
is to do it by conditional formatting so
click a sell on the task status go to
conditional formatting click on the new
rule yes of course we can use the icon
settings but we want to automated so
click on the new rule right so here
instead of two color scale select I on
sets now go to the settings here we
don't want the third symbol so select no
cell icon and here instead of percentage
number formula let's add just a simple
number and the second one as well just a
simple number now in the icon settings
select Tech Mark you have various types
of them you know the circular Tech Mark
and let's select the generic Tech Mark
without any outer circles and into here
generate x mark and now let's set the
values when the value is greater than Z
it will be green and when the value is
less than or equal to Zer it will be X
and the reference value is zero and here
also the reference value is zero
everything is okay click on okay and
done and here you cannot see the logos
yet we need to add some formula here
which is equals to if click on Tab to
select the symbol and if Cell address C2
is equals to
done then the value should be one else
the value should be zero close the
bracket
enter right now you can see this
particular logo here now drag the same
formula it's done now you can see we do
have numbers you can eliminate those
numbers as well just edit the
rules and here you can see show icon
only click okay and the numbers will be
removed also addit the second one and
there you go the numbers are gone and
only the symbols remain now what is the
second technique the second technique is
available in the developer options you
can activate it by you know uh going
into the options here go to file and
here go to options and here go to
Advanced customize ribbon and in here on
the right hand side you will get
developer options click on the tick box
and it will be enabled now go into
developer options and click into insert
menu click on the form controls or
active X controls select the checkbox
and now just place it over here you know
you can edit this particular checkbox
delete everything drag it as checkbox as
well now you can drag the same cell
across all the functions and you will
have the checkbox as well now you can
click on it and say if it's done or not
that is how to add what to Mark to excel
now on my sheet you can see some data so
here we wanted to add some Watermark
logo to your Excel spreadsheet so that
it looks genuine and work by you right
so that's the overall idea of adding a
watermark now go to the insert window
and in the insert window go to the text
option click on that select header and
footer once you select header and footer
you can see something on your screen
like this so in this box which is
highlighted by a cursor is where you're
going to add the picture on my top in
the menu bar you can see header and
footer elements in this select the
picture element and it will navigate to
you to a different option window since
we are adding the image from our local
system select from file or if you are
adding from your Bing or any search
window you can also add that or one
drive as well but now let's go with from
file it will directly navigate you to
the pictures folder in your local system
so here is my simply lears logo click on
it and select insert now you can see the
image just added in this format which is
ENT and picture and you might wonder
where is the picture it is actually
present to view it click on any cell in
the spreadsheet and there you go you can
see it now you might be wondering the
image is a little towards top and
abnormally placed right so no worries
you can always you know format your
picture just press enter and use enter
to move your picture towards the center
of your data spreadsheet and also there
is another option of format picture
altoe here you can adjust the height and
width of your image by you know
increasing and decreasing width or
increasing and decreasing height using
the arrow marks also works and apart
from this there is another option of
picture formatting where you can choose
your image to be washing out black and
white gray scale or anything so
currently I'm going with automatic which
will automatically adjust the brightness
and you know everything for your image
it looks perfectly fine so click on okay
and there you
right so now this should be
fine right now everything is done and
everything is automatically saved if you
are having that auto save option on your
spreadsheet and let's go back to the
normal view from the header and footer
view click on The View and go to
normal you might be confused right where
is the logo it vanish did I had to save
it no it's already saved everything is
fine even the image is there but you
cannot see it in normal view to see it
click on file click on print then you
can see the logo it will be present only
on the printed Pages not on the normal
view okay so that's how you work with
watermarks in Excel and that's how you
can add and customize your watermarks
using Excel how to modify or increase
cell size in Excel now most of you might
probably want to increase just the cell
size or you know just to increase the
visibility of the text so one of the
easiest way is just to press on the plus
icon on the bottom right corner of your
Excel spreadsheet so this will
automatically increase the text size and
you can see the text more clearly now
apart from that if it's just not that
what you want to do you can also modify
by hovering over to the line between two
columns and right click which will give
you the option of format cells or column
width so either of these options will
help you to maximize or minimize your
column withd
similarly you can apply the same idea
for your row as well so you can either
format the cells or modify the row
height of yourself and this is another
way and another simple way is to just
hold that line and drag it so it
improves your width of the column and
another way is to just over onto that
line and hold it and drag it to
improvise or increase your width of the
cell and same applies to your row so
this is another way so apart from that
there is another way that is format
celles from this particular option in
the home button you can select this and
here you have the row height autofit row
height column width autofit column width
for example let us imagine that you
wanted to you know just by mistake you
uh you increase the cell size and you
want it to restore it back to the
original thing right so you can just
click on the autofit height and click on
the autoit column width there you go it
happens in that way and now coming back
to another simplest way let us imagine
that you are given a lot of data and you
are told to autoit all the rows and
columns now we have already seen the
format cell option where will autoit all
the columns and width of the column and
also the height of the rows Etc right
but there is also a keyboard shortcut to
do this so all you have to do is select
a cell and press CR a to select all the
cells in the spreadsheet and once all
the cells are selected all you have to
do is press and hold ALT key and then
release it then the combination of keys
that is h o i so your column width has
been now adjusted now the same formula
or the same shortcut key with a small
modification press and hold and release
ALT key now h o and a to adjust the row
height so this is the way where you can
increase or decrease or modify or
autofit all the cells in Excel now you
can see that we have the First Column
that is a column and the first set of
that is text and all the other cells are
numbers but as a whole Excel considers
the whole column as a general data
format so why are we discussing about
this so to create a barcode in Excel you
have to make sure that all the elements
in the column are of Text data type so
the first step is to convert this
General data type to Text data type so
you can do that by going into the data
type and selecting text and now all the
elements in your first column A are type
text now the next step is to convert
these elements into barcode now for that
let's create a new column called
barcode now our new column that is
barcode has been created now the next
step would be is to check for the
barcode font so the barcode font looks
something like this but let me remind
you the barcode font in Excel is not
available by
default don't worry if it's not
available we can download it from open
source so let's go back to Google
so on the Google you want to search uh
for barod font for Excel so the one that
I would recommend is three of9 barcode
font now you can download this font by
just clicking on the download button
over here now I've already downloaded
this font on my local system let's now
try to install that now the 3 of9
barcode folder will come in the form of
zip folder you have to unzip that and
after unzipping you'll get the setup
file which looks something like this
which is three of9 new select that and
you'll be having the installer file over
here you can install by selecting the
install button over here so I have
already installed it in my local system
so it is readily available for me on my
Microsoft Excel now we might want to
create the barcode for this particular
cell in A2 so let's create that so to
create a BARC code we need to write in a
formula that is equals to double
codes star
double codes and ENT symbol address of
the cell that is A2 another ENT symbol
again double codes star symbol and
double codes so you can either use this
or instead of star you can use brackets
as
well so let's try brackets now select
enter now this will generate another
type of code in your resultant cell now
we will change the font for this
particular resultant cell and we will
get our barcode now you can just drag
all these cells so that you can apply
the formula to all the codes now I got
all the codes over here now select all
the cells get into the fonts and here
select the barcode font and there you go
you have the barcode for all the numbers
you have in your column A so that's how
you create barcode in Excel Excel
flashfill is a feature of Microsoft
Excel where Excel can sense a pattern in
a cell and apply the same logic to
extract the similar resultant pattern
out of the remaining cells in a table
might be a little confusing right so let
us simplify it so let us imagine that
you have a text in one of the cells in
the Excel sheet and you wanted to trim a
part of that text for example let us
imagine that there is an assembly an
assembly where the car parts are
assembled together to finish a car so
each and every part has a code the
serial number the product code and the
assembly code Etc right and you wanted
to separate all those three if you
wanted to do that you might want to use
the trim function which might be a
little treats to apply to all the cells
but what if if I say there is a simple
key format using which you can fill all
the columns in the Excel sheet within a
fraction of second sounds interesting
right so that's exactly the flashfill
function in Excel
does now before we get started let me
tell you guys that we have daily updates
on multiple Technologies if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological Trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
YouTube channel and don't forget to hit
that Bell icon to never miss an update
from Simply now without further Ado
let's get started with the flashfill in
Excel for that we might want to start
the Excel to get in the Practical mode
now we are on the Microsoft Excel and
remember the example we discussed so
this is a similar example now the first
column in the sheet is the product data
detail so this product detail consists
of the product code that is 112 next we
have the product serial number that is 1
25 637 and lastly the assembly code that
is a s and X now we want to separate
this product detail into three columns
where we have the First Column to be
storing the product code second one to
be storing the product serial number and
the last one to be storing the assembly
code so now if you want to do that using
trim function you might want to apply
the trim function here and trim out the
left part and again for the product
serial number you might want to use the
trim function again which might go into
a little complicated pattern So to avoid
the complications and and decrease the
time spent we might want to use the
flashfill in Excel now let us help Excel
about the pattern that we might want to
generate so the pattern is 112 and the
next one is
322 so now you can see that the text was
highlighted that was the intimation from
the Excel that can understood the
pattern now going into the next cell and
holding the control key and pressing the
E button will help us to fill the
remaining cells in the column B so
that's how it is done and similarly
let's try out for the serial
number for that the serial number is
one2
5637 now in the next cell we have
13 6582
now we can go to the third cell and
press contr e for Windows and if you're
using a Mac operating system then you
have to press command e and all the
serial numbers will be filled so this
will reduce the time in separating the
pattern and filling the
columns now let's try the last column
that is ASX which happens to the
assembly code next we have FG and V now
the shortcut method that is CR e and
there you go now you might be wondering
will it work only for numbers etc etc or
the text which is properly aligned or
separated using a hyphen no it can also
be used for some random text which is
like this so let us imagine that we have
a text which is of length like 20 or 30
and you wanted to print only a part of
it so here I'm going to print the
alphabets from position fourth to
position e so I've already tried the
first one that is taking out the
alphabets from fourth location to the
eighth location or the pattern of the
text that is i f e r from Jennifer lope
and in the next cell we have the numbers
starting from the location 4 to 8 so
that is
7767 and similarly we have the other
cells consisting of the names of few
cars that is Alpha Romeo Bugatti Von and
next we have Superman return returns
text so now let's press the shortcut key
that is contr e and make sure that all
the remaining cells are filled so that's
how the Flash Fill works so the Flash
Fill in Excel will reduce the time
consume to fill all the columns by
separating the text in your main cell
that is the column A which we have here
in this example and it also reduces the
complexity of using a trim function in
Excel is hyperlinks in
Excel now hyperlink is something which
is clickable and when you click on it it
will redirect you to a different web
page to a different worksheet or a
different location in your local system
so there are a variety of options and we
will explore all of them using Excel now
creating a hyperlink is really simple we
have multiple ways now let's write some
text on the Excel
worksheet I'll write Simply
longan Now creating a hyperlink is
really simple you have multiple ways the
first simplest shortcut is clicking on
the cell where you want to place the
hyperlink and holding control key and
pressing K now this will enable the
hyperlink menu box or the dialog box
this is the first way and let me close
it now again we have selected the cell
there is another option where you have
to click on the insert menu on the
toolbar and navigate to Links group
click on the link option and you will
again have the dialog box of the
hyperlink and Excel and the Third Way is
right click on the
and you can see the link option in the
last and this will enable the hyperlink
option in Excel now let's create a
hyperlink the simplest way again control
K now we have a variety of options that
is existing file or web page place in
this document create a new document and
an email address so we will address all
of these one at each time so first one
existing file or a web page now you can
select an existing PDF file or any file
in your local system and hyperlink or
create a hyperlink to the text or you
can select a website link and place it
over here and create it as a hyperlink
Let's uh explore both the options first
let's try to explore the web page option
so since I have written as simply learn
let's use the website link of Simply
learn and create a
hyperlink let me open
Google
new tab and let me type simply
learn.com let me copy the hyperlink and
now let's get back to the Excel workbook
now here let's place the hyperlink now
you can press okay and there you go the
hyperlink has been successfully created
now this link is clickable when you
click on it it will redirect you to a
new simply learns home web page right so
this is how you create a hyperlink to a
website s now we should explore another
option that is using an existing file
right let's create a new text box here
let's name it as
existing file and okay existing file
should be good again the same you can
either click uh you know right click and
select hyperlink or control key now
let's select existing file or web page
option now here you can see navigate key
press on that and let's let Navigator
files let's select all files here
remember to select all files okay by
default it shows as office files now
let's explore our file
option so let's select uh fundamentals
of computer programming option which is
a PDF file press okay and there you go
we have created a hyperlink so when I
click on this you can directly navigate
to an existing PDF file in your local
system and it will be open as a web P
click on it and you can see the PDF file
now close now another thing when you
navigate onto this you'll see the lenier
HTTP uh address and same happens here
right so if you're a little
uncomfortable watching this lengthier
link you can also edit it you can choose
the option of edit
hyperlink
and
see the screen dip option click on
it and here you can change the text
display
option and write it as click here to
know
more press
okay again press okay and now if you
navigate onto it instead of seeing a
lenier hyperlink what you you can see is
click here to nor more okay I think I
made a spelling mistake so I think I
forgot an
e somewhere over here yes click here to
no more and press okay right so here you
can see click here to nor more let's try
this again over
here so
edit edit hyperlink screen tap option
and instead of the L text box or
hyperlink you can write it as click to
open
notes or
PDF click okay and click another okay
and you are done so instead of seeing
that lengthier hyperlink you can see
click here to open PDF right so so far
we have explored two options that is
existing file and existing web page
right now let's try to explore another
option again uh hyperlink right click
hyperlink and here you have seen place
this in document all right so which is
like uh okay let me show this to you
instead of telling you so here what it
is doing is you have the cell A5 and you
want it to refer to A1 or any other cell
in the same worksheet so you can do that
right so now for your reference let me
cancel it and let me create a new sheet
and here navigate me to here right let
me write it as navigate me to here okay
so now what we will do is so here we
will create that navigate link from
using the hyperlink option place this in
this document he can see the sheet to
option and the cell reference is E1
where we have written navigate me to
here
so when I click this A5 cell okay let me
also rename
it write it as navigate cell navigating
cell right
now create
that control
K let me select sheet two and the cell
address is A1 press okay now what did uh
what What's the change right when you
click on this you will be redirected to
sheet 2 cell A1 navigate me to here
right so this can be like a shortcut
when you have multiple sheets like 100
sheets then you can uh you know have a
different column over here and uh add
the navigation address to all those sell
links you can just click on that cell
and go into the different sheet and to
the specific cell which you have given
the address in our case I have given
sheet to address cell A1 right so this
is another trick now let's get back to
the hyperlink thing again uh control K
and another option is create new
document so you might have been through
you know option of uh having let's say
some cheat sheets or uh clip on
clipboards right so uh let us imagine
that you're working through uh a huge
worksheet and uh you wanted to you know
uh have a a track of everything and keep
notes updating right so it might be a
little comp complicated to understand so
let me show it practically so let me
write it down as clipboard or sticky
note
right okay I think this has a hyperlink
letter us okay this can be used no
worries back
to uh hyperlink option
again create new document now here you
can create a variet of uh documents
right so it can be a text document it
can be an Excel document it can be a PDF
document right for now we'll create a
text document okay uh we'll name it as
uh
tracker. txt so this should create as a
text
document and the location can be
anything so you can you know uh take it
as a desktop documents download so let
me take documents here and select okay
so I'll be having the tracker. txt
located in the documents
folder and uh you can also choose to
edit the document later or edit the
document now let us select edit the
document now press okay and there you go
so you have your text tracker here so
let us imagine that we have worked on
the Excel sheet and we wanted to write
down us a sticky note uh so that we can
remember what we have done on the Excel
sheet so update one
and uh update to now you can close it so
it'll ask for a save option save it and
um and let us imagine that you did
something else and you also updated
something else on the sticky note I mean
Excel sheet and you wanted to update
that on your sticky note so click on it
and you'll see a minor notice over here
from Microsoft Excel based on potential
SEC concerns you can select yes and
you'll be having access to your text
document again and write down your
update again here update three what you
have written right the latest update
what you
have and you can save it and
close so that's how you keep track of
your sticky note and you'll have all
your updates right now getting back to
the hyperlinks
again uh the last one is email address
so you can also try to add uh okay let
us imagine that your working with a
colleague and every time you make an
update in your Excel sheet or anything
and you wanted to send him out an email
right so it would be a little time
consuming that you open your email and
uh compose something and send it over
here but what if you had uh one single
click and access to the email compose
option right that can be done so let us
write down
email
B me with the spelling so again the
control K and hyperlink select email
option and you can write down your
email which can be anything so you can
write down your friend's email address
so I'm just writing down some random
email here friend
gmail.com
and can write the subject about update
and press okay this will navigate you to
the Gmail option or the mailing address
options click on it and you'll have a
variety of mailing options Outlook
Office 365 Yahoo iCloud Google Etc so
you can select any one of those since we
have written as gmail.com we'll navigate
to Gmail and all you have to do is login
you know all the formalities and you're
good to go with emailing
so let's skip this for now so you you
know how to do the rest parts so so far
we have uh you know covered all the
hyperlink options in Excel that is
existing file or a web page place this
in the current executing worksheet or
document creating a new document for
your update thing and uh also including
the email right so so far we have
covered everything around hyperlink and
Excel and if you have anything to know
more about or if you feel that we have
missed anything important regarding
hyperlink in Excel you can feel free to
let us
know so first we will understand what
exactly is standard deviation so
standard deviation is a calculated
square of variance now what is variance
okay nothing to worry let us also
understand what is
variance now the next part variance so
what is variance variance is a measure
of variability it is calculated by
taking the average of squared d
deviations from the mean now what are
deviations so slowly you can understand
that we're getting into the topic of
statistics and graphs so uh before
getting deep into it let's understand
what is deviation so the deviation is a
measure that is used to find the
difference between the observed value
and the expected value of a variable in
simple terms deviation is the distance
from the center point so for example
when you are going through a graph so
you will be expecting some value right
and if you get some difference that is
above or below the expected point that
is called the devision what is the
difference between the expected point
and the obtained point so that is the
deviation now next is the observed value
so the observed value is the value that
you get in real time unlike the
predicted value so now you might be
thinking to calculate standard deviation
we might need a few more parameters and
you're exactly right so to calculate
late standard deviation in Excel you
need variance and then you need
deviation and then you need mean right
so all these parameters are supposed to
be calculated first and then you will be
having the final formula to calculate
standard TV now that we understood the
theoretical and formula based
explanation about standard deviation
it's time we calculate the standard
deviation using one of the most popular
business intelligence tool that is
Microsoft Excel so let's get back to the
practical
mode so now we are on the Practical mode
and we have some sample data on my
screen right now let me expand it a
little
bit yeah there you go so as discussed
before to calculate standard deviation
we might require the mean variance
deviation and deviation squared and then
we can calculate the standard deviation
so let's go step by step so the first
one is calculating sum right so to
calculate average we might need some of
all the scores so we have the index
values that is 1 to 10 and scores of
each index value that is 1 to 10 right
now let's calculate the sum of all
values here press tab to select the
function select and drag these cells
press enter and then you have the scores
now you want number of indexes so
clearly you can see we have 10 but still
let's count them C N tab space to select
and select the number of cells press
enter and you have count now what's the
mean so mean is simply the average of
all the numbers right so you can either
divide the sum by count or you can
simply use the average function so let's
try to use the average function so that
we also have an idea of how the average
function Works press St to select it and
select all the cells press enter now you
have the average or mean value now we
have the mean value and now after
finding the mean value we are supposed
to find out the deviation so remember
the deviation that is the difference
between the obtained value and the
predicted value right so the obtained
value is this one which is here in C2
and the predicted value is this one that
is 82.6 that's our mean right according
to formula we supposed to eliminate the
value of obtained minus the mean right
so select uh the cell equals to
C2 minus the obtained value that is mean
now press F4 to freeze the value and now
press enter so that you can freeze the
value and drag the formula across all
the cells now you have the
deviation
right now the next step is to find the
sum of all the deviation numbers so
either you can apply the sum formula to
all these numbers or you can just drag
this cell over here
and the formula will be automatically
copied now similarly the count function
to count all the values that us drag it
and you'll have it over here right now
the next step is to find out the square
deviations or the square of the
deviations which is really simple all
you have to do is equals to select the
cell and uh see that small hat kind of
logo on the number six use that now into
two press
enter we have this Square similarly drag
the same formula across all the cells
and you'll have your squar numbers
similarly drag this summation function
over here so you'll have the sum of this
and the count number as
well now comes the final
formula now we have the mean value that
is over here let's color
it and we have the variations
Square now that is which is this one
let's color it in a different shape and
we have deviation as well let's color it
in a different
shape now we need to find the variance
and after we find the variance the last
step is to count the standard deviation
or calculate the standard deviation so
what is the formula to calculate the
variance so for variance you need the
sum of deviations
Square divided by total number of
values minus
1 press enter and that's your variance
now the standard deviation so the
standard deviation is really simple you
need to calculate the variance to the
power
of5 and that's your standard deviation
so that's how you calculate standard
deviation in Excel I hope all the
formulas and the explanation was clear
so you can see that we have got started
with Microsoft Excel and on the left
hand side we have a simple table with
all the teams in an IT industry starting
from it admin testing development to
client consultant support we have got
everything in this particular
table now our main idea is to find out
the index of these particular elements
for example if you wanted to find the
index of the element marketing then how
could you do it so here let's try to use
the match function in Excel for that we
want look up value and position so on
the right hand side you can see that
I've created two separate columns as
lookup value and positions so in the
lookup value column we will be inserting
the value of which you want to find the
index now for example let us consider
that we we want to find the index value
of Team
marketing so I'll be writing Marketing
in this particular lookup
value now how to find the index value of
the element marketing for that we will
be using the match function in
Excel now after writing the match
function you can see that it is asking
for three different parameters
so the first one is the lookup value
second is the lookup array and lastly we
have match type so lookup value is the
value of which you are trying to find
the index that is marketing this
particular cell so we have selected the
lookup value which is the first one next
we have to select the lookup array that
is from which set of elements you want
to find the index so the set of elements
are this it admin testing the column
which we have created created the a
column now we have selected the lookup
array and lastly the match type is it
you're looking for less than or is it
you're looking for exact match or is it
greater than match so for now I want
exact match so I will be selecting the
exact match that is
zero now there you go you have the exact
index of the element that is five now we
have selected all the 10 teams starting
from it1 admin 2 testing three
development for marketing five so that's
how you find the index of a selected
element in
Excel now we just have like 10 elements
so we have got the uh writing of the
elements or you know uh choosing the
elements in a easy way but what if if
you had like 100 elements right could be
a little different okay so let me put it
simple now you wanted to find the index
value of Finance so right now we have
marketing and you wanted to type in
finance and you missed out a letter
A okay now you're not finding the right
index to avoid such problems you can
always take the help of data validation
in Excel that is using the list in data
validation in Excel you can see a small
drop- down icon here right you can
choose that and here you can see all the
names that we have created in the left
column right so here I can scroll down
and choose the finance and there you go
I have the index value okay again we
need to copy paste the same match
function in Excel over
here equals to
match look up
value look up
array and exact
match so there you go that's how you
make use of data validation in Excel and
using the list you can comprehend all
the list elements in this particular
column into the list of data validation
and you can choose the team whichever
you want to find the index for so this
is how you can make use of match
function in Excel or index match
function in Excel to sort data in Excel
so on my spreadsheet you can see some
employee data and on the column f and g
you can see employee date of birth and
employee date of joining for example you
wanted to sort the employee data in the
form of earliest joining employee and
the latest joining employee right that
is who is the employee who joined first
to this company and who is the employee
who joined last to this company so for
that you just need to select the column
of date so let's select both the columns
and go to home and check or verify if
the data type is date or not so
generally the data type will be set to
General by default by Excel so we need
to make sure that we have the proper
data type which is State now that we
have the proper data type select the
entire column and go to the data option
and here select the sort option and in
the sort option select the expand
selection click on sort and here sort by
employee dat of joining
and oldest to newest that's what we
wanted the oldest employee or the you
can also set it to the newest employee
to oldest according to your requirement
but we'll go to oldest to newest
according to the case study right now
just click on okay and that should be
done so Emily who's a manager is the
oldest employee who joined the company
and Chris who is a trainee in it support
is the latest employee who joined the
company now that's how you sort date in
now on my screen you can can see the
sales of four quarters from different
regions that is east west south north
and Central now you might want to
calculate the sum of sales happened from
all the regions in q1 or you might want
to calculate the sum of sales happened
in one region of all the four quarters
that is either you want to calculate the
sum of all the regions from quarter 1 or
you might want to calculate the sum of
all the quarters in one region right so
to do this you have some simple
functions in Excel so you might say me
you have some function Etc right for
that you might want to go into the you
know equals to mode and fetch some
option and subtotal or some you have to
select the function from here but what
if I tell you that there is one simple
easy shortcut where you just have to
make one single click and you'll have
all the sum right so that seems
interesting so on the top in the home
bar select home and in on the top right
corner you have the editing group in
editing group you have aggregation
function that is summation so you have
different aggregations here some average
count numbers maximum minimum more
functions here you might want to select
the sum and you can get all the
sumission numbers here so I'll select
one cell so the second query where we
wanted to calculate the sum of all the
sales happened in each region with all
the quarters included that is this one
C2 to F2 right so let us select G2 and
select the autosome option and here it
will automatically select the range for
you that is C2 to FS2 if you want to
change it can also you know change it
like minimize the number if you just
wanted to calculate the sum of three
quarters you can do that so now we want
four quarters so select enter and there
you go you have all the sales of all the
four quarters of of east region now if
you simply drag it you will have the sum
of all the four quarters of all
different
regions now let us calculate the
summation of q1 of all the regions that
is this one Select Auto Sun and it will
automatically select all the cells for
you that is from C2 to C6 right press
enter and you'll have the summation
similarly you can you know drag it and
you have the numbers here of all the Q2
sales of all the regions Q3 sales of all
region and Q4 sales of all region now
let us try to change the color that you
can have a reference that is it's
different it's it's say total sum or
right you just have a reference to
identify
it now similarly to this one as
well
so that's how you implement Auto sum in
Excel now we are on the Excel
spreadsheet so you can see that I have
five different sheets of the same data
so why do we have that so I'll be
explaining you how to sort data for
multiple parameters so firstly we will
try to sort data in the form of numbers
right so let us imagine that this data
is being shared with you by your manager
and he wants you to sort this data based
on the salary number so he wants you to
arrange the data in the form of
ascending order or descending order
maybe which will help him find the
employee with the highest salary right
so how could you do that so it's really
simple you could sort the entire data
just within a few clicks so how would
you do that so since you're focusing on
salary select any sell from the salary
column only right select this particular
column and select any sell in the salary
column get into the S and filter options
and here select this sort of arrangement
you need that is largest to smallest or
the smallest to largest since the
problem statement was to find the
highest salary click on largest to
smallest and there you go so you have
Tony and the designation is senior and
he works in it support and he draws the
highest salary of
80,000 right and there's also another
one which is Peppa and she works for the
analytics team and now the next sheet
let's get into the the sheet to and this
time let us imagine that you wanted to
you know uh arrange or sort the data
based on the employee date of joining or
date of birth right again if you wanted
to arrange the data in which you find
the youngest employee or the oldest
employee of the organization you can do
that click on any cell in the date of
birth column and go back to the sort and
filter and here you will be seeing the
options sort oldest to the newest or or
the sort the data from newest to the
oldest so since we want the oldest
employee select oldest to newest and
there you go so the oldest employee is
Alfred who is an associate designation
employee and he works in the admin
department and he's drawing the salary
of
25,000 so that's how you can sort the
data when you are trying to sort the
data based on date wise so first we try
to sort the data on the number wise so
you can apply the same for your employee
ID salary and if there is any
possibility you can do that as well and
if you want to apply the same sorting
based on dates you can do that as well
using the Sorting function in the same
way now let's get back onto the third
sheet and here now uh single column wise
is perfectly fine there is no issues
with that now you want it to you know uh
let us imagine that you have two columns
okay let's eliminate a few columns here
maybe we can eliminate the employee ID
and uh okay let's keep a few columns so
we'll just keep employee name and
employee salary okay so here we are
trying to demonstrate if you are uh
trying to sort the data using one cell
in the column B will it maintain its
relationship with the cell a okay uh
that's our query right so let's see I'll
go a little detail so let us imagine
that you wanted to sort this data based
on highest salary okay so when you do
that will it also impact the cells in
the column A so it will basically impact
but just uh it's a query right any of
you viewers might have that query will I
uh if in case if I try to sort the data
based on this will it affect the cells
on the rest of the data set okay so in
basically it will impact so I'll try to
you know sort the data based on
ascending order
so this is the smallest to largest and
you can see uh the Tony and pepper so
since I selected the cell in the column
B it also impacted the change on the
cells of column A so that's how the
Sorting works now we'll get to a little
Advanced um sorting techniques so here
we try to I mean already we try to sort
the data based on numbers based on
alphabets based on U you know uh date
date of birth right so I think we forgot
the uh ascending or you know sorting
based on alphabets let's do that as well
select any um cell in the column A and
go to S and filter try selecting a to z
or okay let's try to Z to A okay so here
you can see the U names have been sorted
based on the descending order from Zed
to a right so so far we tried on
alphabet so far we tried on numbers date
of birth and a couple of more things so
let's dig a little deeper and try to
sort based on colors right so for that
you don't uh you know find that uh extra
setting here in the regular sortant
filter so you might want to get into the
data option and here you'll find another
sort function which is a little Advanced
so that's how you do it so since we have
colored in the cell or column of salary
select that salary and we're going with
cell value so in the cell values section
select the cell color
and here on the cell color options
you'll have green blue and yellow that's
what we have used in our cells so let's
keep Green in the first position which
is on top and press okay now you'll see
green has been sorted to the first
position now yellow and blue are left
out so why is that so because you didn't
provide it right so you can do what that
as well mean you can always add uh the
setting to
it right select any cell go to S
and add a level and then again select
the salary and sell values to sell
colors and now the cell color in the
second position would be blue and that
will be on bottom and I can add another
level the same
salary the cell values will be sell
color and uh cell yellow will be
somewhere in between or bottom okay so
based on hierarchy uh it will be
selecting press
okay and there you go so you have cell
yellow and blue at the bottom and green
at the top position as for your
suggestions now we are on the last sheet
so here in this last sheet we are going
to you know um dig a little deeper into
the advanced sorting methods so
previously we tried to apply the advanc
Sorting methods for colors now we'll try
to apply the advanced sorting methods
based on the data set we have here I
mean the data we have in our data set
right so select the sort option and
let's add a few details right so firstly
let's sort the column employee ID okay
so let's have the smallest to largest or
yeah now that would be good now let's
add another level where we will sort
okay uh I think we will sort based on
employee name that would be a little
better so let's try to uh sort it on
employee name here and here will be
employee salary okay now the cell values
and this would be from a to zed and the
salaries will be from smallest to
largest so basically what we are trying
to do is we are trying to sort the
employee list based on employee names
from A to Z so so the employees name
starting from a to zed will be ordered
first and another subset of the Sorting
will be done based on highest salaries
that is smallest to highest so let us
imagine that we have three employees
with Nam starting from a and their
salaries are 10,000 20,000 and 30,000 so
how would it sort so it will sort
basically uh in the alphabetical order
first so first three names will be
sorted and then it will also have
another condition to sort the data with
keeping the lowest salary on top and
highest salary in the last right so uh
this is how the algorithm works for
sorting now let's press okay and see the
output so there you go the names are
Alfred and you have the highest salary
here smallest to highest so this is
25,000 next we have Banner Barnes and
Ben so here you might be seeing why we
have Ben in the third position despite
he has a low salary and name starts with
B right so here it is trying to work
based on the alphabet that's in the
order right so B A and B E it's not just
comparing the first letter it's also
comparing the following letters as well
right so n comes first R comes later so
bonds is pushed to the second position a
comes first and E comes later so B A
letters are pushed to the first position
and Ben is pushed to the third position
so that's how it works right so
accordingly the set for BA is created
here 3540 next Ben 12 and next you have
Bobby Brian Brock Chris Clark right so
that's how the data has been organized
and sorted based on multiple levels of
parameters you provide for sorting so
that's how you use sorting in Excel
slicers and filters in
Excel so slices in Excel are software
filters used along with Excel tables or
Excel pivot tables over a large amount
of data not just filtering out data but
slices also help you with an easy
understanding of the information being
extracted and displayed on the screen
now Microsoft Excel slices are
compatible with Windows and Mac and tou
operating systems now let us understand
how to implement slicers in Excel so for
that we might want to get back to the
Practical mode that is starting our
Microsoft
Excel now we are on our Excel sheet and
as you can see on my screen there is
some data available on the Excel
spreadsheet and this table is not just
any table this table from Microsoft
Excel is been converted into an actual
table as you know by default Excel
considers all the data which has been
inserted into the spreadsheet as a
database and to implement this slices in
Excel we might want to create or convert
the format of database into a normal
table for that you can select all your
data and just press contr T and that
will allow you an option called convert
the data into table now since since this
table is already converted as a table we
can directly start implementing or
inserting slices into the
spreadsheet now for that select all your
data then going to the insert
option and in the insert ribbon you can
see the filters group and in the filters
group select the option called slicer
now you will be provided with multiple
options since we have the columns
employee ID employee name Zone
designation Department salary employees
date of birth and employees date of
joining so we can choose any of the
options available according to our
columns and create the slices now let me
select the first one that is Zone next
designation department and let's also
select employee
name now press okay and there you go we
have our
slicers now let us try to rearrange
these slices all you can do is just
select and drag them
up and done now let us imagine that we
want to see or take a look at the
employees who are working in the EAS
Zone then we have all the information
displayed on the screen who are working
in the East Zone they are Jack Tony bner
fled Etc and they Department designation
etc etc all on one single screen so this
really helps you while you're presenting
your data in a presentation now for a
change let's try to select the
department now if your client wants to
select the data from only analytics
Department then you might want to select
on the analytics key on the department
slicer and there you go you have an
employee called Luke hops who works in
the East Zone and his department is
analytics and his designation is
contract based and the salary he is
getting is
65,000 now
similarly uh you can see that we have
only selected analytics and your client
also wants data from itop now you can
see that analytics is gone but what if
you want both analytics and it support
then you have an option called select
multiple then you can select analytics
and it support and if you want HR you
can also do that and in the zone if you
want West along with East then you can
do the same east and west and you have
all the employee details and in the
designation let's try to select U senior
traine okay select multiple senior
traine and manager so that's how you do
it so that's how it's done and that's
how you implement slice in Excel to
simplify the filtering options using
slicers during a presentation it is
really simple to add filters in Excel so
we are on a practical mode right now so
on my screen you can see an Excel
spreadsheet of sales data so here you
have various columns regions category
state subcategory sales quantity and
much more right so now let us imagine
that we want to add filters on the
region part so we have south west east
Etc right so we want to you know let us
imagine that you want to extract the
data of only vest region and you wanted
a filter so doing it manually could take
a lot of time so using filters will be
helpful now select one cell on the
headers part and select the filter
option in the data toolbar you can see
the data option on the toolbar right so
click on the data option and navigate to
sort and filter uh group and in that
select the option of filter now you can
see the filters are been added to all
the column headers region category state
subcategory sales quantity right now we
wanted the West category so when you see
or when you click on the drop down icon
you can see all the options are selected
right the central east west south every
everything right but now we just want
West one so click on West and select
okay there you go so you have everything
from the west region now let's imagine
that you wanted to look into uh office
supplies only or technology only right
you can do the same with the technology
and press okay and now you'll have all
the technology related sales in the west
region right so that's how you use
filters in Excel however if you are
looking to get certified then hey there
we are here with an amazing course
through which you can catch the eyes of

box
so what is data validation in Excel so
it is a feature by Microsoft Excel where
it can restrict data entry into certain
cells by using data validation and it
will prompt the users to enter valid
data in the cells based on the rules and
restrictions provided by the creator of
that particular sheet now this would be
a little confusing to understand so to
understand it in a much better way let's
get back to the practical way where we
will start entering some data validation
rules to our Excel sheet and try to
enter data into it now we are on the
Microsoft Excel and this particular
sheet is based on employee ID employee
name employee Department employee salary
fiscal year and work timings of the
employees now we will be applying some
data validation rules to each and every
column and try to enter data based on
the rules we have entered now for the
first one which is the employee ID we'll
enter rules based on the employee ID
number so to apply the data validation
you need to go into the data tab on the
toolbar and inside the ribbon you can
see data tools group and in the data
tools group you have the option of data
validation now select the entire column
go to the data tools group select data
validation option and you will have this
particular popup menu and here you can
see different types of options so since
we are entering employee ID it would be
whole number so let us select whole
number option and now here you can see
the option of between not equal to equal
to not between greater than less than
Etc so let us select between and let us
assume that your employee ID has five
numbers and uh it should be between
10,000 to
11,000 so let us provide
10,000 and 11,000
now select okay and now the new rule has
been
applied so now the minimum value of each
and every employee ID should be equal to
or more than 10,000 and less than 11,000
and it should have five digits now let's
try to enter a wrong employee ID that is
just one there you go you can see that
Microsoft Excel is not allowing you to
include a wrong number it says this
value does not match the data validation
restrictions defined for this cell so
now you can press retry and try to enter
some number which is in between 10,000
to
11,000 now it is
10,901 and this will take the
entry now let us assume that because I'm
the creator of the sheet I know what
should be entered here but what if I
give this sheet to you and you're the
person who's trying to enter the number
and it shows the error and you don't
know what was the error right to avoid
this kind of confusion what you can do
is you can do some uh ways where you can
provide the message to the user so that
can be done by okay let's select the
sheet again and go to the data
validation and here you have the same
settings now here you have another
option saying input message so before
input message let us go to error alert
now
here the error title would be data
entered is not
valid please enter this is the error
message please
enter
EMP I
ID
between
10,000 to
11,000 press okay now when you try to
enter the wrong number it will show that
particular error alert
message see data entered is not valid
please enter employee ID between 10,000
to 11,000 now this is fine but how long
this will be you know what if there is
an option where you just hover over to
this cell and it automatically tells you
to enter the value between 10,000 to
11,000 without having to face the error
yeah even that can be done so you can
select the entire column go to data
validation and here this is the input
message this is where you can do that so
here you can write the message name
valid
data please enter
data
between 10,000 to 11,000 now when you
hover over to any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
show you this message where you can
avoid all the errors just select okay
see when you select any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
tell you please enter data between
10,000 to 11,000 so here you don't have
to face any errors right now let us try
to enter the valid
data
10
9
02 and it will take it as the correct
value and again 1
903 now in case if you try to provide
the wrong number it will show the
error
see so that's how it is now we have
finished the whole number part now let's
get into the m employee name where we
have to
provide uh the second type that is text
length now let us imagine that uh in
your company you're trying to provide ID
cards to your employees and you know
that ID card is really small and inside
that ID card you need to include the
employee photograph and your company
name employee ID blood group phone
number address everything and also you
need to include the name of the employee
so what if there is an employ with very
lengthy name like 30 characters 40
characters yeah in India it is really
possible that you might have a lengthy
name so what you can do is you can
provide the text length where the text
is limited to like 15 or 20 uh um
characters so you can include that name
in the ID card so you can do that by
allowing the data validation criteria
with text length uh minimum can be
anything so minimum can be one and
maximum here you can provide 15 and
press okay okay minimum will change it
to at least uh
two and yeah let it be one so minimum is
one and maximum is 15 characters and
press okay and uh let us also provide
the input
message
enter character type character
data please enter valid
name and error
[Music]
alert invalid
data please enter valid
data okay please enter
characters less than 50
press
okay now let us try to enter a random
name okay uh we'll enter characters more
than 15 here qu t
z uh yeah it's like 1 2 3 4 5
11 okay now this is more than
15 okay I think it's not more than 15
let's try to enter a little bit more
characters
yeah now we have entered more than 15
characters and it is showing please
enter characters less than 15 so now we
can retry and try to enter some valid
name
um now we have characters less than 50
so it will take as the proper name now
let us try to enter another
name
I'm just entering some random
data so another name
maybe great now the next type of data
validation is also done now let us get
into employee Department employee
department is something really superb so
I'll tell you about it it's actually a
list now let us finish the other ones
first that is employee salary physical
year and work timings after that we'll
learn about uh the list one now let's
come into employe salary so salary is
something where you have to include
decimal points so now let us go to uh
data validation and inside the values we
have already dealt with whole
number uh text
length yeah now we'll deal with employee
salary that is decimal now minimum is
okay what is uh minimum can be
[Music]
1.0 and maximum can
be 1
lakh or let us put that as 10
lakhs press okay okay not not just them
uh enter
valid
salary okay now let's change it to
minimum as
10,000 so the employee minimum salary
will be 10,000 and input enter valid
salary
enter
salary
between
10,000 to 10
lakhs let us include a comma here
too now error
alert invalid
salary please
enter
between
10,000 to 10
lakhs press okay now the message and the
data validation conditions are applied
to this column now let us try to enter
some invalid data first it will show the
error now we need to enter the valid
data yeah now it is taking the valid
data let us provide
20,000 and this has
35,000 now the next one is fiscally let
us imagine that we wanted to you know
work on the employees for current
working year that is 2020 to
2021 and or you can consider 2021 to
2022 not more than 2021 and not less
than 2021 for that you can provide the
year option as well so for that that you
need to select the entire column go to
data validation settings and inside here
you have an option of date so uh let us
provide the date option as between and
start date is
01/01 SL
2021 and end date is
01/01
SL
2022 and input
message let us provide data as
current fiscal
year Current financial
year enter
date
between 2021 to
2022 let us copy this and go into error
alert error message will be S
invalid date
select okay now the error message and uh
the data input message and the data
validation rule has been applied for
this column so let's try to enter some
date here you can enter uh 02 of
February
2021 it will take as the correct data
now let's try to enter some wrong data
which is apart from 2022 02
02 20 22 it will not take this it will
throw error so that's how it works now
let us try to enter as
2021 and this is March it will take it
now another
data 04 this time and
2021 so that's how your uh date data
validation will work now coming into the
next type of data validation that is
time so we have time here let us imagine
that you are providing some work timings
to your employees that should be from
9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. not more than
that so you want to keep your work life
Balan for all your employees so you just
want them to work between 9 to 5 and
that should be fine and anything apart
from that time should be invalid so you
can do that by selecting uh time option
between it should be in between and the
start time will be
09 00
and this should
be
uh
17 that is 5:00 p.m. in the
evening and input
message please
enter time
between 9
a.m. to
okay 5
p.m this should be the input
message
now error
alert invalid
time error message okay
now okay work timings now this should be
okay we can do this as two columns
actually let us
cancel let us copy this and paste it
here you can do it as
login login timing and this should be
okay this should be log
out so this should
be okay so this will be considered as
login and log out times now let us
provide the login time this should be
the right time and uh let's try to
provide wrong timings 08 now it will not
take it it will throw as error so it's
working fine let us provide 10 now let
us provide the log out time it should be
below 5:00 p.m. so let us provide 5 it
will take
it
okay let's try to provide something just
one it less than
5 that is
59 okay there is some problem in this
let's check
it okay it is taking uh three that is
including
seconds okay let's provide seconds as
well
05 0 0 0
Z okay still there is some
[Music]
problem okay we have entered four we
should we are suppos to enter 24hour
timing right
14 okay uh it should be 17 I think this
will work yeah now we are following
24-hour timing here so let's provide
another timing that is
16 30 0 0 this will be valid and
1530 yes this is also valid now we have
finished almost all types of uh data
validation things that is we have
finished with any value whole number
decimal date timing test length and the
last one is list so this is where things
get interesting now let's cancel this
now select the employee column now if
you're running a company then definitely
you'll not have only one Department in
it you might have multiple departments
right so let us consider that you have a
software development company so in that
the basic departments will be software
development team and software testing
team
so what you can do is you can provide a
list so using that list you can just uh
H over to that cell select the drop-
down menu and inside that you can select
the option so we will try to work
something like that if we have selected
the entire
column selection
okay yeah let us select the entire
column again go to data validation the
selection contains some cells without
data validation settings do you want to
extend data validation to the sales
yes now let us provide the list
option
[Music]
and here Source you can provide
as
developer and
tester press okay
okay now input message select
one select
one error
alert
invalid
data select from
dropdown
only press okay now when you select the
cell you can see small drop- down icon
right so when you press it you will have
developer and tester option so you can
select developer for first one and for
second one you can select uh tester
right okay this is good for uh one or
two options maybe three or even maybe
like five but what if you have more
departments okay let's go to this uh
second sheet where we have the
department data so here we have like 14
departments no 15 departments or 15
employee type names so the first one is
CEO second is developer tester quality
analyst system analyst Finance human
resource so so many options are there so
you cannot keep on typing all of them
right so here it is 15 what if you have
like 25 like 50 departments right it
will be tough so for this you have
another option so let me select all this
data and copy this from this sheet to
our employee
sheet let us paste it
somewhere here let's expand
this okay now we have our uh list over
here now let us remove the data
validation from this
column clear all okay now everything is
cleared let's select okay now let us
arase this data as
well now let us apply the list data
validation again from scratch go to
list
now here we can select the
source select this particular
cell and drag it until here and it has
been
loaded now go to input
message data
options select one from the menu menu or
the drop
down copy error
alert select only from the drop down
menu invalid entry yeah now let's select
okay fine now you have the icon here you
have all the provided options
you can scroll down and select anyone
out of these you can select knowledge
transfer for the first one and second
one would be system
anist and the last one would
be human
resources now in the list everything is
fine okay this is showing you the menu
options and everything so but what if
you provide this sheet to your new joiny
or new employee in your company and by
mistake he messes up something like
deleting this okay so we have deleted
systems analyst and when you click on
the options here you don't have systems
analyst in that place you have blank
space right so there is a way where all
your U you know data can be messed up so
to avoid this what you can do is you can
actually um save this data in a
different sheet like I did here like
Department data you can hide this sheet
or you can protect this sheet with
password or something so that nobody can
mess this up
so now let us get back to the employe
data and select this column and uh clear
everything press okay and let us also
clear
this and this as well this one too now
let us eliminate the rows or
cells the employee yeah
everything
okay now we have basically removed this
data from here now let us try to apply
the data validation once
again now here let us select as
list and
uh here let us provide the option let us
go to next sheet let us select all these
options and press okay okay let's
provide put
message data
options or Department
options
yeah now let's select
okay now let's hide this sheet now the
sheet has been hidden and you still have
the
options
developer or let us provide CEO
then we have
developer then we
have test so that's how you can protect
your how to protect and lock cells in
Excel now why do we need to lock our
protect cells in Excel let us imagine
that there is an Excel sheet with really
confidential data and you need to pass
that data to your subordinate or your to
make some minor edits now let us imagine
that the edits are supposed to be be
done to only one or two columns and the
rest of the columns should be left as
they are now there is a huge possibility
that sometimes unknowingly or
unwillingly there might be some edits
done by your colleague or your
subordinate So to avoid such kind of
unexpected mistakes you might want to
protect and lock your Sal that you don't
want your subordinate or your colleague
to edit so before we begin be kind
enough to get subscribed to our YouTube
channel and don't forget to hit that
Bell icon to stay updated on the latest
Trends and Tech
content now without further Ado let's
get started with our onepoint agenda
that is lock or protect cells in Excel
now let's get back into the Practical
mode and start our Microsoft Excel now
we are on the Microsoft Excel and this
particular spreadsheet is related to
employee
details yeah now the screen is visible a
bit better now let us imagine that this
is our confidential data and you want to
edit only only two columns that is the
designation column and phone number
column now let us imagine that the
company has finished one annual year and
now there are some promotions happening
in the company and let us also imagine
that the phone numbers of the employees
provided by the company have undergone
some changes so now the minor edits that
you want to make are related to the
designation column and phone number
column now you can see that all the
columns that is the blood group new
salary salary hike current salary and
name of the employee serial number
employee number everything is editable
so in such kind of scenarios when you
pass on this data there might be a
possibility where your colleague or
subordinate might end up making some
mistakes right so you want to avoid that
so you can do that by locking the cells
now let us rename this
sheet now the sheet has been renamed
successfully so now you can log the the
cells by the following
process so in this process you have two
major steps first one is to log the
cells and the next one is to protect the
cells by a password now when you select
all the cells in this particular sheet
you can just click on this edge here and
you have all the cells selected and now
right click somewhere on the sheet and
you can see an option called format
sales so in this particular option you
have some options provided which which
is number alignment font and you want to
go into the protection part so you can
see by default Excel keeps all the cells
locked now we want the phone number and
designation to be unlocked okay so let's
cancel it for now and get back to the
sheet and select the columns D and I and
now let's right click and go into format
Cs and in the protection option make
sure that you uncheck the locked icon
now select okay and
now okay so you cannot include the
merged cell fine we have a cell here
which is merged okay let's remove
that okay now again select the entire
column right click get into format cells
and uncheck the lock option select
okay now we have finished the first part
that is locking all the cells which you
don't want to get edit and unlocking the
cells where you want to make some edits
now the second stage is protecting the
sheet now right click on the sheet name
and you can see an option called protect
sheet click that and now here you can
see select lock cells and also select
unlock cells so let us provide a
password here so let us use some simple
password so that we don't forget that so
I'll be selecting 1 2 3 and now select
okay reenter the password to proceed now
let us type 1 2 3 again now select okay
and now the sheet is
protected now we have successfully
locked and protected all the cells in
Excel now let us verify that the cells
you wanted to protect are really
protected and locked or not so we have
unlocked phone number and designation
and everything else is locked now let me
try and edit the blood group so when I
double click or try to edit this
particular sheet then I'll be receiving
a warning from Excel it says the cell or
chart you're trying to change is on a
protected sheet to make a change
unprotect the sheet you might be
requested to enter a
password so it says that this particular
cell is locked and you cannot edit it
now let us try to edit the phone numbers
which we kept as unlocked so you can see
I can really edit the unlocked cell here
now let me try to change this phone
number let me enter some random phone
number so you can see the cell is
editable now let us go through the
designation column and try to edit this
particular column now since I said that
there's a promotion happening in the
company so the deputy CEO is now the
current CEO of the company and software
developer happens to become the senior
software developer and the tester as
well let us imagine that he will become
the
senior and so on okay so this proves
that this particular sheet is editable
not the entire sheet but only the Cs
that we kept in the unlock
mode
okay now this is how you lock and
protect your sales in X now you can see
that I have sales data on my worksheet
so uh let us imagine that your manager
asked you to find the average of sales
happening in your company right so let's
navigate to the bottommost cell and you
know write it down as average
here okay average
sales
so here this is a cell where you want to
keep your average right so here we'll be
writing a small formula that is
average and tab to select it now you
must select the array of data
right so this is my array since average
is an array function and now press enter
so there you go you have the average
sales data that happened in your
company so to understand the page setup
in in msxl we will go through a demo
inventory in Excel where we'll be
considering some restaurant data now
without any delay let's get started with
the Practical demo now we are on the
Excel sheet and this is the data I was
talking about the restaurant data where
we have the First Column that is Rank
and next we have the restaurant name
followed by that we have the sales
happening through that restaurant and
then we have the segment category that
is what kind of service does that
particular restaurant offers now this is
the list what we made and uh what if we
wanted to represent this data in the
form of a printed paper right so I guess
you can see all the columns and rows
here so you can see that we have almost
like 250 rows so there is no chance or
there is no way to print all those 250
rows in one page of course it is
practically possible but when you try to
read the content it'll be so tough to
read because all the rows will be clued
together so closely so that you cannot
read it so uh you need to print them
Page by page so and you need to also
take care of the data is aligned
properly according to the page size
everything and even you need to take
care of the margins of your page right
so that's what page data basically means
so we had a detailed overview of our
data and what actually we're trying to
make now let us see how page setup is
possible in MSX ex so to go to the page
setup menu or go to the page setup
options we have three methods let's
start with the simplest method so the
simplest method is by just clicking on
file and go to print
option and you'll see all the page setup
options right over here and you can also
go to print menu by pressing a shortcut
method that is controll B so you'll
directly end up on the page setup op
options now let's look at the second
method so the second method is you can
see the toolbar over here right which
has file home insert draw page layout
formulas data review View and help so
the second method we can use page layout
option from the toolbar and you can see
when you click on the page option from
the toolbar you have a new ribbon over
here so this ribbon is all about page
setup options so it will offer you
margins it will offer you orientation
size print area brakes background print
tiles etc etc right so all these options
or menus in this ribbon belong to page
setup now let us look at the third
method so the third method is something
similar you have view option on the
toolbar so just select View and you can
see we have few page setup options over
here as well the normal page break page
layout custom views and we have grid
lines formula bar heading zoom in zoom
out select to zoom free certain panes
right so all these are also the page
setup options so we have the three
methods to enter the page setup options
now we are familiar with those now let's
get started with the Practical mode on
page setup for that let me use the
simplest method that is holding the
control key and pressing P which
navigates me to the print
option now we have various set of
options here we have no scaling normal
margins letter portrait orientation
collated print active sheets and note
one for Windows you can see this option
is the printer's option for example if
you're connected to a printer which is
the hardware printer then your msxl will
show the printer's name here so other
other than printer you can also make
some other arrangements where you can
just directly print your complete data
in the form of PDF and then you can
export your PDF to your recipent that's
also possible okay now let's get started
with the first option that is print
active pages okay to understand this
better we need to create a new sheet not
a problem so you can see that we just
have one sheet over
here so let us kind of select all the
item it and create a new sheet and try
to paste it over here or let's try to
paste it over
here okay now let's try to extend
this yeah this should be fine now let's
rename this sheet sheet uh or let's
rename it as
restaurant
sheet
two for our reference now let us get
back to the print sheet option so I'll
use the shortest method that is holding
the control key and press P now you can
see that here we have six pages in total
from the active sheets so the current
active sheet is the top 250 sheet so
this particular sheet is the current
active sheet so if we print the entire
data in this particular sheet then we
will end up printing six pages now let
us select the other option where you
have to print the entire
workbook right so now you can see that
there's a change in the number that is
12 pages so what is a workbook so
basically workbook is the collection of
entire sheets in your Excel homepage so
in this particular Excel homepage you
have the first sheet that is top 250 and
the second sheet that is the restaurant
sheet two right so the combination of
these two sheets make up a
workbook so when you select the entire
workbook option you'll have 12 pages so
that's how we use this setting where you
select the active sheets the entire
workbook and there is another option
where you can only print a selected item
so if you want to do this then let's get
back here now what if your customer or
what if your client wanted the top 10
restaurants only so you can select the
top 10
restaurants by doing
this now you have the top 10 restaurants
let's go to
print so you can see Excel has
automatically selected the selection
only print the selected content only so
you can see we have only the top 10
restaurants or top 11 restaurants that
we have selected in our sheet and it is
ready to get printed so this is how we
use the first option now let's get back
let's not select that and let's make the
pages normal now get back to the print
option again now you can see the next
option that is
collated right so in collated you have
different different options that is 1 2
3 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 and the next one which
is uncollated 11 1 1 222 333 so why are
these numbers present here and what does
collected mean anyway so this is your
question right now the answer for this
question will be a little similar to
your examination Hall okay let us
imagine that you are an examination Hall
and you are the invigilator and you have
10 students in your room so you wanted
to provide question papers to all the 10
students okay so you have your question
paper distributed into three sheets that
is you have marked questions and your
questions are fit into three papers
right in this scenario we have 250 rows
and all the data is split into six
sheets that is sheet one or page one
page two page three page four right now
if you wanted to print 10 copies then
the arrangement of papers will be page 1
page two page three page 4 page 5 page
six in continuous order right that is
CED if you wanted 10 copies of different
different ways where you wanted to print
the first sheet first then you wanted to
print the second sheet second and the
third sheet third that is you'll have 10
copies of first page 10 copies of second
page 10 copies of third page and so on
that particular approach is called
uncollated approach and if you're
printing the pages in continuous order
for 10 times then that particular
approach is called as collated approach
so this is what we had to learn about
collated and uncollated now let's get
back to the third option now let's press
again print now we have our data over
here there's something
wrong select all the elements control P
yeah now we have our data back now we
have the third option that is the
portrait
orientation okay so when we click that
we have two options that is portrait and
landscape so you might be having a good
idea like when you try to click a
picture in your phone we have two modes
as well that is portrait mode and the
landscape mode so when you click on the
portrait mode this is how your data will
be looking now to understand the
difference let's click the landscape
mode so when you click the landscape
mode this is how your data
representation will change you'll have a
wider page to print so this is why we
use the page orientation for now let's
keep the page orientation as portrait
orientation and we have now the fourth
option so what is the fourth option we
have various sets of options in here
that is letter and A4 size there are
also some more page options over here
where you can select the page types you
want to
print so basically you'll be having few
more options that is A4 A5 A3 Etc but
here we just have two that is A4 and
letter so basically you'll get those
options and followed by that next we
have margins so here you can see we
don't have any margins for our data okay
so now we can add some margins by
setting up this one as an option like
last custom setting or you can also
choose normal wide narrow right so your
page will be changed according to your
mark margin
size right so this is how you can change
the margins now let's keep it as default
let's set the normal
one now we have the next option that is
scaling
option so here you can see we are trying
to fit the page so when you're trying to
print these sheets using no scaling then
the actual size of the page will be
printed now you can also modify that you
can fit and print these sizes so you can
remember the first option that I said of
printing all the 250 rows in one single
sheet this is how you can fit it so fit
the sheet on one page where you can see
all the 250 rows are fit into one page
but the data is not readable so but we
don't want this type of an approach
right so let's keep it as the default
one which is no scaling so these are the
variety of options in print now if you
wanted to print the all the six pages
into the PDF format and mail it to your
client you can also do that I think I
have explained it in the first place so
you can see we can do it by just
selecting this option where you can
print all the six pages and into PDF
format and then you can mail them to
your
client and you can also select the
number of copies you want you can
increase the copies to two three and any
number of uh copies you want for now
I'll keep it as one
[Music]
copy now let's print
this now let us select
the
location rename it and
publish now let's get back to documents
and see if the page is printed or
not here you go here we have the
resturant data in the form of
PDF so we have our entire six pages of
data in the PDF
format
now we are back on the homepage now we
had some limited functions in the print
function over here we had Tri try to
export the data so you can also export
the data or try to print it from the
print option over here you can just
select that as
well
file
PDF yes the pages are printed
now there you go we have the restaurant
2 PDF
[Music]
data so that's how you can print all
your data you can either
choose the export option or you can
either choose the print option now when
you see into the print option we have
limited number of page setup options
over here now let's check out what we
missed so we are in the page layout here
so we had gone through the margins we
had set all the margins and then we have
also gone through the portrait and
landscape now you can see this size when
we were in the print menu option we had
only A4 and letter but here you can see
there are a wide variety of options that
is other than letter we have tabloid
legal statement executive
A3 right we have A5 and many more other
options and if you want some more paper
options you can go to more and you can
always select few more options that's
how you do it and yeah we didn't had the
break option
so remember when we had been through the
print option we did not have the break
option there let's select this to noral
A4 so you cannot see the break option
over here right so here we have the
break option so what does break option
does right you can actually break the
page uh remember we spoke about the top
10 things or the top 10 rows you can
always do that so you can just keep the
top 10 restaurants in your first page
and then break the remaining and to set
page breaks you can select the cell now
I need the top 10 so I'll select this
particular cell which is in the 11th
position and now I'll try to implement
the page break insert a page break and
now you can see on my sheet there is a
thin line which is separating the two
pages that's how you can see the
indication of a page break implemented
onto your page now how do you see it you
can see it by selecting control P where
you can see the first top 10 restaurants
being printed on your sheet so there you
go we have the first top 10 restaurants
printed on our sheets so that's how you
use the page
break now let's try to eliminate all the
page breaks so you can select breaks and
reset all page breaks so the page break
has been
eliminated now you can always choose a
background for your data as well you
just uh if you want you can add a
picture to your background I think
that's not available for
now okay you can work offline as well
let us select this one
so you can see that we have added a
background to our
data we can select all the text files
and then we can change the color so that
the text becomes a little visible yeah
that's how you do it now if you don't
want the image to be added on your file
you can also remove that delete page
background and there you go all the
images are gone now the next important
part that is the print titles
now why do we need print titles for that
let's try to print this so now you can
see the first page in the first page we
have the title rank restaurant sales
segment category but if you go to the
second page you don't have that title
right you don't have the title rank name
of the restaurant sales and their
service category so if we want that then
we need to add titles now for that let's
select the print titles option now let's
select the rows to repeat on top now for
that we need the first row select the
first row and this particular row will
be repeating into all the pages now
let's try to print it so yeah now you
can see the titles are being added to
all the sheets you can see the page two
page three page four page five and page
six so you can see the titles added to
all the sheets now we are on the
spreadsheet so here what exactly are
page braks so page brakes are something
which help you during your trying to
print your data or present your data in
the form of a web page right in those
times you cannot fit your entire Excel
data in one spreadsheet or one paper or
one web page right so in those scenarios
Excel will try to eliminate a few parts
of your spreadsheet or it will try to
split the spreadsheet so how exactly it
looks like so go to the view option and
click on The View and click on page
break review here you can see the dotted
lines right so these are the things
which separate your data in form of
pages so that it can be printable on one
single page so some of the times the
user or the xuser manually inserts a
page break right so how do you insert it
just go to the page layout and here you
can see the page breaks insert a page
break and you have successfully inserted
a page break again go to the view go to
page break View and here you can see the
solid line so these solid ones are the
ones which are inserted by the users or
anyone who had the access to the data
now how do we eliminate them right so we
can eliminate them and we can try to you
know get the shade back to the normal
way so all you have to do is click on
the cell which has the page break which
is right under the page break go to the
insert page break yeah page layout menu
go to the brakes option click on remove
page break and there you go you have
successfully eliminated the page break
and page break preview to make sure that
the page break has been successfully
removed so you cannot see that anymore
so that's how you try to insert or
eliminate a page break in Excel so
conditional formatting is a method to
visualize your work sheet we already
have the charts in Excel to visualize
our Excel sheets in graphical form but
what if you had to see or visualize the
data in your worksheet as it is so that
is where the conditional formatting
comes handy now let's get back to the
Microsoft Excel and try to implement
some conditional formatting now we are
on the Excel worksheet this particular
data set is based on a store now we have
various columns in this particular data
set we have R ID order ID customer name
Etc and finally we have quantity
discount and profits now let's let's go
to profits uh let us imagine that we
have provided this particular store with
a target of minimum 15% profits now let
us find out the stores that have hit the
15% Target and the ones which did not so
for that let us select the entire column
now you can find the conditional
formatting option in the home tool bar
and in that ribbon the ribbon with
Styles has the condition formatting
option click on that and you have
various options open over here
highlighting the cells top bottom rules
data bars data scales and icons so data
bars are actually the bar graphs which
highlight themselves on each and every
cell if you implement them and these are
the color scales if you want to
implement some colors you can go through
that and if you want to represent your
sales with icons you can also do that
for now let's highlight the sales so
select that and inside this select the
greater than option and here you can
provide the person percentage that is
15% and the sales or the stores which
hit the target should be highlighted
with green color and select okay and
there you go you have your stores that
hit the 15% Target and the ones which
did not hit the 15% Target now if we
want to highlight the ones which did not
hit the 15% Target you can highlight
them with the color
red
so conditional formatting
highlight the Cs less than
15% with color red and text dark and
there you go it's done now let us
consider another example so this
particular example is based on train
data set and here we have the passenger
ID survived passenger class name Etc now
we have a train accident incident over
here now one is indicated that they are
alive and zero is indicated that they
are not alive now let us use use this
column and conditional formatting
highlight the cells containing the text
as one with color
green
okay
and highlight the
cells that contain text zero as red that
indicates they are not
alive and let us select the
icons now we have the icons over here
the X indicates that they're not alive
and the Green Tech Mark indicates that
they're alive now that is how you use
conditional formatting in Excel Excel
now here on my spreadsheet you can see
some data so this particular data has
some color markings so we have used
color codes to Mark the designations of
all the employees with different colors
so for example blue for manager purple
for senior and so on right now our duty
is to count the total number of employes
present in a company based on the color
code this can be done using filters but
let's try with color codes now we don't
have a readily available function in
Excel to count cells based on their
colors but we can make use of macro now
to make use of macro you might want to
enable the developer options so by
default these will be disabled in Excel
to enable them right click on the
toolbar and you can see this particular
option click on the customize ribbon
option and you will be provided with
various set of options now on the right
side you can see developer options so
make sure the checkbox is clicked to
enable developer options and press on
okay to completely enable developer
window right now when you click on
developer options you can see various
options here visual Basics macro Etc now
click on the macro to create a macro now
now just give a name to the macro
function so I'll give simply
long and press on create to create that
particular macro function so we have
already created a macro that is Count
colored CS which we will be using in our
current spreadsheet for counting the
colored cells now let us erase the newly
created function now getting back to the
original code so how does this
particular count colored cells works so
let us understand the function first
then we will try try to make use of it
in the spreadsheet so the function name
is Count colored cells as you can see
and this particular function will have
two parameters current cell and
spreadsheet area so the current cell
will be the cell address where the color
you want to count is present and then
the spreadsheet area so what is the
range of cells where you want to locate
that particular color and count the
number of repetion that is the
spreadsheet area and then comes the
variables used colored cell range color
code and color cell count so the colored
cell which particular cell is having
that particular color and what color
code is involved in that colored cell
and colored cell count so what is the
total count what is the total number of
colored cells you have in that
particular range that is colored cell
count now let us consider color code is
equals to current cell interior color
that is current cell do interior do
color so this is the function which will
identify the interior color of a
selected cell let us imagine that
initially color code is equals to the
current cell's color code okay now we
will have the for Loop and that for Loop
will include colored cell which is the
current cell in the spreadsheet area and
if the colored cell the currently
selected colored cell do interior do
color is equals to the color code that
we have selected then colored cell count
the variable which is used to count the
number of colored cells is equals to + 1
initially by default it will be zero in
case if this particular if condition is
true that is the current cell color and
the color code given is equals to same
then the value of colored cell will
increase by one and this particular if
Loop will run as many number of times
the condition is true so let us imagine
that the condition will remain true for
five times then we have obtained five
similarly colored cells in the given
range of cells in a spreadsheet
and once the condition fails then the
latest value present in color cell count
variable will be displayed which will be
a final result so this is how the macro
function works now let's close the macro
window and get back to a spreadsheet now
let us try to make use of the macro
function that we just created so that is
equals to count colored cells press tab
to select the macro function and the
first one is the current cell so this is
the current cell where the current color
is being provided comma the cell range
so our cell range will be from C2 to
c31 right so this is the range where we
want to count the similarly colored
cells that is sky blue colored cells
close the function and press enter now
you can see the function has identified
six reputations of sky blue color in
this particular range of cells now you
can drag the same formula across all the
cells and it will be
providing the results of the same so six
senior colors that is pink or purple
color then two reputations of this
particular color two repetition of
trainy color five for dark blue and six
for green right so this is how the macro
function works and the key point to
remember here is this particular macro
will work only for manually colored
cells so there are situations where we
have used conditional formatting to
color a single cell let us imagine that
we have used conditional formatting to
recognize the employees with salary
above 30,000 as green color and if we
try to use that particular green color
to be counted by the color count cells
function no it will not happen it will
not consider that color as a feedback or
an input now in future we will also try
to design a macro which can recognize
the colors made by conditional
formatting as well but this particular
function will be exclusively used for
manually colored cells only dated F
function is majorly used to find the
differences between two individual dates
so it is also called as dated if by a
few people and a few people also
reference it to date diff that is date
difference so anything is good now to
find the difference between any two
dates let's select a few dates so the
first date would be uh let us imagine
that you're an employee and you wanted
to find out how many years that you've
been working with an organization so for
that you might want to need today and
the dat where you join the company right
so it might be date of joining and
today so what's the difference right so
let us imagine that you join the
organization somewhere around
2010
01
05
2010 and today so for today can you can
give any particular
date let's let us imagine that uh today
is 1st of January 2021 or
2022 now we have up both the dates that
is the joining date and the current date
which can be the current date so the
Daye can be anything so you might be
watching this on a different date as
well so the date of that day for today
would be a little different so we'll
imagine the today's State as an
imaginary date now we might want to find
the difference that is in terms of ear
so you wanted to find the difference in
terms of ear so here you can find the
difference in terms of ear days and
months as well so currently let's try to
find out the difference in terms of
years so for years you might want to
specify the third parameter in the DAT
function as why if you wanted months you
have to give the M as the third
parameter and if you want to find the
days you might want to give d as as the
third parameter uh so we have discussed
the third parameter so what are the
first two parameters right so the first
two parameters are the first date and
the last date so the first date in this
situation is your date of joining and
the last date or the final date which
you want here as your today so let's
find the difference so for that equals
to so it can be dated if or date
diff so date if and and the first dat
which is the A2 and comma the last date
that is B2 and your parameter third
parameter in terms of a status Y close
the bracket and press enter so there you
go you have your date here so it's been
like 11 years that you're working with
your organization so that's how you find
out the differences so we have 11 years
because uh we did not finish the 12th
year completely so if we had given the
month as uh maybe six where we have
finished our total years then it will
automatically change to 12 years
so now for this particular task we will
be considering the student database now
let's get into practical mode and start
our Excel so on my screen you can see
some data related to students now let us
try to duplicate some of the rows here
so we have selected the rows 8 9 10 and
11 now we shall copy them and paste in
so now these are the duplicate elements
right now there might be possibilities
about the duplication of class because
all the students all the 10 students are
in same class so they might be a
duplication but we are not looking for
such kind of duplications right we are
looking for the duplication of the
entire row for example we have the
details of mic over here in the eighth
row which has the role number or serial
number as seven name as mic role number
class blood group and subject scores
percentage round of percentage and total
marks so the entire eth row is been
copied here and it is in the row number
12 we have the exact same details so
what if you have the exact same rows
duplicated so that's what we're going to
deal with we're going to eliminate the
duplicate rowes all completely together
now to carry over this task we have to
select the data from toolbar so you have
various options file home insert Etc so
you need to select the data and inside
data toolbar we have the ribbon and
inside ribbon you have got the duplicate
values or remove duplicates uh option in
the ribbon so select all the data select
remove duplicates and now you can see
that we have all our uh column names
over here and make sure that you have
selected my data as headers and then
select okay and now you can see that
Excel has automatically removed four
duplicate values so four duplicate
values are found and removed 10 unique
values remain now another type of uh
removed duplicates can also be done so
you can see that here we have another
data set which has phone numbers or
phone names that is phone makers that is
Samsung Huawei Vivo Oppo Etc so there
are some duplicate values in this I've
copy pasted them so now you can also do
that so just select all the
data and now go into home and select
conditional formatting and here select
how highlight a cell rules and inside
that you have duplicate values selecting
this option will help you identify the
duplicate values in your data set but
not to remove them so you can select
that and you can see the duplicate
values are highlighted over here in the
red color now again you can get back to
data and select the option of remove
duplicates and select okay and the
duplicate values will be automatically
eliminated so that's how you delete or
eliminate duplicate values in uh data
set and you can also see that we have
another duplicate in this particular row
and if you wanted to select a particular
row and eliminate the duplicates you can
also do that now for that you need to go
to the same process remove duplicates
and here Microsoft Excel is asking you
if you had to expand the selection to
the entire data set or you want to
continue with the selected data set
itself or selected column itself so for
that you need to select the continue
with the current selection and remove
duplicates and press okay and you can
see one duplicate value was found and it
has been removed and six unique values
remain so that's how you use the
function of removing duplicates in Excel
so what is sum in Excel now you might
want to calculate uh the total sum of
sales right so let us assume that this
is your entire stores sales data and you
wanted to calculate the entire sum of
sales so there is a sum function in
Excel where you just have to you know
select all the sales and apply some
function onto it and you'll get the sum
of all the sales right so with something
like this you'll select all the cells
and then you'll apply a sums function
and you'll get the sum here and average
everything right so this is fine but
what if you just wanted to find the
sales that are happening in only western
region as you can see see our column f
is based on region so we have four
regions Southwest East and Central so
your manager asks you to find the sales
happening in suppose say west region so
how do you calculate it would you
manually go into each cell and check if
it's West and calc that will be time
consuming right so what if you had a
method which could do it for you just in
a matter of few steps or few clicks
right so that's exactly sum so it will
Bas basically add a condition calculate
the sum of sales where the region is
equals to West simple to like or similar
to Cal query right so that is exactly
what we're going to do in Excel today
that is using summs now let me add here
Sales of West Region now in the next
cell let's add a sumus function remember
there are multiple sum functions in
Excel so when you type in suum you can
see so many options based on some right
you just have some followed by that you
have some if it is just some if not some
ifs today we are concentrating on some
ifs so not just some if we'll go to some
ifs so we'll be having an option of
placing multiple if conditions there so
let's also try that more on that later
now let's press tab to select our sum
ifs function now okay we forgot another
important step so before we apply sufs
we we need to convert our table into a
table format yes it looks table but
right now it's not in tabular format it
is in the format of database we know
that Microsoft Excel considers its data
as a database by default so to convert
the database into table just click
anywhere on the data and press contr T
so that you'll have a new dialogue box
and it will ask if your table has
headers just make sure that you have Ted
in it our table does have headers so
select okay now our database has been
converted into a perfect table and it's
ready for applying sums function so now
you can see our database has been
successfully converted into our table
now let's begin with our sufs now again
remember we are using some ifs here not
some if or sum so select Su ifs and
press T and we have our sums function
now the first step which column are we
looking at what are we finding out right
which is a sum range what sum do you
want for now we need
sum of sales so select the sales column
and we have a simple key function here
let's hold control again press shift and
hold shift together so we're holding
control and shift key together and now
we're pressing lower Arrow key once yes
the entire sales column has been
selected comma Now where do you want to
look so we want to look I mean which
part of the table you want to fetch
right so this is the region part we want
to fetch right now so again hold control
and shift together lower Arrow key the
entire column is selected now the next
last part so we want to look into the
both of the columns that is sales column
and region column now which type of data
you want so for now we want Western type
of data that is the sales data which is
happening only in vest right so we'll
select this cell with the data as West
or you can also manually enter it for
now let's select the data so I'm
selecting the cell F7 which has uh data
as West right now let's close the
parenthesis and press enter so there you
go you have the sales happening in the
western region now you can also try to
format it in the form of currency so
let's use uh dollars since it is based
on American states so let's use dollars
so there you go now we are having the
sales data of West now let's try to copy
the same to all the for sales and uh for
now here here let's type in
East and this can be South right and
this can be your
central there you
go right now you can also copy the same
formula and make minor edits to it so
here instead of f8 you can select uh
East so where is East here and press
enter so you have the sales related to
East now let's try to edit F9 with South
select South Region enter so you have
South sales and what remaining is
Central so let's edit Central as well
and press enter so there you go right
now you have all the separate sales data
from west east south and Central now
again uh you might want a bit more
granularity in data
right or in your reports right like you
wanted to find the sales data happening
in West and you wanted to find out the
category based on only Furnitures so
your manager will ask you okay a
fantastic job so now just give me
another minute detail on the data I want
to calculate the sales happening on West
based on category Furniture right so he
wants furniture or he wants office
supplies only right you can also do that
it's not an issue at all now let's try
to copy the cell and paste it here and
sales invest let's add another input
here on
furniture right now you wanted to
calculate the sales happening in west
region only on furniture so you can also
do that now we can use the same formula
as well just copy paste the formula here
right and you can add few things here
when you try to add a comma it will
automatically generate the next criteria
so it is expecting that you are looking
for adding another criteria right now
which column you want you want category
so let's select category you want to
select all the cells same track control
shift lower key and again press comma
and you want it to select only uh
Furniture so select on furniture cell
there you go now press enter so there
you go we successfully have the sales
data from west region based on category
Only Furniture so that's how you do some
in Excel you can also add a few more
details to it like in Furniture you can
also look only for tables so here you
can see in west region we have furniture
sales data and we have sales data of
West Region based on furniture which
includes only tables you can also do
that using sums function in the same way
all you have to do is select the
subcategory column and select the cell
which has the data as tables so this is
how you use Su in Exel now creating a
pivot table is just just away from a few
clicks trust me it is just a couple of
clicks and you'll have your pivot table
ready to operate now click any cell or
select any cell on your spreadsheet
which has the data and navigate to
insert menu on the toolbar and select
pivot table and that's how simple it is
now automatically Excel will choose your
data you can see the lines over here
dotted lines that means the Excel has
already selected the range of data that
you want to put into your pivot table
and you can either select the existing
worksheet or a new worksheet I'll select
a new worksheet over here and just press
on okay and there you go you have your
pivot table ready now here you can see
your pivot table is a little empty all
you need to do is drag and drop the data
elements that you want on your pivot
table so here you can see on our
spreadsheet we have some business data
related to a store which has furniture
and states and subcategories of the
furniture and all the you know in in
category you have furniture office
supplies technology Etc right so those
have some subcategories as well and
different states and the regions as well
and the quantity total sales happen
right so using this business data we can
find out some key insights of this
particular data using our pivot table
right so here we'll add the data now let
me drag the region into rows click and
drag and let me
drag uh categories into columns which
are the different Cate categories which
are involved in the sales data and
values what are the sales happened right
and there you go you have Furnitures
offer supplies technology as the three
different categories and those are the
sales happened in central East South and
West regions and this is the grand total
and instead of regions you know you have
all the regions over here right so
Central East Southwest or instead of uh
all the regions or instead of all the
categories you can you know place a
specific category in your pivot table
for example let me push the category
into the filters and here you can see
the total sales happened in those
particular regions now what if someone
asks you to find the sales of Only
Furniture right so your manager comes to
you and he'll ask you getting the sales
of only Furnitures you can select that
and there you go you have the furniture
sales in all the regions right or you
can also do the vice Versa he can also
drag uh regions into the filters and if
you wanted to find out the region wise
sales of furniture you can also do that
right so here we have furniture and here
you have all the regions and let us try
to find the sales of furniture in the
central region and there you go right so
this is how um the priv table works and
you can also remove the regions for
example if you wanted to remove a
certain element ment from filters or
anywhere if it is columns rows anything
you can just drag and drop it right so
that's how it works and also you can
increase the level of detail or improve
the granularity right so here we have U
categories on our uh you know columns so
you can also include subcategories into
the columns right
and and you have the region wise
sales so in the region filter select
all press okay and in the category
select
all press okay and you have the
furniture here office supplies here and
Technology here and also if you want to
include the quantity how much or how
many number of um you know things got
sold in those particular categories and
subcategories you can also do do that so
here in the furniture section books
these are the sales and these are the
number of quantity or elements sold in
in those particular you know sectors so
you can you can also improve the level
of granularity you can also improve the
level of detail using pivot tables
in now AutoFill in Excel is a feature
where you can add some series
automatically using Excel for example
let us imagine that you wanted to add
index numbers right so starting from one
to 10 so manually you will be typing in
the numbers and you'll be doing it right
so instead of this what if I said you
there was a simple way where Excel will
fill all the data for you right so just
start with one two and select these two
cells and you can see the flash logo
over here right so that's the indication
that Excel has understood your pattern
and it is ready to fill the remaining
numbers so as long as you drag this logo
or that ending part where you have a
small square box that will fill all the
numbers until where you have draag it so
that's how autofill works and you might
be wondering will it work only for
numbers no it will also work on some
Logics as well okay this was the first
part let us also look at some other
tricks with autofill now most of the
time you might be just adding one number
and try to drag that cell and the result
is it'll copy the same number all the
time right so you can change it by
clicking on this menu you can click on
fill series and it will change to series
and this was one more trick with numbers
now getting back to the next type so let
us imagine now the next type of series
you want to add as weeks in a day right
so you'll be having
Monday Tuesday Wednesday right so you
can also do the series of weekday using
autofill and Excel as well so drag that
cell and it will will give you all the
days or week days in a week now let's
try
January and this will give you the
months in a
year in the shortcut TOA right since you
just added the first three letters of
the month it will recognize the pattern
and it will do the same for you now let
us try the full names of
months right and now let's try to drag
it it'll fill all the full names of all
the
months now let's try the dates so let us
imagine that this is the first day of
the current
year right it will now give you all the
dates of that current month or until the
end of the year as
well there you
go now let us imagine that your manager
tells you to add the dates of working
days in the month of January so how how
can you do that it's simple all you need
to do is select the cell go to the fill
option select series and here select
column wise since you want the dates and
columns and here in the type select date
date unit should be weekday and the stop
value should be the next month right
since your manager asked for the week
days of January so your stop value will
be the first of February press okay and
there you go so since the 1st of January
is Friday that's selected over here and
the rest two Saturday and Sunday are
eliminated similarly we have all the
dates here of working days only so
that's how you use AutoFill in Exel so
on my screen you can see a simple
spreadsheet with student names and their
marks on my sheet so we will be
calculating what are the total marks
obtained by the students in overall
subjects and calculate what is the
percentage now we will carry forward a
few simple inbuilt functions in Excel to
calculate that first we will be
calculating the sum of marks so here
equals to sum
function and select the range of
cells close the bracket press enter so
you have the sum
now so we have to calculate it repeat so
by clicking on the same formula now we
have the total of all the subjects for
individual students and now let's
calculate percentage so usually we use
the you know divide by option that is
divide the total number of marks
obtained by the total number of marks
available that is we will be dividing 47
by 500 and then we will be multiplying
that into 100 so that's how we calculate
the percentage
so cell G2 ided by cell H2 press enter
and you will end up with you know uh the
decimal format that's perfectly all
right now we have also extended the same
formula for all our cells now select
this overall column or select the
highlighted cells right and get into the
data type here you have General so
that's why we have got that uh decimal
format but when you press percentage
you'll have the actual percentage of all
the students according to their marks
achieved now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet and this spreadsheet has
some values of employees that is their
employee ID name designation Department
salary date of birth and date of joining
now our concern is to highlight some
cells which are duplicate in this or
some rows which are duplicate so for
example here you can see on row number
seven we have the details of Mara and
you can see the same details of Mara in
the row number 14 as well right so you
need to eliminate those cells or you
need to eliminate those rowes now you
can say there is a quick way just few
clicks and those will be eliminated that
is conditional formatting yes that is
also one way but I'll show you what's
the problem with that okay so let us
select the entire table and get into
conditional formatting and here you have
duplicate values highlight cell rules
with duplicate values and there you go
the problem so here we have designation
which is duplicated in certain ways
department and salary state of joining
right right so there are certain
conditions or scenarios where you cannot
directly identify which is the duplicate
rowle again you can use the same for
this right so you can select the
entire uh column of employee ID and you
can uh identify the duplicate cells here
since the employee IDs are unique for
everyone so this is a way but let's dig
a little deeper and understand the way
of highlighting duplicates with an
advanced technique so let me cancel this
and for that let's create a new um
column and let's name this as
duplicate
flag e
flag
so the new column has been created which
is D flag so here we will be using a
simple formula that is Count F and here
press tab to select the formula and here
we will be adding our uh range that is
which range are you considering so the
range will be the employee ID since
employee IDs are unique for every
employee
and and let's press function F4 to fix
it and now uh again the criteria and the
criteria will be the same cell that is
A2 and now close the bracket and press
enter now let's track the same formula
to all the
rows okay now here we have now what you
can do is uh sort it in an Advanced way
go to sort and filter and custom sort
and here you'll be sorting by the D flag
and it will be smallest to
largest so now uh you can apply the
conditional formatting to highlight it
you can select the column H or the D
flag go to conditional formatting
highlight cell rules and here you can
get into greater than and give the value
as one oh okay so all the cells which
are you know repeated multiple times
will be selected here and they will be
highlighted with a selected color what
you have given so I've given Red so now
you can select these cells and highlight
them or delete them from your
spreadsheet and now all your data in the
spreadsheet is unique and clean now
let's quickly get onto the Practical
mode where we will have some data sets
over which we will be trying to apply
the charts now there are various types
of charts in table and those are the pie
chart the column chart the bar chart
column versus line pavier chart and
Spark line charts so we will discuss one
after the other first let us discuss
about the pie chart so as you can see we
have a small data set on my screen which
I have personally created and uh this
deals with the companies and this deals
with the shares of the automobile
industry so now for this let's create a
pie chart
select all the data and then get into
the toolbar and inside the toolbar you
can see various options and inside that
we're going to use the insert option and
when you select the insert option you
will have a ribbon here and inside the
ribbon you can see groups tables
illustrations addin and here you go
these are the charts so now we needed a
pie chart so select on that icon and you
have various types of pie charts you
have two dimensional pie chart three
dimensional pie charts donut type of
charts Etc right so I would like to go
with the three-dimensional pie chart as
it looks a little more appealing and
easy to understand and now there you go
this is the title of the chart and these
are the legends of the chart and this is
the chart area and these are the values
now we can uh you know kind of add the
data labels as well so you can just have
to press the plus icon over here and
you'll have the options you can add the
data labels which will give you a lot
more interesting
values and uh you can also turn this
around as you can see we on double
clicking any part of the pie chart
you'll get this option which is called
as format data point and uh let's
imagine that you wanted to show the
information related to this particular
one which is Volvo which has the biggest
share so this is in front right now now
what if you wanted to show the
information related to data which is
over here right for that you can select
this particular Arrow key and you can
just twist it and there you go it is
coming in front this will be a a great
way of presenting your data to your
clients
right yeah and there is another option
where you can directly explode this like
you can pick it out you can see this
right Point explosion where you can
split it out and you can show that
especially like you can highlight it and
show it so that's the you know a great
way of presenting your data so that's
how you can work with pie charts and
Excel now let's quickly move to the next
one that is the column chart and in the
column chart we have the data related to
some company and uh the profits of that
company based on a so you can see that
the year has started from 2008 and it
has gone until 2021 and these are the
profits of that company year after here
so since we are dealing with column
chart I'll tell you the simplest way to
create a column chart there is a
shortcut key for that which is alt F1
and there you go you have the chart
right on your
screen now you can uh expand the chart
just by dragging it like that and you
can see that there is some problem with
this chart that is we have numbers here
instead of years right you can see that
the First Column is the years which is
2008 to 2021 but here you can see we
have 1 2 3 4 which is not proper right
so to change the axis that is you can
see the axis which is 1 2 3 let me
expand my screen a little bit
Yeah so if you look at my screen we have
two different columns one column is
about the ears and the second column is
about the revenue now what we want to do
is we want to create a line graph where
we have year on the x-axis and revenue
on the Y AIS and we will be generating a
line graph based on the data we have now
for that we have to select the entire
data what we have then we need to go
into the insert option in the toolbar
and then you can see a lot of chart
options in the insert ribbon now here
you can see that we have a line chart or
area chart option select that and here
you can see 2D line graphs now let's
select the first one and there you go
you have the line chart here now let's
rename the
title and there is one problem with the
chart here you can see that the x-axis
is not actually pointing the ears you
can make a change to that no
worries just right click and then you
can see the select data option and there
you go you have the edit option here
just edit it and now select the
range I am selecting the ears now let's
select okay and there you go you have
the ears here you can just try to expand
it a little
more
yeah so now you have the revenue on the
Y AIS and year on the x-axis and this
shows the growth of Revenue in your
company so this is how you create a line
graph in Excel
playar now let us imagine that you are
the CEO of an IT company and you have
taken up multiple projects let us
imagine that you wish to keep track of
all the projects so what is if there was
a tool which could keep track of all the
projects in the form of a detailed
visualization with the percentage in the
form of a graph or a bar chart
interesting right that's exactly what we
going to design today using Microsoft
Excel so without further Ado let's get
started with our onepoint agenda that is
progress tracker in Excel now to design
a progress tracker in Excel let us get
back to the the Practical mode where we
might have to use our Microsoft
Excel now we are on the Microsoft Excel
and we have taken some sample data to
make things look simple so here we're
considering a set of students and their
attendance percentage so we will be
using this particular data and design a
progress
tracker now let us try to increase the
size of the
celles now select all the cells in the
attendance
column now we have selected all the
cells in the attendance column and in
the toolbar select the Home tab and
inside the Home tab you have styles
group inside the Styles group select
conditional formatting and inside the
conditional formatting option select new
rule so in the new rule we want to
select the first option that is format
all cells based on the
values
now here you can see format style since
we trying to create a datab bar we need
to select the option of datab bar
here and under the datab bar options we
have some more options on the drop- down
menu so here in the type select
number and the minimum number is zero it
is automatically stored here and the
maximum value is again a number and let
us provide it as one now here you can
select the color for your pass now since
we have already chosen green for all the
column headers let's choose
blue
and select okay now here you can see
that the values are being indicated
using bar graph
right and you can also see the
percentage values but we can make it
look a little more better by shifting
them to the left side and text could be
given as white so that it's more uh
vibrant to look at and now we can also
apply some conditional formatting onto
these attendance columns so let us try
to highlight the students having
attendance less than
65% so highlight cell heru less than
65%
attendance with red color select
okay and there you go you have the
progress tracker right on your screen
and using the same principles you can
track the attendance for all the
students and also you can apply some
conditional formatting onto all your
cells and highlight the ones which are
not on the track now this is how you can
Implement progress trackers using
Excel now for this particular example we
going to use the employees
data now let's quickly get back to the
Practical mode and enter into
Excel now you can see that we are on
Excel sheet right now so let me expand
my screen a little
bit
so that the data is a little more
visible yeah so here on my screen you
can see that we have employees data so
the First Column is the name of the
employees and the second column is the
start dates of the employees that when
have they started working with the
organization and when they have ended or
resigned to their position in that
particular organization and the duration
gives us the number of days they have
work in that particular organization so
to create a g chart is really simple you
just have to select the data and then go
to the insert option and in there you
can see the charts icon and select all
charts and in that select the bar chart
and here you can see the Stacked bar
chart select that and press okay and
there you go you have the Stacked bar
chart right on your screen let's expand
this a little more so that we have the
clear visualization of the dates as well
now you can if you want you can change
the title as org data or employe
data and now we are partially done with
our chart now the next thing we have to
do is select the bar chart right click
on it select data and here select the
add icon now you need to select the
series name so the series name is
duration for our Gant chart and series
values are let's select this and select
let's move a
little yeah so these are the data series
let's select okay and you can see the
Gan chat on my screen right here select
okay and it's done and still now it's
not complete yet so to finish it you
need to select the blue colored bars
here and right click on them and select
format data series
go to the fill icon and select no
fill and it's done for now and you can
see that there is a difference in this
particular arrangement we had Joe at the
first place and Susan at the last place
but here you can see Joe is in the last
place and Susan is in the first place so
we need to make some arrangements here
for that right click select format
access and then here you can see
categorize in reverse
order
and there you go it should be done and
there you go you have your Gant chart
right on your screen however if you are
looking to get certified then hey there
we are here with an amazing course
through which you can catch the eyes of
top Recruiters in the industry allow me
to introduce postgraduate program in
data analytics by simply learn so what
are you waiting for hurry up and enroll
Now find the cost Link in the
description box we have started the
Microsoft Excel on my screen you can see
a small data set the data set is about
students and their marks in the sixth
semesters right now we should be
creating a new heat map to describe
their rankings Now to create a heat map
the procedure is really simple just CR a
select the entire data go to the Home
tab and there you can see the Styles
group and in the Styles group click on
the conditional formatting now out of
all the options go to the color scales
and when you open the color scales you
can see some types of maps select the
green yellow red Scale map which should
show Green for highest yellow for
mediate and red for low right this is
how you create a heat map just select
the first option and there you go the
heat map has been successfully generated
the green colored cells indicate the
highest marks orange and yellow color
indicate the intermidiate marks or the
average marks and the red color
indicates the lowest marks that's how
you create heat maps in Excel we have
reached the end of this session on how
to create heat maps in Excel but before
we end the video let's take a minute to
hear it from our Learners about their
success story after graduating from the
business analyst postgraduate program by
simply learn from P University in
collaboration with Amazon Google and
Microsoft Excel is a really powerful
tool for data analytics and Reporting
and pivot tables are one of the features
that Excel offers for creating tabular
reports to summarize our data let's
begin by understanding understanding
what is a pivote
table a pivote table is a tool that
summarizes and reorganizes selected
columns and rows of data in its
spreadsheet to obtain a desired
report it does not actually change the
spreadsheet data it simply pivots or
turns the data to view it in different
perspectives P tables are especially
useful with large amounts of data that
would be timec consuming to calculate
manually now let's understand the
different components of a p table so
there are four main components first we
have rows when a field is chosen for the
row area it populates as the first
column in the pivot table similar to The
Columns all row labels are unique values
and duplicates are removed columns is
the second component when a field is
chosen for the column area only the
unique values of the field are listed
across the top then we have values each
value is kept in a pivot table cell and
displays the summarized information the
most common values are sum average
minimum and maximum finally we have
filters filters apply a calculation or
restriction to the entire table so let's
jump over to Microsoft Excel and let me
show you the data set that we will use
in this demo so with India being ready
for its 16th census in
2021 that is next year it is a good time
for us to analyze India's last census
data from 2011 and see where different
states and cities across India stood in
terms of population literacy and other
socioeconomic factors we will analyze
this data by creating different pivot
tables in Excel and explore some of its
features so let's begin first I'll show
you one of the features that Excel
offers us so suppose I click on any cell
and hit control+ Q you can see our
entire table is selected and at the
right bottom there's an option of quick
analysis now you can see by default
Excel has prompted certain features such
as has formatting we have charts totals
and there's one more called tables now
Excel by default has created some pivot
tables for us now the first one you say
sum of district code by state names next
we have sum of sex ratio by state name
then we have some of child sex ratio
some of male graduates and some of
female graduates by state name and there
are others before creating our pivote
table so let's have a final look at our
data set so First Column you see is the
city column so there are different
cities from different parts of India
then we have the state code we have the
state name district code we have the
total population followed by male and
female population next you can see we
have the total literates from each City
then we have the male and female
literates next we have the sex ratio
then we have the child sex ratio next we
have total number of graduates and
finally you can see we we have male and
female graduates so using this table
we'll create several peot
tables now first of all let's create a
peot table to find the total population
for each state and sort it in descending
order so you can see here we have the
problem statement so our first P table
will have the total population for each
of the states in descending order so to
create a pivote table you can click any
cell in your data
go to the insert Tab and here left you
can see we have the option to create a
pivot table so let me select pivote
table now my range is already selected
the entire table and here I'll choose
existing worksheet because I want to
place my P table in the same worksheet
and I'll give my location I'll point to
cell Q5 now let me click
okay you can see the P table Fields
appears here on the right now since we
want to find the total population for
each state so what I'll do is I'll drag
my state name onto rows so here in our
pivot table you can see we have the
different state names listed now we want
the total population for each of these
states so in the field list I'll search
for total population which is this one
and drag it under
values you can see we have a sum of
total population for each of these
states by default Excel will sum any
numeric column you can always change it
to average minimum maximum anything you
want now we want to sort this column in
descending order so I right click go to
sort option and choose Z to A that is
largest to
smallest you can see here in 2011
Maharashtra had the highest number of
population or the total population in
Maharashtra was the highest then it was
utar Pradesh we had Andra Pradesh and if
I come down we have nagaland and andan
and nicobar Islands towards the end so
this is a simple P table that we created
now the next problem we have is we want
to find the total sum of literates in
each City belonging to a certain state
so let's see how to do it I'll click on
any cell go to insert and here I can
click on pivot table my range is
selected I'll choose existing worksheet
and give my location which is Q5 I click
on
okay now here we want to find the total
sum of literates so what I'll do is
first let me drag total literates column
to values you have the total sum of
literates from all this
States next I want to see the sum of
total literates based on states and
cities so let me first drag state name
onto rows and then we drag City onto
rows you can see here we have our pivote
table
ready to the left of the pivote table
you can see we have the state names and
the cities per state and on the right
you can see the total number of
literates from each City if I scroll
down we have Assam then you can see we
have
Bihar and if I keep scrolling we have
all the states harana Himachal Pradesh
that's Jammu and Kashmir which has now
become a union territory we have jarand
kataka and other states as well moving
on okay so the next thing we want to see
is what is the average sex ratio and the
child sex ratio for each state with that
we also want to find the states
that had the highest and lowest sex
ratio in
2011 so let's create a pivote table for
this I'll click on any cell go to insert
choose P table click on existing
worksheet I'll select cell Q5 and click
on
okay now since we want the average sex
ratio and the child sex ratio so first
I'll drag those columns either you can
manually scroll and drag it or here you
have the option to search for it so if I
look for child you can see we
have the same column listed can just
drag it from there let me delete this
and I also want the sex ratio so I'll
place it on top of child sex ratio next
we want to see it based on different
states so what I'll do is I'll take
state name and put it under under rows
so here you can see we have our pivote
table ready on the left you can see we
have the different state names listed
and on the right we have the values now
we want to find the average Now by
default Excel will sum the numeric
columns you can see it tells you sum of
sex ratio and child sex ratio so what
you can do can click on this drop down
and go to Value field settings
and here summarize values by you can
choose average you can see the custom
name it says average of Sixx ratio click
on
okay our entire column is now giving us
the average sex ratio similarly for this
column let me convert it into average
I'll again click on the drop down go to
Value field settings click on average
and click okay
and you can see here we have the average
of child sex ratio for each of the
states now the next question says which
states had the highest and lowest sex
ratio so we'll consider this column so
we'll sort it in any order you want you
can do it either ascending or descending
let me short it in descending
order you can see we have our column
sorted now so in
2011 Kerala had the highest sex ratio
and if I scroll down to the bottom you
can see himanchal Pradesh had the lowest
which is around
[Music]
8818 up next let's explore one more
feature of peot table so suppose you
want to see the top or bottom few rows
of a pivote table you can do that as
well so here we have a question at hand
we want to find the top three cities
with the highest number of female
graduates so let's see from the entire
pivote table how we can filter the top
three cities so I'll go to insert click
on the pivote table option go to
existing worksheet click on Q5 and hit
okay now since we want to find the top
three cities I'll drag City column onto
rows and then we want the female
graduates so in the search bar I'll look
for
female and I'll choose this column that
is female graduates and drag it here
onto values so I have the sum of female
graduates for each of the Cities now
since we want to find the highest number
of female graduates in the top three
cities so let me first sort this
column I'll sort it in descending order
now we have it sorted now from this you
can say that Delhi greater Mumbai and
bangaluru are the top three cities but
it's displaying all the cities for us so
let's filter only the top three so what
you can do is right click and go to
filter under filter you have the option
of top 10 I'll select this here I only
want the top three so either you
can go down like this or you can
directly type three your column is
already selected let me just click on
okay
there you go we have the required pivote
table ready and it only displays us the
top three cities with the highest number
of female
graduates now the next thing we want to
see is how to use a Slicer in a peot
table so we have a question here What's
the total population for all the cities
in Rajasthan and Karnataka so let's
create a poo table for this and see how
you can use a slicer to filter the
table click on existing
I'll click on a location this time
q6 click
okay now since I want the total
population so I'll drag total population
onto values and then I'll select the
city on to rows and then the state name
also I'll place it on top of City so you
have in the pivot table all the states
and the cities
and on the right you can see the total
population for each of these cities but
our question is we want to find only for
Rajasthan and Karnataka now for that
what you can do is go to
insert and create a slicer either you
can create from this option or you can
go to pivote table analyze option and
here you have the option to create or
insert a slicer I click on this and
since we want to slice the table based
on state that is Rajasthan and Karnataka
I'll choose state name as my slicer
field you can see this is my slicer here
now you only want the data for Rajasthan
and Karnataka so I'll search for these
two so here we have Karnataka so let me
select Karnataka
first and and I also want for
Rajasthan so let me select Rajasthan
also you can see in our pivote table we
only have data for Rajasthan and
Karnataka so this pivote table shows you
different cities from Karnataka and the
total sum of population from each of the
cities and similarly we also have for
Rajasthan moving ahead now we will see
another very interesting feature of
pivot that is how you
can create percentage contribution of a
table for example we have a question
here what's the percentage contribution
of male and female literates from each
state now we want to see in terms of
percentage and not as sum or average
let's do that I'll create my pivote
table click on
existing and I'll select an empty cell
okay now here since we want to find the
percentage contribution of male and
female literates so first I'll
drag male literat onto values followed
by female literates onto values by
default it has summed up the male litat
and female lit value and also I want to
drag State
column to
rows so here you can see the sum of male
literates and female literates per state
I want to convert this as percentage
contribution so what we can do is I'll
select any cell and I'll right click and
I'll go to so value as and here I have
the option to select percentage of grand
total so I'll select
this you can see we have the percentage
contribution of male literates to the
total now if I sort this you will get to
know which state contributed or has the
highest percentage
contribution so we have Maharashtra for
male
literates then we had utar Pradesh in
2011 if I come
down we had migala nagaland and Andaman
and nicobar
Islands as two states which had little
or minimal contribution to male
literates similarly let's do it for
female literates I'll go to so value as
and select percentage of grand
total so you can see here also
Maharashtra utar Pradesh then Gujarat
and all had the highest percentage
contribution to female
literates so this is another good
feature to convert your data and seat
and terms of
percentage now moving ahead let's say we
want to find the bottom three cities
from each state that had the lowest
female graduates we can do that as well
I'll go to insert click on
pivot go to existing worksheet select an
empty worksheet and click on
okay now since I want to see based on
States as well as cities so let me drag
the state name first onto row and let's
drag the city column onto
rows next we want female male graduates
so let me look for female graduates in
the field list I'll drag it onto
values now we have the list of states
and the respective cities and to the
right of the P table you can see the sum
of female graduates from each
City now first I'll sort this column
I'll write click go to sort and click on
sest to largest now we have sorted our
female graduates
from shortest or smallest to largest now
since I want to find the bottom three
cities from each state I'll come to the
cell right click go to filter and select
top 10 now
I'll replace top 10 with bottom and I
want the bottom three cities from each
state I have I have my column selected
that is some of female graduates if I
click on okay you can see here some of
the states don't have three cities so
you can see andan and nicobar islands
has only one city that is Port player
while the remaining you can find the
bottom three cities with the lowest
number of female graduates so Andhra
Pradesh had these three in Assam we had
Naga then there was diar and CA
similarly if I come down in harana we
have palwal kathal and
zind if I come further here you can see
for Karnataka there gangavati this Rani
benur and the scholar similarly you can
see for Kerala as
well now moving
ahead now in the next example I'll tell
you how you can create a calculated
field or a calculated column in Excel
with the help of a peot table so in a p
table you can create or use custom
formulas to create calculated fields or
items calculated fields are formulas
that can refer to other fields in the
pivot table calculated Fields appear
with other value fields in the pivote
table like other value Fields a
calculated Fields name May proceed with
some of followed by the field name so
here we have a sales table that has
columns like the items which has
different fruits and
vegetables and those have been
categorized as fruits and vegetables we
have the price per kg and this is in
terms of
rupees and we have the quantity that was
sold now let's see if you want to find
the sales for each item in the table you
can create a calculated field so your
sales column is going to be the product
of price per kg and quantity so let me
show you how you can do that with the
help of a pivot table I'll create a peot
table
first click on an empty cell hit okay
okay now if you see on the top under P
table analyze and under calculations we
have the option Fields items and sets if
I click on this drop down I get the
option to create a calculated field or
insert a calculated field I click on
this I'll give my field name as
sales and I'll select my
formula I'll first click on price per kg
and hit insert field I'll give a space
hit shift 8 to give the product symbol
and then I'll double click on quantity
now this is my formula for sales that is
price per kg multiplied by quantity I'll
click on ADD and I click on okay if you
see here there's a calculated field that
is present in the P table fields which
is Sals but it did not add it to our
original table our original table is the
same
but here we have added a calculated
field which is present only in the pivot
table list now we can use this it is
already taken it under values now let's
say I want to find the sum of seals for
each item under each category you can
see it here we have our category fruit
and we have our category vegetable and
under that we have different items like
apple apricot banana
similarly in vegetables we have broccoli
the carrots corn eggplant and others so
this is how you can create a calculated
field in a pivote table now there's one
more good feature that Excel offers us
in pivote table is to create a pivote
chart so you can use your pivote table
and create different charts so I'll show
you how to do that if I go to
insert here I have the option of
recommended charts if I click on this
Excel gives me some default charts which
you can use let's say I'll select
this let me drag it a bit to the right
here you can see I'll close this pivote
field list this is a nice bar chart that
Excel has created this is called a
pivote chart now here you can see the
category fruits and vegetables and the
different fruits and vegetables or the
item
in the y axis you can see the total
sales if you see from the graph guava
meet the highest amount of sales now if
I sort this let's sort this
first you can see it here fruit guava
meet the highest amount of sales now
since I sorted and changed my P table
the P chart also automatically gets
updated similarly there are other charts
also that you can create let's go to the
insert Tab and let's click on
recommended charts again let's look for
a pie chart so this is a pi chart that
you can create let me click on okay so
here is our PI chart and each Pi
represents a certain item and the pi
that has the highest area represents it
had the highest amount of sales in this
case you can see it is quava and
similarly we have other items as well
this is fruit
banana that's
corn and we have spinach and
others let's explore a few other charts
so first I'll click on my pivote table
go to insert and under recommended
charts let's now select a line chart if
I hit okay move it to the right so this
is a line chart you can see it starts
from guava which had the highest amount
of sales then it
drops and in the x-axis you can see the
different items similarly when it starts
with the vegetables broli made the
highest amount of sales with 2,800
rupees and our lowest was eggplant at
900 rupees for fruits papaya sold the
least at 700 rupees let's take another
chart I'll go to insert under
recommended charts let's
see this time we'll see a bar chart now
this is
a horizontal bar chart and not a
vertical one we just saw a vertical
column chart like this this is an
horizontal bar chart now you can always
increase and decrease the size of these
charts let's explore a last chart let's
take the area chart for now so this is
an area chart again it looks similar to
the line chart it start starts with
guava which had the highest amount of
seals similarly papaya under fruits had
the lowest amount of seals under
vegetables it was broccoli and finally
eggplant made the lowest amount of sales
under vegetable now let's go to our
first sheet and summarize what we have
done in this demo for pivot tables in
Excel so we had our
data this is 2011 Census Data from India
we had the different cities the state
names and we had the total population
total literates female literates male
literates we had the sex ratio total
graduates and other
information so we began by understanding
how to create a simple pivote table
where we calculated the total population
for each state and sorted it in
descending order we found that
Maharashtra utar prades had the total
population in
2011 then we we saw another preot table
where we calculated the total sum of
literates in each City belonging to a
certain state so you can see we had the
different state names and the cities
under each
state then we saw another feature where
you could calculate the average of a
certain numerical column so here we
calculated the average sex ratio and the
child sex ratio for each state and found
out which one had the highest and lowest
sex
ratio
after that we saw how you could find or
filter
tables we saw how to find the top three
cities with the highest number of female
graduates we found out that Delhi
greater Mumbai and bangaluru were the
top cities with highest number of female
graduates next we saw how to use Slicer
in a p table so we sliced our table
based on Rajasthan and Karnataka State
and saw the total population for all the
cities in Rajasthan and
Karnataka
in the next
sheet we explored another feature that
was to find the percentage contribution
of male and female literates from each
state then here we saw how to find out
the bottom three cities for each state
having lowest female graduates now one
thing marked that some of the states did
not have three cities for example
Andaman had only one city that was Port
player but the others we found out the
bottom three cities that had the lowest
female graduates finally we looked at
how to create a calculated field in a
pivote table so we saw how to create a
calculated field called sales and then
we explored how to create different
charts and graphs so this was an area
chart that we saw there a column chart
we also saw or looked at a bar chart
that was a horizontal bar chart
similarly we saw how to create a pie
chart as well so how to create a PIV
chart you ask it is really simple all
you need to do is just follow few steps
and you have your PIV chart ready which
is completely interactive now all you
have to do is select any cell in the
data set you have and rush into the
insert toolbar then in the group of
charts you have an option called pivot
chart select on it now you'll be asked
to select the data range and you can see
Excel has automatically select all the
range that you want to include in your P
chart then you have another option which
is asking you to either create the PIV
chart in the current worksheet or a new
worksheet for now let's select a new
worksheet and there you go voila the
pivot chart is completely ready you
might ask me this is completely empty
yes the default pivot chart what you get
from Excel will be completely empty but
you can add the Legends and all the data
that you want to add onto your PIV chart
just by dragging and dropping the data
from the right hand side of your Excel
sheet that is from the P chart Fields so
you can see we have various options
region category state subcategory sales
quantity Etc now I'll add
region I'll add region to
access and comparatively we will see the
sales that are happening in those
particular regions by dragging sales
into values now you have all the data in
the form of pivot chart which is
completely interactive which represents
the sales happening in those regions now
you can also select a particular region
right by default all the regions are
selected but if you want to select only
Central then you can do that by
deselecting everything and select only
Central and select okay and there you go
you have all the data related to the
sales happening in the central region
now if you want to you know kind of see
all the uh categories of sales happening
in all the regions you can drag the
category into values again and uh in the
region part okay I think we have to add
category into Legends yes now select uh
regions that that is all regions and
select okay and you can see the category
wise sales in all regions at one single
go and I hope you did not observe it
clearly uh the Xcel also gives you the
completely prepared pivot table as well
right which is also interactive you can
also get to choose the data from here as
well and select okay and you'll see that
being reflected on the pivot chart so
here you can see both pivot table and
pivot charts are completely
interactive now here we have four
different sheets of the sales so the
first sheet is the West Zone next is
South Zone East Zone and central zone so
all this data belongs to one single
sheet that is Superstore data set so I
have categorized or I have taken a part
of the data which belongs to central
region South Region west region and east
region now we are going to use all these
four sheets and create one single sheet
which is the pivot table of all the four
sheets now without further Ado let's
start the process now for that we might
want to use the shortcut key that is all
D now press P now this starts the pivot
chart
wizard now here we have to choose the
option multiple consolidation
ranges then click on
next and here you can see the pivot
table is clicked by default now we'll go
to next now here click I will create
page fields or the pivot chart wizard
will automatically create if you want
that to create for you now click on next
now here let's select the
range now I'll be selecting the
range add
it now next we'll Select
East
it followed by that we have
South and finally we have
bestest
now we will name these according to the
regions so the first one will be
West next one will be
South next one will be
East and the last one will be
Central
click on next and here select new
worksheet and finish and there you go
you have the pivot table here now you
might want to change the submission
value so click anywhere on the pivot
table and change it from count to
sum so that you have the sumission of
the total number of sales subcategory
sales and grand total of sales Etc now
here you can see all option now let's
select Central and you'll get the
details of the central region the grand
total and the sales happening quantity
of sales Etc now here can you can see
the furniture office supplies technology
and the grand total all in one single
sheet now let's get back to the original
sheet so as you can see this is the
original sheet and in the original sheet
you can see various more
categories which is the which is the
shipment mode customer customer segment
country City State uh and you also have
uh product name subcategory Etc so if
you had added all these into this sheet
you can also create a separate option of
adding my new details to your pivot
table so that is how the pivot table is
created using multiple sheets mail March
in Excel is a simp simple yet
spectacular method to write similar
emails to hundreds and thousands of
recipients without a hassle or even a
single error let us imagine that you are
supposed to write an interview call
letter to multiple recipients so what if
you had like five recipients you could
do five different emails and you could
send them but what if you had 50 or even
500 right that would seem a little
Troublesome and you might even feel that
you might want a whole team to do that
right but what if I say that you can do
the same with one single mail within a
matter of minutes you send all the
emails to all the 50 or 500
recipients sounds interesting right so
now in this particular tutorial we are
going to do the same now without further
Ado let's directly get onto the
Practical mode and start our Excel and
try to do some mail merch in
Excel now we are on practical mode and
we have started our Microsoft Excel so
regard regarding the example we
discussed earlier that is sending an
interview call letter to multiple people
that's what exactly this Excel sheet
does so here we have about 25 members or
25 candidates with their first name last
name and email and their address written
over now where is our call letter now
this happens to be our call letter so
the call letter is been sent from an
imaginary company that is smart
Solutions private limited India and
followed by by that we are having one
recipient here who happens to be Mia and
the subject and everything all the text
related to the interview call now we are
trying to send this one single interview
call letter to all the 25 people now the
only change that is going to happen is
the recipient's name and address is
going to change and the addressing for
example here you can see dear Mia so
instead of dear Mia we we going to greet
the recipient with their particular name
so that's what we're going to try to do
now so to do that you have to go into
the toolbar and select mail links option
in the mail links option you can see the
start mail merch select recipients edit
recipient and all other options so here
you might want to select the second
group and inside the second group you
have an option called select recipients
click on that and now it will show you
you some options the first one is Type
in new list so if you are having some
list then you can type in or if you
already have an existing list like what
we did creating an Excel sheet and
storing all the email and address and
all the recipients complete details you
can use that as well so here we're going
to use the existing list so click on
that now it will show you a new dialog
box using which you have to navigate to
the existing list
so our existing list is named as mail
merch so click on that and select
open now press
okay now the next part is to address all
the details so here you can see that two
address and after that you can see the
addressing of the recipient now we have
to encode this mail in such a way that
to all the recipients automatically Al
Excel will replace the addresses names
and the greetings right now let's try
that now let's try to encode the address
part so highlight the address part and
in the same mail links option you can
find the address blog in WR and insert
Fields
ribbon so let's select that and now you
can see the address of everyone
right so this is the preview of the
recipient's address now you can see that
the recipient's full name and state is
only available here not the street and
house number Etc now you can fix that by
selecting the match Fields option and
here you can include the address so
which might be the house department and
the second one would be Street and um
postal code code you can match it with
PIN code and that's all yeah remaining
we have everything else let's look at
the preview and this is how it looks
like perfect now let's select
okay now that's
fine and uh similarly we will also try
to match
the just a moment yeah similarly we'll
try to encode the recipient's name now
for that let's go into the greetings
line here you can see you can select the
option Dear Sir or dear ma'am or to
whomever may may concern and uh here you
have another option to or just deer so
we'll go with deer and this is how the
preview looks like and if you're happy
with that it's okay and if you want to
Pary check for other things I mean other
recipients you can also do that for
example the next recipient is Santos
shastri and followed by him we have
prakar Redi rajes sahu right you can
also check everything and here you can
also see the address changing on the
mail so we can check for jagadish
charari his address and his name right
so it looks like it's working perfectly
now select okay and that's
done now we are in the final stage and
in the mailing option you can see the
last two options that is the preview
results and finish so before merging and
finishing the mail merge we should go
through a quick preview to check if
everything is fine or not so here you
can see we have the address block this
is how the encoding looks like and uh if
you replace the encoding with the actual
address and name this is how the actual
address and name look like and you can
check all the letters you can just click
on on the Arrow key here and you can
check all the recipients address and
their uh names right so if you can find
any errors you can replace them and if
not if everything is fine then you can
just quickly press on the finish and
merge option when you finish merge
option or finish and merge option you
get three different options that is edit
individual documents print documents and
send all these to the
now if you had any queries or if you had
any doubts about or if you find any
errors on the mails then you can go to
that particular individual document and
edit it with the first option and in the
second option you can print all the
documents like if you want to send a
hard copy then you can print it so you
can see here all and select okay and
then you can you know kind of save it as
a PDF or you can send the location of
your printer and then and just press
okay right you can just save them in the
form of
PDF or you can directly send the emails
right now I'm not connected to any
printer so I'm not going to print any
documents now let us try the last one
this should be
interesting now when you select the mail
option then it automatically selects the
email column from your Excel sheet
remember we had an email column from
Excel sheet right this particular column
word automatically selects that column
from Excel and you can just select okay
and all the mails will be sent to all
these imaginary mailing
addresses so that's how it's done what
is Xcel V
lookup vlookup stands for vertical
lookup vlookup lets you search for
specific information in your spreadsheet
it allows you to search for a particular
value in a column and returns another
value from a different column but of the
same Row V lookup takes advantage of
vertically aligned tables to quickly
find data associated with the value the
user enters now let's look at the syntax
to write a vlookup function so vlookup
takes four parameters or arguments you
can see it here there are four arguments
in the vup
function so the first argument is called
the look of value the look of value
represents the value that you are
searching for next is the table array
the table array represents two or more
Columns of information the third
argument is called the column index
number now this represents the column
number in the table from which the value
must be returned the First Column is one
the second column is two and so on and
then we have the fourth parameter which
is called the range lookup now this
parameter is optional now range lookup
is used to find an exact match so if you
want to find an exact match you need to
enter false or zero meanwhile if you
want an approximate match you need to
enter true or one if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scaleup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know
more now let me give you a brief
overview on what's going to be in our
demo so for our demonstration we'll use
a sales data set you can see the data
set on the left using this data set
we'll understand how V lookup performs
an exact and approximate match we'll see
how V lookup is case insensitive then
we'll perform a wild card character
search we'll understand how to handle
errors when a match is not found and
finally you will look at two-way
lookups now here is a small example of
how V lookup works so we want to find
the units sold by Morgan using the data
set on the left
so here you can see I have the data set
it has some rows and columns so these
are the columns which are order date
region there's a representative column
item units there's unit cost and total
and from this table I want to find the
units that were sold by Morgan if you
look at the table at the bottom you can
see the representative name Morgan and
Morgan has sold 30 units now I want to
find this value using the vooka function
so here on the right you can see I have
my lookup value which is Morgan and this
is my V lookup formula and using this
formula I'm getting the result as 30 now
let's go to our Excel workbook and
perform all the demos one by one so this
is my Excel workbook that we are going
to use for our demo and here is the data
set we'll be using now this is the same
data set that you saw a while ago so
this data set has seven columns you have
the the order date the region
Representatives name item there units
unit cost and total which is basically
the total or the amount of sales that
was
generated we are going to use a chunk of
this data set and perform our V lookup
analysis so let's see our first example
and the problem we have at hand let me
go to the exact match tab all right so
here I'm going to use this chunk of data
which is actually taken from the
original data set so we have taken the
first 11 rows from the data set you can
see from row
two till row 12 is going to be our data
set that we'll use so we have a question
here we want to find the items sold by
Thompson so here Thompson is my lookup
value which means looking at Thompson I
want to find the item that he sold so if
you consider our table here you can see
we have the representatives name
Thompson right here and from the table
you can see Thompson sold pencil and I
want to get this value which is pencil
using my vlookup function so let's go
ahead and write our vlookup
function I'll consider this as my lookup
value and here under item I'm going to
write my V looka formula to write the
vooka formula I'll write for first equal
to and I'll write bookup now if I hit
tab it will auto complete all right now
let's give the parameters so first is
going to be the lookup value which is
nothing but Thompson so I'll just select
this cell which is
j17 comma now it's asking to give the
table array so the table array is the
table from which you want to retrieve a
value one thing to keep in mind is that
the value you are looking for should be
the first column of a table table and
you can select the table array till the
end of the data set or till the column
which has the value you want to find so
here I'll select my table array starting
from the representatives column till the
end of the item column which is going to
be my table array then I'll select the
column index number so the column index
number is based on the table array you
have selected in this case my column
index number is going to be two because
we have selected just two columns and
the value which I'm going to find is in
the second column so I'll give two comma
Now the range lookup I'm going to give
is false because I want to find an exact
match so either you can hit tab or you
can write zero which means
false if I close the bracket and hit
enter it will return me the item that
Thompson has sold which is pencil you
can verify from the table that Thompson
had sold pencil all all right now let's
try to change the table array and see
what result are we getting so this time
I'll slightly change the table array so
again we are trying to find the item
that Thompson had sold so I'll write my
formula equal to V lookup I'll hit tab
to autocomplete I'll give my lookup
value as Thompson comma this time I'm
choosing my table array starting from
the representatives column till the end
of the data set which is till P2 again
my column index number is going to be
two because if you consider this table
array the item column is the second
column in the selected table array so
I'm going to write it as two comma the
range lookup I want to give as false
because I want to find the exact match
if I close this and hit enter you can
see it has return return me the same
result that we saw earlier now suppose
let's say this time I want to start my
table array from the region column which
is this column so I want to select my
table array starting from the region
column now this is going to show me an
error because your table array should
always start from the look of value
column so if you consider Thompson as
the look of value my table array should
always start from the representatives
column so let's just try this example so
I'll write V lookup my lookup value I'm
going to give it as Thompson comma the
table array as I mentioned earlier I'm
going to choose from the region column
and let's say I'll select till the item
column give another comma and this time
my column index number is going to be
three because since the table array has
three columns and my item column is the
last column so I'm going to give my
column index number is three comma I
want to get the exact match so I'll give
zero if I close the bracket and hit
enter you can see it has given me an
error okay now let me just show you
another method to use vlookup in Excel
so here on the top you can see there's a
formulas Tab and under formulas tab
under function Library you see we have
an option to select look up and
reference if I click on this and if I
scroll down below you can see there's an
option called vlookup let's choose this
all right now here you can give your
lookup value your table array column
index number and the range
lookup under this function arguments
dialog box so here I want to select my
lookup value as Thompson my table array
is going to be from the representatives
column till let's say the end of the
data set my column index number is going
to be
two I'll write two and range lookup I'll
write as false because I want the exact
match
now if I hit okay you can see it has
given us the exact same result so this
is one of the other ways to use V lookup
in Excel now let's move to the next
sheet which is regarding approximate
match okay so sometimes you might have
cases where you don't have the lookup
value present in the table in those
cases you can tell V lookup to return an
approximate match now one thing to keep
in mind is that your lookup value column
should always be sorted in ascending
order while trying to get an approximate
match so here we are going to use this
table and my lookup value column which
is going to be the representatives
column is already sorted in ascending
order and let's see the question we have
here so I want to find the item sold and
the unit cost for Matt so my lookup
value is going to be Matt now if you see
this table I don't have the
representatives name Matt anywhere in
the table now Now using an approximate
match I want to find the item and the
unit cost so let's do it so here under
item I'll write my vup formula so I'll
type V lookup I'll hit tab to complete
it and this time my lookup value is
going to be Matt so I'll select this
cell comma my table array I'll select
from the representatives column till the
end of item column because I want to
find the item value for mat I'll give a
comma my column index number as per the
table array is going to be two comma my
range lookup this time I'm going to give
us true or one so I'll write one close
the bracket hit enter all right it has
written me binder was the item sold by
Matt now let's try to figure out why we
look up returned binder as the
item now let's say you were asked to
insert the name Matt to the
representative column in alphabetical
order so where would you place it
ideally you should Place between KL and
Morgan since this column is already
sorted Matt should appear before Morgan
and after Kell so in an approximate
match we lookup will consider the
previous highest value in this case the
previous highest value before mat is ql
and hence we look up returned the
corresponding item purchased by KL which
is binder now
similarly if you wanted to find the unit
cost for
Matt again V lookup will return the unit
cost of Kel which is
125 let's just trite it out so I'll
write we lookup my lookup value is Matt
comma my table array for this time is
going to be from Representatives column
till the unit cost column I'll consider
I'll give a comma now the column index
number as per the table array is going
to be four I'll give another comma and
this time I'll double click true because
I want an approximate match if I close
the bracket hit enter you can see it has
returned me 125 which is actually kl's
unit cost okay we have another question
and this time I want to find the units
sold by Rob now Rob is going to be my
lookup value if you see the
representatives column we don't have Rob
now let's see what we look up is going
to return as the item for Rob so I'll
write V lookup I'll give my lookup value
as Rob comma my table array is going to
start from the representatives column
I'll select till here I'll give a comma
the column index number is two I'll give
another comma I'll double click on
true I close the bracket hit enter ENT
you can see V lookup has written me pen
now let's understand why V lookup
returned pen for Rob now if you are
asked to insert the representatives name
Rob into this column so ideally Rob
would appear somewhere between Morgan
and sorino because since this is sorted
in ascending order Rob is actually
greater than Morgan and is less than
sorino so as you know we look up in an
approximate match Returns the previous
highest value which is Morgan here and
the corresponding item for Morgan is pen
and hence we look up returned pen for
Rob all right now moving to the next
sheet which is another property of
vlookup which tells vlookup always looks
to the right this means that your lookup
value must always be on the left and the
value you are going to find out should
always be to the right of the table the
con consider this scenario where your
lookup value is on the left in this case
it is the representatives value and I
have taken svino for an example and we
want to find the order date for svino
now if you consider this table your
lookup value which is s we know is
actually this column the representatives
column and we are going to find out the
order date so your representative's name
is on the right of the table and the
value we are going to find find out is
on the left of the table now as for the
property V lookup only looks to the
right so if I use the vlookup function
for this example here I'll write vlookup
I'll give my lookup value as svino comma
my table array I'll consider from the
order date because I want the order date
till the representatives column I'll
give a comma and this time my column
index number number is actually the
first column if I consider my table
array as the first three columns
selected and my range lookup is going to
be false if I close the bracket hit
enter it returns me an error the reason
is we look up always looks to the right
and this time the value we were trying
to find out was to the left of the
table now if you consider the opposite
case suppose you have the order date and
you want to find the represent ATIV name
you can do that easily because your
lookup value which is the order date is
on the left and your representatives
column is on the right so let's just try
this I'll write V lookup my lookup value
is going to be svos order date so I'll
select it from the table I'll give a
comma my table array will start from the
G column let's say I'll select the
entire table comma and my column index
number will be three if you consider
these as my table
array comma my range lookup is zero if I
close this hit enter you can see we have
got svino corresponding to the order
date all right now let's move to the
next
tab now this tab says we lookup returns
only the first match so we have a
question at hand the question is find
the units sold by Jardine if you see
this table
we have the representatives name Jardin
twice you see here and if you look down
we have Jardin here as well but the item
sold by jardan at the first instance is
pencil and at the second instance it's
desk now as per the property V lookup
always returns the first match now
ideally when we write the V lookup
function and look for the units sold by
Jardine you will see vup will return 36
instead of three let's just write
out I'll write the vup
function my lookup value is Jardine
comma my table array I'll select from
the representatives column till the end
of units column I'll give a comma my
column index number based on the table
array is three I'll give another comma
Now I want the exact match so I'll
select zero close the bracket and hit
enter now as you can see it returns me
the first match of Jardine which is 36
so we lookup did not consider the second
match now
similarly if you consider this table we
have Jones repeated Thrice so you have
Jones here you have Jones here for the
second time and also we have Jones for
the third time and let's say you want to
find the unit cost for Jones so if I
write the vook of
function I'll consider my look of value
as Jones comma my table
array I'll select from the
representatives column till the end of
unit cost column I'll give a comma based
on the table array my unit cost column
is at the fourth index so I'll write
four comma the range lookup is zero if I
click on this and and hit enter you can
see it here V lookup has returned the
first instance of Jones and it did not
consider the second and the third
instance so our unit cost for Jones is
1.99 because V lookup only Returns the
first
match okay moving ahead to the next
example we have here is V lookup is case
insensitive if you consider this table
I've added another row in green
so if you see here I have a
representative name called Gil which is
in proper case or popularly known as
sentence Keys here I have added Gil's
name
in capital letters or all in uppercase
so I want to find the total revenue
generated by Gil the total revenue is
basically the total column let's do it
I'll write V
lookup my lookup value is Gil which is
actually in a case I'll consider my
table array from the representatives
column till the end of total column or
the sales
column based on this selection my column
index number is
five comma the range lookup is false so
I'll just double click on
false we close the bracket hit enter you
can see it here our vook of function has
returned the total as
53973 which is actually
the value for this row so clearly V look
up did not consider Gil which was
present at the bottom of the table in
upper case so this shows that V lookup
is clearly case
insensitive all right now moving to the
next example the V lookup function
supports wild cards which makes it
possible to perform a partial match on a
lookup value for instance you can use
vup to retrieve values from a table
after typing only part of a lookup value
to use wild cards with v lookup you must
specify the exact match by giving false
or zero for the last argument that is
range lookup now we have a question here
I want to know how much sales did the
representative whose name starts with Ki
make now here sales represents the total
column
actually so I want to find out the
person whose name starts with
Ki so if you consider the repres
representative column I have one
representative whose name starts with Ki
that is KL so using Ki as my lookup
value I want to find the total so let me
show you how to use wildcard characters
and find the value using vlookup so I'll
write my function
vlookup okay now in lookup value I'll
give
Ki after that I'm going to write Amber
Cent followed
by double inverted commas then I'm going
to write a star and close the inverted
comma this means the value starts with
Ki Amber sent actually represents
concatenation and star represents
anything followed by Ki so this is going
to be my lookup value in total I'll give
a
comma next I'll select my table array
starting from the rep Representatives
column till the end of total column
because I want to find the Sals I'll
give another
comma my column index number based on
the table array we have selected is five
comma the range lookup is zero because I
want to find an exact match close the
bracket hit enter you can see it here V
lookup has returned me
99.5 which is actually qals
total now there's another way to do it
instead of selecting the cell in which
we have the lookup value I can directly
write it in the v lookup function so
I'll write the V lookup function
something like this so my lookup
value I'll pass Ki within double
inverted commas because Ki is a
character value So within double
inverted commas I'm writing Ki followed
by Amber sent which is for con cenation
followed by a
star within double inverted commas so
this is going to be my look of values
this in total means anything that
appears after Ki will be considered as
the look of
value again the table array I'll select
as these rows and columns comma my
column index number would be five comma
the range lookup is zero if I close the
bracket hit enter you see we have the
same value so this is another method or
another way of using
vlookups okay now moving ahead let's
explore another feature of vlookup so if
the vlookup function cannot find a match
it returns a hash and a error now if you
want you can use the if na function to
replace the has na error with a friendly
message so suppose you want to find the
region in which an order was placed on
10th of May
2018 now if the order date is not found
I want to return a message that is
invalid date
so if you look at the order date column
we don't have any value for 10th of May
2015 you can see these values we don't
have any value corresponding to this
date so if my V lookup function cannot
find this lookup value I'll return
invalid date so let me show you how to
write this I'll type my vook of function
I'll give my order date as 10th of May
2015 as my lookup value and then I'll
consider my table array starting from
the order date column till the end of
region
column I'll give another comma my column
index number would be two this time
based on the table aray we have selected
comma I want an exact
match so I'll give zero close the
bracket and hit enter there you go it
has returned me an error now I want to
convert this error to a friendly message
saying invalid date so let me show you
how to do it I'll do it here so to
return a valid
message I'll use the if any function and
within ifna function I'll give my
vlookup function so let me type if
na I'll hit
tab now for the value parameter I'll use
my vooka function so my lookup value is
going to be the order date comma my
table array I'll select from the order
date column till the end of region
column comma my column index number is
going to be two comma my range lookup is
zero I'll close the bracket give another
comma Now if this expression results in
an error I want to display a message
that is invalid date so I'll put invalid
date within double codes since it is a
text
message I close the bracket hit enter
you can see the result which is invalid
date now moving on to the final section
of the demo we have two-way
lookup now in the v lookup function the
column index parameter is normally
hardcoded as a static number however you
can also create a dynamic column index
by using the match function to locate
the right
column and this technique allows you to
create a dynamic two-way lookup matching
on both rows and columns now let me
first show you how a match function
works so
suppose I want to find the index where
unit cost column is present so here I'll
use the match function I'll give my
lookup value as the unit cost column
name comma suppose I'll choose my lookup
array starting from Representatives
column till the unit cost column comma
I'll give my match type a zero for exact
match if I close the bracket hit enter
it returns me four because my array was
selected from the representatives column
till the unit cost column and in this
array unit cost is at the fourth index
all right now using this idea let's
solve the following problem I want to
find the cost of each item sold by
Morgan so let's write our vlookup
formula write
vlookup my lookup value is J5 which has
the representatives name as Morgan comma
my table array I'll select from C2 till
F12 I'll give a comma and this time I
know that my column index number is at 4
but I'll be using the match function to
find the
same so I'll write
match my lookup value is unit cost comma
my lookup array is from C1 till
fub1 comma my match type is zero I close
this bracket give another comma and I'll
give my range look up as zero close the
bracket hit enter you can see for Morgan
the unit cost is 19.99 you can verify
from the table for Morgan the unit cost
is
19.99 all right now we have another
question
here I want to find how much sales did
Andrew make in the central region so
here I have two lookup values one is
Central one is Andrews now looking at
these two values I want to find the
total to solve such
problems let me first create another
table I'll place the table somewhere
here okay so let me just paste the table
here all right now I'll create another
column where I'll merge the values of
region and representatives so here let
me create another column okay I'll just
name this column as region
rep all right now this
column I'll use the concatenation
operator so I'll Select East use Amber
Cent and then select Jones I'll hit
enter now the same thing I'll just
duplicate it for the other rows as well
so I have my new column created Now
using this table I can easily solve the
problem now to find the the total I'll
write my V lookup
formula so my lookup value will be a
combination of
G11
erson
k11 comma while table array will start
from the region rep which has the values
of region and rep combined
till the last
column and from this table array my
column index number is five
and my range lookup is zero if I close
the bracket hit enter you can see for
central region which is this one and for
Andrew's representative the total is
14925 all right now we are done with our
demo let's have a quick glance at what
all we did in this demo okay so first of
all we saw our data set which was a
sales data set that we used then we
started with our first example to see
how V looker performs an exact match we
also saw how using the formulas Tab and
look up and reference you
can write V lookup in another way so you
can use the function arguments to give
your vlookup parameters next we saw how
V lookup performs an approximate match
so we had mat and raw which were not
present in the representatives column
after that
we saw an important property of V lookup
that is V lookup only looks to the right
followed by V lookup only Returns the
first match following which we saw that
V lookup is case insensitive so here we
had added a new row where Gil was
present in upper case but still we look
up found the total revenue for Gil which
was in sentence case or proper case next
we saw how we can use Wild Card
characters to use V lookups and here we
saw how to use an if any function along
with v lookup and finally we saw how to
use two-way lookups choose from over 300

now we are on the sheet of Microsoft
Excel and here you can see some data on
my
sheet that is employee name employee ID
and salary so here we are going to
perform our horizontal lookup but before
that let me show you that this
particular drop- down menu so this
particular drop- down menu has all the
names of the employees in this
particular table and we have created
this using data validation in Excel if
you want to create the drop- down menus
just like this then feel free to check
out our data validation in Excel
tutorial link to which is in the
description box below now let's try to
implement H lookup in Excel so here we
have employee name but we want to find
out the employee ID so for that let's
create the H lookup now for that equals
to H
lookup now the first one is the lookup
value so this one is the cell which is
the employee name now after that the
table array we have to select all the
table arrays
here
now the row index number so the employee
ID is in row index number two according
to the table so for that provide two and
close the bracket and before closing
brackets you might want to give the
exact match so for exact match select
false and close the bracket press enter
and there you go and if you select Jack
then you'll find the employee ID of Jack
and if you select Jerry you'll find the
employee ID of Jerry reflecting here now
similarly let's find out the salary of
all the employees using H lookup so
equals H
lookup and lookup value that happens to
be the name of the employ now the table
array and next we have uh row index
number that is salary happens to be the
third row in the table so three
and exact match close the bracket and
enter so now if you change the values in
this particular drop down menu you'll
find the employee ID and their
particular salary so Jack happens to be
carrying the employee ID as 10001 and
his salary is 10,000 so similarly let's
try to find out pto's employee ID and
salary so there you go one5 and 50,000
as salary so that's how you use H lookup
in Excel here you can see the first
chart so this particular data is
converted into a table format to avoid
confusion while you're fixing the data
so here you can see the name of the
employee employee ID Department salary
and date of joining and here you can see
the salary column and the bonus
percentage of each and every employee
based on their salaries now coming to
the new data table and here on the table
two which is an updated table here you
can find we're going to find out the
department of the employee and the
current Department of employee and the
bonus percentage based on his or her
salary so why are we finding current
Department again so here you can see
that we have an intern Emily who has
joined in the year 2020 but recently she
got promoted as a developer so her
department has been changed from
Department intern to Department
developer in 2021 so that's what we're
going to find out here in the current
Department using X lookup now let's
start to implement X lookup so for that
equals to
xlup and for lookup you can see if you
need to find out the lookup value lookup
array return array and all the other two
are not important right now but you can
use them to get some exact matches in
the future we'll also use that in the
future for now let's try to use the
first three parameters that is lookup
value lookup array and written array so
the lookup value is the name of the
employee Mary and lookup array is right
here which is this one now we are going
to select the lookup array then comma
and uh we're going to look up the
department so this is the department
lookup array and that's all we need
close the bracket and press enter okay I
think we missed out the lookup value so
the employee or the lookup value which
we required was missed so I've added it
here so that is the lookup value the
first one which is Mary and there you go
press enter and you have the department
here now let's add it to all the rows
and here you have all the rows and all
the data related to all the employees
now we will find out the current
Department as you can see here you have
Emily as intern which is the old data
but what if you needed the latest data
that is the developer in the year 2021
right for that you might want to to work
the X lookup formula a little bit so
let's try that X look up look up value
which is the same and comma Now where
you have to look for the array that is
lookup array this one and the return
array which happens to be
this
one and
next you can find the exact match for
this one so that's all right exact match
and here comes the important part where
you have to search last to first by
default X lookup searches for first to
last that is like this in the starting
place to the last place so that's the
reason why we had Emily as intern so now
if we give last to first then it
retrieves the latest data where Emily
will be shown as developer now select
that and now you can close the brackets
and press enter so let's add that to all
the rows there you go now you can see
Emily Clark Peter and James all they
have got their updated job profiles as
you can see in the original data Emily
is a developer now so is Clark who was
originally a tester and he got promoted
to development team in 2021 similarly
Peter became a senior Finance executive
in 2021 and James the manager of sales
now let's try to find out the bonus for
all these employees based on their
salary so this one is quite simple so X
lookup now the lookup value is their
existing salary comma and the bonus part
so the lookup array is the salary range
then here is another important point so
here you might want to find the exact
match but finding the exact match will
not help you here you might want to
declare another type of value where you
can get exact match or next smaller item
so you'll understand it why I'm
selecting that so now let's close the
bracket and enter
so so now we have the bonus values now
let's add the bonus value to all the
factors all the rows I mean so you can
see we have different variety of
salaries that is 38,000 22,39 Etc but
here in the ranges we have provided 10
20 30 40 and 50 so what if the value is
between 30 and 20 that's when you want
the less number right that's when you
want the number which is equivalent to
30 or less than 30 which happens to be
15% so that's how it has worked here
that is 0.15% bonus to the actual salary
now we are on our Excel sheet here you
can see the employee names and employee
IDs of different employees from from
different zones let us imagine that the
blue one is from East Green one is from
West and the black one is from or the
purple one is from South and the orange
one is from North so this data is a
little small but what if we had a data
with hundreds or thousands of rows
including all the employee names
employee IDs or another relevant data
type like sales of an employee and his
employee ID and you were supposed to
combine all the data from all the four
different zones into one single sheet it
would consume a lot of time right so
recently Microsoft has released some
latest updates based on arrays and datas
so one of those is vack function in
Excel so how to use it since it is a
latest function I recommend you to go to
the file menu and in the file menu you
can navigate to account and in the
account if you can see the option of
update options then you can select
update now and your Microsoft Office
will be updated to the latest version
and you'll get access to the latest
functions in Excel and all the other
office related things like B on
presentation Etc now we going to
implement the vstack function in Excel
it is completely simple all you need to
do is equals to stack and then select
the data remember to select the data
from column A and cell two or the row
two we are not selecting the employee
name and employee ID we are just
selecting the data now separate them by
comma then again this one here this set
and again this
one and again lastly this particular law
set now close the bracket and press
enter and there you go you have all the
employee names and their respective
employee IDs all together in one data
set so this is how you use W stack
function in Excel and there are also a
few more new updates from Microsoft
Excel and we will discuss on them sooner
so the name itself conveys that it is
something like a reference function
right so it refers to a cell which is
present in a particular sheet or the
current sheet or it refers to a
particular range in the current sheet or
it can also refer to an entire workbook
in a current window right so you can
stay here on the sheet number one and
you can refer something which is present
on the sheet number 10 or 11 you can
stay in this current workbook and refer
to something which is around in a
different workbook Al together so that's
exactly how the indirect function in
Excel works okay so I guess the
definition was a little uh difficult to
get let me show you a simple demo here
so that it becomes a little easier for
you so currently I'm in the cell number
A2 right now here I will implement the
indirect function press tab to select it
and now I'll refer to the cell
C2 and let's enter and there you go let
me properly close the window it's there
so let me implement the indirect
function here so equals to indirect and
press tab to select now I'll be
selecting the cell C2 and inside C2 we
have E2 address now the formula is fine
I have implemented the indirect function
and selected the cell E2 and now if I
press enter see the magic there you go
so in the cell E2 we have the text hello
world so when I use the indirect
function to refer which is something in
C2 it is indirectly referring to another
cell address that is E2 which has the
text hello world now this one was a
little pretty simpler now let's check
some complicated ones and we'll move to
sheet number one one here we have some
student names and their uh you know uh
marks on the individual subjects that is
math science English computer science
and here and here you can see I'm
selecting the student names and
accordingly I'm getting their average
score and the total marks obtained right
seems interesting how did I do this so
this is done exactly using the indirect
function so let's do it again so this is
how you do it now here I will be using
okay before we get into this uh we need
to do some fundamentals before we do it
right so the fundamentals are you need
to name your individual columns so here
I have Brian and his marks so I'll
select entire marks of brine ranging
from B2 to B4 right click and here you
can see Define name and I'll be naming
it as
Brian it's already name we might get an
error so it's already named okay let's
add another one
maybe uh Jennifer let's cancel this so
let's uh add
Jenny and her marks will be
96 87 I'm selecting some random numbers
here so
87 so we have the new column here now we
need to name this Colum colum Define a
name and it's Jenny so Excel has
automatically selected the name for this
column so let's press okay now we have
our colums ready now here if you see the
drop down we have Amy bana Brian Brock
Emily Jenny John everyone over here
right so the columns are named the
individual columns are named so now the
student name so here you can use some
simple trick called Data validation here
select the data option in the toolbar
navigate to data tools here here select
data
validation and uh in this instead of any
value select list and here give the
source as this particular
set press okay so that you get the drop
down menu over here you can also type
the individual names again when you type
the individual names you might go wrong
with the case or spelling right so it's
better always to use this kind of list
options which will make things easier
for you now getting into the average
calculation so here the average which
will be uh equals to average press tab
to select now the indirect function
indirect
of this cell address and close the
bracket first you might get an error
because currently it is empty so select
some name and you'll get your average
score now same thing applies to uh you
know total you can press the sum
function select the sum function and uh
type in the indirect function and uh
the
cell V1 close the brackets and press
enter so that's how you do it however if
you are looking to get certified then
hey there we are here with an amazing
course through which you can catch the
eyes of top Recruiters in the industry
allow me to introduce postgraduate
program in data analytics by simply
learn so what are you waiting for hurry
up and enroll Now find the cost Link in
the description box now at times you
might be working on a important
spreadsheet on your Excel or you might
have the sales data of your company or
some confidential data of your
organization and you might have shared
the file with your junior or you might
face some paret issue and you forgot to
save or you miss to save your data and
what to do if you cannot save your data
and how can you recover it right so this
might be a really big hassle today we
are exactly going to discuss the same
and see how to do it in multiple ways so
Excel comes up with an option to
automattic automatically save the data
also it will try to warn you that your
data is not being saved would you like
me to save it or not right so we'll do
the first one so here you have the
autosave option you can either say okay
to it or you can ignore it in case if
you ignore it if you choose to ignore it
or if you choose to manually save it and
then if you want to close the file
remember we haven't saved the file if
you wish to close it Excel will
automatically come up with a dialog box
asking you want to save your ch es to
your data.
xlsx that means it is asking you if I
have to save it or not let's try to
ignore this and forcefully let's try to
close it you can go to task manager
option here we are trying to simulate
the option of barut issues so we are
forcefully closing Excel without saving
any
data so we have closed it now here you
can see we do not have Excel running in
the background now when you directly
open open or try to start Excel when you
get the power backup again and if you
want to open that same data file it will
ask you the document recovery option it
says you have closed the file without
saving the changes and you can choose to
you know come back from the same place
where we left last time okay now that
was the pocket issue and now let's see
uh another way okay let's imagine that
somebody uh eliminated few important
data files from your
organization's confidential data
employee ID employee name Etc and again
uh let's simulate the force uh close of
the
Excel now we are closing it again
without saving no data was been
saved now it will also ask the same uh
data it has another version here the
original one which wasn't saved so here
you can recover the same file again
however it was initially so you can save
it and it will get back to the original
place so this was one way also we have
another few multiple ways just we have
to navigate to file and here you can
open and in the open menu you have a
button called recover unsaved workbooks
not just the current workbook it will
also have all the remaining files which
are related to excel that are not saved
so here you have a few workbooks which
was not saved this is one option and we
also have another option we can just
navigate to info and there you have
another option called manage workbook
and in the manage workbook you have
another option called recover unsaved
workbooks which will also redirect you
to the same file that is Microsoft
Office unsaved files and you'll have all
the unsaved workbooks which are related
to excel so this is how you can recover
the unsaved data in Excel using multiple
ways first thing Excel will automatic IC
Ally ask you if you have to save the
file or not and in case if you forget to
save it you can directly recover it by
default by Excel it will automatically
show that some folder was not saved on
the left side of your Excel spreadsheet
by default and in case if you missed out
on that one you can manually go to file
and you can either choose open option or
info option to recover the unsaved
folders from your default file location
from your PC that is Microsoft Office
unsaved files Etc
which will have all the list of all
unsaved workbooks related to excel let's
