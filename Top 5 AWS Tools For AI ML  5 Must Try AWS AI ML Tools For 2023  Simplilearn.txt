hello everyone and welcome to Simply
learns YouTube channel in today's video
we'll be discussing something that's
often overlooked by a lot of individuals
wanting to venture into the field of
machine learning data science and even
artificial intelligence Chad GP the buz
word today it relies heavily on gpus for
its AI training as they can handle
massive amounts of data and computations
faster than CPU according to a report on
LinkedIn industry sources quoted that
Chad GPT has imported at least 10 ,000
high-end Nvidia gpus and drive sales of
Nvidia related products from 3 billion
to 11 billion within 12 months sounds
like a lot of gpus and investment right
it actually is for large models
intensive and advanced gpus are required
