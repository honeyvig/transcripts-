using a simple programming language
today we will explore one of those
programming language
and that is python if we talk about
python then Python's flexibility
Simplicity and versatility find its way
into these remarkable applications
python is used to create several
commonplace applications including
Spotify and Netflix and python is the
world's most widely used and fastest
growing programming language
and not just among software developers
but also among mathematicians scientists
accountants Network engineers and even
young children they are very familiar
with programming language python many
TDS processes such as coping files and
directories renaming them and uploading
them to a server can be automated with
Python scripts therefore a variety of
professionals and software developers
use Python to automate processes and
improve their lives
you now need to understand the
importance of a python developer and the
Python programming language today
developers are ruling our world so let's
get started with who is a good python
developer to be a good python developer
you will need more than just technical
knowledge and the following skills the
first skill you need to know is you
should have a problem solving mindset
the second skill you need is strong
communication skills you will need to
communicate project requirements and
features to your team this will also
help you write better documentation
the third skill you should have is an
eagerness to learn new tools and
libraries then you should have knowledge
of how things work internally and
definitely strong technical skills
and if we talk about the average salary
for a python developer in India that is
rupees 8 lakh 25 and 593 rupees per year
as stated by indeed.com
today at 21st December 2022 and the
average salary for a python developer in
the United States is 1 lakh
6649 dollars per view and now we will
start with what python is
so python is a general purpose
interpreted programming language during
its extreme versatility python is one of
the most sought after programming
languages by data scientists software
engineers and web Developers
python can be used in a wide range of
disciplines including data analysis
machine learning artificial intelligence
web development web scraping competitive
programming and much more
unsurprisingly given its versatility
python became the most sought after
language to learn in 2021
their specific employment positions and
sectors that a python developer can
pursue depending on the skill set
that is web developers software
Engineers data analysts data scientists
automation testers Etc these are all
python Developers
in the next question that arises in your
mind would be why to become a python
developer when there are so many other
programming languages that may be
learned let's look at some of the
benefits of being a python developer you
should start your programming earlier by
learning python for several reasons
first reason should be python has a
basic syntax and is easily readable
second should be it makes the language
easy to learn for both beginner and
intermediate programmers python is a
multi-purpose programming language with
many practical libraries and outstanding
analytical capabilities a programmer can
devote more time to development due to
these features of python then the third
reason should be python enables
programmers to write programs with fewer
lines of codes python programs for
instance run slower than Java programs
but they also need less time to create
because the python code is three to five
times shorter than the Java
and the next reason should be all
operating systems can utilize python for
free because it is open source software
the next is it is the most productive
language
then we have python has a wide range of
applications and python has a vast and
active community and it has hundreds of
built-in libraries and Frameworks now
moving on python is used by numerous
companies like Google
Facebook Netflix IBM and much more
these companies use Python to develop
software and use them for machine
learning web development and many more
you can see how beneficial learning
python is
now to become a python developer we will
Begin by studying the fundamentals of
Python Programming to master the
fundamentals of python you should study
these subjects
starting with basic syntax then you
should have a Hands-On any code editor
like Wim chapter notebook Google collab
or atom
then you should study the indentation of
Python language
then you should move to loops and
logical operators then we have data
types and variables then operators then
strings and numbers
and then we have conditional statements
and type conversions
and at last
we have functions and built-in functions
now we shall go to Python's most crucial
section that is data structures and
algorithms they serve as any computer
languages building blocks DSA is a
requirement for both coding and software
development interviews to master the DSA
you should learn about these subjects
starting with Aryan linked list
then we should learn binary search trees
and recursion
then we should learn python lists and
tuples then dictionaries sets and
slicing then we have stacks and queues
after that we should learn hashing
hash tables and graph traversing then we
should learn about sorting algorithms
divide and concur algorithms and many
more algorithms then we should have a
Hands-On dynamic programming
after finishing the python DSA we'll
move towards some of the advanced
concepts in Python and the relevant
topics to learn in the advanced topics
are we will start with object oriented
programming then we should learn the
methods
and then we should learn functional
programming and then we have the most
popular element that is inheritance then
we have decorators in Python and then we
have Lambda functions we should learn
how to use Lambda functions in this
language then we have classes and then
the simple and regular Expressions after
having expertise in core python Concepts
you should learn GitHub
do you know that practically all hiring
managers request a gator profile these
days
