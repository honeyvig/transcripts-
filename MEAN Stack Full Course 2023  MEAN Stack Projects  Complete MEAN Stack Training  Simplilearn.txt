do you know according to indie.com the
average salary of a mean stack developer
in the US is 120 000 US dollar per annum
and it can go up to 200 000 per annum
today's video will be a full course on
mean stack for 2023 starting from the
basic to Advanced topics we will start
this full course with angularjs which is
a front-end development tool for
creating web applications we will cover
basic topic like features of angular
architecture components types of form
building in angular form control form
groups and many more topics and finish
it off by creating a to-do app project
using angularjs we will also see the
difference between angularjs and
react.js next we will cover node.js
which is a JavaScript runtime that
allows developer to write server side
code in JavaScript in node.js we'll
cover topics like npm which is a node
backend manager then we'll see rest API
node.js authentication with JW D and
many more topics once we are done with
node our next step would be to learn
express.js so Express is a lightweight
framework that allows developer to
create server-side web applications
quickly and easily in Express we will
learn about methods error handling in
express.js how to connect the server
side to the client side and many more
once we are done with all the three the
next logical step would be to understand
mongodb where we will cover mongodb from
basic to Advanced we will discuss data
modeling operators projection indexing
aggregation in mongodb and many more
towards the end of this full course we
will also cover interview questions on
each of these four Technologies to make
you interview ready and you can land a
great job in the domain of mean stack
but before that if you want to become a
software developer consider the course
on full stack web developer mean stack
by simply learn and master those
necessary skills you can also consider a
postgraduate program by cash Tech in
full stack web development check out the
link the description box for more
details you can also call us on the
numbers that are given below and know
more about the program so without
further Ado let's get into this full
course
okay everyone I'm sure you're all aware
that every application that we use today
has something called the front end which
is the user interface and the back end
which is the software that accesses data
for us and finally we have the database
to store the data
now these three together form something
called as the full stack so hi guys
welcome to this video on what is full
stack by simply learn but before we
begin if you haven't subscribed to our
Channel already make sure to hit the
Subscribe button and the bell icon to
never miss an update so here's what's in
store for you first we'll have a look at
what front-end development is
then we'll see some of the front-end
languages
then we'll move on to some front-end
libraries and Frameworks
then we'll see what back-end development
is understand some of the popularly used
back-end languages and Frameworks and
finally we'll have a look at the
database
so now what exactly is front end every
time you open a website it has several
UI components and once you click on a
particular icon say sign in in this case
you get navigated to the sign in or the
login page right so what happens is that
all of these items facilitate navigation
and utility
these are collectively called as the
front end
so the front end is the visible part of
the website or the web application which
is responsible for user experience the
user directly interacts with the
front-end portion of the website or the
web application
so now let's have a look at some of the
front-end languages so I'm sure you've
heard of HTML CSS in JavaScript so these
are collectively called the front-end
languages when it comes to HTML it
defines the structure of websites and
formats the web pages it also defines
text documentation so let's look at a
simple example if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit skillup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more
one tag which is
the NF displayed the message hello
welcome
so correspondingly my website displays
the same message
so HTML is responsible or defines what
is being shown on the website next up is
CSS now CSS is a style sheet that allows
you to alter and style different web
components beat size font spacing Etc it
makes the content on the website look
more decorative correct so now if you
have a look at the code here I've added
some styling I've changed the font style
to italic I've made the text bold and
I've changed the color to red and again
correspondingly all the changes I've
seen on the website
moving on we have JavaScript now
JavaScript is a very powerful
client-side scripting language and it is
mainly used for enhancing the
interaction of a user with the web page
so again if you have a look at the code
here I've created a form wherein the
user can enter their name and I've also
displayed the message please enter your
name as a result an input box is made
available where the user can type in
their name now this is facilitated by
JavaScript so as I mentioned earlier it
is used to make web pages interactive
and bring the web applications to life
so next let's have a look at some
front-end Frameworks and libraries now
most of these are JavaScript Frameworks
and libraries first we have react then
there's angular there's view there's
jQuery and then there's bootstrap now
all of these help develop the front end
of the application however when it comes
to react angular in view it's not
necessary that you must know everything
to create a website one of them will be
sufficient however the usage of react is
on the rise and most of the developers
prefer using react jQuery and bootstrap
are also powerful Frameworks that can be
used used to create interactive web
pages now that you know what front-end
development is you must be wondering how
the data is being fetched and how this
data is being presented in front of you
on your screen correct now this is all
facilitated by the back end of the
application so let's understand what
back-end development is
now back end basically refers to the
server-side development of the
application
it is responsible for managing all the
database with the help of queries and
apis so every time the user makes a
request it queries the database and
retrieves the data from the database and
presents it to the user
and lastly it ensures data consistency
so now let's have a look at some
back-end languages and Frameworks
firstly we have node node and express.js
are packages provided by JavaScript
then there's python which is a very
popularly used language python
Frameworks like Django and flask are
popularly used to create the backend of
applications
then there's Java and Java provides
spring and Java server faces which are
also used for backend development then
there's c-sharp which provides
Frameworks like asp.net core and asp.net
MVC and other popularly used back-end
languages are PHP that's Pearl and Ruby
database is the collection of
interrelated data which helps an
efficient retrieval insertion and
deletion of data from database and
organizes the data in the form of tables
views schemas reports now some of the
commonly used database Management
systems are MySQL there's postgresql
there's Microsoft SQL Server this Oracle
database and then there's mongodb but
how can we assembly learn help you if
you wish to make a career as a full
stack developer then a certification
will come in handy for that you could
head to our official website and look
for full stack development courses now
we offer the full stack Java developer
Masters program
we also provide the postgraduate program
in full stacked web development and we
also provide the full stack web
developer mean stack Masters program you
can go ahead and click on the program
and have a look at the overview if this
suits your requirements you can go ahead
and purchase the course hey everyone
welcome to another video by simply learn
in today's video we're going to be
comparing two commonly used technology
Stacks that is mean stack and non-stack
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure you hit the Subscribe button and
the bell icon to never miss an update
so first let's begin by understanding
what exactly is a technology stack
now a technology stack is a combination
of programming languages Frameworks and
tools that developers use to build a web
or a mobile application
now the two main components of any app
are the client side and then the server
side
and each layer of the application is
built a top of the other
thus creating a stack
now the server side is not visible to
the user but is programming languages
power the user side and create the logic
of websites and applications
when it comes to client-side now this is
everything that users can see on their
screens and where the interaction is
happening the three main technologies
that fall under client-side are HTML CSS
and JavaScript
so now that you know what a technology
stack is let's go ahead and understand
what exactly is mean stack
now mean stack is defined as the
collection of JavaScript technologies
that assist in building complex websites
right now mean is basically an
abbreviation that stands for mongodb
express.js angularjs and node.js
now this framework provides quick and
easy development of web and mobile
applications
it also provides popular plugins and
reduces time on system administration so
if you want to speed up the process of
web and mobile application mean stack is
an appropriate choice
now while talking about the components
mongodb here is used to store the data
of backend applications like Json files
express.js is a back-end application
that runs on top of node.js you have
angular which is the front-end framework
that runs the code on the browser
and then you have node.js which provides
a runtime system for JavaScript on the
backend web application
so this was all about mean stack
so let's go ahead and understand what
man stack is
now monster like mean stack is also an
abbreviation so it stands for mongodb
express.js react.js and node.js now this
framework also provides quick and easy
development of web applications using
Java as its main component now it is
used to development of websites and it
makes use of libraries databases and
Frameworks now monstack ensures a smooth
development process and is becoming
increasingly popular in the development
Market
then again mongodb here it is a document
oriented nosql database that is used to
store backend data then you have
express.js which is a layered framework
built on top of node.js and it takes
care of all the websites back-end
functionality and structure you have
react.js which is a JavaScript library
that creates user interface components
for web applications and then you have
node.js which is a runtime environment
capable of running JavaScript on a
machine right so this was monstag now
you must be wondering what exactly are
the differences between monstack and
mean stack so let's go ahead and look at
them
first up is the obvious difference that
in means tag we use angular while in
monstack we use the act.js now angular
is obviously a JavaScript framework used
to build single page applications while
react is an open source JavaScript
library used to render components for a
smooth user experience
next up mean stack uses typescript
language while monstack uses JavaScript
and jsx now jsx is a combination of
JavaScript and HTML now since mean stack
uses angular the flow of data is
bi-directional that means any changes
made to the view part of the application
is reflected in the model part as well
and vice versa
but in the case of monstack which uses
react it uses unidirectional flow of
data meaning first the model state is
updated and then all the changes are
rendered to the view part of the
application
next up is that mean stack has a better
learning curve you need to know all the
concepts of angular like data binding
services routing bootstrap Etc
and in case of monstack it offers
excellent documentation making
development extremely smooth
so now you must be wondering which one
to choose now you know what mean stack
is you know what monstack is you know
how they function what the stack
comprises of what are the different
types of Concepts that can be used Etc
but if you're wondering what to choose
then this section will help you clarify
that out so there are many companies
that readily use different types of
stacks for web development so companies
like Accenture raindrop bungle among
others use mean stack while companies
like the ubereats Instagram Walmart use
monstack
also both the stacks provide an
incredible user experience and stability
and scalability are the objectives of
both these Stacks now Enterprise level
projects require mean over month and
month makes rendering the user interface
simpler and both of these are quick for
front-end development
however mean stack is good for large
scale applications and monstack is used
for faster development of smaller
applications so in conclusion one isn't
necessarily better than the other but
choosing the right stack for your
software process depends on the
front-end framework or related tools
that you would like to use right so if a
developer or team prefers using angular
they may choose to work with mean stack
meanwhile a developer or a team that
enjoys using react will gravitate
towards man stack so it's basically just
your choice and your requirements in
this session we're gonna cover the topic
of what is angular
sure all of you use mobile and web
applications
from social media to healthcare
e-commerce and net banking these apps
are used by billions of people across
the globe now the main reason we use
these apps is that they offer seamless
user experience and interface with
holiday developed to provide such
reliability one of the Frameworks that
is widely used to build such robust apps
is angular so let's dive into the
session now so here is a list of topics
that we're going to be covering first up
we'll see why angular was introduced
then what is angular
features of angular
angular architecture advantages and
limitations of angular
the learning curve of angular and
finally we look at some of the companies
that deploy angular so without further
delay let's begin
why angular now JavaScript is the most
commonly used client-side scripting
language it is written into HTML
documents enabling interactions with web
pages in many unique ways
so as a relatively easy to learn
language with almost pervasive support
it is exceptionally well suited to
develop modern applications but the
question arises
is Javascript ideal for developing
single page applications that require
modularity testability and other
features perhaps not however we have a
variety of Frameworks and libraries
designed to help us with such thing with
respect to front-end development angular
and JavaScript together bring in
structure and consistency to your web
applications and also provide
scalability and maintainability
angular is specifically developed for
single page applications so now the
question arises what exactly is angular
angular is an open Source JavaScript
framework written completely in
typescript
now it was primarily aimed to develop
single page applications and is
maintained by Google
angular as a framework provides a few
advantages while also providing a
standard structure for Developers
designed for web desktop and mobile
platforms
to doubt here as to what exactly single
page
are that help you with that now these
single page applications are basically
applications that get loaded just once
so the main pH gets loaded onto your
browser so any further interactions does
not lead to loading of subsequent Pages
anything that has to be done further is
just an addition to the already loaded
page these single page applications are
primarily developed using angular moving
ahead let's look at the features of
angular
we have four features that we're going
to be discussing we have the document
object model type script data binding
and testing now let's look at them one
by one now the document object model
treats an XML or an HTML document as a
tree structure now here every node in
the tree structure defines an object
representing a part of your document
angular uses the regular Dom now let's
suppose you've made 10 updates on a
single HTML page
so every time you make a change the
corresponding Dom or the tree structure
needs to be updated
angular updates the entire tree
structure of HTML tags moving on to our
next feature
we have typescript
now typescript defines a set of types to
JavaScript which helps you write
JavaScript that is easier to understand
now all the typescript code compiles
down to basic JavaScript that can run
smoothly on any platform now typescript
is not mandatory for developing an
angular application but it is highly
recommended the main reason is highly
recommended is that it offers better
syntactic structure while making the
code base easier to understand and
maintain now typescript can be installed
as an npm package now to do that you
just have to run the command npm install
hyphen G type script on your command
prompt let stop is data binding now data
binding is a process that allows you to
manipulate web page elements using the
web browser now it mainly employs
Dynamic HTML and does not require
complex scripting or programming
it is used in web pages that include
interactive components like calculators
tutorials Games Etc now incremental
display of a web page makes data binding
extremely convenient when Pages contain
a large amount of data when it comes to
angular
it uses two-way data binding
let's meet in the UI element is
reflected in the corresponding model
state
and conversely any changes made in the
model state are reflected onto the UI
state
allows the framework to connect to Tom
to the model data via the controller the
last feature we're discussing is testing
angular uses Jasmine to run its various
tests the Jasmine framework allows
various functionalities to write
different kinds of test cases karma is a
task runner for the tests that use a
configuration file to set the startup
reporters and testing framework so with
that we've covered the features of
angular
so let's go ahead and understand
the architecture of angular
angular is a full-fledged MVC framework
it provides a strong opinion on how the
application should be structured and
offers bi-directional data flow and
updates the real Dom MVC short for model
view controller is an architectural
pattern that separates the application
layer into model view and controller the
model here relates to all the data
related logic view on the other hand is
used for UI logic of the application
and controller is the brain of the setup
now it is an interface between the model
and view
moving on let's look at the advantages
of angular
first up we have custom components
angular allows you to build your own
components that can pack functionality
along with rendering logic into reusable
pieces
data binding as discussed angular allows
you to effortlessly move your data from
your JavaScript code to the view and
react to user events without having to
write any code yourself
dependency injection angular allows you
to write modular services and have them
injected wherever they are needed this
greatly improves the testability and
reusability of the same don't worry if
you can't wrap your head around these
topics we're going to discuss them
further in the coming videos
next Advantage is testing angular has
been built from the ground up with
testability in mind
you can literally test every part of
your application
comprehensive angular is a full-fledged
framework and provides out of the box
solutions for Server communication
routing and marketing
lastly we have excellent browser
compatibility angular is cross-platform
and browser compatible
an angular application can typically run
on all browsers with chrome Firefox
Safari and platforms like Windows Mac OS
and Linux now many versions of angular
have been released ever since its
Inception all of these versions have
added to the efficient working of the
framework now here are the different
versions released first up was angular
1.
built on JavaScript and completely based
on controllers next release was angular
2. now this Incorporated the component
based approach wherein the entire UI was
divided into several components and
lastly integrated to give the final
logic next was angular 4 it included
draft adaptation of angular CLI or
command line interface 1.0 was
introduced however not deployed in this
release the angular CLI was optimized
and commands like NG update and NG add
were added
the angle is 7 released prompts were
introduced which provided tips in CLI
about the functions being used
in angular 8 IV renderer and bazel were
introduced
and finally the most recent release was
angular 9. now this came with the better
framework and angular material now this
completely switched to the IV renderer
as a default compiler now that we've
learned about the pros of using angular
let's look at some of the limitations of
angle
first up is a steep learning curve now
since angular is a complete full-fledged
framework it becomes difficult for
Learners to begin with you need to be
acquainted with simple topics and then
move on to more advanced topics to
become proficient in this language
except is limited SEO auctions now
angular offers limited SEO options and
poor accessibility to search engine
Crawlers
it were both and complex
a common issue faced by the angular
Community is the verbosity of the
framework it also poses to be complex
compared to other front-end tools
and lastly migration
now one of the drawbacks of
Aqua migration
now it becomes difficult to Port Legacy
code to angular style architecture also
with each new release it is painful to
upgrade and a lot of them are not
Backward Compatible
next up let's look at the angular
learning curve
now if you wish to learn angular you
need to be acquainted with basic topics
in angular some of them are directives
modules decorators components Services
dependency injection pipes and templates
now once you've mastered your Basics you
will want to go and understand more
advanced topics such as change detection
zones aot compilation and rx.js however
the learning curve of angular is
clear-cut in the beginning it could be a
little intimidating but once you start
using the tool becomes way more easier
to comprehend and understand what is
going on
and lastly let's look at some of the
companies that use angular today
many top tier companies like Nike Forbes
Google HBO Sony upwork among others
readily deploy angular so moving on
let's look at the prerequisites for
angular
first up we have node.js angular uses
node.js as its base for a large part of
its build environment
so as a result to get started with
angular you will need to have node.js
installed on your environment so head to
their official website and download the
latest release for your corresponding
operating system next up is the angular
CLI now this command line interface is a
tool that makes it easier to bootstrap
and develop your angular applications
now to install the latest version run
the command npm install hyphen G at
angular front slash CLI you gotta run
this command on your command prompt and
finally to confirm installation check
for its version
now the next thing that you will need is
an IDE or a text editor to type your
code now there are several Ides that you
can choose from but in this series we've
used vs code throughout so it is
available on all platforms so go ahead
and download it if you haven't already
now moving on to the final part is the
demo now that you have a basic
understanding of angular and its
prerequisites I think you're ready to
create your first angular application
so let's head to our vs code and begin
here I've created a folder called
angular on my desktop and opened it on
my visual studio code so to create your
app you need to open the terminal just
go here and
select new terminal
and now type in the command Ng
new
and provide the name for your app so I'm
just gonna say hello world
so now this is going to create
to see yes
so basically what happens is that when
you run the command it will
automatically generate a skeleton
application under the folder that is
Hello World in our case and it includes
a bunch of files and installs all the
necessary dependencies for the angular
application
so this could take a while
so once you've created your application
to run it first change the directory so
let's say CD
hello world
and now use the command NG so
now once it's compiled you need to go to
your browser and type in localhost 4200
and once you do that
you can see your UI
you can see that the application has
been loaded onto your browser and it
says hello world app is running
so this is how you create your
application
so let's go back to our vs code now as
you can see here
there are many files and folders that
are created right so let's look at a few
of them of course we can't explain
everything but I'll brush through a few
of them
so the first main component is basically
the root component now the root
component here is the index.html
so here if you open the file and see
it's a very small crisp code right but
the most important thing in the file is
this app Root element
so what this does is it's basically the
marker for loading your application code
so this is extremely important so the
next important file is the main.ts
now this is a part of the bootstrapping
piece all right so the index.html file
is responsible for deciding which files
are to be loaded correct the main.ts
file on the other hand identifies which
angular module is to be loaded when the
application starts so this is just a
brief explanation as to what they're
doing
next we have the app folder now here we
have the app dot module.ts file now this
application module file can be thought
of as a core configuration of your
application
so here's where the source code starts
from and moving on we have the
app.component.ts these are all
typescript files hence the extension TS
now this file basically is the root
component of your application and then
we have the HTML file for the same which
defines the appearance of what you can
see on your browser so let me just
change the message that is being
displayed
so I'll say hey
welcome to this
angular
tutorial so let's save this and when we
go back to our browser
we can see the message hey welcome to
this angular tutorial being displayed
so like this we can make a simple change
and then it gets rendered onto your
browser so this was just a brief
explanation of what happens in the
background of your application
first we'll get acquainted to what
exactly angular components are then I'll
help you create an angular component by
showing a quick demo and lastly we'll
learn about component decorator metadata
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our Channel if you love
watching new and interesting technology
videos also hit the Bell icon to never
miss an update so what exactly are
angular components
now I'm sure everybody uses web
applications and one of the most widely
used applications is Gmail correct now
to help you understand what components
are consider them as Lego blocks now
they basically are combined together to
form the final application
so in this case here we have the logo
component then you have a sign in
component an image component and then a
create account component now all of
these components generally don't affect
the working of each other but however
when embedded they Define the UI of your
application
so I hope you understood what components
are so to go ahead let's discuss some of
its common features now firstly they are
the building blocks of an application
generally you have a root component
which is basically the app component and
then it branches out into other
components creating a hierarchy
and these components are a subset of
directives now don't worry about what
deductives are because we'll cover them
later on in the series but to give you
an idea there are three types of
directives you have the structural
directives the attribute directives and
the component directives
only one component can be instantiated
per element in a template now components
are typically custom HTML elements and
each of these elements can instantiate
only one component
now don't worry you'll understand this
better when I show you the demo
nextly a typescript class is used to
create a component now this class is
then decorated with the at component
decorator Now The Decorator accepts a
metadata object that gives information
about the component now a component must
belong to the NG module in order for it
to be usable by another component or
application
and finally components control their
runtime Behavior by implementing life
cycle hooks so this was just a brief
introduction to what amular components
are
now you will only be able to understand
the working of components when I show it
to you practically so let's head over to
a Visual Studio code now here back in my
vs code I've created a folder called
angular demo within which I've created
an angular application called demo
components once executed the browser
looks something like this so if you
haven't watched our previous video on
getting started with angular that is
angular hello world I highly suggest you
go through that video first it helps you
create your first angular application so
um now let's go ahead and create our
first component now the command used to
create our component is NG GC and your
component name once executed it creates
four different files now let's just see
how this works on RVs code now what you
can do is head to your terminal and type
in the command Ng
g c
and provide a name for your component
for example I'm gonna just call my
component text component all right
so what it does is that it creates four
different files you can see you have
four different files that have been
created and finally it updates the file
that is app.module.ts indicating that
this new component has been created so
here in your Source folder within which
is an app folder and again here you can
see that your four different files have
been created first is the HTML file
wherein you can Define all the code that
you want for your component next you
have the CSS file for your styling then
you have the dot TS file which includes
the component decorator and finally you
have spec.ts which is basically a unit
test file all right and then in your
app.module.ts you can observe that the
company that you've created that is text
component has been imported that is what
the message conveys here all right now
let's go back to our
app.component.html now this basically
has all the code for your applications
so so let me just get rid of it
and I'm just gonna display a basic
heading saying
hello
welcome all right so let me save it and
if you go ahead and look at your browser
hello welcome message displayed now
let's go back to our component dot HTML
file and here let me
provide a message
[Music]
let me say h
3
and let me display a message saying
welcome to this tutorial
on angular components all right now in
your text component dot TS file which is
your typescript file the selector
mentioned here is app hyphen text
component now go ahead and copy this
and in your final
component.html go ahead and create your
custom HTML tag with the selector that
you just copied now this indicates that
the component that you just created that
is the text component is being
Incorporated in the final render so what
happens is that whatever is defined in
the component.html file is also being
rendered in your final output so when I
say this let's go ahead and check our
browser you can see that the message
welcome to this tutorial on angular
components is displayed so this was a
simple creation of a component now for
this let's give it some styling so here
go to your dot CSS file and provide some
styling see for example here I just say
text line
and let me say Center and also in my
app.component.cs I'm going to give the
same thing and see each one
text align is Center
all right so let me save this
and there we go
now we can also create multiple
components and Define the tags in the
app component now the components are
executed sequentially
so now let's create another component
just to give you a brief insight into it
let's say NG GC image component
now here I'm going to be adding the
simply learn logo so I'll show you how
that works
now you can see that a new component has
been created with four files again so in
my assets folder here I've added the
logo so what I can do is back in my HTML
file I can go ahead and create an image
tag so first let me just display another
message here
just to avoid any confusion and let me
say this is the image component
and then let me say
image
Source equals so the source is basically
assets
[Music]
slash logo
dot PNG
and class equals
Center
[Music]
all right so you can also head to your
CSS file and provide any sort of styling
that you need so let me just see
text
align
to be Center
and then let's create
a styling for the image
and here I mentioned the code for the
image so let's save this and from the
dot CS file let's copy the selector
and create a custom HTML tag in our
final component.html file
so there we go let's save this and check
the output
and there we go first the hello welcome
message is displayed next you have the
message displayed from the first
component and then you have the second
component so this is how you can create
your own components and don't forget to
incorporate these selectors into your
final HTML file so moving on to our next
topic component decorator metadata now
as mentioned earlier the at component
decorator accepts a metadata object that
provides information about the component
correct here is a list of properties of
the metadata object first up is the
selector now basically the selector is a
CSS selector that identifies this
particular component in a template now
this corresponds to the HTML tag that is
included in the parent component you can
create your own HTML tag however the
same has to be included in the parent
component so to help you understand that
better let's head back to our vs code
and say for example in our text
component
here
the selector says text component correct
for the time being let's change it to
say n component
all right now when you save it and look
at the browser the message is not
displayed so what we can do is you can
copy this
selector and then include this
here
and now you can see that the same
component has been rendered onto your
output
all right so the selector plays a
crucial role in that
next up we have the template now a
template is an inline defined template
for the view now the template can be
used to provide some particular markup
the markup could typically include some
headings or paragraphs that are
displayed on the UI
next up we have template URL now it is
the URL for the external file containing
the template for The View
so here you can see
this is basically the external file that
contains the template for the view next
up you have Styles now these are also
inline defined styles that can be
applied to the components view so any
code that you provide in the dot CSS
file can also be included here next you
have the style URLs now this is a list
of URLs to your style sheets that are
applied on your components View
next up you have providers now this is
again an array where certain Services
can be registered for your component
lastly we have animations as the name
suggests these are animations that can
be listed for your components
first we'll understand what exactly
dependency injection is
then we'll understand the demerit or the
drawback of not using dependency
injection
then we'll understand dependency
injection as a design pattern and
finally I'll help you understand the
entire concept with the help of a demo
so let's begin
what exactly is dependency injection so
let's consider this I'm sure you're
aware that angular uses the concept of
components the entire UI of the
application is divided into several
components now what have all of these
components perform similar tasks be it
accessing the database rendering images
Etc now instead of writing the same
piece of code for every component you
could write the code once and then
perhaps inject the same core into every
component
now this is supported by dependency
injection now to give you a better
example consider two classes A and B now
let's assume that a uses the objects of
Class B and normally in object oriented
programming an instance of Class B is
created so that a can access its objects
with using dependency injection we move
the creation and binding of dependent
objects outside of the class that depend
on them so dependency injection or di
keeps the code more flexible testable
and mutable also classes can inherit
external logic without having to create
on its own and lastly di benefits
directives pipes and components
next up let's have a look at the
drawback of not using dependency
injection
now let's consider Class Postal details
that is dependent on the number and the
address class
in the postal details class the
Constructor creates copies of the number
and address
so when you instantiate a new postal
details class the Constructor
instantiates a unique number and address
now although this looks simple there's a
problem with this code let's assume that
the number and address class
Constructors now accept parameters when
we change the numbers class the postal
details class gets broken now to
overcome this what we need to do is we
need to pass parameter to the number
Constructor so this applies to address
as well the first drawback of using this
traditional method is that the code is
not very flexible anytime the
dependencies change the postal details
class needs to be changed as well
and the second drawback is that the code
is not suitable for testing
once you instantiate the new postal
details class you get the same number
and address even if you change the
number and address classes every time
what if these classes are in turn
dependent on other classes
then it's going to be a chain reaction
so to overcome this we make use of
dependency injection
now let's look at di as a pattern
dependency injection as you all know is
a coding pattern where a class receives
its dependencies from an external Source
rather than creating them on its own so
here in the above example we have moved
the definition of dependencies from
inside the Constructor to the
constructor's parameters
so the postal details class doesn't
create the dependencies anymore
it just consumes them so the postal
dependencies class doesn't create the
dependencies anymore
so with that we overcome the drawbacks
of not using Di
so now that you know what exactly
dependency injection is and how vital it
is let's look at a simple demonstration
to understand the concept better now
services classes modules components all
of these are benefactors of dependency
injection so in the demo I'm going to be
showing how dependency injection can be
used with the help of services and
injecting these Services into classes so
the main uh thought behind this is
normally components are used to ensure
just a good user experience these
components do not generally execute
tasks so to execute these tasks we make
use of services so a component can
delegate tasks like fetching data from
the server any network related issues
ETC to a particular service and these
Services can be made available to
components with the same thought what
I'm going to be doing is I'll be
creating a service that performs the
task of displaying an employee list
later we're going to inject the service
into the class using dependency
injection
so let's head to our Visual Studio code
for the demonstration
all right so as discussed I'll have to
first create a component that displays a
button for the employee and then I have
to create a service class and inject it
into my component now this service holds
the employee details such as name
employee ID email ID
Etc so first let's go ahead and create a
component
so here let me just type
NG GC
and the name of the component I'm
providing is M info
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit skillup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more
all right so as you can see here in my
app folder I have the component with
four different files all right so the
next thing we have to do is we have to
create a service so to create that we
make use of the command n g g s
you can either give s or service and the
service name I'm providing is records so
let me just say record zero
all right here you can see two files are
created there is a spect.ts file and the
dot TS file all right so now the service
contains all the employee data that
needs to be displayed right so let's go
ahead and write the data so first we're
going to make use of three arrays I'm
going to be displaying employee records
for three employees so I'll have to
create three arrays and provide certain
information so let's go ahead and do
that
all right so the array I'm creating is
called info one for the first employee
and I'm going to be passing
information like name employee ID and
the email ID so the arrays of type
string
and within which let me just mention the
details I'm giving random information
I'm just saying Adam Taylor
and some random
employee ID
and let's say 80 at abc.net
all right so I'm going to be creating
three records so I'll just copy the same
thing and paste with the rest too
let's just change here
provide a different name here
and same for the last one
and let me change the name of the array
as well
followed so with the agenda to retrieve
this data in our component we make use
of the method for the same right so this
method Returns the employee data
so let's go ahead and create this method
I'm going to call it get info
and then just say string
and then this will just return
this dot info one
all right I'm going to be calling it get
info one for better understanding
same for the rest two as well
I'm just gonna return different arrays
here
all right and lastly info three all
right
now in order to retrieve this
information in our component we need
three more arrays right three more
arrays I will receive this data let's go
back to our component dot TS file here
and then type in the following code
so I've created three arrays again or
info received one two and three
now what we need to do is we have to
accept the information that is being
sent from the service correct now as I
mentioned services are implemented with
the help of dependency injection so what
we need to do is we'll have to first
import the service into the component.ts
file the key reason behind doing this is
that when angular creates this component
an instance of the service class is also
made to perform the necessary tasks
correct so let's go ahead and just
import it here
so I'll say import
[Music]
records
services
I'm sorry service
from
and let's say records.service
all right and what we have to do next is
that we must also declare this instance
that is being created in the provider's
area of the component
all right so
let's just say providers
and then say records
service
all right now we've created the instance
of this class right however to access
this instance an object is also created
so this object will in turn access the
methods and variables of the service
class
so for that we have to create another
object so let's do that here in our
Constructor method let's say Constructor
private
and the object I'm creating is called
our service you can give a name of your
choice and then I'm going to just say
records service
all right now this object will help me
retrieve data from the service so let's
go ahead and use this in order to get
the employee details our ads have
created three different methods here get
info from service class 2 1 and 3 and
these methods will retrieve the data and
add it to our array here that is info
received all right and lastly
we'll have to create an unordered list
in our HTML file here we haven't added
anything so let me get rid of this
so now I have to create three different
buttons for three different employees
and when the user clicks on the button
the data is retrieved from the service
and then displayed on the UI right
so as you can see I've created buttons
for three different employees
and then I've made use of a bootstrap
class called list group info and then
I've
interpolated info which displays the
contents
of the info variable all right now in
order to call the methods in the dot TS
file we have to bind them with the
button so since it is bound with the
click event every time you click on the
button the information is displayed
so now the last thing we have to do is
we'll have to create a custom HTML tag
for the component and then add it to the
main component
so let's just do that
let me copy this here
and then in my app component.html let me
get rid of this
and then let me just create this
I've just created the custom HTML tag
for my component
and now just to beautify the code I'll
write a heading
and let's say employee
details
and then I'll also add the simply learn
logo
say image source
[Music]
I've I've added the image here so let me
just say logo
dot PNG
I've also added some styling to it all
right so now let me just save this and
have a look at the browser
so here we go we have the logo here and
then employee details heading and then
we have three different buttons created
that is employee one two and three and
when I click on it
the information of the employee is
displayed the name the ID and their
email address
so yeah so this is how you can make use
of dependency injection and inject a
service class into a component
dependency injection plays a crucial
role in angular
we'll understand what angular forms are
then we look at the different types of
form building supported by angular next
up we'll get acquainted with features
like form control and group control
and we learn all of this with the help
of a simple demo
so without further Ado let's begin
so what exactly are angular forms
now I'm sure every application that you
use comes with certain amount of form
filling correct be it your login
credentials or your sign up forms or any
sort of registration forms Etc so forms
are an integral part of a web
application you need forms to update
your profile or to enter sensitive
information or also to perform any sort
of data related tasks so now let's look
at the different types of form building
supported by angular
first up angular supports two types of
form building
first you have the template driven
approach and second you have the
reactive approach
now let's look at them one by one so
talking about template driven approach
in this method the conventional form tag
is used to create forms so angular
automatically interprets and creates a
form object with the help of the
directors
Now controls can be added to the form
using the NG model tag now multiple
controls can be grouped using the NG
control group module so it basically
uses several module classes to provide
controls now if you don't get this don't
worry you'll understand better when I'm
showing you the demo
next up is Json values so form value can
be generated using the form dot value
object
form data is exported as Json values
when the subwidth method is called
lastly basic HTML validations can be
used to validate the form fields in the
case of custom validations directives
can be used so arguably this method is
the simplest way to create an angular
form
so moving on to the active approach now
this approach is the programming
Paradigm revolving around data flows and
propagation of change
now with reactive forms the component
directly manages the data flows between
the form controls and the data models
now reactive forms are code driven
unlike template driven approach
reactive forms eliminate the
anti-pattern of updating the data model
by a two-way data banding so it does not
use two-way data binding
and typically a reactive form control
creation is synchronous and can be unit
tested with synchronous programming
techniques
so now let's go ahead and look at form
control and form group
so consider a typical form consisting of
fields like name age and location
now a form control is basically a class
that enables validation of these fields
for each input field an instance of this
class is created now these instances
help check the values of the field and
see if they are either touched untouched
dirty pristine valid invalid and so on
so this allows you to check every field
for the value it makes it easier to
understand which Fields value is invalid
or which field has not been entered
Etc
now moving on to form group
so a form group class represents a group
of controls a form can have multiple
group controls the form group returns
true if all the controls are valid and
provides validation errors if there are
any so I hope this was clear
so moving ahead let's look at the demo
to explain all of these features I am
sure it will become extremely clear once
you look at the demo so for that let's
head to our vs code
so back in my vs code
I've created a component called form
component and I've also included the
simply learn logo just to purify the
appearance so once you execute the code
this is what you want to see on your
browser so you just have the logo at the
moment
the first thing we need to do is we'll
have to import the forms module all
right so oh uh but before we begin let
me tell you what the use case is so
we're going to be creating a user
registration form which is going to
include four fields that is the first
name and last name email ID and the
password all right so now let me show
you how to import the forms module so in
your main
app.module.ts file you will have to
import forms module from angular forms
all right and then in your Imports
you'll have to just call it here
all right so this is just a simple step
and now once you're done with that let's
go ahead and start our form creation
so here in my component.html let's
enclose the entire form within a div tag
so here let me see div
class
as a container
within which let me just have one
heading
which says user registration
all right and now let's go ahead and
create our form
so first let me just say form
now I'm going to create a div class for
every field so say div
class
equals form group
I'll explain it to you a little later
now first let's create a label
so label tag
for
basically it's the first name
so let me just say first name
and the tag will basically have
first name again
all right and let me just break the line
next we have the field so let's say
input
type is text
name is
first name
and we have a class which is
the form control class
all right
so this we have to do for all the other
fields so let me just copy this
and
paste it like four times
I'll also add the tag 3 for spacing
let's do that here
and finally we'll have the button
so let's just add that here
with a type submit
and let's just say submit on the button
so now let's go ahead and change these
values here
so here let me just change it to last
name
here as well
and here as well
and in this case it is going to be email
so let me just change it here
and finally we have passwords so
let's add that here
all right so let's save this and just
have a look at our browser
so there we go we have our uh user
registration form ready but I would like
to uh align it to the center so let me
just do that
so here in my CSS file
I'm just going to uh align all the div
tags in the center and the label tag to
the left so let me save this and look at
the browser now
and there we go we have our registration
form was a logo so this is how you
create a simple form
now we'll have to add a directive called
NG model now this directive when added
into the input tag will provide form
controls to every input field
all right so here let's just go ahead
and say NG model
that is it
so let me just copy this and paste it
for every other field
all right let me save this and back in
my browser
let me inspect
and here you can see different types of
classes like NG untouched NG pristine NG
ballot are added right so this indicates
that angular has recognized the form Tab
and it has added these classes to the
form as well as all the fields
so this is achieved when you add the NG
model directive in your input tag now
back in my vs code now every form has an
output property attached to it called NG
submit all right so this property can be
bound within a method that method called
the submit method
so once submitted this method is called
right so once we click on the submit
button this method has to be called so
to include that
we'll have to just save
form
and G submit
equals
submit
[Music]
all right so now we have to define the
submit method
in our component.ts file so here let me
just go to our component.ts file and let
me
just get rid of unnecessary code here
and let's define a function
or submit
and then here let me just
console log
form submitted
all right so let me just get rid of this
as well it's unnecessary here
let's save this so what it means is that
every time you click on the submit
button
this method is called all right so let's
just have a look at the browser so first
let's go to our console
and when I click on submit it says form
submitted
all right so the next crucial step is to
generate JavaScript representation now
we'll have to make use of another
directive called NG form that is
assigned to a template variable
okay so this JavaScript representation
helps with validating all the fields so
I'll help you understand that better
so back in our HTML file
let's just create a variable first
let's call it login
all right and say Ng
form
okay now the mg form object includes the
JavaScript representation so now while
you're calling the submit method you're
going to pass login as a parameter
so let's just say login here
and in my ts file again let's just say
login
and along with it
I won't login to be displayed so
I say login again
so now let's save this
and if you have a look at the browser
let's click on submit
and now here you can see the JavaScript
representation So within form
I can
check for email
or say first name and here for this
field first name you can see different
properties attached you can see invalid
is it invalid or is it untouched
which is true or are there any errors so
this basically gives you all information
about the particular field
so we can make use of this feature to
validate the information so we're going
to learn about that in our next segment
moving on to form validation one way to
ensure that incorrect fields are not
submitted is by disabling the submit
button
correct now apart from this you can also
specify certain properties in your input
tag for the corresponding input field
now
um let's say that the fields that
now let's say that the fields can't be
empty and the form only accepts names
with the minimum length of 2 and the
maximum length of 7.
so here in my input tag I just mentioned
a required meaning this field cannot be
empty
and Min length
to 2
and
max length
to say 7.
all right
so to check this
let's go to our browser
and here
let me submit the form without filling
the first name
and evidently there has to be an error
so when I submit it
and I look here
within forms and here controls
and my first name you can see that an
error is shown here it says require
equals true that means that there is one
error now you can make use of these form
control objects you can leverage form
control objects to ensure field
validation and display a message
whenever an error occurs
right so to do that you need to access
these objects like errors or invalid or
touched all of these properties or
objects need to be
accessed for that we'll have to create a
template variable
and then this variable is assigned to
this object so back in our vs code
let's create
a variable let me call it
name
and let's say NG model
all right here the variable name
receives the control object
so here back in my browser when I submit
again without the first name
you can see that the invalid
property is set to True correct so this
helps us use this property to alert the
user with the help of a simple if logic
so back in my
vs code let me create
another div tag
within which I mentioned NG if
in which I'm going to use a simple if
logic so let's say MGF
name which is our template variable name
dot touched
and name dot invalid
is true
right then I'm going to alert
so I'm gonna
make use of an alert
here let's say
alert
Danger
all right
so in my CSS file I'll have to mention
the simple styling for alert
so here let me just say
so we're gonna have the background color
red
for danger all right and here I'm gonna
display the message
invalid in bold
so now let's go back to our browser and
check it
so let me proceed without entering the
last name it says invalid here so this
was a simple demonstration to show you
form validation
of course you can modify the code
depending on your requirement say
suppose the length of the first name is
too short then you can alert the user
with a different message or uh suppose
they have missed out on filling a form
field then you can again alert the user
so you can basically make use of the
nested if condition right now just to
help you understand that better let me
just show it to you
now back in my HTML file
instead of invalid let me have another
tag a paragraph tag
within which I make use of NG if again
now ngf
name dot errors
[Music]
dot required
is true
then I display the message first
name required
all right
and if
the length of the first name is
not 2.
now if the length of the first name is
less than 2 then I'm going to display
another message so let me just say
name dot errors
dot Min length
if this is true then I'm going to say
sorry
short
first name
all right so let's save this and have a
look at the browser
when I proceed without providing the
name it says first name required but
when I type in one character it says
sorry short first name but if I type in
another character it accepts so I hope
this made you understand how form
validation works
so this was just a simple demonstration
again now I highly recommend you explore
these properties and play around with
these objects uh trust me it's really
fun so I hope this tutorial helped you
out let's begin
first let's have a look at the basics of
routing
now I'm sure that you've observed that
the URL changes every time you click on
a particular link or on an icon on the
user interface correct now this
basically indicates that you are
navigating throughout the application
now to achieve this navigation we use a
mechanism called routing routing is
essentially used to navigate through a
website or a web application
but how is it achieved in angular
especially in angular routing plays a
major role it is used to create a single
page applications now these applications
are loaded just once and new content is
added dynamically applications like
Google Facebook Twitter and Gmail are a
few examples of single page applications
the best part of using single page
applications is that it provides an
excellent user experience and you don't
even have to wait for new pages to load
which by extension makes single page
applications extremely fast but how is
this new content loaded
enter routing now routing is the
mechanism that as discussed earlier that
is used to navigate through the
application and load new content
routing helps angular configure the
route and the component that needs to be
displayed
now I'm sure you're going to understand
the concept of routing better when you
work on it Hands-On
so in the demo we're going to be
navigating to the login and the home
pages of a web application with the help
of routing
so let's head to our Visual Studio code
so basically the objective of our
application is to navigate to home and
the login pages so when I click on the
login icon here it loads the login page
and here you can see the extension
slash login and similarly with home once
you click on it some new information
gets added and the URL changes
with a slash home appended all right so
this is the main objective of our
application so to create it let's head
back to our vs code all right so here
I've created a folder called demo and
underscore angular and I've created a
file called demo routing
now the first thing you want to do is
open the index.html file and make sure
that the base tag is added now although
this is generally added when your app is
created if it is not then add a base tag
with href attribute which is set to a
forward slash
all right now this is generally done to
tell angular to construct the URL while
navigating with a forward slash all
right and the next thing you want to do
is open your app dot module.ts file and
check if the app routing module has been
imported
if not go ahead and import it and then
also mention it in your Imports array
or with that or the initial setup is
done
Now to create the nav bar the code that
I'm going to be using is already
explained in the previous video that is
angular bootstrap I highly suggest you
go through that video before watching
this
so uh the code is already available I'm
just going to create a component and
write the code for it and paste the code
in it so let's do that
let me say NG g c
navbar
[Music]
alright so this component is now created
now here in my HTML file
I'll just get rid of this and paste the
code for the nav bar
so here we go I've pasted the code for
the navigation bar
and back in my
app.component.html file I'll just remove
all The Unwanted code here
and just specify the
custom HTML tag for my nav bar
so let me just create one here
all right let me save this let me just
run the application and see if it's
displaying correctly
all right so when I open the browser the
navigation bar has been created
along with these different options
that's home about services and login
all right and we also have the simply
learn icon here all right now the next
step is to generate the components to
display the login page content and the
home page content
now again I have used bootstrap to
define the user interface for these
files you can easily find the code
online just search for a bootstrap login
templates and depending on your
requirements you can choose the
appropriate one
so first let's create the components for
by two files that is for the home
component
and the login component
so let's go ahead and do that
[Music]
nggc
I'm just going to call it login for my
login component
all right and then I'm gonna say nggc
home for the home component
all right
so I'm just going to copy the code for
the login component
so back in my login.html
file
I'll just paste the code here
okay
also note that I've added the simply
learn logo in my assets folder
and then just provided the source for it
here in my login component
all right
so next up is the home component
and if you've seen the previous video
that is angular bootstrap you might have
seen that we created three different
components that is intro courses and
footer which included the content for
the intro message for the courses and
the photo message correct so here we're
going to just paste the code for all of
these three
and then just display it when the home
button is clicked
alright so what I'm going to do is I'll
just paste it here
[Music]
so this basically has all the content
one thing I want to tell you is that in
the previous video we made sure that the
code was written in three different
components however for this I've just
added all the code in the same component
now I agree that this is not the best
practice so if you want you can go ahead
and create three different components
and separate the code into these three
components and just add the custom HTML
tags in your home component
I'm just hoping you're following me
right now and also here in my assets
folder I have added a video and the
YouTube logo that needs to be displayed
uh when the home icon is clicked all
right so now that we've created the home
and the login components the next step
is to configure the routes for the
application right so here you can see
that we have a file called app routing
module.ts file
so here we have the routes and the
router module that is imported and we
also have a constant called routes which
is strongly typed to routes from the
router package
all right now this array is used to
define all the possible routes in the
application now each route is basically
an object with a path
so here in my routes array I'm just
going to go ahead and create the paths
that is we have two different uh routes
right one is for login and one is for
home so I'm just gonna create a path
object so let's say path
I'm sorry within curly braces I say path
foreign
this is basically what will appear uh on
the URL all right and the component that
needs to be
navigated to is nothing but the login
component
so let me just say login
component as you can see the login
component has been automatically
imported
now same with
the Home Path so let me just say
path
home
and the component that needs to be
rendered is the home component
[Music]
all right
now the next step is to link these
routes to a button
in the nav bar that is the home and the
login button right so we're gonna make
use of the nav tag and an anchor tag for
this
you can see that we have a nav tag
and an anchor tag
which encloses the login and the home
components
all right now we're going to make use of
two directives from the router package
called router link and router link actor
now these are specified within the
anchor tag the router link basically
holds the path to the page
and the latter that is the router link
active specifies one or more CSS classes
that will be applied when the router
link is active
all right so to do that let me just add
router
link
all right in our case it is home here
and we're gonna have another director
called router link active
[Music]
and we're just gonna say active here
[Music]
all right
same for the login icon here
let me just copy this
[Music]
and instead of home
the path we created for this was login
[Music]
all right
so this is how you can bind the route to
your specific button on your UI
now despite of all this how are we
specifying where these components are to
be displayed
right the answer to this is using the
router Outlet director now again this
directive is available in the router
package so we have to add that in our
app component.html file
so here just go ahead and type
router Outlet
all right so with that we've created a
simple navigation bar which has
different options that is home about
services and Link and once the user
clicks on the home icon it displays the
content that is in the home
component.html file and once the user
clicks on the login component it
displays the content in the login.html
file
all right it's as simple as that so now
let's go to the browser and see if it
executes correctly
so all right we have the navigation bar
and once I click on the home icon here
all right yes we see that all the
content has been loaded
you can see we have uh the intro section
we have the courses section and the
footer section as discussed
and the most important part is that here
in our URL you can see that slash home
has been appended this shows that a
route has been created that navigates to
the home component so we've successfully
created a route here
and for login component when I click on
this icon you can see that the path
changes here and the login component
gets displayed
all right so this is how routing is
achieved in angular hello everyone and
welcome back to another video by simply
learn this is a number and in this video
we will be creating a angularjs project
but before we jump to the coding part if
you haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to hit the Subscribe
button and press the Bell icon so you
will never miss any update from Simply
learn
so without further Ado let's see how our
application will look like at the end of
this video
so let me show you however application
will look like
so
like this our application will look like
here you can add anything like like
share
and comment
you can also remove it or Mark as done
like this you just have to click
and just remove if you want
from here you can just write anything
and just add like this if it's done
or you want to remove it
so
before we jump to the coding part let me
just tell you about a angular overview
so what is angular angular is an open
source JavaScript framework written in
typescript
Google maintains it and its primarily
purpose is to develop single page
applications as a framework
angular has clear advantage while also
providing the standard structure for
developers on a team to work with it
enables users to develop large
application in a maintainable manner
so there are so many advantages
using angular but the two I love the
most is data binding and browser
compatibility
you can also check out our videos on
angular for deep understanding
so what is data binding angular enables
users to effortlessly move data from
JavaScript code to view and react to the
user and events without having to write
any code manually
and the browser compatibility as angular
is a cross-platform and compatible with
multiple browsers an angular application
can typically run on any browsers for
example Chrome Firefox and others such
as Windows Mac OS and Linux
so
let's open our
Visual Studio code
let's cut this
the first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna create an angular project
for that let's open our command prompt
in this command prompt we'll write a
command
npm
install
I think globally
at
regular
CLI
press enter
so for this you must have node.js and
npm install in your system
it'll take a couple of seconds to
install the files let's wait a minute
meanwhile
let me tell you why we use angular
JavaScript is the most commonly used
client-side scripting language it is
written in HTML documents to enable
interaction with web pages in many
unique ways as it is relatively easy to
learn language it is well suited for
Developers for modern applications
let's wait a couple of seconds more
so whatever angular application is
installed
so now we're gonna create a project for
that
we're going to write NG new and the
project name here I'm gonna write
angular
ah
press enter
we're gonna ask you a few steps
yes I'm gonna type CSS
and it will install all the necessary
packages
let's wait a couple of seconds more
let's discuss some other things about
angular
JavaScript idle for developing single
page application that we all know but
that requires modularity testability and
developers probability perhaps not
these days we have a variety of
Frameworks and libraries designed to
provide alternative Solutions
with respect to where front-end
Frameworks
angular address is many if not all of
the issues developer face when using
JavaScript on its own so angular is the
best app or tool to develop applications
so angular is to one thing I love the
most
so let's wait more seconds
so
all the packages are installed
successfully
so now
let's now open our Visual Studio code
let's cut this
and inside this let's open our folder
you can check the path of the file where
you have installed this so in the my
system it's in the user
yeah
and angular wrap is here so I'm gonna
open it
so
this is what
it will open
most of the code we are going to do is
in this source file
so we're going to open this app
so let's delete this we're gonna not
need it and
or application
we don't need routing as well
and
now
let's open style.css
let's
delete this
and let's write some Global styling
here
let's write margin
if it is zero
that thing zero
OtterBox
and
font friendly
San Andreas
let's save this file
and let's open index.html
so here it's
angular app
now let's just run this and see how it's
looking for that let's type Ctrl and
back tech
to open the terminal
or you can also go here
let me just first
zoom out a little
then new terminal
inside this
new terminal
I'm gonna write
ND servers open
let me show you
so we're gonna type
yes
enter
let's wait a couple of seconds
so as it's saying
this can't compiled
so let me see the issue here
it's saying
most of the times the
app routing the file that I have deleted
so because this file is has been called
somewhere
because of this this error is coming
so I'm gonna go here
and see where this file is
called
so we're gonna remove this part
this
app routing module part
now let's save it
now
let's see where are the issues here
again
do the compiling
until it's being compiled
we're gonna see if
where are the
HTML file the CSS component is empty
in this HTML only
the issue is coming so it must be in the
last of this yeah
let's remove this save this file
and as you can see it's compiled
successfully
we're gonna go again to a Wrangler
application
as you can see it's showing this store
to
create a new component we're gonna write
this command NG generate component and
the file or the project name
angular material for that we're gonna
write this command
and like this there are so many other
commands also
if you want to learn angular you can
just click on that and it will open the
angular Iota tutorial part
so we don't need that let's delete this
and the application that we have created
let's delete it also
let's minimize this
and let's work on our code
let's minimize this as well
we don't need components
so let's delete this part
let's delete this
and here we'll write app
it's
I'll use a twin tag
and inside this I'm gonna write
from
freedom
let's save it and see on our browser
it's saying hello from simpler
isn't it amazing
let's write here
angular
to do
app
let's just save it
let's say angular 22
now
let's make it under head attack
let's write this one
between this so we'll make this
under header
it's working fine
now
I'll create a component for that
I'll create
a new terminal in here I'll write
a command Ng
globally
component
components in that I'll write
2 2
enter
so as you can see here
component inside this up
has been created under to do so here as
you can see
so many to do components and TS file has
been created a typescript file
so everything looks good here we don't
need this file so we're gonna remove it
so
let's minimize this
and inside the components folder
HTML
let's delete it
and create a class
to do
inside this class
I'm gonna create another class
let's name it as to do
let's make this as to lose
and this has two
after that
I'll create a class of
ID
so that we can
fetch the numbers
as for the junk data I'll write zero
not trend
will write F class
content whatever we're gonna post inside
that
so I'm going to write content
and inside this I'm gonna write
my to do
after that I don't need anything now we
can create a button
of class
delete
and then inside that I'm gonna write
oh
it's fine let's see in the browser
how it's looking
wait a couple of seconds
Illuminator code
so
first we're gonna call it inside this
okay
that's right amp
so it's not fitting it
let me see
tool okay
let's first see in the modules that
should provide that two two component is
automatically as you can see here
the 2do component is automatically has
been imported in this
see the issue
let's first see the component name
inside this file
okay the component is app.tudo
that's why it's not fetching
let's
lead head now save it
compiled successfully zero my to-do and
remove button
let's move forward now
so this is fine but we need to loot this
how many times
so because of that
we can't write it so many times for that
we're gonna do
create a array inside this to do
component
under this Constructor
now we can use angular
engine for that I'm gonna write title
here I'm gonna write
two two
not component
okay let's see
so let's save this file in will go back
to our
to do a company dot HTML and inside this
we're gonna call this class
so the name of the class here is title
that's why
I'm calling this here
let's see
you will see to do
if we'll change this to
to app now let's save this
it will show us to do app
okay so this is how we can inject our
variables inside the Dom
so now
let's
delete it
tools
it's right here
now let's save this
let's compile
which are inside this file only
title
so we have created an error
so let's create a file because we don't
want to access it from here so we
create a file let's name it as
to do
well let's
models first
let's just create a folder first
inside this models
will create a file
you to
dot clip script
inside this we'll export a class
to do
yeah well
if the content
but
string
and
when it'll get completed
we'll get
so
as you can see here
and then
and
so yes oh
sign
it's looking fine now let's save this
file
let's move forward
let's first import
YouTube
we'll import this module
TS file
so it's in this
tutu
from
tag
modules one two
this is the path of this
so let's
let's filter
save this
we have to write
doodle array
components are done
so we will
this is a keyword so
this array
exit this
okay I will write content
it's
it's true
complete
completed
okay it's
content
what we are going to show so it's
will come under
okay
first content
and here we'll write
true
so it's
fine
we'll create two so we copied from here
here
it looks
let's save this the error is coming
can't fetch it so I guess the
isn't behind it is
yeah
let's save this still
violation error is coming
it's deleted
let's show similar only
we're gonna have to work on our code
let's minimize this
now
here we'll call it function
attribute for the last trick
2
let
to do
those
and then let
I equals to
index
and next
so this looks
fine save it
so
it can't fetch it so you know
as the index here
it's not fetching
oh
okay we have declared here
as I as in X so we're gonna write I
let's save it quite successfully
one okay fine
before we go deeper into the code
I'm gonna copy the CSS file
from here
let's copy this
and we're gonna paste it
the component part
there are just simple CSS commands
we'll get this code in the description
box
let's save this
let's cut this
is not fetched
C
oh
steak
these CSS should come under
to
company.css let's save this
save and cut this also on this
now we'll open our app so our
application is going to look like this
is
buttons are not functional right now but
we'll make it functional
so let's
let's style it
remove will remain the same because it
is coming under the button part
now we're gonna call methods
and the methods are like just functions
okay
now
index
to add
of to do
complete
when it will get complete
then
our cash done
the wise
because
empty
so
it's done
it's completed
okay
let's see this
now
what we're gonna do is we're gonna make
method or function
so that whenever we click on this part
will just get cut or Mark as done
so the end
I'm gonna go to this to the component
and under this
I'm going to create a method
toggle
done
and I'm gonna pass the ID
and inside this
so this
I'm going to make it as here
to do this
dot map
don't worry I'm gonna tell you
how this is working and what I'm doing
it's not fetching V and I
just wait
well I'm gonna write
see
if
I is equals to equals to ID
10
P Dot
there
you get cut
equals to
not V
don't
completed
or if not
then return
V
so what I'm gonna do here is
okay this is
left
I'm gonna pass the number here
foreign
things look
normal
let's find the issue here what's the
issue
okay
we have declared V and I but we can't
fetch it because it's under this only
so to
access this V and I here also
check this let's
see
it's second and it's coming like this
let's go back to our code
and make it as
only
let's make this also
it's both are coming like this
okay
let's clear the click function
side
over
component
EML okay
here only
clear click whenever we click on any
item
it'll pass through Darkly
done
see
and here we're gonna pass
inside toggle hi
so we call this we'll pass through I
save this
here also in the delete path
we're gonna do it later let's save it
first
see
whenever we click on this
LDL leader
like this
fine
let's just
go back to our code
after this we're going to create a
delete method
let's name it as to
[Music]
Tal
this will implement
inside remove
like
so to delete we're gonna try it
again this to do
is
equals to
this
Dot to do
filter method
I will call B B I can
stem will not repeat
old mistake
run right
not equals to
to ID
when I is not equals to ID remove it
this is a function
so
we're going to call it like
we call inside our toggle done so we're
going to save this
going back to a cone
after this right click
and I will click
it will call
eat
to do
and inside this will pass index
save this
coming back to our
company
let's just
create
add to function
so let's First Take the clear the number
giving her number is
whenever will
put the number only that time it will
work
so we can't add a string here so that's
why we are declaring here
number
let's just delete this from now
save it and see
the remote function is also
working now
going back to our code
what we'll need is
remove or ADD
so now we'll work on
let's let's create
first thing we're gonna do is
set this
dot HTML
so we're not writing
2 2
here create a class
dove
class name
and inside this
let's create a form
set this form will create an input from
the user
so what
he or she wants to enter in this
or first thing we'll need is the text
next we need is the name
input
to that placeholder
inside that box that will
get created
all right
enter
your
after that
you get the class
off
of root
two two
I have declared here as to do
input
no your hand
let's
one thing I am forgetting is the
NG model
will get red because
we are not
so this is coming red because we haven't
created this input to do
the component
so we're gonna create it right now only
first yeah
first let's just save this
okay
and let's
okay
let's just delete this save this
it's coming red okay
it's
to do
is a string of
where I'm collating
what
will come under the string is
a Boolean only or not Boolean string
value only
let's open this
here
I'm gonna import
ah
in G
module
[Music]
from angular
or I guess
when the module is already
fetched so we're gonna need
only
import
s
module
angular
oh
this
hold it inside our
side over
app module
see yes
here we're gonna write
this module
which is after interior
even
um this
save as
so
I've called this one
so it's working now
this still is not working let's
delete this so everything is working
fine now there is no
nothing
and you can add
it's not adding
now everything is done
we're gonna
create
add to
insert this so we'll call this Dot
two-do's
dot push it
content which will come under this will
be content
whatever comes under this
and two two
and then completed
then false
let's close this
and after this
let's create
empty string here
called
to do let's run this
it's
app we are looking for
hello
from
another click on let's mark As done
we can also remove it
yeah and we can also add it
like
share
if this is Mark as done then click here
as done
so what's in it for you
we'll first get familiar with both the
programming languages by going through a
quick introduction then we will compare
reactant angular focusing on their
performance
after that we will discuss the learning
curve for learning both of these
Frameworks
we'll also get to know about the
adoption of these Frameworks and their
application in the field of web
development after that we'll compare the
community support available for each
framework
then we will dive into the industry
Trends and job prospects
and in the end I'm going to tell you
which technology to choose but I will
give you enough food for thought for you
to choose a technology that suits you
and your project best
so let me first give you an introduction
to react
now react is JavaScript library for UI
development it is managed by Facebook
and has an open source community of
Developers
the framework was introduced in May
2013. it is currently one of the most
popular front-end libraries for web
development
moving on to angular
angular is an open source JavaScript
framework for web development and mobile
development
it is typescript based and is managed by
Google's angular team and the angular
developer community
launched in September 2016 Angela also
known as angular 2.0 is a complete
rewrite of angularjs which was
introduced in 2010. it competes directly
with react front-end Library
moving on let's go ahead and compare the
performance
now react's performance is greatly
improved with the introduction of the
virtual Dom and is generally better than
that of angular
react uses the concept of virtual Dom
that puts less load on the browser react
was released with the USP of being
faster than other Frameworks available
furthermore since the data binding
process is unidirectional bindings are
not assigned Watchers as in the case of
angular
when it comes to angular it performs
worse especially in complex and dynamic
applications
the performance of angular apps is
negatively affected by bi-directional
data binding angular uses traditional
Dom that updates the whole web page even
if a single element is changed however
the most recent update of angular has
greatly improved its performance and it
does not lose to react anymore
so moving ahead let me give you a brief
insight into the learning curve
react is a library and not a framework
it is quite simple to understand if
you're familiar with JavaScript
however it takes time to learn how to
set up a project properly so you need to
learn the Redux Library which is used in
more than half of react applications for
State Management react depends on other
libraries to add functionality constant
framework updates also require
additional effort from the developer
next to understand
some complicated features are embedded
into the framework core which means that
the developer cannot avoid learning and
using them
angular itself is a huge Library so
initial learning effort is worth it
since you probably won't have to learn
other libraries like react
moving ahead let's look at the community
support
react framework is one of the most
popular JavaScript Frameworks worldwide
it has larger community support and you
may face a lack of documentation at
times the community support makes up for
the lack in documentation
when it comes to angular even though
angular was released before its adoption
is lesser when compared to react
comparatively it has a smaller Community
Support documentation is on point and
definitely better in the case of angular
also the community support has improved
over the few years
moving on let's look at adoption and
application
react was released in May 2013. react is
more popularly adopted by developers due
to its simplicity
it is an actively used by companies like
Facebook Twitter Netflix Airbnb and many
others
now here New York Times is one of the
many popular websites built using react
every new section acts as a separate
component so if any one of the component
updates the entire web page doesn't have
to reload making the web app feel much
faster and smoother
this is just to give you a brief example
when it comes to angular it was released
in October 2010 even though it is
improved now developers used to ignore
angular due to its complexity at the
time of its release angular is used by
Google Apple Nike McDonald's and other
companies
now Gmail is one of the many popular
websites built using angular only the
initial loading takes time but after
that everything is so smooth because it
is pre-loaded onto the web browser
similarity of reactant angular in the
last five years
we can clearly make out that react's
popularity is increasing over time while
angular's popularity is more of a
straight line
moving on to job Trends a react
developer's average salary in the United
States is around 91 000 US dollars per
annum in India the average salary of a
react developer is around 7.35 lakhs per
annum
when it comes to angular an average
salary of an angular developer in the US
is around 73 000 US dollars when it
comes to India the average salary is
around 4.88 lakhs per annum
so in conclusion angular is a
full-fledged mobile and web development
framework
react is a library only for UI
development which can be turned into a
full-fledged solution with the help of
additional libraries
react seems simpler at First Sight and
it takes lesser time to start working on
a react project however that Simplicity
as the main advantage of react is
neutralized because you have to learn to
work with additional Frameworks and
tools
angular itself is more complex and takes
quite some time to master yet it is a
powerful tool that offers a holistic web
development experience and once you
learn how to work with it you read the
fruits
now there is no better framework both
are updated continuously to keep up with
the competitor for instance while react
was believed to win because of its
virtual Dom angular equal Discord by
implementing change detection in the end
angular versus react is all a matter of
personal preference a matter of skills
and habits as a beginner in programming
you would probably benefit more from
starting with react as an experienced
developer you just keep working with
what you know better
now let's say you're using an Instagram
application
every time you refresh new content is
loaded onto your screen
you can like a picture add new ones
search your profiles and do much more
although it provides a seamless user
experience there's a lot that goes in
the back end as well
so every application typically consists
of the front end the back end and the
database
together they form the full stack
so what exactly is front-end development
then now front-end development is the
part of web development that develops
and creates the website's front-end
elements or features
now a front-end developer in a sense is
responsible for everything that you see
it could be text alignment navigation
colors Etc
now the main objectives of front-end
development is responsiveness and
performance
so now that you know what front-end
development is let's look at the skills
that will help you land a job
first up is the foundation
so first things first to become a
front-end developer you need to start
with HTML
move on to CSS and JavaScript
now these are the actual fundamental
languages for front-end development HTML
is used to structure our web pages CSS
is used to make them beautiful and
JavaScript is used to make the program
run and add interactivity
however knowing just these will not help
you you will have to learn the second
important skill that is Frameworks
now there are several front-end
Frameworks that make development way
easy now to name a few or the most
important ones we have react there's
angular
View
jQuery and Amber
now I'm sure you must have heard of
these Frameworks react is a UI
development Library written in
JavaScript
all the react is just the library and
not a framework its usage is rampant
nowadays react goes beyond simple UI and
has many extensions like flux and react
native for complete application
architecture support
talking about angular again this is an
open script JavaScript framework based
on typescript so as a framework anchor
offers advantages and it also provides a
standard structure for developers in a
team to work with
you know it allows users to create huge
applications that are easy to manage
talking about view it is also an open
source JavaScript framework and is again
used to build user interfaces for single
page applications
now I'm sure you must have heard of
jQuery which is again a trendy
JavaScript framework and application
development platform it is leaner it is
fast loading and comes with features
that make life of a JavaScript
application developer more accessible
it is used more and more to be the
foundation and the primary driving force
of web development today
and lastly we have Ember which is again
an open source JavaScript client-side
framework it comes with built-in
environment with fast rebuilds Auto
reload and the test Runner
so these are some of the Frameworks that
you're expected to be proficient at now
the third skill that is crucial is
Version Control System
now we use Version Control Systems to
track our code history and work more
collaboratively with others that's why
you will find that in every job
description now there are multiple
Version Control Systems available in the
market today there's git there's sub
version
Etc so just focus and git which is the
most popular one and don't worry about
other Version Control Systems knowing
these Version Control Systems will
definitely add more credibility to your
resume the fourth skill that is crucial
is the CSS preprocessor
now to give you an insight into why we
need preprocessors CSS is an old
language and it has its own limitations
if you write CSS for medium or large
size applications your code starts
looking messy so every time you want to
change something you end up breaking
something else
instead we can make use of a CSS
preprocessor now a preprocessor is a
program or a tool that lets you generate
CSS from a different language that is
better and more compatible than CSS
so instead of using plain CSS you can
use another language that looks pretty
similar with CSS we give our code to a
CSS preprocessor that converts it into
plain CSS which every browser
understands that's the purpose of CSS
preprocessors there are many of these
available today there's SAS less and
stylus to name a few and lastly the most
important skill required is testing and
debugging now a very important aspect of
web development is to make sure that the
end result is error free
of bugs and seamless experience for the
user
therefore the ability to test and debug
a website is another essential skill
that a front-end developer needs to have
there are various methodologies that can
enable front-end developer to make sure
that the websites or the product not
only looks good but also functions
smoothly so although these are the top
five skills that a front-end developer
must possess they must also have good
communication and interpersonal skills a
good understanding of apis and how the
app needs to behave is crucial to make a
good developer
so you must be wondering how can simply
learn help you with this
well you could get started by acquiring
a simply learned certificate all you
need to do is head to our simply learned
page and type in full stack developer
you'll get a brief overview of the
course and what it offers if it suits
your requirements you can go ahead and
enroll for it having this course
certification will definitely boost your
resume industry Trends so what exactly
is node.js now consider a scenario where
a user interacts with a web application
the user only interacts with the front
end of the application but there's a lot
of work that goes behind the scenes now
in a web application there's a front end
a server and a database the front end is
developed using JavaScript and
Frameworks like angular and react while
the server is built on Java PHP or
node.js and the backend database that
stores the data usually consists of
MySQL or mongodb so node.js is an open
source cross-platform JavaScript runtime
environment for running server-side
applications it is used to develop i o
intensive web applications like video
streaming sites single page applications
online chatting applications and other
web applications it is used by large
established companies and newly minted
startups node.js was developed by Ryan
Dal in 2009 and at the same time of this
session its latest version is v13.3.0
now that we know what node.js is let's
go ahead and look at why it was so
prevalent in the field of web
development here are a few points first
up node.js is extremely fast being built
on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
its library is extremely fast in code
execution node package manager has
around 50 000 bundles for developers so
whatever functionality is required for
an application can be easily imported
from npm all apis of node.js Library are
asynchronous that is non-blocking it
means a node.js based server never waits
for an API to return data node.js
dramatically reduces the processing time
while uploading video and audio files it
is also an open source platform and is
easy for beginners for web development
the above reasons more than justify the
popularity of node.js platform and why
it is being adopted by a large number of
organization and businesses today so now
moving on let's familiarize ourselves
with the parts of node.js node.js
consists of several components now let's
look at them one by one first up we have
modules now modules are like JavaScript
libraries which are used in a node.js
application to include a set of
functions now we can use required
function with the parenthesis to include
a module in a node.js application
node.js application has many modules to
provide basic functionality needed for a
web application some of them could be
HTTP util FS URL query string stream and
zlip next up we have console the console
module provides a simple debugging
console that is similar to the
JavaScript console mechanism provided by
web browsers now the console can print
messages to STD out that print standard
output messages and SCD air to print the
error messages the next component is
cluster now node.js is built upon the
concept of single threading programming
a single instance of node.js runs in a
single thread to take advantage of
multi-core systems the user will
sometimes want to launch a cluster of
node.js processes to handle the load a
cluster can be added to an application
in this way here is a small code for you
the next component is global now global
objects in node.js are available in all
modules now these objects are functions
modules strings Etc some node.js Global
objects are mentioned in the table you
have dir name that is a directory name
file name exports module and require the
next component is error handling now
node.js applications experience four
types of Errors we have the standard
JavaScript errors system errors user
specific errors and assertion errors now
errors in node.js are handled through
exceptions now for example let's handle
that error that would occur when we
divide a number by zero now this error
would crash the node.js application and
so we should handle this error here's a
small code for you next up we have
streaming a stream is an abstract
interface for working with streaming
data in node.js streams are objects that
let you read data or write data
continuously there are four types of
streams first one is a readable these
are the types of streams from which data
can be read writeable these are the
types of streams to which data can be
written duplex these are both readable
and writable streams lastly we have
transformed these streams can manipulate
the data while it is being read or
written moving on to the next component
buffer the JavaScript language has no
mechanism for reading or manipulating
streams of binary data buffer is a
module that allows handling streams that
contain only binary data an empty buffer
of length 10 can be created by this
method next up we have domain domains
provide a way to handle different i o
operations as a single group domain
module intercepts errors that remain
unhandled there are two types of methods
that are used for intercepting these
errors firstly we have internal binding
in this case the error emitter executes
its code inside the arrow method next up
is the external binding now here the
error emitter is explicitly added to a
domain via its add method the next
component is the DNS the DNS module
enables name resolution for example it
is used to look up the IP addresses of
host names DNS module is used to connect
to a DNS server and perform neem
resolution by using the method
dns.resolve the DNS module is also used
for performing name resolution without a
network communication by using the
method dns.lookup the next component is
the debugger node.js includes an out of
process debugging utility accessible via
a V8 inspector and built-in debugging
client this node.js debugger is not
feature packed but supports simple
inspection of code it can be used in the
terminal by using the inspect keyword
before the name of the Javascript file
in order to inspect a file say
myscript.js you can use the following
method now that we are familiar with all
the major parts of node.js let's go
ahead and learn about the node.js
Express framework Express is a flexible
node.js web application framework that
provides a wide set of features to
develop both web and mobile applications
you can assume Express as a layer built
on top of the node.js that helps manage
the server and the routes now let's have
a quick look at some of the core
features of Express framework it is used
to design single page multi-page and
hybrid web applications it allows
setting up of middleware to respond to
http requests it defines a routing table
that is used to perform different
actions based on the HTTP method and URL
it also allows Dynamic rendering of HTML
Pages based on passing arguments to
templates now moving on let's take a
quick example of a simple hello world
program now this is developed using
Express framework to gain a better
understanding alright first up we have
the WHERE Express now this is used to
import Express framework into our
node.js application now the app.get
method is a callback function with
parameters request and response the
request object represents the HTTP
request and has properties for the
request query string parameters body
HTTP headers Etc the response object
represents the HTTP response that an
Express app sends when it gets an HTTP
request now the application will listen
to the defined Port which in this case
is 8081 and variables host and Port will
contain the address and the port
respectively lastly we have the
console.log which is used to show the
address and port in the command prompt
so this is what the command prompt would
look like and finally the output is
displayed on the web browser Having
learned about the Express framework now
let's move on and look at the node.js
use cases now it is no doubt that node
stands out for its speed and intensive
data exchange so top industry leaders
like NASA PayPal Netflix among others
incorporate node.js first up we have
Netflix the world's leading internet
television network with over 117 million
users is one of the top companies that
trusted their server services to node.js
the reasons why the company chose to use
node.js were application scalability and
data intensive application now you must
be wondering what application
scalability is with basically the
potential of an application to grow in
time being able to efficiently handle
more and more requests per minute and
data intensive application allows
millions of people to stream Netflix
simultaneously next up is Walmart now
Walmart is the world's largest company
by Revenue with around 514 billion US
Dollars according to the fortune Global
500 list in 2019. again the reasons why
the company chose node.js were
asynchronous IO and efficient handling
of concurrent requests now asynchronous
IO which is a form of input output
processing allows other processing to
continue before the transmission has
finished node.js is able to efficiently
handle concurrent requests with the use
of thread pool and event cues Uber Uber
is an American multinational ride
hailing company offering services that
include peer-to-peer ride sharing right
service healing and food delivery the
reasons why the company chose node.js
were asynchronous i o quick iterations
and active open source Community as
mentioned earlier asynchronous IO
permits other processing to continue
before the transmission has finished now
quick iterations now node.js is
continually being updated and added new
features that help in further
Improvement in the performance of web
servers and finally active open source
Community resolves many problems that an
organization May face in a particular
scenario next up we have NASA now NASA
as an independent agency of the United
States federal government responsible
for the civilian space program as well
as Aeronautics and Aerospace research
the reasons why the company chose
node.js were reduced access times
handling of data intensive tasks and the
fact that the servers are active 24 7.
now NASA has lots and lots of data and
using node.js has really helped them in
reducing the access times it is also
continuously handling and working with
large streams of data node.js is highly
stable which helps in keeping the server
active 24 7. next up we have PayPal now
PayPal is an American company operating
a worldwide online payment system that
supports online money transfers as
opposed to traditional methods like
checks and money orders the reasons why
the company chose to use node.js were
the fact that node.js has extremely fast
build times it allows tasks to be
carried out with fewer lines of code
when compared to other server
Technologies like Java and PHP and
node.js being data intensive efficiently
handles a large amount of data next up
is medium medium is a popular online
publishing platform developed by Evan
Williams and launched in August 2012.
the main reasons why the company chose
to use node.js were a data driven
applications now these applications are
ideal for being interfaced with node.js
servers B to run a b tests now A B
testing is essentially an experiment
where two or more variants of a page are
shown to users at random and statistical
analysis is used to determine which
variation performs better lastly node.js
server maintenance is simpler than its
counterparts moving on to the last topic
of this session industry Trends now
node.js developers are in demand across
the globe since many companies are
adopting JavaScript libraries according
to Forbes it is one of the top 10 most
in-demand jobs according to node Source
the total number of node.js downloads
increase by 40 in the last one year the
use of node.js in production has
increased dramatically since its release
in 2010. with early adopters such as
LinkedIn PayPal and Netflix among others
node.js has seen an exponential increase
in its use in web development the
popularity of node.js is also accounted
to JavaScript now since JavaScript is
the most popular language as evidence
from a survey conducted by stack
Overflow in 2019 many developers can
start working on node.js library with
not much of a learning curve node.js
developers are being offered better
salary options than another web
technology developers according to pay
scale the average salary of a node.js
developer in India is around 6 lakhs 13
000 rupees per year the average salary
of a node.js developer across the United
States is around 105 000 US dollars per
year in this video we'll help you
install node.js on your Windows system
so without further Ado let's begin the
first thing you need to do is download
node.js from their official website so
go ahead and type download node.js
navigate to their official website and
here
you can see the 64-bit version so go
ahead and download that once the
download is done go ahead and run the
downloaded node.js installer
accept the license agreement keep the
default settings as it is
and then say install
so with that we finish the installation
process
once node has been successfully
installed the next crucial step is
verification now this process ensures
that node has been properly installed to
do so we first open the command prompt
and then type in a few commands to
verify the successful installation we
type in this command
node hyphen V now this command Returns
the version and if it Returns the
version it means it has been
successfully installed
so here we go it Returns the latest
version
now the final step is to update the node
package manager now this npm is bundled
with node.js which consists of all the
repositories and packages required for
development purposes so to do that type
in the command npm
install npm
hyphen hyphen Global now that we're done
with the installation of node let's go
ahead and Implement a small program for
that we make use of a text editor in our
case we've installed vs code so go ahead
and download vs code once you're done
with the installation this is what vs
code looks like so go ahead and click on
file and create a new file it's going to
be a simple program where you're going
to print a hello world message on the
web browser to do that we make use of
HTTP modules so node comes with built-in
HTTP modules to transfer data across it
so for that we make use of a require
method we create a variable first say
where
HTTP equals required and just say HTTP
within single quotes
now the HTTP module can create an HTTP
server that listens to the server ports
and gives a response back to the client
to do that we make use of the create
server method so let's go ahead and type
the code
say http
dot create
server an internally it consists of a
function
now the parameters to this function are
request and response now the response is
basically used to write to the client so
we say response dot write and here we
type in the message say hello world
welcome
to this tutorial
once you're done with that you end the
response
so the server listens to a port number
to display the message by default it
listens to the port number 8080 so we
keep that as it is and we end it save
your file
say demo.js maybe demo1.js and they save
now to run the program you have to open
the command prompt so open your command
prompt
and mention the path to your file so in
our case it's our desktop saved on the
desktop so CD
desktop and now to run it say node demo
one dot JS now we navigate to your
browser
and say localhost 8080 and here we go
our message is successfully displayed so
let's talk about the node.js
architecture and understand why it's so
good
so to begin with uh node.js has what's
called a single threaded event Loop
architecture and this allows you to be
able to handle many many concurrent
clients at the same time it's just a
very flexible way of being able to scale
up your support for many clients
and then in addition to that we have the
JavaScript event based model along with
the JavaScript callback mechanism that
allows you to have this standard
approach to being able to connect with
and talk and discuss interactions
between the client and the server
it's good to have these kind of
Standards where you're not using
something that's unique to a specific
framework or a specific technology and
this just makes it so it's a more
accessible for everybody
so if we look at the actual node.js
server itself everything centers around
the the concept of the event Loop and
the event Loop has a a an event queue an
operation completed um fire request
threaded pull and then it'll actually do
the actual computation or the file
system interaction
all of this interconnects in a nice
seamless Loop the great thing again with
node.js is that it's not new technology
it's been around for almost a decade
it's very very well tried out many of
the largest websites out there are
running node.js
so let's now dig into each of the parts
of the node.js architecture so let's
talk about requests
so the way that the request works is
that you have your framework such as
angular on the client and that will then
send a request to the web server there's
many ways that those requests can happen
through web workers through forms and
through other interactions but at some
point a request is sent to the server
and so these requests can be for data it
can be for deleting data they can be for
updating data they can be for
interacting with Services as mentioned
before but the goal is to have some kind
of request now once that request
actually hits the server and then we
start actually getting into the queuing
and threading process that centers
around the event Loop and this is where
node.js really excels because it's able
to use that single threaded model to be
able to manage from just even a few
requests to tens of millions of requests
so it receives the actual request and
starts the event queue and this is where
a single threading process starts is by
queuing everything up appropriately
and then it then maintains the thread
within a pool so you have the queuing
process as one action and then you have
a threaded pull which manages those
threads as well
and then we have an event Loop which you
know goes through as you receives and
processes those requests
and they're funny what we're doing is
we're actually then going to be
interacting with a system and that could
be a database it could be a cloud system
it could be an API file system but we're
interacting with something that's
outside of the node.js server so the
node.js server itself is doing some
actions on the server but then it's also
interact with things outside of its own
server environment
and so this talk a little bit about that
workflow so requests come in they go
into the event queue and they get
spiraled through the event Loop and then
we have a non-blocking operators which
are going to be doing the input output
polling such as KQ e-poll and other
services and from there we're also going
to be then interacting with a threaded
pool and we're using the blocking
operations to manage that threaded pull
and that threaded pool is going to now
then go outside of the server and
interact with something beyond the
server so whether that is a database or
file system or API or microservice these
are things that can be interacted with
so let's go through what npm is so npm
itself stands for the node package
manager no great shakes there as the
name says it's responsible for all the
packages and modules that are bundled
Within node.js
so the notepad manager itself really has
two key functionalities now the first is
that reply it is a central repository
for all packages and modules which you
can then search through um online you
can go to
search.nodejs.org and you can find all
of the packages of modules that are out
there the second is that it's also a
command line or terminal uh line utility
that allows you to install those
packages so you can actually go through
and you can see the version management
and dependencies within those packages
and you can actually can control the
packages themselves
so why would you use npm
so npm is really useful for being able
to extend the project you're working on
so when you're building out a project
one of the concepts I like to use is the
concept of Lego bricks
um big fan of Lego and uh what's great
about Lego bricks is that they're all
individually by themselves very small
very specific functionality but if you
actually get a whole collection of Lego
bricks together you can build like crazy
cool things so think of when you're
working with the node package manager
itself is that each of those individual
pieces that you're working with each of
those individual packages are their own
Lego bricks and by themselves you can
then edit and update and maintain that
piece separately from the whole
environment as long as your inputs and
outputs you know really the piece where
you snap the logo in or when you connect
the Lego to something else are
interacted and open and well documented
then you can actually then use those
modules effectively throughout your
project
um so you can actually then be able to
do that you can do Version Control on
your codes and dependencies you can do
testing very easily
and then once you actually get to the
point where you go yes I want to release
um a new module you can do that
effectively using npm and it will
actually go through and do the actual
deployment for you
so let's go through the npm installation
so the actual package manager itself is
included with the installation of
node.js so if you've installed and
you're running node.js locally then
you've already installed the package
manager but you can also access it
through command line or terminal window
on your data server or in your server or
via the cloud
if you haven't now downloaded node.js
here's the website where you can go down
to install it and there's Windows and
Mac versions of that code as well with
the installers which allow you to get up
and going very quickly
you want to be able to run the installer
and accept all the default settings just
you know to begin with you want to kind
of have the standard set up so that you
are most familiar with the normal
settings before you start getting to the
point where you're a master and you're
tweaking things
there is a way that you can open up the
command window or The Terminal window
and once you've actually installed
node.js to verify that it's actually
installed you can write the command node
dash dash version and they'll actually
then pull out the version of node.js
that you have installed and then you'll
be able to see that you've got it
actually up and running
and then you can also do the same thing
for npm where you can do npm dash dash
version and actually will then show you
which version of the node package
manager you have running so you can
actually take it full advantage of that
program and verify that it's actually up
and running now so we're actually going
to go ahead and actually run a demo of
using npm and to do that I've got three
windows in front of me right now so I
have this window here which is my
terminal window where I'll be doing all
of my instructions and then I also have
a folder which shows where I'll be
putting all of the files and then
finally I'll actually have a text editor
in this case I'm using vs code because
it's free but you can use any text edit
you like to be able to go in and show
what the code that's been created by npm
in the Json file so you can actually see
what it looks like and then we'll modify
it a little bit so first thing we want
to do is we want to go ahead and create
a new project file so I'm going to go in
I'm just going to move into let's do
change directory and go to the project
folder and we'll see down here that we
have an empty project folder but for
this one I'm actually going to go ahead
and I'm going to create a new directory
in this one and I'm going to call this
one simply learn
and there we are we've created a new
simply lamp folder
and we are going to move into the
symphony land folder
and so we're now in the simply land
folder uh there's nothing in there right
now um so the first thing we want to do
is we want to take go ahead and
initialize this folder as a project
folder for working with npm now to do
this you will have to have already
installed npm if you have node.js npm
comes with it and if you want to see
whether or not you have npm installed so
you can just do npm
version
and that will actually tell you what the
version of npm you have installed is it
also verifies that npm is installed so
I've gone ahead and I've been able to
validate that I have npm installed so
what I'm now going to go ahead and do is
I'm going to initialize this folder so
to do that just do npm in it and you'll
see that the path is that we're already
in the simply learn folder and then when
you do that
it's going to ask you some questions so
what is the package name we're going to
go with the defaults for right now and
then I can show you how we can edit
those in a little bit uh we're going to
go with just say yes to all of these
just by hitting return
and you'll see here that we're going to
create a new folder called a
package.json folder this is the
instructions that we have in the folder
do you want to go ahead and create this
we want to and it's going to go ahead
and do that and we can see now in our
folder here that we actually have
package.json so if we go ahead and open
this up with
vs code here we are we can actually see
what all the information is we can go
ahead and we can actually go and update
this metadata if we want to I'm going to
leave it as is for right now because I
want to show you a couple of other
things so a lot of times when you're
actually working with npm and the reason
why you're using npm is that you want to
take advantage of packages that are
freely available in the open source
community that are supported by node.js
and one of those is a package called
Express and express is a lightweight
framework for building out web
applications similar concept to angular
or react.js I like using it and it's
also a great way to be able to show how
we can install this using npm so to
install this you just start with the
command npm and then you type install
and then we type the name of the package
and we hit
enter and it goes ahead and what you'll
actually see
is a couple of things one is we have a
dependency in our package above we also
have so this is in our Json package that
it's now a dependency it's written in
there we can also go in and under our
node modules we actually see that we
have if we scroll down we should see
Express
there it is Express
now if we decide that we don't want to
use um Express we can actually just come
in and we can write command npm
uninstall
type
Express
oops did a typo there so let's try that
again npm
uninstall
Express
and couple things can happen one is in
our Json file the dependency for the
express file has now been removed
and we can also see that underarm node
modules there are no extensions there
so this is kind of cool this allows us
to be able to see
um that we can easily add and remove
packages so let's just go ahead and I'm
going to install Express again so
installed Express
npm install Express
all right so it's gone ahead and it's
installed Express
now one of the things that often happen
is that when you're working with a
package the actual Json package so
you'll receive this file and you want to
be able to go ahead and install of the
sub modules that come with it so and you
can go through you can manually install
them like this or you can actually run
and install command so you can actually
install all of them at once I can just
show you what that looks like
because we're going to actually go ahead
and simulate as if we're going to
install bootstrap
which is another
popular framework
straight
and we're actually going to go with
and then we'll save that
and what we'll see is under the packages
that bootstrap isn't listed in there we
do have Express there it is right there
so we now come over to our new command
so we can actually write the command
npm install
and now
site typo let's try that again
let's do npm
install
okay it does help to save your file so
let's go ahead and
let's run npm install
and when you do that what we'll now
actually have is not just
Express but we'll also see that
bootstrap has also been added
now I don't recommend that you use the
star symbol which will install the
latest version of bootstrap because you
obviously haven't tested your
application against that but it gives
you an idea of and of what's happened
here now if we want to we can actually
go in here and we can see on in
install
bootstrap
and it will actually remove that from
your Json package so there we are that's
how you work with using npm from getting
started with a setup for a base
initialization of your package going
through to creating the first package
being able to set up and control the
naming convention for each of the items
within the metadata that provides the
instructions for the package how you can
then put in dependencies such as Express
and bootstrap how you can install them
and remove them and actually use do all
of this through command line if you have
any questions please let us know
so this kind of jump into the express.js
framework
so express.js is a really flexible
node.js and web application framework it
is just something you can spin up very
quickly and build both web and mobile
applications just a really great tool um
you know I use it all the time for
building up my own applications
the thing that's so great about it is
it's really simple and so and it's not
going to be as have all the the
functionality that you'd have in maybe a
larger scale HTTP service but with that
said it does come with a lot of
functionality that allows you to not
only create websites but you can also do
apis and other routing calls very very
nice
so let's go through some of the features
that expressjs have
so as I mentioned before it allows you
to build simple web applications and
they can be either a single page
application or a multi-page application
it also allows you to do middleware
requests and responses so for instance
if you want to do an API and have that
be part of your middleware you can
actually set that up real quickly in
fact in the demo that we'll do later on
we'll actually be building out four
different API calls that you'll be able
to do and you'll be able to see how you
can use express.js for that and that in
then turns allows you to be able to see
how express.js can help manage some of
the routing of the different HTTP
methods and that you'd be using via URL
and then finally it's just a great way
of being able to dynamically test the
work that you are developing so you can
actually build out a solution and test
it right away and express.js have it in
a single packet and then once you get to
a certain point you can then check in
the whole packet and even have it as
part of your container and then check
that into your main project
and then if somebody else wants to then
take on the work they can then just pull
that in so let's kind of go step through
a you know a basic example so here we
actually have a full script for creating
a simple hello world and this includes
installing express.js uh defining the
ports it's going to run on as well as a
basic piece of code so the first thing
you want to do is actually go ahead and
Define how you want to install
express.js and this is called the very
first variable which is requiring that
Express be installed as part of node
packet manager npm will then pull in the
latest version of Express if you need to
define a specific version of course you
can do that in this example we're just
going to pull the latest one and then
we'll go ahead and with the second line
which will then install Express and when
you do it once you'll see how quickly it
stores onto your local development
machine
the next parameters are actually a
callback function so if something
actually happens when you go to the
website where we're going to run our web
application you want something to pop up
and in this instance we'll say hello
world will pop up
the third block is all about where you
would actually go ahead and host your
code and so in this one you'll see that
the server is going to listen and listen
to Port 8081 so that's what that
function actually there defines
and then you can either put in uh the
specific host address in the demo you'll
actually see how we Define that for
localhost but you can actually then
point this to a production host
environment if you want
and then the final line here is a
command that actually sent a script to
your terminal window telling you that
which port and which host that you are
listening to so let's see what that
would look like so here we can see have
our terminal window and we're actually
able to then run the hello world JS
script that we just wrote and then once
we do that it'll actually then post that
we have an example app listening ads and
here we don't have a web domain address
and we do have the the port 8081
and in our browse window it says hello
world
so that's a quick breakdown of
express.js now let's jump over and do a
demo
so the first thing we want to do to get
Express up and running on our system is
we have to have node.js installed so
we're just going to do a Google search
to let you know where you can find
node.js it's actually at nodejs.org so
we select that link that will take us to
nodejs.org and there are two types of
downloads one is the current download
which has the latest features and then
there's a more stable version that if
you are new to node.js I'd recommend you
to download next we want to find a text
editor and we're going to go with Visual
Studio code or vs code is known it's an
open source solution from Microsoft that
runs across all the leading platforms so
this will default to our Windows
platform but you can run it on Mac OS
and Linux as well I really like it it's
a great code it comes a lot of
extensions and it's open source
and next thing you want to do is because
it's going to be developing apis we want
a way to be able to visualize those apis
quickly and a great tool is a product
called Postman again open source and so
you can go out and go to postman.com top
right hand corner you'll see a bright
orange download button where you can
actually go and head and download and
install Postman and that will allow you
to be able to access all of your apis
that we're going to be creating in
Express
you can actually use other tools such as
apigee as well for visualizing your apis
but this one's just great to get you
started so let's go ahead and open up vs
code and we want to go ahead and open a
new folder where we're going to have our
project we're going to just for our
demonstration here we're going to put
this on the desktop you wouldn't
normally do this but it will work fine
here I'm going to create a folder I'm
going to title the file the node Express
and we'll select that folder that now
becomes the root folder for our project
in Visual Studio we don't really need
the the welcome screen anymore so we're
going to get rid of that
and one of the things that is great
about working with vs code is you can
actually have the terminal window up and
running as well so let's go ahead and
open that so it's running at the bottom
of our screen and this gives us a little
bit of space
and the first thing we want to do is
actually turn convert the folder we're
in actually into a project running
node.js so we're going to use npm in it
and they'll actually initialize the
project we have another video that
explains how to use npm or node package
manager and you can go ahead and find
that um in our library here but as we go
ahead and we do that you'll actually see
that it will create the default package
Json file which has the name of the
folder is the default name of the
package but you can actually go in and
edit any of these documents
we want to create a default file as
called index.js This is where we're
going to write most of our scripts that
allow us to work with node.js
and the first is writing a script that
allows us to install Express and we'll
use the node packet manager to actually
pull and install Express and you can
fault to specific versions of Express if
you want and we're just going to go with
the latest one so we're just going to
put in Express and then we'll go down
into terminal window and say npm install
dash dash save Express and this will
install Express so we can actually test
out the code we're working on
and this will be just a moment to
install
great thing we're working with node
package manager is that once we've
finished with our package here we can
actually wrap it all up and send it over
to any other developer that we're
working with and then you can actually
run the the package and actually have
exactly the same code in store
and there we are we have everything
installed and ready to go we can see we
actually have all of the modules
installed you'll see that we actually
have Express installed as well
and we also want to then make this an
app
and then we'll do app listen
to Ports 3000 so this is by default
we're going to be running from our Local
Host which is uh HTV server running on
this test machine and we're going to
have Express for this project run on
Port 3000.
and in the once we actually run the
script we'll actually post into the
console window a piece of text saying
server started on Port 3000.
so we're going to go ahead and save this
file a little control s to save these
files
so let's go into localhost in our web
browser so localhost colon sorry uh yeah
localhost column 3000 and you'll see
nothing has been reached that's because
we actually haven't done anything to
initialize the script so we want to come
in and we're going to go node index.js
and hit return and as you can see now we
have a message in our console window
that means that yep there we go we
actually have everything up and running
so we can actually see that the service
is running not a very pleasant message
so let's go ahead and change that
so let's change that to
app get
and
acquire res
and so we've used the get message that's
change what we'll print
and we'll type hello there
exclamation mark
I'm going to save that
and we refresh the screen
oh nothing happened again because we
didn't run the script let's go back in
and we'll run the script node index.js
and now what you'll see is if we refresh
there we are we have our new hello there
message
all right well let's actually start
building some apis in this environment
so to be able to build the apis we want
to be able to pull content so we can
actually create a new file called
users.js and we're going to create
I'm going to go ahead and create a a
user's Json packet and a Json packet is
essentially
a an array and as you consider it like a
small database and in this array we're
going to have four objects each object
is going to have three pieces of
metadata we have an ID name and email
and there'll be ID 1 2 and 3 and then
you'll see that the names will be John
Smith and we'll make up a couple of
others I'm just kind of giving them
arbitrary email addresses
it's just for our demo here
let me grab this copy it and kind of
speed up
the script writing time
there we go
and let's just change what we need one
of the things that's nice with working
with the visual studio code vs code is
there's lots of plugins and so one of
the default features is that if you
select a variable it'll actually look
for the same variable in the script so
you can if you need to you can actually
change them all in once
but we don't need to worry about that
right now we're just creating a Json
packet so we have four items
ID one two three and four for John Smith
and Jack and Chris
all right so that's our
erased string and we're going to then
make sure that we can export that as
users so we can actually now whenever we
select the term users in our scripts
you'll actually pull in this packet
all right looking good
now let's go over to our main index.js
file and we're just going to go ahead
and we want to like Store where the the
API is going to be so we're going to
create a foldable route and then a
subfolder called API
and then we'll call a file in there
called users.js so as we're updating our
scripts we know where to
pull the data from
it's just a standard way of being able
to pull out the values so in here we're
going to say
um in this instance Express is required
for our Scripts
and we're going to also say that from
router
with an Express router
correct naming convention
and the script is case sensitive we'll
also want to create a value later on
that will have a unique ID so we're
actually going to pull in a uuid
package that will actually then allow us
to install unique identifiers so we use
node package manager to install uuid
again this is a great example of how you
can go from nothing to something very
quickly with Express
node.js because we've installed Express
we installed uuid and We're Off to the
Races
so let's have users require the path for
where our API is going to be located
all right so let's do a basic get which
will be to pull the record so we're
going to have it pull all the records so
router.get and we're going to require it
to pull all of the records in the Json
Packer that we created
so there should be four items to come
back
save that
looks good
make sure that users is consistent
there's our Json packet
and yep everything's looking pretty good
all right let's go back to index
and we're going to switch out this
function here from just a generic get
with a generic statement to actually
being able to pull in the users so
we have to go app
use express.json
lab dot use
URL encoded
extended
false
NP dot use
API uses so
you're going to be pulling them off in
the same location
require
and where we have our API
scripes
okay
and then let's go ahead and open up
Postman because we can actually use
Postman to actually show us what the
results look like because right now the
results won't show up appropriately and
in our browser window
suppressment again is just a API
management tool if you used apogee or
other similar tools that are on the
market mulesoft
you'll see it's very consistent again
this is open source and what you want to
be able to do is you can actually go and
actually go to the path where the API is
stored and then you can use all the
different types of commands within your
environment to be able to you know test
out the scripts so let's go ahead and
create a new project new request and
we're going to go with the default get
but there's actually quite a lot of
different commands we can use
and these are just HTTP commands
and we're going to type in the request
and in this instance
it's going to be
let's run our script first
internal script
let's make sure we're exporting the data
correctly
okay so we want to run our script so
let's do node index.js and that will run
the changes that we just created so we
can now come over to get we select API
um localhost colon 3000
API uses when we do that brings back the
Json package with that for entry points
there there's all four of them
so that's your
first action
now let's kind of get this a little bit
tinier let's actually go in and see if
we can filter by ID
so we're going to go in and we're gonna
modify our script so it's gonna be round
and then we're going to put in the
filter and in this instance it's going
to be ID
which would allow us to be able to just
put a backslash against the end of the
URL string we just had and put in a
number or a unique identifier and then
that will actually then allow us to pull
in that unique record
thank you
again as the data
okay so I found
I'm going to
take the Json and
print it
so we're going to filter here against
user ID
and then publish the results
else if it doesn't work I might just
have a generic error message
we shouldn't see this though in the
demos we're creating this is just good
practice
save that
and let's go ahead and rerun our node
index file against that folder
and now we can actually come in here and
we do backslash one and that will give
us just one record and we could change
that to 2 or 100 in this instance and if
it's 100
we'll just get a bad request error
message
there's two
all right
so that's get so we'll be able to pull
all of the records we know to filter
against one specific record against a
specific parameter in this instance it
was ID so let's go ahead and create a
new user so that what we do for this is
we're going to use the post command from
HTTP to actually push and post data into
the data source the data sources.json
packet which means that we'll have to
then push a new record into the Json
package using our array statements
because Jason's just essentially in an
array
and so we're going to post and when we
do this we have to create a unique ID so
this is where we have to reference the
uid
I'm going to do a V4 unique ID
which will be
four groups of four so these 16
characters
and then
we'll have
name
and email will post
okay looks good
Okay so
if
new user
and then put dot name
and
new user dot email
and then we want to return
the results
okay
and so the users Dot
push so we posted which is HTTP
statement and then pushing into the
the Json packet array
okay
okay that's looking good
all right so I think we're good
let's go ahead and rerun our script
node index.js
now allows us to do that so let's go
over to postman so we can actually
connect to the URL I'm going to change
the HTTP statement to post
and get rid of that we'll go back to
users now if we just do this nothing's
gonna happen so we actually have to go
in and we have to update the body this
would be the content that would be
passed through and we're going to go
through with a raw statement here
and we're going to do Json is B
that's the packet we're sending so let's
go ahead and the records we wanted to
update we only have to update two which
is one is name and the second is email
we don't have to do an ID because we're
using uuid to generate an automatic one
for us
and we're going to create records for
Steph and her email address is Steph
gmail.com
yep looking good
okay so let's go ahead and send that we
sent it
and if we look at the bottom we can
actually now see that we have five
records so a new one's been added we
have our unique ID at the top and then
we have name and email which are the
ones that we just created for staff and
staff at gmail.com
all right so that's posting now the next
thing you want to do is to update a
record so that means we need to select
an ID and then be able to update the
content and for that we're going to use
the HTTP put command
so we'll use ID as our way to be able to
filter
and then we'll be able to update against
that filter
so construct found
equals users
and then
we'll have it going against
user's ID so we know how to get the
correct record and then pass the record
Bank
onto the screen so we know what we're
editing
so if
so I found
I want to update the user
and I'm going to go ahead and pull
information from the body for what will
be updated
now for each
diffuser ID
and pass the integer
okay
so this is our values to pass against
the ID
and in this instance we'll make sure
that we're obtaining the values of
username
so if we are updating user and we're
just updating the username we want to
make sure that that's the value that
gets updated
and then we also want to do user email
we don't want to update the ID so it's
going to remain unique and consistent
okay and we're going to make sure that
everything is pushed to the Json package
and then we'll also have a message
saying that
the field has been updated in the Json
package
okay
all right so we'll run that script again
and looks good so let's go to our folder
let's change the HTTP post let's put it
as get just so we can see that we have
uh all of their values in the array from
the Json packet
and now we want to say put which allows
us to update just one record
so let's go ahead and select one record
we'll save it1 so we've got one record
we can go ahead and for name we can
change this
so let's go ahead and change these
so now you see that the email has
changed so we have staff
as the new account
all right our final API that we're going
to create is to delete an account and in
many ways it's actually a very basic API
because all we're doing is we're
grabbing the ID and then we're saying
that all the associated records with
that ID
within that row as it were in the table
just to delete the whole row
and so we want to use again our ID as
the unique value that we
pulling against
so we're going to if he uses a found and
we're going to
filter those users
I'm going to do that filter against user
ID
and pass that
and
and they go and
post a message to uh Jason packet saying
user
deleted
in our generic message of things fail
okay let's save that and we'll
see we go ahead and we're using we're
just deleting the record now
and we're going to do it by filtering
against the unique ID
and then you will then just eliminate
that record
we'll pass the message that has been the
account has been deleted
okay let's save that let's go run our
script
node index.js
I'm good okay let's come over here and
we're going to
show that we can put any of the accounts
so let's just take one of them
one I think that's good
so let's go ahead and we're going to
change
the HTTP command to delete
and we actually have to
select an account so we just do one when
we do that it'll actually delete that
record and here we are um it says that
the user has been deleted and we now
only have three records in the Json
packet
and we can put all the records
and you'll see that there's only three
so being able to
pull all the records from a Json package
we've been able to create a record
update a record and delete a record
and we can just step through so here's
our Json package that we had created
originally again this is just an array
it's just a different way of setting up
the array and then we have our index
files which um identifies what are the
apps that need to be installed and where
the API is going to be serviced out of
and that we're going to be doing this on
uh the port 3000
um again these are additional tools that
we need to make sure that we have up and
running um in our script and so the
first script was to get all the the
records the seconds to filter against a
user ID for just a specific record and
then for creating a record we actually
went in and we used the uid tool to
create a unique identifier and then we
posted in the data for the new records
we did something similar with updating
the record we didn't have to update the
user ID we just had to update the values
in the two fields that we needed to be
updated
in this case name and email
and the final step was to go ahead and
delete a record so these are all apis
that you can now pull into your own
application so you can use them in web
applications or you can actually go
ahead and use them in other applications
such as mobile applications
um local applications and other scripts
and this really allows your application
to become more scalable and more useful
hello and we're going to go through and
do our demo of building a restful API
with node.js so the first thing we want
to do is go ahead and install all the
correct pieces of software we're going
to start with node.js so let's do a
Google search on node.js and you'll find
that node.js is at
nodejs.org so we select that link
and that's going to take us to the
node.js website and there are two
versions of node.js you can download
There's the stable version and then
there's the latest version I'd go with
the stable version you'll find it
available in Windows Mac OS and Linux as
well
and if we go to the next piece of
software we want to go ahead and install
the text editor of your choice I'm going
to use Visual Studio code vs code it's
an open source solution it works on all
leading platforms uh works really well I
like the large Microsoft did a good job
with this I also really like it that
it's open source but there's lots of
extensions you can get for vs code and
so it's a great text editor
we'll also need Postman Postman is a
tool that allows us to be able to view
the apis that we're going to create so
let's go ahead to postman.com and again
it's another solution you can download
for free and so we're going to go ahead
and select the download button and it
will automatically detect which OS
you're on so in this case it's going to
be windows but you can also get Mac and
Linux as well so we'll go ahead and
download those
and once we have everything installed
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a project in vs code and that's
actually really easy to do all you have
to do is create a folder
and we'll do this right off our desktop
and we're going to call the folder node
rest API and we'll select that folder
and you'll see on the left hand column
that we have the new folder that we
created we still have the vs code
welcome screen we'll get rid of that we
don't need that anymore
so let's go ahead and one of the things
I like with vs code is you can actually
toggle the terminal window so let's go
ahead and open up the terminal window so
we can actually run that at the same
time and so we're going to move our
cursor to the folder we just created and
there we are you can see that
and what we can do now is we're going to
initialize this with no package manager
to make this a package
and it's going to go ahead I'm going to
ask for a name we're just going to go
with the default so we're just going to
say yes yes to a couple of these yep
enter enter
[Music]
enter enter
and is this okay
yep enter
all right so now we have a new file and
this is our Json package it has all the
defaults in it we can go in and modify
these if we want to no need to for this
exercise but you may want to for the
solution that you're putting together
and we're going to create a new file
called index.js and this is going to be
the reference file that's in the Json
package for npm
and here we're going to put in our
solutions that we absolutely have to
have for this to run so we're going to
install Express and express is a web
service application but it's very
flexible and one of the things that
we're going to use it for today is build
apis
so in our terminal window we're going to
type npm install Dash save Express
this will install Express locally on our
machine
and it takes a few minutes but it's
going to go and download all the latest
features this is going to be the latest
version of Express you can if you want
to specify a specific version of
software for these examples there's no
need to do that
so you'll see that everything has been
installed we expanded the node module we
can scroll down and indeed yep there we
are we see Express has been installed
along with some other
um pieces that are used for
all right so that's our first piece and
the next
is we're going to Define our amp and our
app is going to use Express
and we want Express as a local host on
our local machine on Port 3000 so we've
identified Port 3000 as the default port
for our application
and
we are going to now create
a an array
for some movies
I'm going to have ID title director and
release date
exception great movie
and director Christopher
[Music]
and that was released
in 2010 yes 10 years ago
okay so we're going to do an a couple of
items here and just so that we have some
more than one entry in our array and
array is a JavaScript uh you can think
of it as a very simple uh table now it
allows us to have structured data you
can also do a Json file you can also
connect to a database mongodb or
something like that
2019
okay so we have two movies in our little
array
it'll be more than enough for right now
the key part is that we have a
consistent structure for the array of
IDE title director and release date
and so we're going to create two apis
one's going to be a get API we'll get
the list of the items in our API and the
second will be a post where we'll be
actually pushing in a new item so let's
go ahead and start with the get and what
we want to do is we're going to say get
slash movie and
we are going to
have this run as an API and so what
we'll do is we will test this in a
moment so we'll be running from our web
browser and actually we'll probably open
up Postman and run it through Postman so
okay
that pulls all the movies
and we'll do a another
um getting a mobile filter by movie ID
but let's just get them all for right
now
and we are going to listen
on a server port in this instance it's
going to be important
and we already had to find the port as a
variable earlier and which so we're just
referencing the variable and the port
number is listed at the top in line four
it's just a text stream it's going to
get put to the terminal window
and it is going to dynamically
grab the port the value from the
variable from 3000
and place it in our text string easy
and we want to save the file
and now we're going to go ahead and run
it so we're going to do node index touch
Js
that runs the script
and it tells us that we're listing on
Port 3000 that's great
that means now that we should be able to
go into Postman
and
grab the data from an API
so here's Postman if you've not used it
before it's a great tool for being able
to manage apis strongly encourage you to
have a go with this so we're going to
get the get command and we've done any
applications web applications you've
probably used get and post for the data
and that your
pulling and pushing from forms online
same principle so we want to go ahead
and we're going to go and grab get I'm
going to type in localhost
and it's going to be colon 3000 slash
movies because that's the the name of
the file and we're going to hit send and
what we get as a response
is the
data in our query
sorry in our array here we go so there's
our array and the data values have been
pulled back by Postman
that's great
so now we want to go ahead and add a
movie
to our array
and we're going to do that we're going
to use the post
command and it gets imposed our HTTP
commands
and so we're going to use movies
and in this instance we're going to push
the value
into
our list
so construction movie requires we need a
structure here and that structure is
going to be
the information that's in the the body
and then we're going to push to the log
our terminal window
and I'm going to push so here we're
using push and that's a term in for
arrays within JavaScript where we push
the data into the actual array itself
there are lots of ways of being able to
control data within an array if you're
new to a race with JavaScript I strongly
encourage you to learn more about them
there's just an awful lot you can do
with them
and then we want to have a validation
message come up on the screen saying yes
movie has been added to the list so
we'll save what we've just created
and if you don't save it won't show up
and then we're going to re-run
the node index.js file
you can see this is what we've created
here already
a an API that allows us to pull and push
data
in and out of a variable
okay so let's go back and we're going to
change the header from being get to
being push
so we're going to use sorry not push our
post so we're going to say post and then
what we want to do is the value inside
of the body and so let's go pose huh
and we want to select a body
and we're going to play in text
and select Json so it's going to be
structured and so here we will
essentially copy the structure we have
here so let's go ahead and just
copy these elements
and we have to give it an ID because we
don't have an auto generated ID so we're
going to make this ID
3.
and then
it's going to be a number three
and then we want to put in
title
new movie and we'll put in director
and we'll have this as
I don't know new director
not very creative here today
and then
we need to put in a date
so release underscore dates
and let's just put in a date
uh to
um just so you know that we're not
formatting the date con it's
so let's go ahead and we'll select send
and this will actually go and we can see
below boom movie's been added to our
list
and we can go back and let's go ahead
and validate that so we're going to
change from post to get
use the same
and now we go to the low
oh looks like we put an error in
our formatting
so let's go
to
pass the Json
and we'll pass it using Express
and this will
clear up any formatting issues
so
app.use Express Json
Express
URL encoded
extended false
and this should help us pass
value
and then we'll rerun that script make
sure you save the previous file
otherwise it won't run the new script
all right okay so let's go back
and
let's go back to our
localhost 3000 slash movies
and there's only two values here so what
we need to do now is change from get to
post
we'll go to body
and what we're going to do is we want to
have
raw Json and
what we want to do is capture the values
that we have below
and insert
this
file into this new
Json packet
into our array
let me actually just copy that
it's a little bit cheating but it's the
main same so let's go ahead and
get everything consistent
and we change the number to three
and creating a unique title patching
sorry new typo doesn't need to be unique
just the ID needs to be unique
it's a title in the new movie new
director and change it to New director
I'm going to change the date
I'm not doing any formatting on the date
so it can be any any date any number
really
hit save
movies has been added to our list so
it's been added but now let's go back to
get and let's see if we can actually see
the third entry and scroll down and
there we are we've actually pushed that
Json package into our array
so we now have three items in and that
have been added fire our API
okay
so
now let's go ahead and search our Movie
Database I guess we only have three
entries but you know we want to be able
to so we can do that by using the get
command and what we'll be doing is we'll
be validating against
a specific ID number so we have three
and we're going to
validate against just the ID number
um in this instance
um the way to do it is through the URL
so beforehand we had localhost colon
3000 slash movie now we're adding in a
slash movie slash and then whatever
number of that will actually filter
against the ID and
that's essentially what we're doing here
right now
so we're going to go into f movies
dot ID again we're using the ID menu to
actually pull from our arraylist
with my variables and arrays mixed up
here today
and then once we actually have the value
we'll actually post back as a Json
packet
and if we have any errors then what
we'll do is we'll throw up message movie
not found so there we are we're going to
plug in some ID
and we should be able to then pull that
up through Postman into our terminal
window
again the reason why we're using Postman
is that this is actually just showing
the values going back and forth we're
not having to render a whole web page uh
it's extremely fast very efficient
all right
so we saved and rerun our script all
right let's go back and what we're going
to do is we're going to change the value
so we're going to hit send here we are
we see all of our movies using the get
command now what we're going to do is
we're going to use a look filtering just
id2 which is the Irishman so to slash
two and there we are we have just the
information on the Irishman so now you
can see how you can create a simple
search
all right
so the final action we want to do is to
delete a record
in our array and so we can go ahead and
do that
and we're going to use the uh Delete
commands to actually do that so we'll be
able to push
um in a record we've been able to view
records filtered audience records now
we're going to go ahead and do delete
and so you can do app delete and then
we're going to filter by specific ID
number
and when we do this we'll actually then
when we put in the URL path which will
be localhost colon 3000 slash movie
slash and then the ID number so this is
inside that one or two probably use two
that will then
delete from our array
the record for the Irishman
several files
I do the shortcut and the keyboard
shortcut of Control Plus s to save files
on Windows or command processing my Mac
and
once we've deleted a record we want to
send a message saying B movie has been
deleted
all right so we want to go ahead
and let's just check our code looking
good save our file
and we want to rerun
the index.js file
yep
rerun okay let's go to postman
new gram
the delete
so again we're filtering against the
movie ID and then we'll delete that ID
okay so we went against the Ashman and
we hit send
and there it is now we're going to
change
the command to delete
so we hit
one we'll actually delete conception the
movie has been deleted this parade and
now let's go ahead and grab uh use get
to pull in all the movies that are
listed and it's not going to find movie
number with the id1 if it's not there
anymore
and if we get all the movies
we see we only have one movie and that's
the Irish one and so our delete function
has worked
there we are so we've installed Express
we're using Express to build all of our
applications we have our app running on
Port 3000 we are using Express to pass
the Json effectively back and forth we
have a simple array that array is then
being used to create an API to pull the
details then we're being able to add a
movie then search for a movie itself
reading against an ID
and then we can actually finally go
ahead and delete a movie
all this using express.js
today we're going to be covering node.js
authentication using JWT or Json web
tokens so let's get started so why are
we going to go down this path so let's
cover the key things that you need to be
asking yourself such as what is a Json
web token what is the value of using a
Json web token then what is the actual
structure of the GWT look like and then
let's go through some use cases of where
you'd actually use jwts both in
Enterprise and in the real world
and then finally we're actually going to
go through a demo on how you can
actually install a JWT and using Express
and node.js
so let's dive into what actually is a
Json web token
so a Json web token is actually based on
an open standard and it's one that you
can actually go ahead and research and
it allows a definition of a compact
self-contained way of being able to
securely transmit information between
parties using adjacent object an
adjacent object is a JavaScript array
and it's very compact it's a very a
tight way of being able to send data
back and forth
the thing that's great about using a
Json web token is that the information
itself is encrypted and it can only be
verified and trusted through a public
private key pair and we'll get into that
about how you can actually get to those
so you know why would you actually want
to go ahead and use a Json web token are
there other formats that you can use
well yes there are other formats you can
use but what's great about a JWT is that
it is a great way to be able to pass
data from a HTTP servers so if you're
building a web application and you have
a web vacation where you need to pass
authentication over using a jw2 is a
great way to be able to do that so for
instance you may have a number of
Enterprise applications that run across
your Cloud environment you may have some
Enterprise applications that run in your
data center and you want to have people
come in such as your employees or your
customers authenticate once and then be
able to have their ID transition from
one to the next and JWT is a great way
to do that the content is extremely
secure and we'll get more into that in a
moment but it is the highest level of
security you can have right now
and the final great thing about working
with JWT is that the actual tokens
themselves are very well documented and
so there's actually a lot of passes that
you can use so being able to add in JWT
into your application is very very easy
to do which makes it very easy for you
to actually Implement kind of a large
scale authentication and authorization
and so authorization is a key word there
that's something that you're probably
coming across um a lot instead of just
being able to identify who you are we
want to be able to authorize what you
have access to
so let's have a look at the structure of
a JWT there are several key armors and
the first is the header and that's
actually going to break down what I kind
of token It Is by default it's going to
be a GWT token and what is the signing
algorithm so sha512 is a very complex
and secure algorithm and certainly the
one that I would recommend that you use
you can even go higher than that but um
sha512 is a great place to start
and then you have the payload and the
payload is the information that's been
actually encrypted within the web token
so in this instance we have a name the
admin time type sub name
um just really you can put whatever kind
of information you want in there as long
as it's applicable
um to the uh service that you're passing
the data into
and then you have your signature which
is
um encoded header um and payload with
the algorithm that you've sent so in
this instance it's sha512 algorithm
so let's look at some of the use cases
that you'd have for JWT
so a couple of use cases would be
authorization so say for instance you
have a application and you want to be
able to authorize somebody to have
access to different parts of that
application
um JWT is a great way to be able to
encrypt that data and be able to pass
that data back and forth examples would
be jumping from different parts Office
365 and be able to have access to
different features within the system
and then another area would be if you're
doing information exchange so
information is being securely exchanged
from one person to another so a
blockchain scenario a multi distributed
environment where you want to be able to
have a way to be able to securely
transmit data back and forth and know
that that data is being encrypted is
another good example
so with that let's take a pivot and
we'll go ahead and we'll look at
creating a demo using our standard stack
of node.js and we'll use express and
Postman and these are tools that you may
already be familiar with if you've seen
other videos that we've created in this
series and we'll go ahead and create a
JWT token
so let's go into our demo of how to
create a JWT Json web token there's
going to be some tools that we need to
get started with node.js is the first so
let's go ahead and find node.js at
nodejs.org and you can either download
Windows Mac or Linux code
obviously you'd install the one that
would be for your operating system and
the next tool that we want to install is
a text editor we're going to use Visual
Studio code or vs code and go to
code.visualstudio.com download this this
will run on Mac windows and Linux really
great text code editor
and then we're also going to use Postman
Postman is a tool that allows you to
access and view apis that will be
creating with Express and you go to
postman.com hit download and again
there's versions of Postman for all
leading operating systems
and have those installed and up and
running
so we're going to go ahead and let's
open up visual studio code
I'm going to start by creating our
project
so let's go full screen on this get rid
of the welcome screen
and that's going to open up a folder
where we'll actually have our project
I'm going to put this on our desktop for
right now let's go create a new folder
and we'll call this node JWT
[Music]
uh Json web token select that folder
and we're going to want to go ahead and
use npm to initialize this folder for
for node and so let's get rid of the
welcome screen again and let's go ahead
and one of the things I love about vs
code is you can actually run the
terminal window right from in here so
let's go ahead and select npm in it
Arenas to pull from the folder that
we're in and we're just going to select
yes here in a second for
um
yep let's go ahead and create that and
you'll see that the packet has been
created and there is a Json packet with
just default information about the npm
package that we created for node and
we're going to go ahead and create an
index.js file that's what we'll be
pulling from the package and the
index.js files we're going to actually
write all of our code and what we want
to do right now is install Express
and express is going to be used to
create the apis that will be able to
test our JWT against and then we'll also
want to install
a JWT
file so let's call this Json web token
and from our terminal window we'll just
go ahead and install both of those and
do that by typing npm install save and
then we're going to put Express
and Json web token
Express and Json web token
and we'll just go ahead and let those
install
it only takes a moment for those to get
installed
all right we're up and running okay
so let's go ahead and start bringing in
some of our apps so we're going to
create an Express amp
and we're going to use the
get HTTP header to have everything go
from the we're going to actually have
everything running on our local host and
we're going to run everything off Port
3000 we'll do that in a moment here but
we'll have everything running off a sub
folder called apis where our web
applications can be running from
and we'll put in a message that hey
there to show that everything's up and
running
okay
and
save that
and say if you can do Control Plus s to
save your files and as you can with a
lot of Windows applications and I
encourage you to do that a lot so let's
go ahead and open up Postman we don't
know when we go to our web browser on
this one and open up Postman
takes a moment to run the first time
and it comes
and Postman again is a tool for being
able to manage API calls
um
so you don't have to write a script
so here we go
and we can go in here and we can
that's where we're going to write our
script but we have to do a couple things
first let's let's get everything running
so we want to listen on for Port 3000
that's we're going to run everything off
of
and in the console log we'll actually
throw in a message to confirm that we
are running on uh everything is up and
running we'll just say Okay server
started on Port 3000 again we're going
to be running everything off localhost
so you'll be able to see this
um and this is as you imagine just a
test environment so let's go down into
our console we'll run this script node
index.js to run the script runs really
fast not a whole lot going on there and
we're having everything running off the
API file so let's go and we'll type in
under our get localhost
colon 3000
API
and then we hit the there's lots of
different HTTP headers um we can use
we're going to use get for right now
send that
and
hey there welcome to the API service
so typically this is just an API we're
creating right now this is not JWT we'll
get into that right now
all right
so we want to be able to post data
and post is actually pushing data in so
we're going to go into going to create a
login screen again again this is all API
so it's not real but uh you're good you
get the point
and then you can construct a user
and let's go ahead and what we're doing
here is we're creating a
an array of a random user and then you
can have a name of id1 that we have the
users can have ID value which is one
um a username value which is going to be
John and an email value of John
gmail.com
and then we'll make this a
Json web token JWT signing and they'll
have to sign with their user
and this is going to use a secret key
which will be our hash
512 token
and
respond to the Json with the token
okay so let's see now okay we're going
to
amp Dot and this will be our post
API
posts
and what we're going to be able to do is
we're going to jump from one app to
another app and you'll be able to see
how we can move the token over there
this is
and the message will read
post
created
all right
so let's just run that script next.js
runs real quick okay
so if we come over here and we go to
posts
and hit send
and say message posts created
good
so let's go ahead and try that again
and we want to go to the
login
so go from one app to another app
set post
and here the login
we should be able to request the token
this will be our GWT token
and we hit send we should get our token
and here you can see the the whole token
is encrypted
and set huge long line
it's very unique
and
now we want to be able to go in and say
okay let's verify
the token so we've gone ahead and we
created the token but now we need to as
we go from app to app we need to
actually verify the token so we're going
to get an error message if we don't
verify the token correctly
so I'm going to put in a function to
verify the token
and
we're going to create a better header
value
which will be
the headers and the authorization for
that
and if type of error header
I'm gonna either have it if it's not
correct it'll be undefined
otherwise the spirit token
it will be split
and we're going to require the token
for our Bearer token
else
send status
403 okay so Bearer token is what we're
going to be calling against to verify
our token I'll show you how that works
in just a moment
and this will be to authorize
and to authorize we'll need to actually
go ahead and
use the token so we can actually
put in here
all right so I think
everything's looking pretty good
oh and
if things if we get the error message
means that it's we'll see the message
forbidden if we don't put in the code
correctly so let's
double check everything is looking good
we can verify that the token is required
okay
so if it is then jwt.45
[Music]
and this will
connect our token appropriately
and we'll be able to
put that in as a part of our secret key
and if it is successful
you put in
that message there
and we're also going to plan the
authorization data
yep looking good
as you can see a lot of the work is just
making sure that everything is aligned
up correctly
okay so let's run our code node index.js
there we go nice and fast
and
we go in and localhost
API posts
and change this to post
so this one API which is the API posts
which is up here
I'm going to hit send
and you can see that we have the error
code forbidden has come up which is what
we were expecting because we haven't
been able to put in a secret key
and put in the comment there forbidden
so it's as we're stepping through the
code
and now what we can actually do is we
can go back and we can grab the token
and here is our token below and we just
want the token cell we don't need the
wrappers
and copy that come over here
and we write again it's going to say
forbidden but if we go into author into
uh headers we can put in authorization
and then the value
we do Bearer and then the key
and once we do this
we now get all of the data that we were
asking for pull back
which is exactly what we wanted
so you can see here how we can actually
securely use a JWT to pass values back
and forth across the application
okay
and we hit authorization if we select
that and prove it yep we keep
authorizing so if you don't authorize
and you don't get the data
okay so we have everything against the
API then we have one application which
we call Api post we have another
application called API login and we're
able to move the data back and forth
using our secret key in our JWT token
and we have everything running on Port
3000 of our Local Host server
and that's our demo
so first of all let's cover why you'd
want to go through this tutorial so
we're going to cover what my sequel is
we're also going to tell you how we're
going to connect with node.js and why
you'd want to do that with my SQL and
then finally we're going to do a demo
taking you through all the steps on how
you can actually do that kind of
connection
so what is my SQL well basically my
sequel is probably the world's most
popular relational database so if you
think of relational databases that are
table driven MySQL is arguably the most
popular database out there for rdbs
systems it is by far the most popular
open source relational database
the entire database is written in C and
C plus plus it's been around for a
really long time and again it's open
source which is great which means that
there are no licenses or costs for
actually using MySQL and you'll find
that companies of all sizes from small
mom and pop shops all the way up to
massive Enterprise Global Enterprises
are all using MySQL so you know why
would you want to then take that next
step of connecting node.js with my SQL
what fundamentally comes down to the
basics of the differences between the
two products MySQL is a database and
node.js is a architecture framework for
building out web applications again with
mySQL it's open source it's free to use
you don't have to pay anything there are
no licenses which if you compare it with
other Solutions out there is a big deal
my sequel even though it is open source
it's incredibly powerful it's one of the
more mature open source programs out
there I think Apache is probably
arguably more patchy uh web server is
probably more mature but uh my sequel is
very close behind it so it has had a
huge amount of investment this is not a
solution that's only a couple years old
we're talking about a solution that's
more than 15 years old very very
structured very powerful and you can do
a lot of really good things with it
um you can actually then build Solutions
with it and using PHP Java really any
kind of database even other systems and
other Frameworks will allow you to
interact with mySQL and it just allows
you to work with just huge amounts of
data very very quickly
so let's go through a demo of how you'd
actually use node.js and MySQL
so we're going to go ahead and we're
going to get
into environment together so let's start
by stepping node.js and downloading it
so we'll get to knowjs.org
and there you have your options for
Windows Mac or if you want to go for the
source code you can go ahead and
download and install that
the next is to install zap and so we're
going to go to zap installers for a
quick search and that's on our Apache
friends.org site and here we have
example Windows Linux and Mac OS 10.
and then finally we want to go ahead
and install visual studio so visual
studio is going to be our Ideo
integrated development environment in
this instance we're going to use Visual
Studio code if you're not used for your
skill code it's a break free open source
solution for being able to build
applications I'm a big fan of it so I
encourage you to use it
and go ahead and download and install
that
and we have visual studio and code up
and running so go ahead and we're going
to open up a new folder and let's go
ahead and create a new folder and just
put it straight five desktop here and
it's Just for kicks and Giggles so I'm
going to type in node MySQL or our
source code and open up that folder and
select that
and so we now have this folder selected
in uh Visual Studio code editor and what
we want to do is we want to get rid of
the welcome page and we don't really
need that anymore and we're going to
turn a window so we can actually see the
script that we're writing we'll be using
terminal quite a bit
um in this so for instance we're just
going to test that we have npm installed
we did so that's great
and we're going to go npm init and
that's actually going to set up our own
node package module and we can actually
see that the Json file for the package
has been created so we go in there we
can see that all the defaults selected
now you'll see that index.js is the
default file that will be created so
we're actually going to go ahead and
we're actually going to create our own
index.js file and we're going to add in
some instructions into that file to
actually install the correct software
from the npn package
and the first thing we want to do is
install Express
which is a package that's great for
building a lightweight web applications
not mobile applications I suppose if
you're doing a responsive design then I
can see
level but in this it's really it's a web
application environment so we're going
to put in the requirements for that and
then we're going to also go and require
that my SQL gets installed and uh you'll
see that for both of them we're just
going to use npms default commands for
creating it and we'll go down to the
terminal window and we'll do npm install
and it's going to install the express
and my SQL environment
an asset in stores you actually see on
the left hand side under the folder you
actually see
the files starting to be installed so
for instance we have the node modules
and underneathpad will be all the
subsequent files that we need
and there we are everything is installed
all right so let's go ahead and validate
some of these clients make sure
everything is installed so we're going
to open up xampp which allows us to go
in and
View and see everything installed so we
have my SQL Server we have a patch
installed we can start the Stop and the
services
with zamp go ahead and do that you can
do this through tell the window as well
but
the UI interface is really nice so let's
go into
my SQL interface
and you'll see that we don't have any
databases
these are all just the the standard test
databases and so we have to go ahead and
create one
and so that's
git uh
single database connection created
so we're going to write
const DB equals MySQL
create connection
and we want to create connect to the
localhost in this instance
and users just going to be a root user
account
which is the standard user account that
comes from MySQL there is no password
for the root user when you're running it
locally or I encourage you to change
that as quickly as you can because you
don't really want to have a password
free environment
and now we want to be able to then
connect to the MySQL
environment
so do Royal write DB dot connect
uh parentheses error and we want to
throw an error message if the connection
isn't good so if we do error
we will throw the error message to the
log window
and if we don't
then we'll write my super connected
all right
and then we want to connect that to our
Express app
the next step we want to do after we
made our connection is to go ahead and
create a database so I'm going to do
both steps are the same one so we'll run
the script right now and then we'll run
the commands in the terminal window so
we can actually create a database
and so we're going to go ahead and we
want to create
a database
and let's
let's let SQL equals
create
database
I'm going to call the database node
MySQL you could call it whatever you
want
um but this is just a node MySQL
script
the DP
query
SQL
error
through error message
rest.send
database created
so we'll throw a message saying that
database has been created let's go save
that
to demonstrate that we've connected and
we've created database so let's go ahead
and the node index.js
let's run it and we connect it to my SQL
that's great
good first step and then we'll go to the
window
and we'll go to localhost
3000 which is
the default
connection but what you'll see is that
we've actually created the name of the
databases and change it to node by SQL
so we've got an error message which we
expected and so what we're going to do
is we're actually going to go ahead and
we're going to say we want to listen
and if the Met error message it comes
out to three thousand
then
in the console window we want to
put a message of server started on
Corpus 2000.
so let's try that again
load index.js
yep and server has signed with 40 000.
Let me refresh that
I'm still getting an error message
and what we want to see is let's go
ahead and see our database hasn't been
created
so let's go and connect to
database
the database is let's go ahead and say
create DB on Port 3000 all right so by
doing that we write that command and
that function and that goes and creates
our database and we'll actually see what
we have now node MySQL has been created
great first start
now we have to go in and create some
tables because we have no tables in
there
all right so let's go down let's go
ahead and create a table
so what you're seeing right now is that
we're using
the index.js environment within a
package on node.js to actually create
and control everything that we want to
see in our windows so all of the work
that we're doing for creating a table
for creating the database
for initializing the core files it's all
being done through Js and so here we are
going to create a new table we call it
create import it's going to be called
the employee table and so once we run
the command create employee it's going
to create a table has the employee
fields which is going to have an ID
which will be an integer there or into a
auto increment it'll have a name field
and we'll also put in a designation
field
and
I will have a primary key as well
keep it very simple for right now
and let's just
put our DB connection so that everything
connects effectively
okay so everything goes correctly then
we'll have the message employee table
created
so let's test this out
and note index.js
make sure that the data we have now
actually a database field that we can
connect to so we've got node my SQL so
we're connecting to the correct database
obviously we get an error
and then we'll try that again here you
connected to the database
so database has the name
and of course we've got load MySQL
there's no fields in there yet so let's
go ahead and
and put in trade employees and Fields
and let's run the budget that creates a
new table and then
voila we have a new table and so the
next action we want to do is actually
populate the table with a record
so this starts becoming familiar so it
happened to
put in a single record we'll call it
employee one for right now and
we'll write the
the function you know employee one and
when we run that function
uh it'll actually go ahead and
create the it'll actually insert the
record into my SQL
and then the name will be Jake Smith
and the designation will be
a chief executive officer
certainly encourage you to put your own
self name your own name into this make
yourself your own CEO because why not
and we're going to make this as an
insert record
we answered into the employee table
and we're just using some basic SQL
script in here
and what you'll see actually with Visual
Studio code is that it's actually
providing a lot of prompts to make it
easier to write your code
Microsoft is looking to actually add
some AI
to visual studio code to actually start
Auto completing scripts which will make
it even easier
to write your code
right so let's go run node index.js
we'll see a guy from connected and we'll
grab the function employee one and let's
go over to our Express site let's just
go and we'll insert the command employee
E1
employee has been added and we will just
validate this by going back to my SQL
and we'll refresh it and you'll see if
we click on the employee table which we
should now have an employee in there yep
there we did Jake Smith
put on Jake first record
all right so we want to be able to now
is select the employee
so let's go ahead and do that
and we want to be able to easily get the
employee list
so let's use our SQL command and we'll
do select star which is everything from
the employee table so we're actually
playing everything from the employee
table
we're going to query the database
let's throw a message to confirm that
the query is successful
we'll put everything in the console log
results
all right let's give this a well
okay so let's go and run our Command
or localhost 3000
but get employee
and it says employee details fetch now
we go over to the console we do in the
visual studio yeah there we go we have
now all this packet information
including the ID about Jake Smith
okay so let's go ahead and see if we can
actually update the employee information
so as you can see now we're starting to
run into just our standard SQL commands
and so we want to be able to update the
employee from a browser
and as you can tell we're not using uh
any forms or any other types of Records
we're just simply interacting
um with between the the uh the browser
the server and
a new name will be updated name
appropriate record
and we'll show that we're matching
against 181
all right so that's right
[Music]
Jake Smith is there
now go and select
adjusted
come on same slash one
we've now gone ahead and updated
the object uh Jake Smith's information
let's click on complete table and we now
see he says dated name I know not very
creative but
it allows you to see a change
and finally we can go ahead and delete
the record as well
so it's going to be similar to update
but you can delete it instead
and we're going to delete
the record from the employee table
where the theme equals what i t equals
sorry
and
okay
and then we want to be able to
show that the record has been deleted
oh yeah
just select delete employee
looks like deleted and we go to uh
database we can actually see
in the employee table
but there are no entries
they want to record that was there has
been deleted
and so this shows you how you can very
easily control everything
from using your connection into MySQL
right from node package manager
you can create table
you can select your records
you can then update any record that you
selected
and finally you can delete any
recordings
you want to be able to delete
hello everyone and welcome to Simply
learns YouTube channel I hope you guys
are doing well today we will be taking
you through the express.js full course
this express.js full course is designed
in such a way that it will help you
understand the most widely used concepts
of express.js in an exciting manner
you will see how to create a simple rest
API in this video by the end of this
tutorial you will be able to understand
and deploy the express.js
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have regular updates on
programming videos so if you are a
programmer and want to learn something
new then consider getting subscribed to
our YouTube channel and press that Bell
icon to never miss any update from
Simply learn so let's go through the
agenda for this full course
first we'll see the introduction to this
course after that we will see what is
expressed Js
moving ahead
we will see how to install express.js
after that we will see express.js get
post method in detail
moving ahead we will see what is a
middleware and its function then we will
create a middle wherein express.js
moving ahead we will see express.js test
API and then we will see react with
express.js in this we will also see how
to connect the server side to the client
side
after that
we will see what is typescript and how
to connect node and express.js
and in last we will be creating an user
registration form with Express so let's
begin
I hope you guys are ready to learn
something new now we will start our
first topic
node.js is a file JavaScript runtime
environment but it does not support
request handling functions HTTP methods
or serving files so Express JS comes
into the picture Express makes the
node.js code easier as Express provides
a wide range of features to develop both
web and mobile applications it is used
to build single page multi-page and
hybrid page web applications as Express
is written in JavaScript it is very easy
to understand for the developers who
know JavaScript until now Express is the
most popular framework of node.js
you must have heard about mean stack in
web development right where e stands for
express.js
it is a back-end part of means tag it
manages routing HTTP method sessions
error handling Etc
let's see what express.js is
express.js is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
cross platform mobile apps quickly and
easily
it is very high performance fast
lightweight and unopeniated that is
there is no structural way to write a
code XPS does not force you to write a
code in a fixed manner
express.js is used as a server-side
scripting language
let's see the need for xpages but before
that let me give you an example if you
have to write a rest API using the core
modules of node.js in the same using the
framework express.js you will realize
that with the help of express it will
take 5 to 10 times less code and time
that was the reason behind creating
express.js framework for node.js
express.js is time efficient fast money
efficient very easy to learn and
asynchronous let's see the features of
express.js
for server side development with the
features of node.js XP saves a lot of
time middleware middleware is a request
Handler that has access to the
applications request response cycle
routing this refers to how an
application's endpoints URLs respond to
client requests
templating it provides templating
engines to build Dynamic content on the
web pages by creating HTML templates on
the server
debugging Express makes it easier as it
identifies the exact part where bugs are
let's see the advantages of express.js
expresses unopeniated and we can
customize it and use it as per our needs
as it is written in JavaScript a single
language is used for front-end back-end
development
Express is fast to link it with
databases like MySQL mongodb
Etc
let's see the disadvantages the
disadvantage of express.js is that there
is no structural way to organize things
sometimes the code becomes
non-understandable
there are so many issues with callbacks
the error messages that will come are
very challenging to understand
now we'll see the companies that are
using express.js the major companies are
IBM Uber eBay PayPal essential Fox
Sports Netflix LinkedIn
as per the nlib.com there are more than
34 300 companies that are using
express.js
now I think you guys have a brief idea
about Express as it is a lightweight
framework that gives functionalities to
make node.js easy
express.js is trending so much because
it is helping so many developers to save
their time it is so awesome that most of
the companies are moving towards it
if you know JavaScript and node.js the
framework expresses what you should know
to strengthen your coding skills
now here
you'll find downloads
you can download node from here
and install it but if you find any
difficulties downloading node.js you can
click on the link in the right corner to
see how to download node.js
now let's see the version for node to
verify here I am using visual studio
code you can go and search it and simply
download vs code
after opening your Visual Studio code
will look like this
here
you will find a terminal click on it
the terminal window will open
here we will write node
hyphen B
this will show us the latest version of
node.js
now we need to update the npm which is
node packet manager this bundle consists
of all the repositories and packages
required for development purposes to do
that NVM install npm globally
NVM install
VM hyphen
globally
this will download all the npm packages
globally now let's create Express for
that first we need to create a separate
folder where we will keep all the
modules and files of express.js let's
claim this TLS
you can open the terminal by clicking on
the shortcut also by pressing Ctrl and
backtech that will open the terminal for
you
let's make a folder mkdir
this is a command that is used to create
a folder on the terminal then we will
write our file name I will write Express
by
simply learn
enter
here you can see the file name expressed
by simply learn has been created
you can also click here
and enter your file name
m.js
press enter
as you can see a new file has been
created
now we need to install a package manager
that is npm
we will write a npm command open your
terminal again
write a command
npm
in it
enter
version enter description and
description you can write Express
tutorial
bye
simply learn enter
repository if you have your git
repository you can add yours enter
author
relearn
license enter
press yes
after this
you can see npm created a Json file
now we will finally install express.js
we will write npm
install
Express
enter
now as you can see our Express is
installed in our system
let's open the app.js that we have
created earlier
now we will create a express application
with the help of Express functions that
we can do by requiring the express
modules let's create a first program
first
constant
Express
required
Express
in this line we are requiring the
express module
const
a name equals to function
Express
dot get
to get the file
request response
to get the request and the response
of the user
and
we will need to pass callback function
here
let's write
response send
this message will be shown
in the server welcome
to
welcome to Simply learn
now here
we will write a report number where the
message will be shown to us add dot
lesson
4000 you can add anything
here also we are passing the Callback
function
console
DOT log in control log we will see the
message in the console
listening to Port
number
four thousand
close this line
save this
let's run it open your terminal new
terminal
now to run this file
we need to go to the express
folder
CD
Express
by simply learn
we are now in a simply land folder
now the easiest way is to write the file
name write node space the file name
app.js
enter
now you can see it is printing our
message listening to Port 4000 now we
will see a message on the server
open your Chrome
type localhost 4000
press enter
and here we go a message is successfully
displayed welcome to Simply learn
get in post method are the standard HTTP
request used to create traced apis
get in post methods are used to send and
receive significant amount of data
the client sends a request in the form
of Json file and with the help of HTTP
requests which are get post and other
methods it will go to the server and
then the server sends back the response
to the client in the form of a message
to tell what happened to the request
that was sent to the server
now
express.js get method
get is a method that is used to request
data from the server but mainly this
method is used to read data
to handle get request in Express is
pretty straightforward
get requests are to be cached and
remains in the browser history and
that's why the get method is not used
for sensitive data
to get the data we add parameters in the
URL and get data in response
get method is more efficient and popular
than the post method
now we'll see express.js post method
host method is used to create new or to
edit already existing data this method
is used to communicate with large amount
of data
the post method is secure because the
data is passed in a request body and not
visible in the URL and the user is not
able to bookmark it mostly we use get
method only but when we want to send a
sensitive data we use post method
now we will see how to get the post and
get methods work
now open your Visual Studio code
I have already installed node and
express if you haven't installed it then
you can click on the right corner of
this video to get the setup done
coming back to express get and post
methods
now what I have done here is I have
created a basic express.js app
const app require Express this will
install all our Express modules
now first we will write our gate method
so let's start
first we will write get method
then we will initialize how it will be
called well write get
this OS
create new consonant request parameters
request and response
the fat Arrow function
in this
we will send a response
and the server
hello
this is
full
get
request
let's I have no initialized the brackets
let's see what I have not done oh
God like this
now let's just save this file
we will run this file open your terminal
and write node
Dot
and
I think I have done something wrong
let's again open the terminal
right node
Dot so it is showing server is
successfully running on Port 4000.
now we'll open our Chrome and write
localhost
enter
as I have told you earlier this needs a
parameter so we'll initialize here
get request
hello this is successful get request
so a request method is working fine
now
we'll go back to the post method and see
how it goes
app dot post
request
response
response send
just like this only
just
post
hello
this is
successful
post
now we'll run save this first and then
run it in the terminal
yes no
dot so we're running on 4000
we have to write this so first copy from
here only
open your terminal and here we can write
post Quest enter
so what you can see here is it can't get
post request
for this to see we need to have the
postman I'm using Postman here
here I will write post method and here I
will write the
localhost 4000 and the post request
method then we'll press send
here
in the body part
we will see hello this is successful
post request
how this is working is because post
method is secure and data is passed in
the request body and it cannot be fixed
in the URL
what is middleware middleware is a
request Handler that has access to the
applications request response cycle it
is a function that contains the request
subjects response object and the next
middleware function
middleware can also send the response to
the server before the request
the next middleware function is commonly
donated by the variable named next
simply middleware is a function that can
only be applied using routers with the
help of middleware we can access and
modify requests and response
now we will see what are the functions
of middleware
middleware can execute any code
it can make changes to the request
response objects
middleware can also end the request
response cycle
it can call the next middleware function
in the stack
we use these functions to modify our
middleware to perform many tasks like if
you want to block our site from some
country or if you want to check the
authentication of a user

now we are going to create a simple
middleware
we can create a middleware in a router
file but the best way is to create a
middleware file separately and then use
it creating and using middleware is very
easy now we first need to create a basic
express application but before that you
must have all the app packages to run
Express
you can take the help of our video what
is express.js the link will be in the
description
you need to install npm Express to run
this so coming back to our application
first we need
const
express application
so we'll write constant Express
required
Express
now we'll write constant app
equals to express
function
now to get the data we'll write app Dot
get
foreign
response
response
function
write response stand
welcome to
simpler
now all we'll copy paste this
to get the
home page that way it's too late
copy paste it
okay
here we'll write the extension of the
next page
home will say
and welcome to this villains
okay
this is a very basic middleware
application we are going to create
list
homepage
now we'll make it listen to some Port so
we'll write
Dot listen
to Port will say report
four thousand
again that Arrow function
control
log
right listening
this message will be prompting to us on
the control determinant
so we'll close this brackets
foreign
open your terminal
first we need to go to this folder CT
Express
by
run
enter
now we'll write
file name
uh called enter
so it's showing
listening to Port 4000. now we'll open
our Chrome
local server
type localhost 4000 and
so it is successfully showing us welcome
to Simply learn now we'll go to the next
page we have written there home
enter
so it's successfully showing
welcome to Simply learns homepage
now
will create a middleware go back to that
file
will write
strength
required filter
request you can write anything here
request object
spawn subject
and next
in the fat Arrow function
we will write
concern block
okay
we have written Quest
and use this
by writing
app dot use
request
filter
and save this file
now
we haven't
called our next parameter in Express
framework next is a function
what we'll do is we'll call it in the
bottom of our middleware
will write next
soon
save this file
again we'll open a new terminal
where we'll go to the part folder
Express
by simply run
enter
like node the file name M.K enter
go to the
home
right localhost 4000 enter
as it is printing welcome to Simply
learn we'll go to the home page
okay welcome to Simply learns homepage
with this we have successfully reached
the end of this video
npm which is called as node package
manager is node.js built in package
manager by default and expressjs is a
framework of node.js which is fully
built in JavaScript
it was first made and available for use
in January 12 2010.
let's move on to what is npm
let's take async as an example npm is
incredibly easy to use and all you need
to do is to type npm install async to
install the desired module in the
current directory under node module
folder you may use need function on them
as they use build-ins once installed in
your node modules folder
the biggest software registry in the
world is npm there are more than 80 lakh
code packages in the registry to share
software open source developers utilize
npm npm is often used by businesses to
control private growth
all of the node.js packages and modules
are managed through npm which also
includes the npm command line client
along with the installation of node.js
it is added to the system npm is used to
install the necessary modules and
packages in the node project
moving ahead let's see what is a package
in node.js a package includes every file
required for a module
you can add module in a JavaScript
libraries to your project
now let's see the functions of node
package manager which is npm
only node.js packages modules
repositories can be searched on
node.js.org
use a command line tool to manage
node.js packages dependencies Version
Control and installation
now let's see how to install npm
to install node package manager we have
to install node.js for that you have to
download node.js and install it in your
system
now we will see the version of node.js
go to terminal new terminal
and search here
for
node hyphen V which is denoted as
version enter and this is my version of
node
now we will verify the npm version to do
that we have to run a command
write npm hyphen hyphen version
and you can clearly see my npm version
is 8.5.3
now we will see how we can install node
modules using npm this is a very simple
Syntax for that we just have to write
npm install and that module name
now we will install the famous web
framework module of node.js we will
simply write a command
npm
install
Express
this is a very simple command you can
write in your console or terminal and
then press enter
you can clearly see
the express is installed in our system
what is error handling
array handling is a process in which
express catches and processes the error
that occurs synchronously and
asynchronously
Express comes with its own default error
handlers simply in error handling the
tasks are to identify errors report them
to the users and then develop some
recovery strategies and Implement them
to handle the errors
this whole process should not slow the
overall processing time of the program
now
how does error handling Works in
express.js
express.js comes in with a built-in
error Handler this default error
handling middleware function is added at
the end of the middleware function stack
it automatically catches all errors in
router handlers and allow developers to
extend router handling functionalities
by middleware function error handling in
Express is done using middleware this
middleware is defined in the same way as
other middleware functions the error
handling functions have four arguments
error request response and next
we have next function method that
matches us to the next middleware
Handler in middleware
in error handling we have the next error
method this function skips all
middleware and matches us to the next
error Handler for the router now let's
set up our area in linguid Express
open your Visual Studio code choose from
over 300 in-demand skills and get access
to 1000 plus hours of video content for
free visit skillup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more first we will create a new
directory
for that
open your Domino
new terminal
let's try it
make directory
now I will enter the directory name
I will write
simply learn
or you can also write
error
press enter
you can see the area and Link directory
has been created it's empty
let's go inside that CD
error handling
now we are in the middle link folder
now let's create a new project here
we'll write npm
in it
hash
by
so as you can see
the Json file has been created in the
error handling folder
now
we will install couple of packages here
okay
first we will install Express right npm
install
Express
now we will also install Morgan
which locks the request
after that we'll also install HTTP
errors
errors this package makes it very easy
to check the status code
and then last
we will install node dot EnV
press enter
this will take couple of seconds
now in the dependencies
you can see dot EnV Express HTTP errors
and Morgan
now I will create a file in this error
handling folder
right app dot JS enter
now let's install node bond which helps
us not to reset our file again and again
for that we'll write in the
npm
install
is minus sign save
node mod
enter
this will also take couple of seconds
now
here you can see
the node one has been successfully
installed
now open your package.json files
here
in packet.json file
you can see here
this line
I will rewrite this
you can also remove it let's write
script
and in this I will write
note
app dot JS yes
save this file by pressing Ctrl s
yes
now open the file app.js
here we will be importing some packages
in node.js we use require function right
so we'll write const
Express
required
and
Express
here we need Express packages
now we will be needing Morgan
we will write const
ant
require
D in
now like this we will need HTTP packages
const
ant
error
create
error
required
http
errors
we also need dot Envy packages to import
our environment variables for that we
will simply write required
choir
acting
Dot EnV
Dot
and fig
for this command we need a EnV file we
will create a file
dot EnV
printer
and here we have our EnV file where we
can have our environment variables
first we want a port for this
application so we will write the port
3000
save this file
now again go back to the app.js file
here
first we will be initializing our app
we'll write const
app
Express function
now we will start the application for
this we will write
const
port
to which it will be called process
dot EMB Dot
vote
three thousand
now we'll make our application listen to
Port 3000 we will write
tab Dot listen
port number
port
it will call the port number
and here
we will call the Callback function
Adder function
and here we will make a block statement
for this we'll write console
DOT log
vector
server
I mean
on
import
two dollar sign
and
port
now let me start the application before
that we'll save this file
now to start the application we'll write
NVM
start enter
here it is showing error let's find out
okay
here
I have wrote script
here we need to write start
save this file
and now clear this screen
enter npm
Dot
so as you can see it is successfully
running in the port 3000 rest API are
the standard way to send and receive
data for web services
client sends a request which goes to the
rest API then to the database
to get or put the data after that it
will come back to the rest API and then
to the client
using an API is just like using a
website in a browser but instead
clicking on the buttons we write code to
request data from the server
it is very flexible and can handle
multiple types of requests
restful API is very popular and very
commonly used to create apis for
web-based applications
what is express.js
express.js is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
and cross platform mobile applications
it is used as a server-side scripting
language
express.js is high performance fast
lightweight and unopeniated
we'll see what is rest API but before
that what is rest and what is API
rest means representational State
transfer rest is a popular architecture
which is used to create web services
Now API is a application programming
interface it is a code that allows two
software programs to communicate with
each other
rest API is a software that allows two
applications to communicate with each
other with the help of internet and
various devices now
we will see the HTTP request types first
one is get it is used to request data
from the server but mainly this method
is used to read data
next one is path it is used to update
the data or to change or replace it next
is post
method is used to create new or to edit
already existing data
after that it is delete
delete method is used to delete the data
completely from the server
now we will see the complete
architecture of HTTP request type in
this client sends a request in the form
of Json file
and with the help of HTTP request which
are get patch post and delete it will go
to the server
and then sends back the response to the
client in the form of message
to tell what happened to the request
and now we will create a simple restful
API from scratch

press enter
this will create a Json file
for us
now let's install express.js
for that
we'll write in pm
install
Express
enter
installing express.js
this will add
all the dependencies
for now we have only one Express
installed
we need a file here
to write our code
so we'll create a file called index
.js enter
in this file we will write all our code
when index.js Js
first we'll write cons up
where
Express
in this line we have imported the
Express package
which itself is a function
so we'll write parenthesis here
to initialize it
now
write
code
we'll write the port number I'm writing
4000 here
this will call a variable which is 4000
right app dot let's see
till now our API hasn't defined any
endpoints
this app Dot listen tells the server to
listen on specific Port which we have
defined already as a variable
four thousand
now
in app dot lesson we will write a second
argument as callback to tell us the API
is working or not
then we'll write
port
comma
we'll write the Callback function here
function
console
DOT log
tactic
it's
running
on http
closed
localhost
all this time
and port
which will come under curly brightness
now we can run this app by writing the
command on a terminal
actually save this file
in terminal
now we'll write the command to run this
file
index node
file name index Dot
yes
so it's successfully showing us it's
running on HTTP port
4000.
hopefully your Chrome or anything
I'm using Chrome here I'll write
localhost
4000
enter
closed enter
can't get
no
if you open this URL you will see
this message
can't get this is because we don't have
any API endpoints as of now
but express.js is still responsing with
error message
you can add an API and call it
every application consists of front-end
login and the database together they
form full start and in this video we
will be talking about react and
express.js
react was created by meta and it is used
to make web application responsive
express.js is unobedient and it is used
to make apis Express is maintained by
node.js
let's see what is react.js
react is a JavaScript library which is
used to build mobile and web
applications fast and Interactive
it is an open source reusable components
based front-end library of JavaScript
basically with the help of react we can
create a client-side application or user
interface
it is a combination of HTML and
JavaScript
let's see the features of react.js
first jsx
it is a syntax extension of JavaScript
with the help of react.js we can use the
extension to see how the UI should look
like
virtual document object model Dom it
defines how documentary accessed and
manipulated in the web page
performance there are several ways to
speed up your regular act application by
using virtual Dom
one with data binding information Flows
In One Direction react receive
information through arguments and pass
it by returning values
react goes beyond simple UI and has many
extensions for complete application
support extended with flux and Redux
among others
debugging it is a small browser
extension to make debugging easier and
faster let's see what is express.js
Express the node.js framework designed
to build apis web applications closed
platform mobile apps quickly and easily
it is very high performance past
lightweight and unopeniated express.js
is used as a server-side scripting
language
let's see the features of express.js
first fast server side development with
the features of node.js Express saves a
lot of time
middleware middleware is a request
Handler that has access to the
application request response cycle
routing
this refers to how an application's
endpoint URLs respond to client requests
templating
it provides templating engines to build
Dynamic content on the web pages by
creating HTML templates on the server
debugging Express makes it easier as it
identifies the exact part where bugs are
now we'll see how to connect client-side
to the server side first we need to
create a folder I have created a folder
named react Express
let's see
go to your save file
here I have created react Express folder
now we will be using a text editor in
this video I will be using visual studio
code let's open it
then
we will add all the npm packages and
create a react application called client
open Terminal
new terminal
let's write some command npx
hit
react
ah
line
enter
this will take some time
until then just wait
yes so it's downloaded
now as you can see the client folder has
been created
with all the npm files
in this client folder you will see all
the npm files known modules
Json file also
yeah
now
we'll go to this folder
CD
client
now to get this application running type
npm
Dot
enter
this command will start and compile this
application now it has opened a web page
localhost 3000
this is the first client-side
application startup page
this will be now working as a client
now let's create a backend application
for that first
clean this terminal
let's open a new terminal
type
npx
Express
engine
data
folder name
press enter okay
now this will take some time to install
press yes why
as you can see a API folder has been
created
now we'll go to that API folder see the
API in the
now we are in the API folder
let's install
all the packages in pm
install
press enter
this will again download all the
packages
so npm has installed all the packages
required to run this as you can see in
the packages.json file there are all the
repositories and files that I used
now let's terminate this terminal
terminal
now let's go to the client folder CD
client
press enter
now we are in the client folder
npm
this command will start and compile this
application
now
we'll see the standard express
application that has got installed will
again go to the terminal
delete this terminal
create a new terminal
and this will go to the API folder
npm start
let me start the terminal
press enter
now
we'll go to the Chrome
localhost 3000 very fresh
you will see the standard express
application that has got installed
for this typescript typescript is an
object oriented programming language it
is a strongly typed superset of
JavaScript and all the code of
typescript is compiled with JavaScript
only
it is developed and maintained by
Microsoft
typescript was created to develop large
applications
it is mainly used to simplify the
JavaScript code so that it can be read
and debug easily
what is node J
no chase is an open source cross
platform JavaScript runtime environment
and it runs on a web application outside
the client browser node.js is used by
the developers to build server-side web
application
notice is perfect for data intensive
application since it uses an
asynchronous event driven model
what is X Plus Js
express.js is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
cross-platform mobile apps quickly and
easily
XYZ is unopeniated
it is high performance fast lightweight
framework of node.js express.js makes
the node.js code easy as it is used as a
server-side scripting language
now we'll see how to set up node with
Express and typescript open your Visual
Studio code
new folder which I have created in this
C drive typescript
it's an empty folder I'll show you
open the terminal
I'll show you if it is empty LS
both folder is empty
now
will make a project inside it
will simply write npm
in it iPhone y
for all the default values
press enter
so you have seen
the package.json file has been installed
in this package
it is clearance
now the first thing you need to install
is typescript
type npm
PN
d
this will install the typescript
dependencies
now I will install two more dependencies
please write npm I
test elephant node
I will also install node mon
Itor
enter
this will install all the dependencies
there will be need in this project let's
clear the screen
now
now we have to install Express
npm
installed
Express
let's wait for a couple of seconds the
npm express has been created
open the package or Json file here you
see
all the dev dependencies
Express
nodemon and TS node
has been successfully installed
now we need to create a project inside
this folder for that we need to write
npx
hyphen in it
wait for a couple of seconds here we go
here the screen
now we'll execute npx
type thing
in it
so it has already been here
you can see
yeah
now we will be creating a source folder
for that
right mpdir
C
enter this would be containing all our
typescript files here
you can see it's empty
let's create a file here
Dot
everything we will going to write is
inside this file only
so your setup for typescript with
Express in node is ready
you can write anything here
the first thing you need is node.js
let's see I have created one for me you
can create it by just entering a command
make directory in the terminal
and entering your folder name it can be
ABC or something you need
and like this it will be created but I
don't need it so I'm going to delete it
and this
will open the terminal again
I'll write a command
npm
in it
what
this will create a Json file for us
like as you can see here
the Json file has been created here
let's clear the screen
now we will install express.js in this
folder for that write a command in VM
install
Express
and press enter this will install
express.js for us
you can also see here in the
dependencies
Express has been successfully installed
and all the other modules are here
so
let's clear this screen now
now we will create a server file here
let's name it app.js
here we'll write all our code
so let's create a simple Express folder
right
const
Express
require
keyword
all over
modules will be here
the
in this we are requiring express.js
now we will also be meeting
quote
processes dot EnV
y dot port number that will gonna write
here
we're using code number 3000 you can
write anything
this will be a port number now
create an app
Express function
you have created an instance for express
now we'll create
it listen to our code
let's say app Dot listen
port number it will read by its own
a data function
control
but we are gonna see about it
server
started at http
localhost
host
dollar sign
to get the data of the port
and we'll write the code it will fetch
the number of the port
here it goes
now we have created a front end of this
I repeat now we will create a front end
of this registration form so let's
create it
foreign
public
in this folder
let's create two files index
dot HTML
and
uh
second one will name as style.css
now in the index folder
we'll write all our front-end code so
open
index.html page
right dog and enter this will create a
HTML template for you
in the title
yes
we'll write
registration
form
foreign
part
will write
heading for this
H1
right heading you just
have the action will be class
heading so we can style it afterwards
building
now we'll create a form
function
okay
class will be formed
now we'll create an input types first
we'll create input type will be
text
will be the right first name
this folder
this username will become inside the
text box this first name
his name
now we'll create few more like this for
password
last name age number
let's copy this input
[Music]
first one will be first name second one
will be
last name
so we'll write the email
for this
this looks good
okay let me write that email
will write password
placeholder
will write
it will be empty so no one will see our
password this will be an empty
it's ready here
and we'll write
in the placeholder password
let's go to another one
and let's create a first name last name
email password and let's create one more
that will be a
page
for this we have to write here
number
name I guess
let's write this here
page
it is holder what we see inside the box
in the front end
all right
let's create a submit button
the button will
please submit
so we can
give it a style
see you
summary
so our form is ready
uh yeah
we'll write require here
so
one will be left empty
this will help us to
to require every field because
everything is important
we cannot
make it empty so we are writing required
so
our HTML page is ready
here let's see how it looks open this
HTML page
here
a registration form look like this
let me show you what require is doing
as you can see please fill out this
field this is what required function do
submit
is
now coming back to vs code
will write some CSS code for styling
here we will write
padding for the page
will be zero
we don't have to write percent
margin
we'll also write 0 for the overall page
now we'll go to the
body part
so the
height will be 100
pH
width will be
100 BH
this place value will be
legs
in the direction of the flex will be
bottom
right just if I content will be in
Center
alignment
items stuff
this is how we will
write a body part
coming to the
form of this page
phone
all right
everything will be a same we'll copy
this
paste it here
don't want the height of the phone this
much
it could be let's create it for me
40 percent
width will be 100 only
this place legs will be here
direction or this will be column only
justify contents
let's see in the I mean
okay
to our code
let's make it not Center
let's make it as
space
around space let's make it space between
you can style it as your own
as you want
heading
display will be in line block
this will make our
page this registration Page look
more clean
perform
okay
input
the output which will be
needed
heading we can do
then passing from this file
input is okay
now we'll go to
let's do something with the button
button
it will be
padding will be
10 from this
right
yes
so
save the color for this
oh
pretty cool
color will look like this
it's not an issue
amazing
to the summit button
uh
box
this will look cool
brown color
of the summit button will be black
and the text which is inside it will be
White
so it looks clean as a
registration form
it's done
can also
save this file go to the file
a registration form look like this isn't
it cool
let's make this a little up
The Heading fire drill
your operating for 40 percent
go to the form and see yeah it looks
good now
let's see everything is working fine
yeah
coming back to our vs code
now
so our front part is ready if there will
be any changes we'll do it later now
coming back to our backend part
of the registration form will make our
first API routes
here
that's right
dot get
on
excited
okay
request
response
the other function
let's write here the response that the
form will send
we will write the directory name
of this HTML file
it's right here
directory name
because
public
x dot HDM
let's save it
coming back to our
68 post method also here
just
bomb post
and response
will be here
request
body
here in this part it will face the data
in the body of the HTML page
now
let's create an API middleware
for that
to use
dot Json
here we are accepting the data in Json
format
this will
not use
Express
dot URL encoded
function
this is basically to decode the data
sent through HTML form
dot move again
this will Express
dot you will write static
starting function will be public folder
public
this will use the public folder for us
now
we'll save this file first
open your HTML file
and write in the form part
itions
here
will declare the file name app.js
com
class form
and we write method which will be post
here
everything looks
good it forgot to write inverted commas
here
save this file
now open the terminal
and write node
app dot Js
press enter
so our code is running fine let's open
it
yeah
everything looks fine
a back-end developer is the one who
builds an effective website architecture
who also writes code to communicate with
the database and again as mentioned
ensures data integrity and consistency
now essentially a backend developer
handles what you don't see they're in
charge of the back end of a website
which includes servers database
applications and so forth
so if you wish to become a back-end
developer you can but there are a few
skills that you need to have
so let's look at the skills that you
need to hone to become a successful
back-end developer
first up is data structures and
algorithms now you must have a good
understanding of data structures and
algorithms understanding how the data is
being stored is crucial
so Concepts like Stacks cues linked
lists sorting and search algorithms are
important
next we have programming languages and
Frameworks
one of the most critical skills of a
backend developer is the in-depth
knowledge of back-end programming
languages this includes JavaScript and
its environments like node.js and
express.js Java in particular was built
from the ground up to be run on server
side so popular JavaScript Frameworks
like spring and JSF are also important
moving ahead we have python which is the
most popularly used language now it is
flexible and easy to use so there are
Frameworks like Django and flask again
these are crucial and it's important to
have a good understanding of these
Frameworks
we also have C sharp which is a
preferred architecture for backend
programming so it includes asp.net code
and Dot net MVC now other programming
languages include PHP Pearl and Ruby and
since back-end and front-end developers
work so closely it's also helpful to
have a foundational understanding of
front-end web Technologies like HTML and
CSS
proficiency is required not only for
performing daily tasks but also for
working alongside front-end developers
to develop Solutions
so moving ahead we have Version Control
now Version Control Systems help manage
the project files and keep track of the
entire history of users things
so popular ones are get GitHub and
subversion
now git helps manage the project files
it keeps track of the entire history of
things that the user is working on right
and GitHub is a web-based service for
Version Control using git
moving ahead we have database Management
Systems
now a back-end developer writes code
that is used to perform relational
mapping to fetch data from the database
so some popularly used database
management systems are MySQL there's
postgresql SQL server and you also have
mongodb
and lastly we have web hosting platforms
now web hosting platforms allow you to
deploy your product on a cloud service
provider so it can be accessed from the
World Wide Web
now popular ones are Amazon web services
Google Cloud platform Heroku and
Microsoft azure
now of course a backend developer should
also possess non-technical skills like
problem solving critical thinking decent
communication practices and analytical
skills now they should be a debt to
working independently as well as in a
collaborative team
now that you're familiar with the skills
let's have a look at the key
responsibilities and roles of a back-end
developer
to begin with roles a back-end developer
could be assigned the following roles
back in developer Java developer full
stack developer devops engineer software
engineer and iOS Developer
and here is a list of responsibilities
first up
is to form an understanding of the
website's performance needs and goals to
develop effective and efficient
Solutions
development and management of
application programming interfaces
having a good knowledge on programming
and ensuring framework utilization
developing solutions for websites to
accept and store data securely
especially for those involved with
Payment Processing
writing testing and maintaining the
development solutions for code related
issues
effectively communicating with
developers designers and system
administrators and organization of
system logic now it's also crucial to
ensure the development of website
architecture using proper methodologies
like agile scrum and framework
and it's also important to know how to
troubleshoot and debug applications
so now that you're familiar with those
responsibilities and roles
let's have a look at the backend
developer's salary
according to Glassdoor a back-end
developer
in the United States earns around 102
000 US dollars per annum while in India
a back-end developer earns an average
salary of 7 lakhs 23 000 Indian rupees
per annum so now that you're familiar
with back-end development and know what
the roles and responsibilities are You
Must Be Wondering Where to Begin
well look no further you can head to the
official simply learn website and just
search for back-end development a number
of Articles courses and programs will
appear you can also choose the one that
suits you best you can just click on the
program and get an overview of what the
course consists of and depending on your
requirements you can opt for the course
that is most appropriate for you now in
the world of databases the most common
and well popular databases are rdbms
which is relational database Management
Systems now what if you want to develop
an application which deals with a large
volumes of data then we need to choose
one such database which always provides
a high performance data storage
solutions so that we can achieve the
performance in the solution in the terms
of data store and the retrieval with
accuracy speed and reliability now if
you categorize the database Solutions
then there are many two types of
database categories that are available
that is the first one is rdbms like
MySQL SQL server or Apple
Etc and another type is no SQL databases
like mongodb Cosmo DB Cassandra Hadoop
Etc firstly let us discuss the agenda
for today's session we'll start the
tutorial with a quick introduction to
nosql and then we'll discuss what
exactly is what is mongodb and then
we'll go through the history of mongodb
which is when it when and how it came
into existence and after that we'll
understand why we use mongodb up next
we'll discuss some key Salient features
of mongodb up next we will discuss how
exactly mongodb works and then we'll go
through some different applications of
mongodb in real life and then we'll see
which companies are using mongodb in
current days and finally we'll
understand when to use and when not to
use the mongodb
now before we understand what is mongodb
isn't it is important to learn what is
nosql now under the vast roof of Big
Data there lies a number of databases
which are used to store these massive
amounts of data that is generated
worldwide now one among them which is
attracting a huge number of interest is
the nosql database the not only SQL or
nosql database which is often referred
as with these two terms is an approach
that works towards managing data as well
as the database design which may come in
handy for huge sets of distributed data
it consists of number of Technologies
and architectures that seek a solution
to the Big Data performance issues and
scalability that cannot be addressed by
the relational databases now this
database is used when companies and
Enterprises develop a need to access and
analyze large amounts of unstructured
data or the data stored in multiple
virtual servers in the cloud now there
is no specific definition for what no
SQL is but it is a common set of
observation where we can describe that
it is not a relational model that is
unlike the traditional relational
databases which store data in the form
of tables which comprises of rows and
columns nosql database doesn't store in
that way now a nosql databases also we
have a various types of databases now
the first one is key value database that
is it is a simplest type of nosql
database and every data element in the
database is stored as a key value pair
consisting of an attribute name or key
and a value so in a sense a key value
store is like a relational database with
only two columns the key or attribute
name such as anything like state ID your
name and the values such as let's say a
country name India so that is one of a
nosql database and next we have column
based or column oriented databases now
while a relational database stores data
in rows and reads data row by row a
column source is organized as a set of
columns this means that when you want to
run analytics on a small number of
columns you can read those columns
directly without consuming memory with
The Unwanted data
and of course we have the document type
of database the concept that is focused
on in document databases the documents
that are stored and received from the
database store can be like a Json or a
Json or an XML format now these
documents are usually similar to each
other and are in a hierarchical free
data structure that are self-describing
and consists of scalar values Maps
Collections and Etc
and finally we do have graph databases
guys now a graph database focuses on the
relationship between data elements now
each data element is stored as a node
and the connections between elements are
called links or relationships in a graph
database connections of first class
elements of the database taught directly
now in relational databases linked link
links are implied using data to express
the relationship now these were some of
the mainly used nosql database guys but
in this tutorial we'll be only focusing
on the document database and which is
one of the most commonly used no SQL
databases out there and the best example
is mongodb and apart from mongodb we do
have other document databases like couch
base nosql database as well now that
we've understood what is a nosql
databases Let Us Now quickly understand
what is mongodb
mongodb is an open source document
oriented or a non-relational database
now it is different than traditional
relational databases like post to SQL
MySQL or SQL Server because it stores
the data in json-like documents instead
of tables and it is primarily is used to
store large volumes of data in the form
of documents
now traditional relational databases
stored data using tables and rows right
mongodb on the other hand is a
non-relational database which has
collections instead of tables now
documents are stored inside the
collections in where rows are
stored in tables in traditional
relational databases now with mongodb
the biggest Advantage is the structure
and scheme of your data is flexible and
not enforced by a predefined table
definition unlike relational databases
where you have to specify the schema
that is the structure of the table the
attributes and the values in it now
documents can vary greatly in size and
shape within the same collection whereas
tables are more rigidly defined in a
relational database so when you are
using mongodb it represents hierarchy
relationship in a single record instead
of joining multiple tables so that is
the main difference between a relational
database and a non-relational database
and mongodb being a nosql database
follows the a document data model which
is a collection of complex documents
which arbitrary nested data formats and
varying records formats now because
mongodb does not store data in a
structured table format you cannot query
it using SQL instead mongodb uses a more
flexible and a dynamic query language
called specific carries which is
based on JavaScript which we'll be
discussing in a certain way
all right I hope you understood what is
mongodb let us now go to the history of
mongodb guys now it is also important
that when and how mongodbs came into
existence even though we have several
relational databases in the market
now mongodb was first introduced in 2007
tangent software company began
developing mongodb in 2007 as a
component of a planned platform as a
service product so from 2000 to 7 to
2008 it was developed and it was working
as a platform as a service product
now in 2009 the company shifted to an
open source development model with the
company offering commercial support and
other services so from 2009 since it
became an open source the users can
directly download it from the internet
in 2013 tangent changed its name to
mongodb Inc and it is working under the
same Banner on October 20 2017 mongodb
became a publicly listed traded company
on NASDAQ as amdb with an IPO price of
24 dollars per share now mongodb is a
global company with U.S headquarters in
New York City and international
headquarters in Dublin and has more than
110 million download and regular users
in the current times and the latest
version of it was released in 2022 which
is 6.0
let us now understand why mongodb is
used guys now since mongodb is a nosql
database we need to understand when and
why we need to use it in real life as
well now since a normal circumstances
mongodb always preferred by the
developers when our main concern is to
deal with larger huge volumes of data
with a high performance so if you want
to insert thousands of thousands of
Records in a second then mongodb is the
best choice for that now also one of the
main reason is to overcome the
limitation of relational databases or
like the structured query language guys
where the language is only used for
certain
databases offer limited records right so
in order to overcome that we use mongodb
since it is a robust and highly scalable
and it is also powerful way of storing
data in comparison to traditional
databases
now it is also highly flexible which
allows you to store and work on
different data types in one document
whereas in relational database you store
data in tables and you have to maintain
a proper schema for that so you need to
join multiple tables if you want to
retrieve certain amounts of data and
mongodb also provides a lot of security
and it is also considered as a powerful
query language as well
now as discussed earlier mongodb allows
the user with flexible schema that means
it allows you to meet the ever-changing
conditions characteristics of Big Data
applications if you are working on
massive amounts of data on a regular
basis and also it gives you high
performance with its incredible features
like on-demand scaling real-time
resources which will guarantee the user
high performance of the applications let
us now discuss some of the key features
of mongodb now the first one is
aggregation now you might have heard
about aggregation in SQL as well now
data records are processed by
aggregation which is grouping of data
which then produces the competed results
or into a single result now in simple
words aggregation operations group
values from multiple documents in
mongodb database together and can
perform a variety of operations on the
grouped data to return a single result I
said earlier it is similar to that of
SQL Group by Clause where we use
aggregation functions like average sum
minimum Max and and others next we have
the grid FS now grid FS is a
specification for storing and retrieving
files that exceed the based on document
size limit of 16 MB now instead of
storing a file in a single document grid
FS divides a file into parts or which is
called as chunks and stores each of
those chunks as a separate document Now
by default grid FS limits trans size to
255 KV now it uses two collections to
store files so it is also another
important feature of mongodb now next we
have sharding now in mongodb uh it uses
sharding and replication which are
another key factors sharding allows
partitioning of data across multiple
servers using the shared key and the
technique of synchronizing all these
organized data across many servers to
offer redundancy is known as replication
now next we have document oriented as we
all know that mongodb is a document
oriented type of a database there are
different documents to store different
types of data and each document has a
unique system generated key the
application I think we have already
discussed and also our mongodb is a
schema-less database that is it stores
data in collections with no enforced
schema so in other words incoming data
can have a predefined structure and it
can alert to it however different
documents in the same collection can
have different structures if required
indexing is also another key feature of
mongodb which is one of the most
important options to improve the search
query performance now as a result we
should index the fields that fit our
search criteria like without indexing
mongodb it has to scan every document of
the collection to get the required
result that matches the query statement
right so in order to eliminate that we
need to provide indexing for a faster
query retrieval
next we have Adder queries now in most
cases while designing a database schema
we don't know what queries we'll run
ahead of time right so when we design
our database we may not be knowing uh
the query types of the data that we
process into our database so ad hoc
query is the query not known while
structuring the data or you can say that
other queries are short-lived queries
whose value depends on variables so
mongodb supports these types of queries
and can buy also updated in real time
and finally high performance performance
means writing speed performance of
mongodb is far greater than any other
relational database like MySQL those
were some of the key features of mongodb
so let us now understand how exactly
mongodb Works guys mongodb stores data
objects in collections and documents
instead of the traditional tables and
rows which is used in our relational
databases now collections comprise sets
of documents which are equivalent to
tables and relational database now
documents consist of a key value pair
which are basic unit of data in mongodb
now the structure of a document can be
changed by simply adding a new fields or
deleting existing ones now documents can
define a primary key as a unique
identifier and values can be a variety
of data types including the other
documents and the array of documents so
it is basically uh works on a JavaScript
query which is Json
and it is for further classified into
base one which is a binary encoded
object notation so if you look at the
picture in this we have basically a host
which uh
ultimately has a server which stores the
data and further we have databases
wherein we have different Collections
and in collections we have documents so
the data is stored in this documents
which is further presented into the
collections and are saved into databases
so this is roughly how exactly mongodb
works let us now discuss some
applications of mongodb in real life as
well guys now one of the main
application is iot or Internet of things
which is one of the most appreciated
technology Innovations in the world
today connecting billions of devices
globally now with iot companies improve
productivity redefine their models and
leverage operational efficiency so
mongodb helps to maximize this full
potential of iot devices its intelligent
data platform which speeds up the
operation and delivery of iot devices it
is also extensively used in mobile
applications because with the data that
is being generated like for example in
social media in Internet we need mongodb
to handle such amounts of our data right
so it is also used in real time analysis
now with rdbms databases analytics and
transactional databases were usually
separate and data from the transactional
database would have to be moved to
analytics and one environment which
requires an immense daily data load now
with nosql databases like mongodb
companies can now analyze data in real
time while saving cost for example if
you take stock market we have tons or
trillions amounts of data has been
generated every day so again in sports
as well which is a real-time data
analysis to get the Insight we need the
data in a quick and faster manner so in
that case we can use mongodb as well
mongodb is also perfect for catalog
management content management as well as
product data management guys it enables
product data or the content related
information to be managed and processed
in a single Central system this allows
for detailed cost and analysis increase
productivity gain new insights and
improve collaboration with the companies
as well so one of the best example if I
take is the other card guys it is a real
world mongodb use case where other is a
India's unique identification project
and world's most extensive biometric
database system now we know that it was
I think it was launched into early 2010s
and it has collected demographic and
biometric information of over 1.5
billion people in India so other mostly
relies on mongodb among other databases
like hbase MySQL Hadoop which basically
runs on massive amounts of data which
process huge amount of data in a real
time
so mongodb was one of the database
systems for purchased to power the
search strategy of other card all right
let us now discuss some of the companies
which are using mongodb in real life uh
guys so companies like Google Facebook
Bosch eBay are some of the companies
which have extensively used mongodb
nowadays and apart from that we have
other companies like you know Toyota
Cisco Adobe essay Verizon and other
service and product based companies use
mongodb on a regular basis now apart
from this we have Shutterfly we have
MetLife we even have Forbes which use
mongodb on a regular basis
and that brings us to the end of today's
session guys now before we uh wrap up
the session it is also important that
you need to understand when you should
be using mongodb and when you shouldn't
now although mongodb is a great database
out there there are times you shouldn't
and you should use in certain uh
circumstances now mongodb works
extensively well with unstructured data
so it's great for uh big data analytic
systems so if you're working on huge
chunks of data which needs in a
real-time processing immediately then
you can use mongodb mongodb is also used
for cloud computing like Microsoft Azure
AWS which is an ideal cloud computing
platform uh for mongodb because
cloud-based storage needs to easily
distribute data across multiple servers
and which basically suits mongodbs
nature
now if you do not have any database
administrator in that case you you might
as well use mongodb as well now wherein
you have lots of unstructured data to
process and which has no storable data
type limits so in that case you can use
mongodb and finally if you have schema
issues that is if you have an unstable
or undefined schema you can use mongodb
which is not with the case of
traditional database which requires a
predefined schema before you start
working on the data now since it's
already installed on my system uh the
installation process will be different
but you just need to follow the steps
there and finally install it so once
you're done with the installation you
can go to your C drive and here you can
click on program files and you can see
that mongodb is installed and inside of
it you have the server folder and then
you have the 4.4 folder and then you
have the bin folder right so here you
have the application that is your
and the mongod applications both are
executable files now the mongod file or
the application is the daemin process
now this is the background process that
makes sure you retrieve the data from
the database access the data so it does
all the background tasks so after the
installation now you need to create a
path to this file by doing this you
don't have to always go to the bin
folder and then execute the file you can
directly execute the file on your
command prompt right so for that let's
just
go to our environment variables
but before that let's just uh
copy this path
right
and here under the user variable section
click on path and say edit
and go ahead and just paste it right
I've already pasted mine so just go
ahead and paste it and click on OK
and
all right
say okay
right so now you've created the path
successfully now let's head to our
Command Prompt and run the file so
here you can just directly type
since the path's already been created so
just go ahead and say
[Music]
and here you can see that your
server has been generated
and with this you know that you're in
mongodb has been successfully installed
and your server is up and running right
so just for confirmation let's see if
there are any databases and how much
space they've occupied so you can right
now just type show DBS
[Music]
and when you click on it it says admin
config and localhost and all of it is
zero so with that you have successfully
installed mongodb on your system and
it's up and running
all right now in contrast to structured
query language or SQL databases which is
a relational database model where the
structure of the database and its tables
have been defined mongodb does not have
or required the definition of a database
or a table structure instead we use data
models in order to store the documents
in our database let us now first discuss
the agenda for today's session we'll
start the tutorial by understanding what
is data modeling and then we'll
understand why we use data modeling
after that we'll be going through how
data modeling actually works in mongodb
and next we'll understand different
types of data models in mongodb up next
we'll discuss types of relationships and
data models and then we'll see some
methods to create these data models and
finally we'll understand when to use
these data models as per our requirement
so without any further delay let's get
started with today's topic all right so
what is data modeling in mongodb now
basically data modeling is a process of
taking unstructured data that is
generated from The Real World scenario
and introducing it to the data server
and then structuring it into a logical
data model in our database so it is
basically a process of determining how
data is stored and what connection
exists between various entities in a
relationship now you don't have to
create a schema before inserting data
because nosql is flexible this is so
that mongodb can support a dynamic
database schema that makes it
unnecessary to create your schema in
advance instead you can now store your
information and make changes in
accordance with your data now consider
data modeling in mongodb as a
relationship now there is no particular
relationship just like a SQL where we
use Now mongodb relationships are the
representations of how multiple
documents are logically connected to
each other in mongodb now since mongodb
is a document database any document
within the same collection is not
mandatory to have same set of fields or
structure you can store different types
in a collections given field and can
even add new Fields update fields and
delete existing Fields as well now for
example consider an online shopping
store where we have like thousands of
customers arriving daily and purchasing
new products from the website now we get
a lot of unstructured data that is the
name of the customer the details and all
which is basically an unstructured data
now in order to convert into a proper
structured data we need to model them
into a particular way which this is
where data modeling comes into a picture
where we store the data based upon our
requirement now the main challenge in
data modeling is balancing the
application needs guys now the database
engines performance characteristics and
also the data retrieving patterns
all right let us now move ahead and
understand why we use data modeling
now data model basically helps us to
create a simplified and optimized
logical database that eliminates
redundancy red is a storage requirements
and enables efficient retrieval from the
database now data modeling may appear to
be a complex process wherein you have to
make adjustments to your database unlike
SQL value predefine your schema and
create a new table and then store the
data now while in mongodb data modeling
helps us to analyze and understand what
type of data and how much data has to be
inserted into a database data modeling
is necessary foundational work that
allows data to be stored more easily in
the database and has a positive positive
impact on data analytics as well now let
us understand why exactly we use now
data modeling now data quality is
Paramount for any organization and to
ensure that we need higher data quality
when we are storing unstructured data in
large amounts now the representation of
requirements and the business rules
enables to anticipate what could lead to
a large-scale data corruption before it
occurs so data model enables the
developers in hindsight to Define rules
that monitor the data quality and
ensuring that there is no possibility of
errors
now it is also important to understand
how the data is Flowing within the
database and the characteristics of that
creating data models forces the business
to Define how data is generated and move
across the application development and
maintenance data modeling exposes errors
and inconsistencies early in the process
making is it making it easier and less
expensive to fix so in order to maintain
a database that is a mongodb database
which is basically a unstructured one it
is important that we try to develop and
maintain it in a regular basis
and finally performance is another
reason why we use data modeling now an
organized database is one that is more
efficiently operated and data modeling
prevents the schema from endless
searching and returns results more
quickly those were some of the reasons
on why we use data modeling is
all right let us now move and discuss
how data modeling Works in mongodb
now unlike SQL databases where you must
determine and declare a table schema
before inserting data or perform any
operations we need to basically provide
a schema for that now mongodb's
collection by default do not require the
documents to have the same schema now
the documents in a single collection do
not need to have the same set of fields
and the data type of for a field can
differ across documents within a
collection now to change the structure
of the document in a collection such as
adding a new field or removing the
existing field in a document or changing
a field values to a new type or update
the documents to the new structure
now basically the first step is to
basically create and design a schema as
per the requirement and the application
made by the user and then we have to
combine documents now if there is no
scope for multiple documents uh to store
into a single one and ensure that if
there is no other need for a single
document to store in a multiple document
in such way we need to understand what
is our requirement and combine the
documents accordingly so that we can
have performance as well as the
optimization of the database is also
improved now this flexibility
facilitates the mapping of documents to
an entity or an object now each document
can match the data field of a
represented ID entity even if the
document has substantial variation from
other documents in the collection so
this is how basically a data model Works
wherein you have to choose as per the
requirement and understand what type of
documents that are being inserted into
the database
all right let us now understand some
data models that are used in mongodb now
once you've understood the business
requirement and the application on how
it should be as you start modeling your
data you will likely go through various
steps of data analysis now each step
might produce different types of data
models therefore ensuring data models
having the right one can be generally
thought of as being one of the main
aspect of choosing a data model and they
are conceptualized into three categories
based on the level of the detail and the
specificity now that's classified into
three types the first one is conceptual
data model the conceptual data model
explains what the system should contain
with regard to and how it is related
this model is usually built with the
help of the user and the stakeholders it
represents the applications business
logic and is often used as the basis for
one or more following model
next we have the logical data model Now
The Logical data model will describe how
the data will be structured in this
model the relationship between the
entities is established at a high level
you'll also list the attributes for the
entities represented in this model
and finally we have the physical data
model guys the physical data model
represents how the data will be stored
in a specific database now in this case
we have mongodb model where we are using
establishing a primary and a secondary
relationship between the data in a
document that is stored in the database
such as mongodb you will also establish
the data types for each of your fields
that are mentioned this will provide you
with your database schema as well
foreign
mongodb has a flexible schema you will
need to uh data model or schema design a
good data model means that you'll
establish a strong foundation for an
Ever evolving data model now mongodb
supports multiple ways to model
relationship between the entities in a
data model now the first one is one to
one that is in this type one value is
associated with only one document that
is it will have a single relationship
between the two connected objects or
entities in the database next we have
one to many here one value can be
associated with more than one document
or value at the same time and finally we
have many too many now when two or more
entities within a document can have
multiple relationship that is basically
is many to many relationships in this
type of model multiple documents can be
associated with each other so let us now
quickly understand with an example now
consider the example for one to one
relationship where I have a student
table and contact info table now for
each student ID there is a unique
details or the contact info so it is
basically pointing one value to another
that is student ID which is one to one
relation and similarly we have one too
many relation wherein we have customer
table and Order stable now every
customer has a different ID and a
customer can place multiple orders so it
can generate multiple order IDs so we
have three different IDs like b204 b391
b448 so this is what is one two mini
which is basically one entity is being
pointed to three other values I hope you
understood one to one and one to many so
if you understood this let us know in
the comment section below what will be a
good example of many to many
relationship
all right moving ahead let us now
discuss the types of methods to create
the data models now once we are
confirmed with what data model we need
and the relationship that we have chosen
for uh for our documents to store the
data we need a method that is to create
a data model now that is where we have
two different data models that stores
the data in documents that is first one
is embedded data model so in emitted
data model you can embed data in a
single document or structure in mongodb
it is also referred to as the normalized
data model it leverages the full
potential of mongodbs Rich document and
it uses a one to one or one-to-many
relationship guys
next we have the reference data model or
in other words it is known as normalized
data model now they are used to build
one too many as well as many to many
relationship models now while working
with the embedded document models there
will be times when you have to repeat
the data this is where reference data
model comes into picture which basically
tackles their data redundancy
so I know it is bit of confusing so
let's just understand this with an
example here now if you consider the
embedded model if you look at a document
which I have taken here which is the
details of a student named Rohan where
we have a collection uh that is
containing a document has Rohan in this
document we have embedded a document
here that is contact details and his
grade
so embedding uh data model stores
relevant details in the same documents
or the same database record this way you
can minimize queries and update required
to perform common database operation on
the other hand we have a reference data
model or the normalized data model
so if you look at to the reference model
example here we have basically split our
single document into three documents and
since contact details and grade have the
ID from the document that is of rohans
you can call them whenever needed now
normalized data model splits the data
into multiple collections by using
references between the newer collections
you can update or change a single
document which will update other
collections automatically this is an
efficient way of updating data and is
mostly used when your data goes through
frequent changes that is if you're
working on a data that has to be
leveraged or changed on a daily basis
you can consider reference model
that is which is basically one of the
biggest advantages of using normalized
data where you have to model large data
sets that follow a certain hierarchy and
you have to where you have to represent
multiple many-to-many relationships so
that is where we use a embedded model
and reference model is a nosql database
program that controls document oriented
data instead of a relational data made
the original data model which comprises
of rows and columns now the speed of
mongodb is one of its characteristics as
it handles a huge chunks of unstructured
data so in order to perform a certain
operation mongodb may use operators to
carry out particular tasks in order to
return queries more quickly and
efficiently so in today's session we'll
be taking you through all about the
mongodb operators what are they the
different types of mongodb operators
that I use its functions with the help
of some examples so without any further
Ado let's get started
so what is mongodb operators operators
are basically special symbols or
keywords that tell a compiler what
mathematical or logical operations to
perform the operator improves mongodb
functionality by enabling the developers
and programmers to construct
sophisticated queries to communicate
with data sets that are appropriate for
their application and perform certain
complex tasks to retrieve the data now
in general we use the find command or
method to fetch the data from
collections using the query operator
also we need to use the prefix which is
the dollar sign before the query
operator so let us just quickly
understand the syntax of the operators
in mongodb the syntax is followed as DB
dot name of collection dot find and
within the parenthesis
we have to mention the field name and
mention the semicolon and then we have
to mention the dollar symbol with the
help of the operator that we want to use
mention the value and finally we use the
pretty uh method so let's just quickly
uh go through all this uh
terminology so that will have a better
idea now the name of the collection is
basically according to the query
operator we used in our query this
parameter is defined as the collection
name from which documents have been
retrieved next we have the find method
now data can be retrieved from
collections using this technique we can
also retrieve particular documents from
mongodb by using the find method with a
query operator next we have this field
name according the query parameter we
used in our query this parameter is
defined as the name of the field from
which we are retrieving data that is
what we are trying to uh retrieve data
from our collection is basically the
field name next we have the query
operator name which must be used to
retrieve the documents from The
Collection accordance with the query
operations next we have to mention the
value the value is nothing more than the
field value that we used with a query
operator to conduct logical or any
mathematical operations and so on and
finally we have an option well uh tag
which is pretty now since mongodb output
is generally is in an unstructured
format so we can display our output
using this technique in a structure
format and this is also optional guys so
if there is a requirement to show the
data in a proper structure where you can
use the pretty uh statement so that was
all about mongodb operators guys so let
us just move ahead so let us now
understand the different types of
operators in mongodb now just like any
operators in other programming languages
mongodb operators are used to perform
specific relational mathematical or
logical operations and produce this
final result operators in mongodb are
you know broadly classified into three
types the first one is query and
projection operator next we have update
operator and then finally we have
aggregation pipeline operator
now in mongodb the default for queries
is to return all the fields in the
matching documents so basically a query
and a projection operator is used to
perform certain calculation wherein a
projection query is used to specify or
restrict the data result returned in
query result Now by specifying a
projection query you can specify the
fields you want to return or exclude now
similarly we have other query operators
which we'll be discussing in a while
which are used to perform certain a
complex calculation on the data that you
are retrieving from the documents next
we have the update operator which
basically updates the value of all the
fields of the documents which is
matching the specified condition and
finally we have the aggregation pipeline
so it basically provides a competent
results as a result of processing the
data requires an document so it is
similar to that of aggregate functions
in SQL wherein it you know Aggregates
all the values within a document and
perform certain aggregation uh operation
like you know some Maximum minimum and
so on so these are some of the main uh
different types of operators in mongodb
so let us now just uh get into detail
and how that further classified into
various types now query and projection
operator further classified into various
other types such as comparison operator
logical operator array operator element
Operator bitwise Operator evaluation
operator and finally we have geospatial
operator now it is time taking to get
into all of this stuff and explain each
and every operator guys so let us just
focus on the main operators that are
frequently used in mongodb
so firstly let us discuss about the
comparison operator guys now the
comparison operators are basically used
to compare two expressions and retrieve
data from the documents that is the
documents that are that we have stored
uh that is the all the data from the
collections which are basically the
group of collections is basically a
document in mongodb that is stored in
the mongodb database now we have several
such comparison operators in mongodb now
as explained earlier we have to use the
dollar sign with the help of operator
that we have been uh mentioning so
basically The Operators are take the
dollar sign and then we have to mention
the operator that we have taken so let
us just discuss some of the operators
here the first one is EQ which is
basically the equal operator which
matches values that are equal to the
values specified in the query next we
have dollar any which has a full form of
not equal to which is opposite of equal
and matches all the values that are not
equal to the value specified in query
next we have GT and GT which is
basically greater than and greater than
equals to this operator basically
matches the value that are greater than
the value specified in the query or that
are even greater than or equal to the
various value specified in the query
next we have the LT or LTE that is less
than or less than equals to again as the
uh it the word course it is similar
again it matches the values that are
less than the values specified in the
query or it matches with the less than
or equal values specified in the query
in the document and finally we have the
in and nin which basically matches any
of the value that is existing or not
existing in an array specified indicator
I know it is a bit of confusing so let
us just uh understand this with an
example here so consider this example on
your right hand side where you can see
this image which is basically a format
of a document that is stored in a
mongodb database guys so let us say I
have uh you know a collection named
orders of let's say a stationary item
database now I have further different
three different documents that are
present in
uh this collection so basically a group
of documents is basically a collection
in a mongodb database so I hope you've
understood uh what is a collection
document and what is a database so if
you want to know more about it we have a
dedicated video on what is Momo DB where
we've uh explained clearly on all these
terms and how it exactly Works make sure
you check that out uh which will be
quite helpful and I would highly
recommend so as you can see we have
basically three documents here we have a
ID of three different uh people who have
purchased certain products from a
stationary and have different IDs so we
have three customers here Rahul prenup
and kirti now if I say if I want to
perform comparison operation for this uh
let us just understand how equal and not
equal operation performs so basically uh
I'm taking an example here which says
dp.orders DOT fine where payment mode is
equals to card so basically uh the
compiler finds all the documents that is
present in this college action where the
payment mode is made through card which
instead of cash so basically we have
here uh the details of two customers who
have used their payment models card
which is customer Rahul and customer
kirti so in this way it will return
these two uh following documents and
similarly we have any which is not equal
to and I'm taking another example which
is DB dot orders fine order total is not
equals to 600. now as you can see in the
image we have the third document of
customer care whose order total is 600
right so it basically evaluates this and
Returns the result which has an order
total which is not equals to 600 that is
basically the first two documents that
is it will retrieve the data from this
document of the first uh you know two
documents which is of customer Rahul and
customer pranav whose order total is
basically 2450 and 5800 respectively so
that is basically what is a comparison
operator using EQ and any which is equal
to a not equals tool all right moving
ahead let us now discuss what is GT and
GTA which basically derived as greater
than and greater than equals to again
let us consider the same uh you know
collection same example that we have
taken earlier now the first query is
basically for GT that is DP Dodge order
file order total is greater than three
thousand all right so we are basically
performing a search query wherein we
want only uh those documents whose order
total is greater than three thousand now
if you look at the image we have only uh
I guess one document which is of
customer pranav whose order total is
5800 which is more than 3000 and
similarly we have for greater than
equals to which is DB dot orders fine
order total GTE
uh two thousand four fifty so basically
we should retrieve the document whose
order total is more than 250. again we
have two documents here right now we
have a document of customer Rahul and
the customer pranav whose order total is
2450 which is equals to 2450 for that we
have mentioned in our query so basically
uh the details of the documents of
customer Rahul and customer pranav whose
order total is greater than or equals to
24 500. all right moving ahead let us
now understand what is LT and LT which
is a negation or complete opposite is
greater than greater uh than equals to
now in less than we have taken an
example which is again order total Which
is less than 2000 uh so I guess we have
only one record again here of customer
whose order total is 600 and similarly
less than or equals to 500 now I guess
we have only one document again of kirti
which is order total is 600. oh I'm
sorry are less than or equals to 500
right so we don't have any uh you know
document of the customers Which is less
than or equal to 500 guys sorry uh just
a pardon me for my mistake item check so
we don't have any customers whose order
total is less than or equals to 500 so
it will basically uh you know retrieve a
null value
so that were some examples of comparison
Operator Let us move ahead with logical
operators now so basically logical
operators return data based on the
expression that evaluate the following
condition to either be true or false now
in general we have four different types
of logical operators in mongodb which is
and or not and not which is again
similar uh with any other programming
languages where we use a logical
operator and similar to that of SQL as
well now the basically the and operator
returns all the documents that match the
condition of both the expression
specified and or operator returns all
documents that match the condition of
either expression specified next we have
the nor operator which returns all
documents that do not match the
condition of either expression this is
basically an opposite of or operator and
finally we have the not operator which
basically returns documents that does
not match with the query expression in a
document so again let us just understand
with an example by considering the same
example which is the order collection
now for Forex first example I am taking
and operator which says DB dot orders
fine and address city is either daily or
payment mode is cash now if I look into
the uh collection here I have only one
such document where City address city is
Delhi and payment mode is cash that is
the details of customer pranav so it
will retrieve only the document of
pranav here next if I consider the r
operator which is DB dot orders fine or
CT Jaipur or order total is less than or
equals 200 so we have Jaipur uh City
whose uh I think it's of customer
yeah it's of customer Rahul so it will
retrieve that one and it will also
retrieve those documents whose order
total is less than or equals two
thousand now we have only one document
of K3 whose order total is 600 which is
again less than or equals to 100 so
basically the first document and the
third document will be retrieved in our
query in a final resultant set and
finally we have the nor operator which
says this city is either is not either
daily or payment mode is cache now other
than City Delhi and the payment mode
cache that is we have a pranav whose
payment mode is cash and also belongs to
Siri so basically it will remove the
document of this person customer
and it will fetch the first and third
documents that is uh the I the customer
rahul's and the customer kirti
so those were some of the uh logical
operator examples we have used I hope
you've understood
so moving ahead let us now discuss some
element operators guys the element query
operators are basically used to locate
document I know based uh on the fields
of the document
now what that I mean is so basically
every document has a field right now for
example let's say in the previous
example I've taken ID customer name
order total and so on and so which is
basically a field I know these field
have further values or elements to its
name right so the element operator
basically uh finds all the documents
based on the fields of the document that
you are trying to search for now we have
basically two uh element operator which
is exists and types exist operator
basically returns documents that have a
specific field now if I let let us take
an example let's say I have an uh you
know collection employees and I want to
find the employee age as a field I want
to find if there is a field called
employees and his age is greater than or
equals to 35 so I have taken this
example which is DB dot employees fine
employee age exists true gt35 so if
there is any field in our collection of
employees and this greater than 25 or
greater than 35 it will retrieve those
documents and similarly we have the type
document type operator which returns
document is field is of only a specific
type specified type now if I take an
example here let's say if I'm trying to
find a field uh employee age again and
it is of double uh in double integer
type so if I want the particular you
know field data type I can use the type
operator here so this was that was all
about element operator guys and let us
move ahead and finally discuss one of
the main us operator that is array
operators array operators in mongodb are
basically used to query documents that
include a field of arrays now we
basically again have three different
types of operators used in mongodb
the first one is all operator it returns
documents from a collection if it
matches all the values in the specified
array next we have this size operator it
returns documents from The Collection to
match an array with a provided number of
elements in it next and finally we have
LM match which returns those documents
that match specified condition within
each array element now I hope I know it
is bit of confusing so let us just move
ahead and understand with an example
here consider the same uh example again
where we have three documents here now
for first example I have taken the all
operator which is an array operator so
what I'm trying to find is I am trying
to find a element of value which has you
know a notebook and a paper so the query
is followed as DB dot order dot find
orders item all notebook and paper so if
you look into the image I think we have
only uh two documents where we have this
fields are having notebook and a paper
that is the first customer and second
customer if you look into the item name
you have notebook and paper in the first
uh document and second document also we
have item name notebook and paper so it
will retrieve these two documents and
next we have this size so the size
basically retrieve the number of array
elements that you want in your resultant
set now the queries forward as DB dot
order DOT fine where order items is of
size 4. now if you look into three all
the three documents that are present
here we have only one such document
where it has four elements now if you
look at the first document of customer
Rahul order items we have four different
uh you know fields that is he has placed
an order on Notebook play Paper General
and postcard now in contrast if you look
at to the other two uh
documents where we have only notebook
paper and postcard for pranav and we
have only notebook and postcard for
kirti so which is against uh which does
not satisfy the size operator so it
basically retrieves only the first one
which has four elements or Fields so I
think that was all about the array
operators guys I hope you uh understood
about all the query and projection
operators and its different types now
again we have uh several many operators
like geospatiel uh comment operator and
so many but which are not that
significant in its usage but anyways if
you want us to cover uh in our further
tutorials let us know wherein will try
to cover a more uh you know detailed
version of it with a hands-on experience
with the mongodb database as well
and finally let us discuss uh what is
upgrade operator guys and basically
mongodb offers a variety of field update
operators to update the values of the
fields and documents matching the
specified condition so it is basically
similar to that of your DML command
which is an update command which is used
to used to update the values in the
columns now similarly in mongodb there
might be a possibility that you have to
update some values and that is where we
have the update field operators now
there are again various such of update
operators so let us just go in through
one by one we have first one as current
date which is used to set the value of a
field to current date either a date or a
timestamp next we have Inc which is
basically increment it is used to
increment the value of the field by the
specified amount next we have the Min
and Max which is used to update the
field if the specified value is less
than the existing field value or it is
greater than the existing field value
next we have the mul which is uh a full
form of multiply it is used to multiply
the value of the field by the specified
amount and finally we have the rename as
a name suggests this operator is used to
rename a field within a document
so that was all about the operators in
mongodb guys I think we have got most
almost all the important operators that
are used frequently on a general basis I
think these are quite enough for you to
perform all the complex operation that
you undertake or to retrieve certain uh
you know documents or values in your
database now projection in TV is a
special type of feature guys that is
used to select only a certain part of
the data without selecting the entire
data present inside the document so more
on that soon but before we get started
uh let's discuss the agenda for today's
session
what are the tutorial by understanding
what is moreover DB projection and then
we will understand why we use projection
in mod and after that we'll have a how
projection Works in mongodb done its
syntax usage and next we'll discuss
projection queries with the help of
certain examples and finally we'll
execute those examples in mongodb server
I hope I made myself clear with the
agenda alert what is mongodb projection
now mongodb projection helps to return
the specific fields from the query or
you can say from The mongodb Collection
Now by this collections
documents
so as you you know mongodb is a schema
LS database which is a nosql database
and has a different structure to that of
relational database now the tables in
relational database are called as
collection rows are called columns and
instead we may not want all the records
from the collection but a few of them in
the resultant set so in that case we use
mongodb projection using projection
document which is used to limit the
amount or fields in the data present in
that document so in a nutshell if I
would say rejection means selecting only
then
necessary data
other than select
in the whole of the data present in the
document now similarly after that of
where conditional Clause that we use in
SQL because if I have a document which
has 10 fields and you need to solution
and why we use a popular nosql and open
source document oriented database which
allows for highly scalable and flexible
document structure which is faster than
relational database because of its
efficient storage and indexing
techniques and being a nosql database it
is designed to handle large amounts of
data so DB will process a lot of
unnecessary data and you want when you
want to retrieve specific information
from a large number of Records so to
overcome this problem we use projection
query now some of the reasons Now when
using projection to remove unused or any
sales the military server will have to
fetch each document into its memory and
then filter the results to return uh
actually reduce the memory usage but can
save the significant network band for
query results depending on the data
model and the fields projected in your
documents and it only returns indexed
query results without fetching the full
documents now which is basically the
main use case of projection which
basically eliminates all the fields that
are unnecessary for the user and
particular Fields within the document
then he can use the production area
operator
and finally data without the overall
database is performance now
by default is return all fields and
matching documents so if you need all
the details it's returning
full documents is going to be more
efficient having a server manipulate the
result projection however then to
recruit performance and that is one of
the main uh consideration when we are
using mongodb projection so these are
some of the reasons on why we use
mongodb projection
all right let us now understand how
mongodb projection works now in general
to retrieve the data from the uh
documents we use the find method uh
which retrieves data from all the fields
within a document without any filtering
so let us now understand the syntax of
mongodb projection operator now the
syntax is followed as DB dot collection
name DOT fine and within the path this
is mention the field names that is I'm
taking your field one and its
corresponding value field 2 and value 2.
now
the values that I'm talking about is if
field value is as 1 which is a Boolean
expression uh which is equals to us it
will basically show the data in that
field field value is if the Boolean
expected hides the data in the field so
let us understand this with an example
guys I the only then you will get a
clear understanding of it now I have
let's say a collection of uh certain
documents let's say the collection name
is orders and I have three such
documents here which has various Fields
like ID customer address payment mode
email order total and Order items now if
I want to display all these documents uh
what I'll do I'll basically write a
query using the find method which is
followed as DB dot orders DOT fine so it
will basically retrieve all the
documents without restricting any of the
fields that are present in our
collection
now let's say if I want only particular
CL that I want to display in my
resultant set now let's say if I have uh
the payment mode and the order total
sealed and I want only them to display
in the resultant set without displaying
all the fields that are present in each
of the document so in that case I'll
write a query as DB dot orders DOT fine
and inside the parenthesis I'll mention
payment mode colon 1 and order total is
one now since I've set the field value
to 1 it will only retrieve those values
and similarly for order total also it
will retrieve only that particular field
value so this will basically be the
output of our resultant set that is it
will show the ID object the payment mode
of the three documents and similarly the
order total of the three documents Now
by default we have the underscore ID
which is a default value which we cannot
change it so if if at all if you want to
override and change it you can mention
it to 0 now let's say uh I'm taking the
same example here now instead of just
writing payment mode to one and order
total to one I'm adding another uh you
know constraint or I'm using I'm
projecting another field which is of ID
and I'm setting it to zero now if you've
seen a result and set we do not have the
ID field so in this way you can use
projection in order to restrict certain
fields from your resultant table set
without actually retrieving all the data
that is present in your documents so let
us now jump into shell and execute
this example and see how it is working
so as you can see uh shell has
been started now I don't want to get
into the details of all of it I will
cover uh in a separate tutorial where
we'll understand how to create a
database and how to create a collection
in mongodb separately guys stay tuned to
the channel for that so we'll just cover
uh how we'll Implement mongodb uh
projection with certain examples here
now the basically uh in order to
retrieve the databases that are present
in our mongodb we have to use
recommendous show DBS so it will list
out all the databases that are present
we have admin config local and simply
code one now I have already created uh
the simply code one and hindsight before
itself so that they can save a bit of
time and have already created a
collection in that so before you see the
collection and the documents that are
present in it you have to use uh the
simply code database so for that we'll
use the simply code one as our Command
so as you can see it is saying that
switch to DB simply code now if you want
to find all collection that are present
in database you have to uh basically
write as
social collections so it will list out
all the collections in that now as you
can see I have a collection that is of
employee here so for example I will
consider this same collection now I have
this below collection named as employee
with let's say certain number of
documents in that now if I query the
collection in the shell if I write
a command to it to return all the
documents or fields from the matching
documents by default it will basically
it will return all your documents so for
that I will use a statement like
pictures of DB
dot mention the collection name that is
employee dot find so file method is used
to list out all the documents so you can
just see that we have a lot of documents
in our resultant Set uh let me just
scroll and go to the top so as you can
see we have different documents a number
of documents and it has different fields
like ID employee ID first name last name
email phone number hiring date job ID
salary manager ID Department ID and so
on so you can see we have a lot of
documents so let's just count how many
documents we have for that you can use
the count statement
so
DB dot employee dot count so you can see
we have a total of 50 documents present
in our employee collection now if you
look at our resultant set after we used
the find method you can see it has
returned all the fields of the document
from The Collection now but what if I
want to fetch only a particular field
like let's say first name last name
email or even their salary
how will we do that now the answer is
using mongodb projection we will Project
Specific fields to return from the query
now so before proceeding to mongodb
projection guys let's recall how we
fetch certain fields from you know our
traditional SQL database so that we can
have a clear understanding now let's say
suppose The Collection employee is a
table in SQL and let's say all the
fields like employee ID first name last
name so on are its columns now I want to
fetch the only uh the let's say first
name last name
uh from the table so in that case what
we'll write will basically write us
query as select first name
last name from a table that is employee
right I hope I am clear with this so it
is similar to that in mongodb wherein we
are executing this query as uh using
projection so let us now see how we do
projection here so let's just uh
consider as an example here now let's
say I am writing a command as DB dot
employee dot find
and let's say if I want to fix all the
documents of all the employees whose
Department ID is 30. so in that case
what I'll do is Department
so it is says a case sensitive guy so
make sure you write in the capitals or
whatever the field is written as
so mention the column and within the
double quotes mention 30.
so close the parenthesis and close the
square brackets as well so it will
basically list out as you can see all
the documents of the employees whose
Department ID is 30. so we can see we
have employee ID of the employee 114 115
116 117 118 and 119 whose all their
department is 30.
now again even if I am returning a
particular field or a condition it is
also you know retrieving all the fields
from all the documents now I don't want
that now I want only a particular field
so what in that case we will project
certain Fields without returning all the
fields from our documents so let us see
how it works so the query is followed as
DB Dot
mention the collection name employee
find
open the square brackets
and let's say uh I want to retrieve only
the first name
first name so I'm setting it as one
as we discussed earlier if you want to
retrieve the particular field you have
to mention one and similarly I want to
mention I want to retrieve the last name
as well
last name
column and one and also let us take
another field let's say a salary
right we have salary also let us
restrict to that as well as one
all right close the parenthesis and
close the square brackets and enter so
we do not have any output here guys that
is because we haven't mentioned the
parenthesis uh before the find method so
let me just copy based and we will see
how it is
so before after the fine we'll have to
mention the uh parenthesis again
foreign
so as you can see in a resultant set now
since we have only mentioned the first
name last name and the salary it is only
displaying the results
only those only certain fields that is
the first name last name and salary in a
result and set now by default this ID
object is uh you know retrieved uh with
the command so if you want to eliminate
that as well you can keep the ID to zero
so let us just execute that so let me
just copy this again
paste it and mention another uh criteria
that is
the field now the shield should be
the field that is of ID should be zero
so close the parenthesis
so let us just execute this and we'll
see how it is the output so as you can
see now only we have the first name last
name and salary of all the employees so
we have just basically eliminated the
object ID as well so if you want uh only
uh the first name last name and salary
in your output you can just uh mention
the field names and mention one if you
want to display your resultant set and
if you want to display if you do not
want to display those certain Fields you
can mention as zero so in this way you
can use the projection query operator in
order to project only certain fields
from all the documents so yes I guess
that was all about the mongodb
projection guys uh now projection query
operator can be quite useful when you
are handling a lot of unstructured data
let's say if the database has like 10
000 or even a million records in such
case if you want to return a specific
number of fields only now a document can
have any number of fields like 10 20 30
40 and so on so in some cases if you
want to retrieve or specify only certain
number of fields in your resultant set
in that case projection operator can be
quite useful and I know it is quite
confusing at the beginning so just you
just need more practice to understand
this in a more better way
so
that brings us to the end of today's
session guys I hope you have understood
all the topics and Concepts covered in
today's session so sorting or limiting
one of the necessary database operations
it helps to simplify and the readability
of the data and sort the data as per the
user requirement now when you're working
on huge chunks of data in a database
both sorting and limit operations can be
quite a handful to understand and
visualize data in order to get
meaningful information out of it and
retrieve only the specified number of
Records accordingly as per your need so
in this tutorial you will learn all
about the sorting and limiting Concepts
and how it can be implemented in mongodb
database so before getting into the
execution part let us quickly understand
what is sorting in mongodb sorting is
the ordering of data in an increasing
and increasing order based on set of
relationships between the various data
items present in the database now
sorting can be done on any entities
having information like ID name is
address or any data type having numbers
or string values now sorting improves
the readability and consistency of the
data displayed from the database so in a
nutshell sorting is done just like in
any other database or programming
language that involves arranging data
into some meaningful information to make
it easier to understand analyze or
visualize let us understand its syntax
the syntax is simple it is followed as
DB dot collection name fine dot sort and
within the parenthesis mention the field
and the order so let us understand how
it is now for sorting your mongodb
documents you need to make use so this
sort method so this method will accept a
document that has a list of fields and
the order for sorting so for indicating
the Sorting order you have to set the
value 1 or -1 with this specific entity
based on which the ordering will be set
and displayed so if the order is is one
it will basically
uh sort the records in ascending order
that is in an increasing manner and if
you mention the order is -1 it will
basically sort sort the uh data in the
descending order that is in a decreasing
manner so one indicates organizing data
in ascending order while -1 indicates
organizing in descending order so that
was all about the Sorting in mongodb so
let us now understand how sort method
Works in mongodb with an example now
consider a collection name orders now if
I just run a command DB dot orders DOT
fine I'll get these collection which has
three documents so it has uh details of
three customers like Rahul pranav and
kirti right so let us now run a query
where I'm using a sort method here which
is followed as DB dot orders dot file
and within the parenthesis I am
basically uh projecting the query ID so
that we will not have it in our
resultant set so and also I'm sorting
the data based on the customer here so
I'm mentioning customer
as well so that means it will basically
order in
the ascending order so this will be the
output guys now the output is now first
you'll have the customer details of
kirti because the letter alphabet K
starts first in the alphabets uh from A
to Z next we have pranam which starts
with p and then we have Rahul which
starts with r so this is a simple
example on how sorting method Works in
mongodb now let's say if I want to sort
multiple fields in a collection so in
what way will I be able to do it now let
us consider an example here let's say I
have a pet info collection here and we
have various records or you can say
documents and we have uh like various
Fields like name of the pet type and its
weight now let's say if I want to sort
multiple Fields uh within this
collection so I would write a query as
DB dot The Collection name which is pet
info DOT fine dot sort and next I am
sorting this collection based on its
type its weight and finally the ID
so type I'm giving it as one which will
basically do in an ascending order which
is an increasing manner whereas I am
doing uh the Sorting on the weight field
as minus 1 which is in decreasing order
that is in descending order that is from
highest to lowest and then I'm also
sorting the field uh ID as uh ascending
order that is I'm giving it as one
so when I run this command in mongodb
Shell this will uh this will what we are
basically basically the output of the
collection right so let us just
understand how it is working
now first I am uh sorting the data based
on that type now the Sorting is then
based on the priority that is given that
is first you have given this uh sorting
input as type then weight and the ID so
it will run the Sorting based on this
sequence only
so if you look at the first uh record of
the document we have uh the cad data
that is the we have three uh records of
cads uh having the same uh type right so
we have Lily Millie and Oliver which is
of type cat so basically it will arrange
those in ascending order since we have C
which is the starting or the uh
alphabetical or order of the alphabets
uh which comes uh the C comes first then
we have dog next we have kangaroo now
since we have uh the same records or the
same uh record of cat that is repeating
then it will check weight now since we
have given weight as minus 1 that is
from descending order that is why we
have the record of Lily whose weight is
12 at the first place next the uh
details of Millie whose weight is eight
and finally we have Oliver whose weight
is seven
so this means that if there are multiple
pets of the same type those pets are
sorted by their weight in must a
descending order now if there are
multiple pets with both the same type as
well as weight then those pets are
sorted by the ID field which you have
given to sort them in ascending order
now if we hadn't included the ID field
in the Sorting process then those pets
of the same type and the uh sorting
process then those threads of the same
type and weight could appear in any
order guys so without having a sort
field on a unique field such as the ID
field it would be entirely possible that
the result would come back in different
order when we run the query each time so
I hope you understood how the Sorting
works when we want to sort multiple
Fields within a document
so let us now understand what is limit
in mongodb the limit method in mongodb
is used to limit the number of Records
this method takes only one number type
of argument which is basically the
number of documents that you want to
display in your resultant set similarly
which we used to do in SQL also wherein
if we have like thousands of Records you
use the limit clause in order to
restrict a certain number of records and
specify only certain records in a
resultant set now the syntax is followed
as DB dot collection name dot file limit
and value now in the value you can give
as per your choice let's say if I give
the value as 5 it will display the first
five records or the documents from that
collection and similarly you can also
uh use the projection where you can
display the fields as per your
requirement by giving the values and
also the limit value and simultaneously
you can also sort the data and the limit
uh and limit those uh collections or
Limitless documents in the collections
as well and the syntax is followed as
db.collection name DOT fine dot sort
field order you can give multiple field
names in the Sorting uh you know
parenthesis and mention the limit method
and you can give the values that is
number of records that you want to fetch
in a resultant table so let us now
understand again how limit Works in DB
now again let us consider uh the orders
collection here now let's say if I want
to limit these collections now if I want
to retrieve only the first two documents
from this then the query would be DB dot
orders dot file limit and within the
time this I'm mentioning as two so this
would is this would be the output
wherein you will get the details of
Rahul and pranav which are basically the
first two documents which are present in
our collection order all right now what
if you want to sort and as well as limit
the data now what I'm doing here is I'm
basically projecting the ID field so I'm
keeping it as 0 so that we do not have
this in a resultant set next I'm sorting
uh this collection orders based on the
customers so I am giving customer as one
which will basically
sort the documents of the customers in
an ascending manner that is from lowest
to highest and then I'm limiting these
documents for only two values so uh when
I run this query this would be the
output
so customer I'm basically sorting in
ascending order so first we'll have qtp
and similarly next we have products in
an alphabetical order which is following
the alphabetical condition starting from
A to Z and since I'm also using the
limit Clause here up to two values it
will only retrieve the first two values
so this is how limit Works in mongodb
guys I hope you've got a better
understanding on how limit works you
know consider in this simple examples so
let us now jump into mongodb shell with
a proper execution and see how it gets
executed
so as you can see mongodb shell has
started and let us consider the
simplifier database again so let us
write the command as you simply code one
which will basically select the simple
code one database and
let us see what are the collections
present in it and we have the employee
collection so let us just retrieve the
data that is present in this so I'm
using the find method DP Dot and send
the collection name and mention the fine
method so it will retrieve all the data
that is present in it so we have uh data
like employee ID first name last name
email phone number hiring date job ID
salary manager ID Department ID
so firstly let us discuss some example
choosing the Sorting technique guys uh I
think we already have employee IDs in
alphabet I mean in sorted order so let's
just take another field let us sort the
manager ID field here so
the following query would be DB dot
employee
dot find
mention is sort
and within the sort mentioned the field
name which is manager ID
so I'm giving the order as one which
will uh sort the order in ascending
order
so close the parenthesis and let us
execute this
so basically you can type it to retrieve
all the records that are present so let
us just understand how it is working uh
let me just scroll back
you have so many requests guys so it's
better we use the project field uh so
that we can have a clear understanding
so next time we'll use that
so this is our query which you have
executed now now since I've sorted the
manager ID in ascending order which I
have given the order value as one as you
can see uh since we do not have any
manager ID for this employee Stephen
King next we have the manager IDs 100
and next similarly we have hundred
hundred hundred
100 and so on and next we have one not
one
and one not a so as you can clearly see
114 as well uh so you can clearly see
that our data has been sorted in
ascending order when we are using this
sorting technique so let us now
understand how we can do that with
another
you know sequence that is let us keep it
as minus one so in that case what it
will be is DV dot employee find
so I'm going to project some of the
fields because uh I don't want all these
uh you know unnecessary fields in my
result and set so I'll just uh opt them
out so I don't want ID field
so I'm keeping it as 0
and I want first name
my resultant set so I'm keeping first
name next I want last name as well
keeping it as one and next last name
uh
and let's say uh finally manager ID only
okay
manager
ID
has one close the parenthesis now
mention the sort keyword
open the parenthesis mention the
field that you want to sort
in the way that is manage your ID
[Music]
so it is important that you mention
manager ID in the projection field right
so if you do not mention and if you are
sorting manager ID without explicitly
calling it so you will get an error it
won't display so it is important that
you mention the manager ID in the
projection field also
close the brackets I think we are good
to go let us just recheck our code
oh okay okay right so I think there is
an error in the manager ID guys so let
me just copy this you know
so you might have a technical error so
make sure you give the correct name of
the Field's name otherwise you'll get an
error so I think we are good to go now
so let us just like figure this
statement and we'll see the output so as
you can clearly see that in a result and
Set uh we are only fetching the first
name last name and manager ID since we
have projected some of the fields uh in
a resultant set and I'm sorting the data
based on the uh based on the manager ID
field and since I've given it as one it
will uh sort the data in ascending order
that is from lowest to highest so if you
can see the first
manager ID is 100 so list of all the
employees whose manager ID is 100 has
been shown next we have one not one one
not three uh similarly if you type it
we'll have the rest of the records as
well so you can see next one not eight
one fourteen 120 and so on 120 to 123 to
not one two not five so in this way you
can sort my uh various documents in
order of how you want to display or show
them in your resultant set
all right I hope you understood this
till now uh let us now sort multiple
field guys so let me just copy this
query
now again like as I discussed earlier in
in our presentation sorting multiple
Fields is not a big task it is just
simply that you have to add the uh
multiple Fields here so manager ID as
well as let's take salary also
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
sort salary in uh descending order so
I'm mentioning it as minus one and also
let us uh project the field here as well
so salary
has one all right so let us execute this
statement and we'll see the output
so as you can see in the resultant set
after sorting the data uh based on the
fields of manager ID and salary if you
look at the output now since we have
sorted our manager ID in ascending order
since we have specified one as the order
it will uh basically sort the order in
ascending order that is from lowest to
highest and salary we have mentioned the
order as minus one so it will do the
opposite of that that is it will sort
the data in descending order that is
from highest to lowest so if you look at
the resultant output here guys
now since we have no manager ID for this
which is uh taken as let's say the least
value or zero so it is displaying first
next we have the salary minus one so if
you look at to the manager IDs uh of the
next uh like let's say four now since we
have the manager ID hundred which is the
lowest value and we have four same or
four or more same values then it will
move on to the next priority that we
have given to sort our document that is
salary so first now we have 82 000 as
our salary that is from descending order
it will uh basically sort the data in uh
descending order that is from highest to
lowest so we have 80 to thousand next we
have 80 000 next we have seventy nine
thousand eight hundred next you have
6558
000 next we have 1700 1700 similarly and
so on
so in this way you can sort multiple
Fields using the sort method as well I
hope you've understood how the sort
method Works uh in mongodb guys uh using
the single field or using multiple field
sorting how you can basically arrange
the data based on your name
all right let us now uh discuss some
examples using the limit Clause again
limit Clause is very easy guys it is
used to restrict or specify only certain
number of Records in a resultant set and
the uh
syntaxes followed as DB Dot mentioned
the employee name DB dot employee dot
find
dot let's say limit I want only five
records of the uh you know employee
collection so I'm mentioning as Phi as
my value and when you enter uh when you
press the enter you can see the
resultant output has only five five
documents one two three
four and five so this is a simple
example of how you can use limit now you
can also use the limit using the sort
method as well so let us just copy this
and we will see how it gets executed
so let me just paste it here
now I'm just adding the limit method
here I want only let's say the first
four
okay now what I'm doing is I'm first
basically projecting some of the fields
that is the required number of years
that I want to fetch in my resultant set
then I am basically sorting this
documents in the uh manner of manager ID
salary in order of ascending order from
manager ID since we are given one and in
the order of descending order for salary
since we have given at -1 and I am
limiting the resultant uh you know
output to only four records so when I
press enter you can see we have only the
first four records so we have no manager
ID again next week if we consider the
manager ID here hundred for Adam Fripp
whose manager ID is 100 and next two
also we have this same manager ID here
guys so now the next uh thing is it will
go on to this salary like we discussed
earlier the salary is uh sorted here in
descending order from highest to lowest
so we have 800 000 next we have 80 000
next we have 79 000 so similarly if you
can
uh let's say let's limit to another
example let's say if I'm limiting to 10
all right so in that case it will
basically fetch the first n record so as
you can see one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten so all of them are
basically uh the records of the
employees whose manager ID is 100 and it
is basically arranging all the details
of the employees for salary in ascending
in descending order that is in the order
of minus one which we have specified
so that brings us to the end of today's
session guys I hope you all have
understood all about the sort and the uh
limit method that we use in a good
indexing strategy is essential for
ensuring that your you know database
returns your results as quickly as
possible now just like any other
relational databases where we perform
indexing similarly indexing in mongodb
is also a way to organize information so
that the database engine can quickly
find the relevant results more on that
soon but before we get started let us
first discuss the agenda for today's
session
in today's tutorial we'll be going
through different concepts wherein we'll
cover what are indexes in mongodb and
then we'll understand why is indexing
used in mongodb and up next we'll
discuss how does indexing work and then
we'll understand how to create an index
and after that we'll be going through
different types of indexes used in
mongodb and finally we'll end this
session uh with syntax and execution in
mongodb Shell I hope I made myself clear
with the agenda part so let us just go
ahead and understand what are indexes in
mongodb
so what are indexes in mongodb now
mongodb index is a special data
structure on which the data is on which
the index is created to hold the date of
specific fields of document now in the
absence of uh you know fields in the
fields and indexing in mongodb there is
a need to scan every collection document
to select those uh that match the query
statement now this scan requires mongodb
to process a large volume of data and is
highly efficient so if there is no
indexing done on a collection of let's
say thousands of documents your query
will keep finding specific documents in
order however mongodb would limit and
make it clear the number of documents to
be searched within your collection if
your documents have indexes so with the
help of indexes when they are applied at
the collection level it can store the
value of a specific field or set of
fields ordered by the value of the field
so those were that is what indexes are
in mongodb
let us now understand why is indexing
used in mongodb now mongodbs indexes
make it unnecessary to perform a
collection scan now from that what I
mean is collections can basically
involve looking through every document
in a collection that matches to your
query that you have written to find a
particular or document or a field that
you are trying to return so when you
provide an indexing on documents let's
say on a database that you have like a
thousands or 50 000 records you can just
simply put an index which will improve
the search efficiency as well now any
collection in mongodb can have one or
more indexes and those indexes can be
made on one or multiple Fields And even
though a mongodb database can hold a lot
of data you need a good indexing
strategy to quickly and effectively
access the data you require from it and
finally indexing is a necessary
operation in mongodb which automatically
brings search efficiency in various
executions of statements all right
moving ahead let us now understand how
to create an index now creating an index
in mongodb is done by using the create
index method
so let us just quickly go through the
syntax uh so the syntax is followed as
db.collection name dot create index is
the keyword and make sure the i in index
is capital otherwise it will throw an
error within the parenthesis mention the
field name that you want to create an
index on and next we have one or minus
one so one of these following syntax
shows how to add an index to our
collection so let us assume we have you
know same uh like employee collection
which is an example which has various
Fields name like employee ID name salary
or so on but for this I'm creating an
index on employee name and I'm
specifying as one now the one parameter
indicates that when the index is created
with the employee name field value they
should be sorted in ascending order now
please you have to note that it is
different from the you know hashtag ID
which is the by default ID which is uh
you know created when you are creating a
document so the ID field is used to
uniquely identify each document in the
collection which is create it
automatically in the collection by
mongodb and the document will now be
sorted as per the employee name and not
the ID feed
so I hope you've understood how to
create an example you will get a clear
cut idea when we go into the execution
part in mongodb so make sure to watch
the video till the end guys
all right moving ahead let us now
discuss the types of indexes used in
mongodb now there are mainly three types
of indexes in mongodb the first one is
single field index next we have the
compounds compound index and finally we
have the multi-key index let us discuss
about each of them in detail now now we
know that a field in a document in a
collection can be indexed individually
so as the name suggests single field
index is used to create an index or only
a single field in a document So Below is
an example and the syntax for single
fill index uh on an uh tape on a
collection named as orders so the syntax
is db.collection name dot create index
and within the parenthesis field name so
you can either index them in the order
of ascending or descending by mentioning
one or minus one so I have considered an
example here of orders or collection
where I've created a index on a field
called price and I am mentioning as -1
so it will basically index in descending
order that is from highest to lowest
next we have the compound index now
compound index is formed when multiple
fields are combined into a one single
index so a compound index is General an
index that holds a reference to multiple
Fields within a collection so for
example I have taken another uh
collection I mean the same collection of
orders and I am creating an index where
I am creating index of multiple Field
Services which is for price and for
customer name so again the syntax is
same which is DB dot mentioned the
collection name dot create index which
is the keyword and within the
parenthesis you can give as much as many
as you know field names to your name to
your sorry to your collection
so I hope you have understood what is
copper index as well so and finally we
have what is a multi-key index now
mongodb supports a multi-key index for
each element inside the array for an
array field so these elements consist of
you know scalar Fields like string
values integer values or even nested
objects now the uh syntax is same you
just have to mention uh the collection
uh name and mention the create index
keyword and within the parenthesis
mention the field name which is of only
array type so multi-key index you know
automatically creates a multi key index
on an array by knowing its structure so
therefore you need not additionally
Define a multi-key index in such case so
no additional definition is required as
such so let us understand with an
example here now let's say I have a
document here
uh different documents like I have three
different documents in a collection of
orders which has various Fields such as
ID customer address payment mode email
order total and Order items now if you
look at this collection I have order
items which has an array values for
example we have for first ID for
customer Rahul we have four different
array values of order items like item
name notebook and item name paper item
name Journal item name postcard so if I
want to create a multi-key index I'll
just simply write a query as DB dot
orders dot create index and within the
parenthesis mention the collection uh
mention the field name that is which is
order items and on which you want to
perform multi-key indexing now I want to
perform uh indexing on price which is a
array value within a collection right so
that is what I'm taking is order items
dot price and the order in which it will
index is ascending so for that I am
giving the parameter as one so with that
we have covered all the three different
main types of uh indexing indexes that
we generally use in mongodb so let us
now switch into mongodb for execution
part and see how they actually perform
now we do not clearly see that how the
index signal is going but it will
definitely improve the search efficiency
if you are working on you know more than
you know let's say thousands and
thousands of Records
so let us now jump into uh
mongodb shell for execution part
all right so as you can see mongodb
shell has started and firstly let us see
uh what are the databases that are
present so for that I'll use the show
DBS and we'll again use the simply code
one or DBS that we have all previously
used so use simply code
one
it says switch to Simply code now if you
want to find all the collections that
are present in that you just have to
write show collections so we have one
collection which is employee so we'll
use that so in order to find the values
or the documents that are present in
this collection we'll just write the DB
command which is DB dot employee dot
find
so it will just display all the values
type it for all the values so as you can
see we have various different documents
in this so we'll just perform a simple
index now we'll just create a single
field index now which is basically a
normal field index that you create so
the query would be DB Dot
employee
create
mention the create index keyword and
within the parenthesis uh so let us just
create uh you know our index on salary
field here right so mention the salary
field
mention the hyphen and we will uh Index
this in ascending order so I am giving
the parameter here as one so let us
execute this statement so when you
execute the statement it says salary
underscore one which is basically means
your index that you have created which
is has been successfully executed
so now that you've created your index
and if you want to view uh what are the
indexes that you have created you need
to use the get indexes keyword so let's
just find again so I'll use this
statement DB dot employee which is a
collection name now you need to use the
get indexes make sure the I is capital
otherwise you will find an error get
indexes and when you enter uh the and
when you enter this and you will find
this a list of following indexes that
you have created now I have already now
as I said earlier in the tutorial the ID
field is automatically created uh
within the you know database which uh
you know automatically creates the index
for the uh underscore ID but additional
to that I've already created email uh
index on our you know employee table and
just now I have created the salary index
also so you can see the list of all
these uh you know indexes that you have
created now let's say if you want to
are not delete or drop any of the index
that you have created so in that case
you have to use the drop index so I'll
just uh you know write the statement
again which is DB dot employee dot uh
mention the keyword drop index
okay and within the parenthesis mention
the index that you want to drop so let's
say if I want to drop the email I find
it unnecessary now so I'll just write
the email uh you know key key which is a
field and I'll mentioned this one and
I'll just close the compare emphasis and
I'll close the brackets as well so as
you can see it says okay uh you know
this it says end indexes uh is three and
okay one that means if finally you know
drop the index so we'll just use again
this you know get index and see whether
it is successfully deleted or not
let's just copy paste here and let us
enter so now you can see that we have
only two fields which is the underscore
ID which is you know by default which is
the index that I've created by the
database itself and additionally we have
the salary index that we have created
earlier and successfully we have deleted
the email
index from our collection or the
database so I hope you've understood
till now so that is what uh you know
index is about you know you just create
index to improve the search efficiency
now behind the uh database the
performance optimization or the
efficiency can be achieved which cannot
be viewed outside so I hope you
understood how to create a single field
here well let us now move to compound
index and we'll see how to create it
also
so I uh as discussed earlier you can use
multiple fields in a mongodb document to
create a compound index so I'll just
create a compound index on another
Fields so I'll just create index
and within the parenthesis okay let us
now create uh you know index for let's
say job ID
job ID I am giving it as minus 1 the
order mention the comma
and let us create an index for let's say
Department ID as well
Department ID and I'm giving this a
parameter one it will basically index in
the ascending order so close the
parenthesis
so as you can see it is saying job ID 1
Department id1 that is me that means you
have successfully created the index so
let's just uh confirm whether they have
created or not
so let us copy paste again
so now as you can see we have another
two indexes that we have created which
says you know job ID and for Department
ID as well
so this is how you can create a compound
index in your mongodb database as well
so in the compound uh in the above
component is that well we have created
the mongodb will first sort by the job
ID in the descending order since we have
provided minus 1 as the parameter it
will basically sort all the documents in
the descending order then with each
department ID it will sort in ascending
order since you have provided the
parameter as one now the index would
create a similar data structure for the
Department ID also which basically sorts
the data in the ascending order so that
brings us to the final which is
multi-key index now I don't think we
have you know array of fields or the
array of data in our document documents
so that we can perform uh but for now I
think I hope you understood how to
implement multi-key multi key index as
well it just suppose supports indexing
of array of data so when you create an
index for a field containing an array
mongodb will create a separate index
entries for every element in the array
data
so I think we've already almost covered
all the topics that we have discussed in
our agenda and I hope you guys have
understood as well so that brings us to
the end of today's session guys I hope
you've understood what are indexes and
how they are used you know to uh search
the data in a efficient and a more quick
way so defining indexes are important
you know for faster and efficient
searching of documents in a collection
and these indexes can be created by the
uh using Create index method so I'm just
recapping what we have covered and
indexes can be created on just one field
by using the single field index method
or multiple Fields using the compound
index and you can even create indexes on
array of fields using the multi-key
index as well what is Advanced indexing
now we all know what indexing is mongodb
Right which is an essential component
which improves the performance of the
data retrieval speed in the database so
mongodb indexing is a special data
structure on which the index is created
to hold the data of specific fields of
documents and in the absence of indexing
in mongodb there is a need to scan every
collection document to select those that
match the query statement now in our
previous tutorial on indexing and
mongodb we have just covered the basic
uh you know indexing techniques like on
single field and comp and compound
Fields right so now what if the database
is working on array of fields within a
collection right uh so let's say if I
have a student's database and in that I
am working on sub documents that is
documents that have array of fields in
them so in such case the indexing
becomes quite difficult
so if there is no indexing done on a
collection of thousands of document your
query will keep finding specific
document in order be it a single field
of multiple fields or even array of
fields so it becomes quite difficult you
know to retrieve the value so indexes
are applied at the collection level and
it can store the value of specific field
or a set of fields so before jumping
into why uh I mean how exactly Advanced
indexing works on you know array of
fails let us understand uh you know why
why we need Advanced indexing you know
in addition to the normal indexing that
we do in mongodb so for that let us jump
into my mongodb compass for explanation
foreign
so as you can see mongodb Compass has
started and in our database simply code
1 we have two different collection that
is employee and new employees here now
if you if I click at the new employees
it basically opens uh the document
Fields now you can see we have like
almost around 33 000 documents and we
have one index which is basically done
on the ID field if you look at go to the
indexes page we have the ID field which
is already indexed now if you consider
these many documents right these huge
tons of amounts of documents like we
have 33k and if I try to find
a particular document let's say I want
to file uh a name you know based on the
name I am trying to field
uh I think we have different names here
right so let's just take Department here
right so we have Department field
so I'm just finding value like let's say
uh I'm trying to find all the documents
which has polis as the department name
so I'll just write polish and try to
search it so close the brackets and let
us try to find
so it will basically find all the
documents or within the collection that
has Department as police here now if I
go to the explanation of this right
let's just click on explanation now if I
uh look the query performance of this uh
document or the query that I've written
for uh you know to find the details of
all the uh you know employees or the
people working in a company and the
background I'm trying to find what all
uh the documents that I want here right
so if you look at here we have a total
of 32 000 928 documents and in that we
have documents returned are thirteen
thousand five ninety
now it indirectly impacts the
performance guys now if you see we have
33 000 documents it is searching each
and every document where the department
uh is police so and after searching each
and every record a record it is
basically retrieving all the documents
so we have around 13590 which is close
to around 14k and if you look at the
actual query time it is around 23
milliseconds so that is quite a huge uh
you know amount of time for a database
to process such information now let's
say if I have like Millions like 10
lakhs or 15 lakhs of documents in such
case the time taken is more so in such
case we'll basically create an index
here now we all know how to create a
single index on a multiple index so
let's just create an index and we'll see
how it actually affects the uh you know
bigquery performance so I'm just
creating an index on Department field
and I'm basically indexing in ascending
so I'm just basically one I'm keeping it
as one so as you can see we have created
successfully uh the index for the
Department uh field here so let us now
try to uh find uh the data that is the
Department of that is the employees or
the people working as a police
so and if I try to find this and if I go
to the EXP again explanation part
so you can see now we have a total of
Thirteen thousand five ninety documents
now instead of searching all the
documents that is 33 000 we can directly
reference a refer only those documents
that are required to us so you can see
index key examined only thirteen
thousand five ninety and you can see
actual query execution time has reduced
a bit more like 17 Ms I think that is
also quite huge but I don't think uh
that is you know uh that can affect
actually so you can see this is how
index works now let's say if I create
multiple index let's say if I'm trying
to find multiple uh you know Fields so
in that case let us see how it actually
impacts
all right so let us now understand how
it works for a compound field so when
you are trying to uh index uh multiple
Fields let us see how the query
performance does so let us know uh find
uh you know the details of the employees
whose department is police and let's say
their job titles is Sergeant so in that
case I'll basically search for
Department field where the department is
Polish
and put a comma and I've job title that
I'm searching for is basically Sergeant
so mention SAR Gent
okay close the brackets and let us now
find the documents
so if you look at it will only display
all the uh details of employees who is
basically job title is Sergeant and
department is police so let us now
understand how it is executing so let us
explain uh click on the explain button
so you can see that uh the documents it
is examining is basically the all the
documents that is present in the
collection that is 32928 now out of that
it is returning 12 to 196. so as you can
see it is a time taking process it is
going through each and every document
now thing is we only have only around
1300 documents where the department is
polished and the job title is Sergeant
so instead of that what I'll do is I'll
basically index the uh both Department
as well as the job title as well so let
us just create another index here
firstly for Department
create index so let us create another
index for job title
and let us create an index again so as
you can see we have created the index
successfully so let us now try to find
the documents all right it will find
that it will fetch all the documents and
let us now uh
basically uh click on the explain and
see how it does so as you can see now
the documents that is that it examined
now is 296 which you've seen earlier
that all the details of employees whose
department is Polish and the job title
is Sergeant so after creating an index
it is only searching only those
documents whose department is police and
Sergeant as you can see the actual query
execution time is also reduced
drastically from almost 4 30 to
milliseconds to almost 16 milliseconds
so it'll also vary like if you click
again it will change to six milliseconds
now that it is find the details so it
keeps on changing so index basically
provides the user to efficiently
navigate through that data which is
required by them instead of searching
the whole data so now you might be
wondering why we need Advanced uh
technique now let's say if I have a sub
array fields in this documents so in
that case I need to query
those documents quickly right now it
will take more time than single field or
a compound field now that is where we
use Advanced indexing to uh index sub uh
array fields or sub documents
so let us now understand how advanced
indexing works and why we have uh you
know went through all that scenario on
mongodb Compass where we have understood
how indexing works for a single field as
well as compounding field and the need
for advanced indexing now let's say I
have a document of students uh let's say
I have the student ID their name age
courses now if a courses field I have an
other additional uh you know array array
section where I am mentioning the course
ID course name and course credits so in
that case we have an array field here
right so in such case we'll use Advanced
indexing now Advanced indexing is
basically just another process where we
are using another technique right so
let's say if I have 20 million such
records right 26 million uh documents
present in my collection it will take a
lot of time so this is where we need to
use indexing process again so let's say
if you're indexing an array field the
Syntax for that would be
db.collection.create index mention the
array field name that is and the order
so I am creating an index on courses
right uh which is an array field there
so the query would be db.students.create
index courses and mention the order that
is one now you can also further uh you
know index subdocument Fields right now
instead of just uh indexing the array
field you can also index the subdocument
field so let's just understand the
syntax here that is
dp.collection.create index field name
dot subdocument field name and the order
now why we are doing this now suppose
that we want to search documents you
know based on the course ID course name
or even the core uh course credits now
since all these fields are part of the
courses subdocument field right which we
will create an index here on all the
fields of this sub document now in this
example I've created an index field on a
subdocument which is course ID similarly
you can also create for course name as
well as the course credit also so the
query is followed as DB dot students
create index courses dot course ID and
I'm mentioning the order as one so once
the index is created we can search for
any of the sub document Fields utilizing
this uh in a query now remember that the
query expression has to follow the order
of the index specified that is either 1
or -1 otherwise you will get an error so
in this way we can use a technique which
is Advanced indexing in order to query
the array Fields as well as sub document
Fields now in addition to that we have
some other Advanced indexing techniques
which is uh another three types of
indexing techniques in mongodb which is
first one is geospatial index now
mongodb uses 2D index and 2D spear to
increase the efficiency of database
queries while dealing with a job
geospatial coordinate data next we also
have text index which provides support
to take search queries on string content
so basically text indexes can include
any field whose value is a string or an
array of string elements and finally we
have hashed index now basically hashed
index keep racks of the entries with
hatches of the values of the index field
which is almost always the underscore ID
field which is created by default in all
the collection now this kind of index is
primarily necessary when you are
sharding data to distribute it evenly
now if you want to learn more about
sharding we have a dedicated video on
that as well so make sure to check that
on our Channel
foreign
guys so in this way you can use Advanced
indexing uh to create an index on you
know multi-key compound uh you know
Fields as well so let's say if you have
a document with an array field you can
just create indexing for an array field
creating an index or an array in turn
creates separate index entries for each
of its Fields so it will basically
separate uh create an index to an array
field so it will help you to find the
documents with which are having any
array field values as well so I hope you
understood uh all the techniques and how
we Implement Advanced indexing in
mongodb mongodb you will most likely use
the fine method or command for a variety
of queries now however as your queries
become more complex you will need to
learn more about aggregation in mogodb
which is used to perform various complex
operations so in this tutorial we'll be
covering the fundamentals of creating
aggregate queries in mongodb and how to
use various expressions in mongodb
irrigation and furthermore we'll
introduce the most important stages of
aggregation pipeline along with examples
of how to apply each one to this
pipeline stages
all right firstly let us understand what
is aggregation and mongodb mongodb
process the data records in the database
during an aggregation operation and
returns a single computed result it
actually groups multiple documents
present in a collection applies an
aggregation operation to it and then
provides the user with a single result
now mongodb offers a wide range of
aggregation operations just like many
other database systems in relational
databases as well mongodb being a no SQL
database also provides with the same
functionality this enables you to filter
data as you might with a query as well
as grouping data sorting data into a
particular order or reorganizing for
returning the documents in the
collection now this is just similar to
the SQL wherein we use the group by
clause in our aggregation function with
the help of certain operations like
count average some minimum and value to
perform complex aggregation operations
in the similar way mongodb aggregation
is also similar to that of the SQL
aggregation method that we follow
so I hope you understood what is
aggregation in mongodb Let Us Now
understand why we use aggregation now
data from different sources is gathered
by an aggregation method which are then
processed to a single outcome now to
perform an aggregate function in a
relational database the database
management system typically extracts
data from multiple rows of the same
table but in a document oriented
database like mongodb the database will
gather information from various
documents in the same collection so it
basically group values from multiple
documents together to a single resultant
value now next one is it fetches a lot
of nested data to perform complex
operations Now when using a database
management system you must run an
operation known as a query right each
time you want to retrieve data from
database however queries only return the
information that is already present in
the database you will frequently need to
carry out another type of operation
which is known as aggregation in order
to analyze your data in order to find
patterns or other information about the
data so if there are if there is a
complex operation that is needed for the
data that is present in documents you
need aggregation and finally it filters
and sort documents and analyze data
changes now uh mongodb being an SQL
nosql database the data model will
frequently change as the data that is
being you know inserting into the
database might change over the time so
in order to analyze this unstructured
data it becomes quite important that you
uh make a proper you know filtration and
sorting of these documents to get a
proper insights for your businesses and
as well as your you know requirements so
in that case aggregation can be quite
useful which simplifies you know the
complexity of the query that you have
written and fetches the data in no time
so these are some of the main reasons on
why we use aggregation
now aggregation uh in mongodb is
performed using uh aggregation pipeline
stages with consists of four different
you know methods the first one is match
next we have group Next we have sort and
finally we have project these four
combinedly are known as aggregation
pipeline stages which perform
aggregation as per the requirement now
firstly when you take a collection and
the first thing you need to is if you
want to match only certain Fields you
know within your documents to perform
aggregation then you can use the match
method next we have the group now just
like the group by clause in SQL you can
use the group uh you know function here
as well in order to group all these
similar or the related uh type of data
in your
you know pres present in your
collections that is the data that is
present in your documents to in order to
retrieve the similar kind of data you
can use the group Next sort again
sorting can be done in any other way
like from ascending order or descending
order next we have the project as we
discussed earlier in a previous tutorial
project is used to uh you know remove
the unnecessary fields that you want in
a result instead and finally after you
know matching all the four uh pipeline
stages then you get the resultant output
so let us understand this with an
example wherein will discuss how
aggregation Works in mongodb now as
discussed earlier the firstly the match
condition uh you know specifies only the
related documents that you want to
consider so for example I have a
collection name orders here and I'm
performing uh you know an aggregation
operation here so first I've mentioned
the match for status a so I have like
four documents here if you've seen the
orders like for the four different
customer IDs we have the amount and
status now I want to retrieve only uh
those documents whose status is a so for
that I'm using the match command here so
match command only retrieve the one that
you have specified here which is data
say so we have only three records that
have the status as field and their value
is a so we have sorted initially with
the match command next we want to group
the values in the order of their let's
say IDs and then so if you look at here
we have two similar IDs which is A123
and b212 so what group does is it will
match all the similar related fields
together and produce a result so you can
see the A123 and B21 b212 are separated
into a different groups and finally what
I'm doing is I'm sorting I'm sorting and
I'm applying an operation here with sum
so what it does is it will basically
calculate the total amount here so if
you look at the first ID A123 the amount
is 500 and 250. so the resultant output
would be 750 and finally we have the
customer ID of p212 is amount is just
200. so in this way the aggregation
pipeline Works in a methodology of
wherein it matches the values that is
the similar values from the documents
then you can even group the data that
you want to show in a resultant output
and you can perform various operation uh
using the aggregate functions like some
minimum average with the help of sorting
as well so this is basically how
aggregation Works in mover DB so and
finally as discussed earlier just like
similar to SQL we have the same five or
the main five aggregation operations in
SQL which is the first one is sum it
basically adds up the values of every
documents of a collection next we have
the average which computes the average
value of every document of a collection
next we have minimum or Min Returns the
minimum of all values from the
collection and next we have Max which is
opposite to that of minimum minimum
which Returns the maximum of all values
from within the collection and finally
we have an additional uh you know
operation which is a push operation
since mongodb is non or relational
database we also work on the array of
elements so in order to add the values
to an array in the associated document
within a collection you can use the push
operation as well now this might be a
bit confusing for you guys now so let us
jump into mongodb sell for execution
part where it will perform uh
different operations using the
aggregation pipeline stages and see how
they are getting implemented and also
perform a detailed analysis on the uh
data uh the collection that we have and
we will bring out some inferences using
the aggregation operations using various
expressions like some average minimum
and maximum so without any further delay
let us jump into mongodb shell so as you
can see we have opened the mongodb shell
command prompt line so let us just uh
use the command show DBS to find out the
database present so we have different
databases like admin config local and
simply code one we'll use the simply
code one as usual so use
write the database name user B code one
now let us see the collections that are
present in the table so we have the
employee collection again so let us
write the command using the DB dot find
find
so it will retrieve all the values that
are present in this collection so we
have our different fields like employee
ID first name last name email phone
number hiring date job ID salary manager
ID and Department ID so all right let us
now perform the aggregate operations in
a sequential way firstly we look at the
match aggregation uh you know stage
where it will match the related fields
that we want in a result and set now
let's say if I want to match the
department ID whose all the Embers who
belong to the department added let's say
100 so in that case the following query
would be DB Dot
employee dot mention the aggregate
keyword here which is a must otherwise
it will throw an error when open the
parenthesis and mention the square
brackets and use the dollar symbol to
write the statement for match
put the call in
and open the parenthesis and mention the
department ID
field
which is uh on which we are basically
you know matching the attic watch so
mentioned it again the colon and within
single quotes mentioned the department
ID name so since we have taken as 100
I'm just taking it close the uh flower
brackets
two times and again mention the square
bracket once again and close the
parenthesis all right so this is the uh
basically the query that we have written
here which is DB dot imported Aggregate
and we're using the match aggregation
method here wherein we are matching all
the records of the employees whose
Department ID belongs to 100 so let's
now enter
uh I think there is an error here
so we had a error in the syntax guys uh
so as you can see in the output we can
see only those records of the employees
were in it is showing are the records
whose Department ID is hundred so we
have the employee id108 109 110 111 and
1 12 113 and all of them have their
employee Department IDs sorry or
Department IDs 100. so I hope you
understood this so let us now uh go
through the next stage of aggregation
Pipeline with where and whale group uh
the values now so for that the following
query would be DB dot employee
dot aggregate
which is the keyword again open the
parenthesis
and mention the double
square brackets open the flower brackets
and use the dollar symbol again write
the group keyword
and open the flower brackets again
and mention the ID here so I'll explain
why we are taking this here again
so firstly let us just write the you
know command and then I'll explain to
you guys that why we are implementing
that so I want to group all the
basically the department IDs right so I
am taking Department ID
so mention the dollar symbol
so the field name which is the
department ID
close the
flower brackets twice mentioned uh okay
double bracket square bracket as well
so when you enter uh you can see the
list of all the department IDs that are
present in our collection so we have
various I uh Department IDs like 60 10
30 70 40 110 115 20 98 and so on
so now you might have a doubt that why
we are using the idv layer now we are
using the group stage to group the input
documents by the specified you know ID
expression which returns a single
document containing the all the
cumulative values of all the ER
Department IDs that we have taken here
so in this above example only the group
stage is specified in the pipeline
whereas the group uses the ID field to
calculate at the value for all the input
documents as a whole so the expression
ID column uh
the dollar symbol Department ID creates
a distinct group on the field Department
name since we don't uh we didn't
calculate any accumulated values in our
document it Returns the distinct values
of Department IDs that are present in
the table or in a document so in this
way you can use the group aggregation
method as well
so this is how you can use the match and
group stages wherein you can combine
both these as well so next let us look
at how to create an aggregation
operation using one of the expression
that we have like count average sum or
minimum now let's say if I want to count
the total employees in a particular
Department in that case I'll basically
use the match statement wherein it will
group all the values of the employees
whose Department IDs in a particular you
know value and then it will count the
total number of employees in that group
so for that the following query would be
DB Dot
employee Dot
aggregate
open the
open the brackets and uh
square brackets as well and then mention
the flower back brackets and then use
the dollar match uh group stage
wherein we are matching uh you know
the department ID let's say Department
ID of 60. so in that case it would be
Department
ID
I have taken the value as 60 mentioned
in the double coach
and close the brackets
put a comma and then basically we are
counting right so I'll use the count
function here
so put the dollar sign
and check the account keyword
and let's say
the statement would be total
employees
in Department
60.
right so
mention the put these close the uh
brackets as well
square brackets second
so when you press the enter in a
resultant output it states that total
employees and Department 60 is 5. so
similarly you can check for various
other departments as well so let us just
verify if it's showing correctly or not
I'll just copy paste this and let's say
for 100 now I want the total number of
employees present in the uh Department
100 so in that case I'll just mention it
I'll just change the values and let us
now print the enter so as you can see in
the resultant set or result in the
output you can see the total number of
employees and Department 100 is 6
wherein we have the total number of
employees and Department six days five
so in this way you can use the various
aggregation stages using the match group
and as well as sort as well and perform
various aggregation operations like Sim
uh some minimum maximum as well
so I think we have covered most of the
concepts that we have discussed in our
Renault tutorial so that brings us to
the end of today's session guys I hope
you understood uh what aggregation
methods and how they are used in mongodb
release topic all right as you know that
mongodb relationship represents how
multiple documents are logically
connected to each other in mongodb it
provides two types of relationships
namely embedded and referenced embedded
documents capture relationship between
data by storing related data in a single
document structure on the other hand
reference models store the relationship
between data by including links or
references from one document to another
now to implement a normalized database
structure in mongodb we use the concept
of reference relationship that is if you
look at the left side of the screen here
you you can have an example where it is
a reference model where we have student
collection and inside we have ID and
then we have another uh you know
document contact details where we are
referencing using this student document
right so in that way we can use
reference model for that so we use this
concept of reference relationship also
referred to as manual or references in
which we manually store the reference
document ID inside another document now
what if the data that you're trying to
search isn't present in different
collection or in different database and
that's where you have to use dbrevs
dbrevs are references from one document
to another using the value of the first
document ID field collection name and
optionally its database DBS basically
allow you to uh more easily reference
documents stored in multiple collections
or database so if you look at this
example I have a user collection here
and a post collection here in the user
collection I have ID name post as my
fields and I'm trying to
fetch those from the post collection
which is another collection in in that
case right so if I'm trying to retrieve
data from another collection which may
be present in another database in such
case you have to reference the database
that you are trying to search for and
that is where we use dbref so and that
will bring us to the main part what is
you know mongodb database references
mongodb database references allow you to
more easily reference documents stored
in multiple collections or database so
relationship between documents can be
represented using this ADB reps which
offer a standard format and type so if a
database needs to communicate with a
variety of Frameworks and tools present
in mongodb Database The dbre Format
offers common links for representing the
data between the documents however in
cases where a document contains
references from different collections in
that case we have to use mongodb ddrefs
so it basically represents a document
rather than a specific reference type
and if you're trying to find data in
more than one collection in such case
you have to use mongodb database
references all right I hope you
understood what it is and let us now
move ahead and understand uh the various
parameters that we use you know while
writing you know database reference
syntax first we have the dollar ref
keyword now ref field basically holds
the name of the collection whereas where
the reference document resides next we
have the ID field the ID field basically
contains the value of the ID field in
the reference document and finally we
have the optional DB which contains the
name of the database where the document
or the reference document resides so in
mongodb these are the three important
fields which should be used in order to
implement dbrev's relationship as
follows
let us now understand the syntax of
mongodb database reference and how it is
exactly used now let's say if I have an
address collection here which I'm
basically creating two different fields
which is ID and City so the command is
the DB dot address dot insert and ID is
145 and city is Bengaluru next we have
another document which is DV dot address
dot insert which is the idea is 124 city
is Delhi so firstly we have inserted two
documents in our address collection now
let us move ahead and see
and how we can implement this using
another uh you know collection which is
which might be present in different
database now let's say if I have another
student collection and I mean that I'm
inserting records wherein I am inserting
records of uh student details like ID
I'm providing as one is first name of
the student is Rahul here so as you can
see here inside uh you know the address
ID which is the database reference field
which is part of the document or the
collection student collection present in
this collection we are using mongodb
reference approach to refer the address
ID present in another collection which
we have taken from the address
collection here after defining three
fields which are basically ref ID and
optional DDP so the ref is basically by
providing the field which you want to
reference have a provider reference to
the collection that you are trying to
connect here so earlier we mentioned the
ID and the address in the address
collection right so I am referring to
that that's why I'm providing the
collection name as address and ID as105
and database is optional you can keep
whatever you want I am just taking
simply it as simply code one and
similarly we are again inserting another
document and again we are referencing it
with the dbref dbref field which is
again address ID and for reference I'm
taking again address collection and IDs
124 and DP dot simply code
now you might have a question of what
exactly and how exactly mongodb dbref
works here now the syntax is followed as
where student DB dot student dot find
one which we use in order to uh find the
data now I'm trying to search the first
name with the name of Rohan so I want to
get the details or the address of this
student whose name is Rohan so for that
I'm querying as VAR student address
equals to student dot address ID and
after that mention the syntax as DB in
the Within These square brackets student
address dot dollar ref dot find ID where
student address dot ID now what does it
mean so I'm basically connecting both
the address collection and student
collection and that is what I'm
referring here student address dot
reference and student address dot ID so
in order to get the address of the
student Rohan you have to basically
provide a reference to both these uh
collections so that is what I'm doing
here so when you execute this statement
this will be the final output now for
Rohan we have uh the ID which is 145 and
his City the address is Bengaluru so
this is how exactly dbref Works in
mongodb and that brings us to the end of
today's session guys in this tutorial we
have revised the concepts of data
relationships in mongodb for the with
the likes of manual references used for
data modeling in the mongodb and
compared it against the concepts of
mongodb DB reps where the former is used
when the references are to be made to
the documents present in the same
collection so you can use manual
references when you are trying to make
references in the same documents or
which are present in the same collection
and the other uh you know part which is
mongodb dbrefs approaches used when the
references are to be made to the
documents present in different
Collections and in different database
now the main question comes is why is no
longer mongodb dvrf's Concepts is not
used it is deprecated uh all around the
world and it is not a suggested method
when you are trying to work on this
mongodb database and that is the reason
also mongodb documentation recommends
manual references unless you have
documents referred to in multiple
locations or the collections in a
database so when you have multiple
collections for your references to
Target we would highly recommend it's
still easier to store the object ID and
collection name in the own object
without specifying or with a special
name of dbrevs and that won't break if
someone insert the field out of the
order now all the dbreps haven't been
deprecated in mongodb as such and the
functionality is unlikely to go away but
hopefully you can see there are good
reasons on why to use and how to avoid
this function that we have discussed in
this tutorial well coming to today's
Topic in today's session we look at how
to use covered queries and analyze those
queries and the performance that it
creates while you query mongodb database
so which helps us to query data more
quickly so without any further Ado let's
get started but before we begin if
you're new to the channel and haven't
subscribed already consider getting
subscribed to our Channel simply code to
stay updated with all the latest tech
content and hit that Bell icon to never
miss an update from us
all right now what are covered queries
now we know that in every database
including mongodb indexes play crucial
role mongodb queries are executed more
quickly when indexes are used as you
know we have discussed in the previous
tutorials on mongodb indexing so if you
haven't checked that out make sure you
check that out on our Channel we have a
dedicated playlist on various mongodb
Concepts as well wherein we have covered
mongodb indexing as well so you make
sure you check that out now indexes
basically provide users with an
efficient way of querying data so if you
ran a query to find specific documents
let's say in a collection of thousands
or lacks of documents without any
indexes mongodb would have to search the
entire collection in order to find the
requested document in your query however
mongodb would use indexes if you had
them to reduce the number of documents
that needed to be searched in the
collection now there is an additional
you know part of indexing that is
covered queries so you've probably heard
that column indexing is an excellent way
to improve query performance by reducing
the number of disk access that are
required now covered queries is
basically a mongodb specific application
of field indexing in which all the query
columns are already indexed now it
basically avoids collection scan just
like the normal indexing so it allows
the database to search through less
document to satisfy a query without an
index mongodb has to scan through all
the documents to ensure it has answered
the query correctly now covered queries
are extremely fast because mongodb does
not have to examine any other documents
other than the ones that have been
indexed so it only examines document in
your query that you have provided the
indexing uh that you have provided the
fields that are already indexed
and finally fetching data becomes much
faster using you know covered queries
because uh covered queries return
results from an index directly without
having to access the source document and
are therefore very efficient as well
now there are case when you have to
consider when to use covered queries now
covered queries are only used when all
the fields in the query are part of the
index so let's say if you're trying to
find uh any field in your query it
should be a part of index that you have
already created only then covered
queries can come into picture or can be
used in a more efficient way
next is all the fields returned in the
query should be off are in the same
index now it can be a composite index it
can be a multi-key index but make sure
that the fields that you're returning in
a query should be in the same index and
finally no fields in the query are equal
to null that is field value should not
be null in in such case covered queries
will not be uh followed
now before getting into the execution
part let us just consider a simple
example on how query covered queries
Works in mongodb so let's say I have a
collection here which has three
different documents uh of various
customers like Rahul pranav and keerthi
and the orders that they have placed and
the various personal details like
address their payment mode email or the
total order items we have an array field
here wherein we are storing uh various
fields in order items like item name
like notebook paper general or postcard
and even their price and the quantity of
the items so we have three different
documents present in our collection here
now if I want to create a simple index
let's say I'm creating an index on
orders item field wherein I'm creating a
particular index on the price here so
and also payment mode I'm creating an
index so the query would be DB dot
orders.create index orders item dot
price I'm mentioning one that is in
ascending order the indexes is created
in ascending order and also for payment
mode I'm creating an index
now generally what you have to do is uh
what you do in general for indexing or
while querying your uh data that is
present in your collection is you just
mentioned the customer or let's say if
I'm trying to find the customer name
here that is Rahul if I consider this
example here it says DB dot orders dot
find customer Rahul orders item dot
price one payment code one now we are
providing the all the index field that
we have created that is audios item dot
price and payment code
but the query that I'm trying to find is
the data of customer here that is Rahul
which we have not indexed so let's say
I'm just having three uh documents here
now if there are let's say 10 000 10 000
documents that are present in collection
and maybe we have more than one Rahul in
such case it becomes difficult right
even the indexes uh is become an anomaly
here it is not as fast as what we have
thought here now instead of that I'm
just taking another query now let's say
I have created index on orders item dot
price and payment mode right now what
I'm doing is I am trying to return the
data or I'm querying for a data wherein
I'm trying to find the payment mode is
equals to card now if you look at
clearly into our you know index query
that you have created payment mode is
already included in the query Index
right we have already created earlier
and I'm trying to find it in the same
way so I'm trying to find payment Mode
card which is again already created
index which is payment mode so in that
case instead of looking through all the
uh data present in documents it will
simply look at only the ones which are
already indexed and that is the main
advantage of uh you know covered queries
it returns results from an index
directly without having to access any
Source document and it can be more
efficient uh more than just indexing
right so I hope you understood how you
know covered queries are actually
working in mongodb and let's just uh go
into mongodb shell now and get into the
execution part and understand it in a
more clear way and also finally we'll
analyze you know how this query is
working and how it is different from
indexing in mongodb
so as you can see mongodb shell has
started so the First Command would be is
basically the show DBS which will allow
us to show show all the database that
are presented on mongodb database so we
have the simply code one database so
we'll be using that only right use
simply code
so it says switch to DP we are good to
go now let us see the collections that
are present in this database so we have
different collections like collection
name employee marks and new employees so
let us just consider uh all uh I mean a
collection that we've already created
here which is employee so let's just
find the idea
details or the documents that are
present in this collection so I'm using
the V Dot employee dot find command for
that
so when you enter it will display all
the records or the documents that are
present in this collection
all right now let us now create a
covered query now creating a covered
queries similar to that of how you
create an index uh so the query would be
DB dot employee
dot create
and mention the create index keyword
make sure the I is capital otherwise it
will throw an error so let's just create
an covered index on the fields let's say
we have manager ID and Department ID
right so we'll be creating uh you know
covered query that is on this two Fields
so mention the field name that is
manager
ID
keep it as one
comma and Department ID as well
as well close the brackets all right and
click enter so as you can see it says
manager ID at the score one Department
underscore ID underscore one that means
you are successfully created you know
covered query on these two fields that
is manager ID and
Department ID so now let's query or read
data from this covered index so for that
we'll again use the find operation so
let's say I'm trying to find you know a
particular manager ID details right so
let's say I want to try find the details
of employees whose manager ID is 123 in
such case I'll use a query that is
DB Dot
employee Dot
find
and inside the brackets let's say
manager
ID
is 123 that I am going to search for
close the brackets and mention the
indexes that you have created here
which is again manage your ID
which is one
comma Department ID
which is again one here
close the brackets I think we are good
to go
so click on enter
so as you can see in the above query
when we find document where we are
trying to find manager ID which is 123
covered index which is on manager ID as
well as Department ID is already loaded
into the RAM and as we know that
so as we know that manager ID is already
present in a compound index that is why
it reads very quickly and we avoid
scanning of too many documents in
database
so this is just a basic example on how
to create a covered query so let's just
create a you know another field where we
understand how covered query exactly
works now let's say I'm trying to create
an index on the first name let's say
first name as well
so let's take
the query as DB Dot
create index
I'm just copy pasting it here and let us
create you know another index for our
you know collection for this so it will
be first name here all right first
name
close the brackets
so as you can see our query has been
successfully created now let's say I'm
trying to find the employee details uh
using this uh you know index that you
have created now so I'll just
so let's say I'm trying to find an
employee whose first name is Shelly Now
by default since I've created index on
manager ID as well as Department ID it
will be directly indexed and display in
a resultant cell so make sure you keep
the first name field also because we
have uh created the index for that as
well
so mentioned first name
as one
comma all right I think we are good to
go now let's just uh see the result for
this
so there was a bit error in the first
time that we are trying to retrieve uh
now Shelley which we have taken uh her
name in all caps which is not exactly
present in the same way in our you know
collection so make sure uh you keep the
name as exactly which is present in our
database which is capital S and the rest
of them are small caps here so when I
try to uh find the you know resultant
set for this the final output is the
first name which is hush name Shari and
we are getting the manager ID as well as
the department ID that she belongs to
which is manager ID is 101 and
Department ID is 110. now if you look at
this query covered index will not be
available when you use this following
query which is DB dot employee find
first name which is Shelley and we are
mentioning the indexes that we have
created for first name manager ID
Department ID because when we find a
document where first name is Shelley
which has covered index on uh basically
the first name manager ID and the
department ID which is already loaded
into the ram but by default uh you know
underscore ID is also present here that
is the field that is not present in the
covered index is also being displayed so
despite of
you know manager ID Department ID
present in our compound index we cannot
avoid scanning of too many documents in
our database so we need to exclude uh
you know underscore ID as well if you
are trying to use covered index so make
sure you include underscore ID in your
query as well
so the query now that would uh you know
followed as
with the help of uh you know indexes
that you have created make sure with the
first name keep the ID as 0 only then
top
who are mentioning underscore ID after
the department ID
keeping it as zero so let us just find
it now so as you can see we are only
retrieving first name Shelley manager ID
and Department ID and finally underscore
ID is being eliminated or dismissed from
this
so that was all about covered index guys
now you have to remember that covered
index does not work when field on which
we're trying to cover in covered indexes
an array or an embedded document that is
when you're trying to retrieve data from
a sub document or a field that is
present in an array field in such case
covered index won't work so let us now
try to understand how to analyze this
query now the performance of indexing is
very crucial for a database performance
right so we need to understand how it is
being executed you know in the backend
as well so for that we'll use the
explain command here so for that the
query is same guys just copy paste the
query that you have uh you know created
and after that mention the explain
keyword or which is the explain command
here
so there was a bit issue or error in the
uh you know copying this code guys so
I'm just copying paste uh the query that
we have written here which is a DB dot
embroidery find first name Shelley first
name manager ID Department ID and all
the indexes that I've created on and
finally you have to mention the explain
command here now analyzing queries is
very important aspect of measuring how
well or the effective the database and
the indexing design is so for that I'm
using the explain you know command here
which basically provides information on
the query indexes that you have used you
know the performance that is the time
that it has taken to execute your query
and other statistics so it is very
helpful when analyzing how well your
indexes are optimized uh you know while
you are using an indexing or a covered
query so let's just uh see how it works
here click on enter
so you can see it is displaying all the
details of you know the performance or
the optimization of the query that has
taken place in the background here
so you can see we have various Fields
you know listed in all this here you can
see the namespace index filter set as
false and all that now we are only
concerned with here is this stage input
stage is IX scan that is index scan the
short form for this is index scan so
basically that we have performed a index
scan on the query that we have uh you
know created in our resultant set so it
it basically says another condition
where you'll find this is a collection
scan that is collls and scan so you may
find that that is you are not providing
any index instead you are finding all
the documents one by one simultaneously
using a collection scan
that is another uh you know scenario in
which we consider you know the type of
scanning that you have done here and you
can also see that index name that we
have created that is first name and it's
multi-key it's it's false unique false
partial false and so on so it basically
indicates the number of you know
documents that have matched that are
returned here it indicates the total
number of documents that we have scanned
and indicates the total number of
documents or index entities that we have
scanned here all this you can find using
the explain operator here so what we're
going to do is so what's in it for you
so in this presentation we're going to
go through three key things you know
what is mongodb now how do you connect
to mongodb with node.js and mongodb is
part of the merge stack so we're going
to cover what the merge stack is and how
it applies to node.js so what is mongodb
so mongodb is a it's a probably the most
popular nosql database out there it's
cross-platform and very easy to scale
it's available on all Cloud systems you
can also run it locally which is what
we'll be doing later on in our demo but
it's just a very flexible database
environment for modern applications
it works on the concept of collection
and documents
um what you'll find is uh mongodb was
originally written in C plus plus and it
is what's referred to as a nosql
database so this is different to a
relational database which is built up of
tables with rows and columns this is a
nosql database as simply a lot faster
and more powerful for the work that
you're doing
and you're able to use mongodb very easy
you can actually go ahead and download
it we'll actually do that as part of our
demo so you know why connect node.js
with mongodb
well the reason why you want to do this
is that mongodb is a modern database
it's not restricted by the the the
challenges of scalability that all the
relational databases have it's really
designed for building mobile
applications and websites that scale
into the millions and millions of users
so mongodb probably the most important
feature is scalability the performance
of the database is phenomenal
and it is extremely highly available for
the solutions that you'll be creating so
when you push it out your solution to
the cloud you can almost guarantee it's
always going to be running
you also have the ability to be able to
scale to very large complex
multi-site Solutions we've had one of
the very first mongodb applications I
built was a multi-tenant environment and
it just worked really well
and you'll be able to easily deploy your
surgeons across Microsoft Azure AWS
Google Cloud
Etc so yeah why do you want to keep
connecting to mongodb um I think
probably
um one of the other areas that's
probably is often forgotten with manga
it's just the concept around big data
and you can I mean when you talk about
big data and you're talking about
absolutely massive massive databases and
mongodb is front and center for all of
that
you can do your effective content
management and delivery
um it has an effective mobile and social
infrastructure so by that it allows you
to be able to build out solutions that
can go to all modern day types of
applications and the data is actually
very easy to manage through your central
data hub
and then finally being able to connect
to mongodb is very easy
um particularly as there is a client
called Mongoose that makes the
connection extremely easy so you know
finally um let's kind of look into how
 DB is part of the Moon Stag
so Moon stack is a JavaScript stack and
it's of JavaScript solutions that are
built for modern single page
applications and there are four key
Solutions in the merge stack there's
mongodb which is your database Express
which is your server side HTTP
environment react which is the solution
for being able to create your Solutions
on the client and the node.js which
actually manages the whole environment
it's really an environment that's
designed to make it very easy to be able
to build out modern day Solutions so
mongodb is the am in Moon Express is the
E react is the r and node js is the n so
again as you start working with some of
our other videos that we have here
you'll be able to see how all of these
tools really complement each other so
we've done an introduction on DB
really the best thing now is to get you
out you know your hands dirty by
actually doing a demo so we're going to
go through a demo what I would strongly
encourage you however though is that
this demo really does build on a lot of
the other videos that we've done in this
series so you really do want to spend
some time on the node.js video the
node.js for Express video the node.js
for apis video really all of those
videos help complement the work that
you'll be doing with this video here
you'll see some real strong correlations
plus a lot of new content as well so
with that we're going to jump into the
demo
so let's give our demonstration on how
to use mongodb with node.js first thing
we want to do is go ahead and install
node.js so you're going to go and do
Google Search node.js and that should
bring up a result of going to nodejs.org
and here you can download node.js for
multiple platforms so Windows Linux Mac
OS they're all supported you can also
get the original source code and
recompile your version of node.js if you
want to
now we're just going to install the
windows version
and the next thing you want to do is
install your favorite text editor I'm
going to install Visual Studio code vs
code it runs on all leading platforms
Mac OS windows and Linux it is open
source you can edit it and I like it
because you can do an awful lot with it
just a lot of extensions it's just a
great tool all around
so that's the next thing you want to
install
and then we want to go ahead and we want
to go to
mongodb.com so we can install the
DB database
so you want to go to Software
Community server
and you want to then select
the
mongodb community server
which platform you want
and where it's going to connect with
and you want to select the download to
install that
and they'll take a moment or two for you
to download and get that up and running
once you've done that well we want to go
ahead and we're going to open up vs code
so we can start editing and the code
that we need for our new solution
so let's go ahead and create a folder of
our desktop that we'll use for mongodb
so I already have a folder created
called demo I'm just going to select
that and then inside there I'm going to
put in node mongodb
and select that folder
and that's going to open up vs code and
it's going to have our folder in here so
we're going to get rid of the welcome
screen we don't need that
we do want to however open up our
terminal window so we're going to run
that that's one of the things that I
really like about vs code is you can
actually have your terminal window or
command line window actually inside the
development environment you're working
in so you don't have to be jumping from
one solution to another and then we're
going to initialize our package so npm
in it for the folder that we're in it's
going to create our node package manager
it's going to create our default package
and we're going to hit return that's
going to go ahead and start the process
and we're just going to go with the
default settings
that npm is going to give so just hit
return return a few times and that will
get up and running for you
uh entry point for the application is
going to be index.js
oh yeah that's uh
JS package and there we have everything
this is just the uh the the Json package
that provides the instructions that npm
would use to pass the um the program now
you notice that we have index.js as our
leading file so we actually have to add
a new file here and we're just going to
Tool this one index.js so we actually
have a file that can be referenced
and now we're going to go ahead and
we're going to actually put in our
default application so Express is going
to be required so we're going to make
sure that that is included in our first
line of our instructions
and then we're also going to have a path
that's required
and
we're going to require handlebars
and these are all part of our Express
environment
and don't forget to save your file as
you're going along and we're also going
to have
Express pH BS
and this is going to be our Express
handlebars
and we're all going to
allow
insecure
prototype
you wouldn't normally do this but
because we're running everything locally
it just makes it easier for you to
actually get all the code in
thanks
and then we're also going to add in
a body parsa
and these are all the required solutions
that we need to be installed when you're
running this
package
and so let's save the file and then
let's go ahead and run it so we're going
to do npn install
and we do just Dash save and this will
install Express
and we're also have install path
uh handlebars
Express handlebars
um
and this is where we'll install the
prototyping
and we'll also have the body parser
installed and we're just going to run
that
this will just take a moment or two to
install
all right there we go
so we have everything installed which
allows us to now start working with our
Scripts
so we're going to create an app in
Express
foreign
and we're going to listen on Port 3000
and
we're going to have a message then go to
our console log
and we have everything running off our
local port on localhost on Port 3000 so
let's go and we're going to select node
index.js and shows us everything's
running
which is good you can actually test this
in our web browser if we wanted to
okay so let's start working on our app
so our app is going to
use body parser
and we're going to encode
uh request
and the goal here is we're going to
create a file that's going to go back
and forth
to mongos among two mongodb
so body parts is going to use Json to
encrypt
the content
and we're going to do a get command to
get our results
and if we worked if you've seen the API
video then we did that here in fact it's
probably a good idea to actually sit
down and look through some of the other
videos that we've created such as the
Json sorry the node.js node.js for
Express node.js for apis and node.js for
authentication before doing this video
we're going to create a default page and
it's going to say welcome to the
students database
the principles that we're putting down
here you'll be able to apply to any
solution that you're creating with
mongodb
and so we want to have a simple action
that we're going to
put on here which is going to be
click to gain access
okay we're gonna put in the path and
where to get the list from
okay
all right so here is our basic web page
that we're creating
nothing fancy
but it's going to take you to a place
where you can actually get all the
content now what we're going to do is
we're actually going to go and pull the
content from manga
so run this and we've got a proper web
browser you'll see what it looks like
let's just go to localhost
close out these other tabs don't need
them localhost 3000
and there we see welcome to the student
database click on the database and you
click on if we click on it now nothing
will happen so yeah nothing there
so let's make something happen
okay
all right so
again extending our app so what we're
going to do is we want to
set
the views
I'm going to do a join
our directory name
and app
engine
so let's go for our views we don't have
engine yet but let's go ahead and create
a new folder
we can call that one views and let's
expand that
actually that should be okay
HPS
Express handlebars
and we're going to allow prototype
access for our Express Santa Claus
so with Express handlebars if this is
new to you it allows you to separate
your content from your layout
which if you have developed with swift
for a mobile application on the Mac
using xcode is the same principle there
but for a web application
so we're just putting out here
some of our
uh default environment settings
and we're going to set our view engine
for handlebars
and just checking through our code it's
looking good
okay so that provides
that so let's create a new folder under
our views and this one we're going to
call layouts so again this is where we
are splitting our layouts
and we're going to have a folder called
models at the root of our application
and under models we're going to put in
db.js so the dbjs file is going to be
where we put our instructions for our
database and so here we're going to go
ahead and we're going to require to
import Mongoose and Mongoose is a tool
in node.js that allows you to connect to
mongodb
so we're going to require the use of
Mongoose and so we're going to do npm
install Dash say save mongoose
and that's going to run and install on
our local machine so we can actually
test this out
and once we've got this installed what
we're going to do is we're going to
start connecting to a database that
we're going to call student DB
okay we're orange already installed so
let's go Mongoose dot connect
and
we're going to call it mongodb
and
we're going to run this off our Local
Host
so we installed the community version
that I was just trying to file logo host
and it's going to run from the port
27017 I'm going to call this one student
DB
foreign
so again with our application we're
splitting out all the functionality so
if you want to reuse elements you can
so we're going to have a new user URL
parser
and we'll make sure we capture
everything correctly
okay so if there are a little send a
message to the console log
and we have either connection is
successful or if things go wrong
error in connection and then if there is
an error then what we'll do is we'll
have the error message posted
okay
and then we'll do require
[Music]
student
dot model so this will actually pull the
model we're going to create
and so what we're going to do now is
creating
under models we're going to create
student dot model
dot Js
and this is where we're going to do
our instructions for our student model
so first thing you want to do is we want
to import
Mongoose Express and the student model
so I've got X make sure we have
everything let's capture that
so let's go over to
our student model
all right so let's make sure that we
have everything so we want to have
mongoose
and
I'm going to create a new variable
called student schema this will allow us
to structure what our model will look
like and this will be a
a new
new schema
in using mongoose
and our new schema is going to be full
name
and we're going to break down
our
Jason's package so we're going to put in
the instructions for what
schema would look like so
we have the type we have a required this
field is required
and
second value is going to be email
type string
this field is required
that's the message error message you
want to send if
the field isn't filled out
mobile phone number this will be just a
number
and we're gonna have City
and subtype will be
let's just make this a string we're just
going to try and keep this simple for
right now
let's build this is required
all right so here's our schema
looking pretty good
all right Mongoose dot model
and connect this to our
student model
so we want to go ahead and save that
okay
a new folder and this new folder is
going to be called controllers
and we have a new file under controllers
and that new file is going to be called
student controller
dot Js
let's go in
see what we're going to add here
so we want to import uh make sure and
we're running Express
so Express is required for our
controller
we also want to have set up a variable
for router
so router Express dot router
and we want to make sure we're also
connecting with mongoose
so we have our connection to our mongodb
and we also want to make sure that we
have
connection to our student model
so Mungus Mongoose dot model
student model and this allows us to make
sure that we have
this student model
pulled over effectively for our
controller for our student controller
okay so let's go to router
get
I'm going to render this
and student slash add or edit
we'll come into that in just a moment
so we want to be able to
View Title and support in
the insert
student
I'm going to use under our views
we're going to create a new folder
and this one's going to be called
student
and we're going to create a new file and
this one will be add or edit
.js oh HPS sorry for our handlebar
so you notice we don't have to put the
file extension
um node.js manages all that for us
so router dot post
so this will be
our we're going to get our content and
then we're also going to post content so
the post will go back and it's part of
our body and there'll be an ID
so we want to then insert insert the
record that we'll be creating
so again if you've been if you've worked
through the node.js API video then
you'll start seeing if there's some
commonalities here of being able to
insert or update a record
and we actually cover that using just a
sample Json package this really takes it
to that next level
okay
okay so we want to put in a new student
record and so be student
and we're going to have that full name
it's going to come from our body
and we're going to also capture the
email
essentially we're going to follow the
model that we created
and our mobile phone
finally with a student City
foreign
and then we want to save the record that
we create
okay
all right so we're going to manage our
error message
and we're going to put in similar
messages that we've put in before
so we want to redirect to our student
list
and we're going to go ahead and create
that in a moment
so let's create a new file student
list.hbs
so list.hbs
and here
so what we do is with student list
that's actually going to manage then the
uh controls for being able to display
the records in the database
and then we'll put
a message if there's an error then you
know we'll put an error message there
and ask it to report the error message
I'm going to try and not do that
all right so
now the next step we need to go through
is we want to call a function to update
the record
and let's go in ahead and we're going to
update our records and we do the
student.find1 and update client
okay
okay so we will redirect to our student
list as needed if not we'll throw an
error message to our console log
foreign
looking good
and again this is just an example but
something that you'll be able to do
yourself
whether your own solution
and
then we want to like go back to our list
to then render
the records
here we want to put student and then how
we're going to find the record
[Music]
um
we'll throw a error message to our
console log
so as you can see we always throw an
error message to the console log
error messages are really useful
okay all right looks good
save that
okay let's do another router and this is
two
I'm going to do the router against ID
so allow us to get the content
so we'll be able to get information by
ID of the student
and what you can see is there's a lot of
the work we're doing here
is very repetitive
um and
you'll find as you create more modular
code that it makes it easier for you to
write your code and update and manage
your code
okay so we're going to
get out
View Title we're going to put that into
our document
okay
all right so our next router
is
we want to be able to delete our record
by ID
and so we're going to do is we're going
to find our records last stream record
and we just find it by ID
and then we'll just find by find ID and
remove
okay so we're gonna
to once we've removed your record we're
going to redirect to our list so we can
show our student list
and otherwise we'll send an error
message to our console log
okay
so I think we have what we need
maybe this maybe there's one more thing
I think we need to do
I think this is good
okay
so let's go to our layouts add a new
file there we're going to call this one
main layout
dot HBS
and here we're going to put the skeleton
of our web page together
let's
write this out so we've been
HTML code
and
we're just going to keep this real
simple
and I hit a
we want a title
and this is going to be students
database
students
so
we now go to
[Music]
try and find out bootstrap four we're
going to just grab that
and we're going to use
bootstrap to get started and there are a
couple of components there's a CSS
component and then there's the
JavaScript component so let's just go
copy the CSS component
and then we're going to just link that
into the header section of us
web page
so and then
here's an example of different
components you can create
if you're not used if you haven't used
bootstrap before it's an open source
framework they're originally developed
by Twitter great tool so in our header
we want to
put in the link to the CSS
as that
and
now I need to also
in our own styles
so we've got here some styles that we
created earlier on for
you can just paste those in
so we have a box style that we want to
use that will extend the Box style that
you get
with bootstrap
all right so we're going to start
working on our body content
plus BG info so this is actually BG info
is
a CSS class file from bootstrap that you
can use
and you have the ID of box
and again we're going to do
another class
which allows us for our table structure
so a little bit of knowledge of
bootstrap is great here
so what we're going to do now is going
to put in
the content which we're going to call
Body missile show up on the screen
so again if we're pulling from records
within bootstrap dig through bootstraps
lots of content there for you to be able
to take advantage of
okay
so now we want to be able to add or edit
a record
View Title
and the
um
the the the
French brackets allow you to be able to
pull records and content directly from
the code that we're writing
so playing title from insert record on
this part of our router
command
and then we'll put in our form
which will be student post
I'm just going to do a basic form here
nothing fancy
we will put in the first
record will be a hidden field this will
be for ID
so we want to also generate the ID we
don't want to assembly to put that in
and then we will put in
r
form elements
so we'll have first will be label
it'll be full name
be
an input field
so be text in the input field
and
again we're using form Dash control
which is from
bootstrap CSS and then we'll have
full name
and place order before name so if where
we have name there will actually match
up with
the value that we're putting in our
model
so here we have student for name
so we're matching everything up to the
model that we created
okay so let's do this for our remaining
form elements
and again as you see we can put this
together really quickly
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
group
and we'll be able to have the
type of
tool for putting in Mobile
so as you can see because we're using
just standard HTML here you can actually
reference external libraries such as
JavaScript libraries for formatting the
field that you're in regular Expressions
things like that
and let's put in our final value
which will be for City
and normally when I'd be writing this by
hand I would actually be copying pasting
sections of code and just changing the
values as necessary
just to make it easier on myself but
here I'm just typing out everything for
you so you can see the
the whole process
okay
all right so there are our values
of course remember save your files as
you're going along
everything looks good
and we're matching up our values
with our
records
and we want to have a button that allows
you to submit
we also want to have a button to select
view or if you want to be able to view
all the records okay
looking good
okay let's go back over to list now we
want to be able to pull our records so
this will display
the
of students
in a table
and
let's go ahead and format that table
so we're going to put together our
format here but then we're also going to
add buttons at the bottom so we can
actually add a record to the database or
if we want to add or delete a particular
record from the database
I'm going to call this one
create a new student record or our
student list
I'm just going to type all this in for
you
thank you
and you'll see how we put placeholders
for the values as we put them in
these are our table headers
okay
putting that body content
and what we're going to do here is we're
going to add in
an element that allows you to create a
row for each item listed
so if you have two or more items they'll
appear as an individual row
on here and again what we're doing is
we're pulling in the values to be able
to
pull from the model that we created
earlier on so this being the data that's
been submitted so we have it pull in the
value for the email full name
mobile and City
we're not going to show ID
so it's pulling out all of this data
that we created earlier on
so we have everything posted into our
list
as documents
so let's go into a HBS file
and it's our list
let's put in our
file entry here
this will be for City
then
this is just a placeholder
at the end
of the list
oh yeah you know what we're going to do
is we can add in
reference for the ID
so if we want to edit the document we
can
and then we want to do the same thing if
we want to delete the document
so href because
student
and then
just delete
now delete based on the ID
there we go
passing that instruction over
click
to
simple
I'm gonna ask him are you sure you want
to
delete that somebody clicks on the
record they hit cancel then won't get
deleted if they hit okay then it will
get deleted
this is what you can actually write
jsonline
okay
and then we want to close out where the
row will end so have each opens and
closes the record
just tying up some of the HTML there
save that
okay looking good
back to our root index file
so let's see now
we want to also require
our model
and then
we'll have our student controller will
also be
a require
of where it's going to pull the student
controller from
okay
and this is just the instructions on
where we can actually find
content
okay it looks good so let's do node xjs
everything's saved we're going to rerun
everything
and we got an error
let's go check out where our error came
from
so let's go and to our files
this is one that we created
so
error is in
June controller see where's the error
oh we need to
have our much we need to export our
module to our router
all right let's go open up
database
and we can just start
seeing where the records are
installing release updates here
foreign
that's the port
let's just double check that make sure
we're
completely aligned so here's our
database connection
and
there's our report and student database
and we did this with mongod Mongoose for
connecting to manga
so I'm going to connect
and here are where our records have been
stored
so we're going to create a database and
we're going to call this database
it's going to be called student DB
student DB has to be case sensitive
and the picture name is students
let's go ahead and create a database so
there we are there's our database
and
let's go we run our index.js file
and everything was successful
this is good
all right
so everything should have passed
successfully good good
database connection is good
so let's go to localhost
and here we are so we can start
achieving navigating through our
application
so we see we have our setup we have no
records
so let's go ahead and create one
and we go through you can actually start
stepping through the different layouts
that you've created so here's our layers
a separate to our code so there's some
spacing we probably need to add that so
let's go ahead and just add that
and let's rerun our code
this is the fun bits where you know
everything is
just tidying up okay so you know it puts
in one one space because we didn't put
in the actual HTML code for creating
multiple spaces
so we're going to go in and select
insert so let's put in
Smith and we'll do Smith at gmail.com
[Music]
and let's just put in I know random
phone number
there we go we don't have any formatting
so we could put anything in there and
the city uh
where am I
um this I'm in Delhi so submit that hit
submit and it takes us to a list and
voila
we actually have a list with a record in
now if we go back to our database we can
actually refresh it and now we actually
start seeing our records being created
and we see the ID is automatically
created and there's our records
okay let's go back
and now we can select edit we can edit
the record
so let's change our city to
Bangalore hit submit
all right city is now Bangalore
and if we want to we can
edit again
and so this is pulling in
you know if we do a delete It's Gonna
ask us do we want to delete
okay
a little bit of formatting apply there
and the records are all good so we had
to make that Smith change
but because we need to hit submit
wouldn't update the record
so we hit submit.w to the record
we hit delete it's gonna say are you
sure we say yes we are
and ah
it has
can grab that record okay so let's go
back into my code
and
because we have everything separated and
actually now just go to our student
controller
and we'll find out Delete and you guys
delete now we had a
uh we had a couple of minor errors there
this is where it's good to test out your
code
okay let's run that again
and refresh everything
go to our database we're gonna go create
a new entry
let's call this one with some John John
gmail.com
we will put in the phone number
you see the the formatting is just
playing from
um
are uh bootstrap so there we have
there's John do we want to delete let's
say yes
easy there we go also
and we hit refresh the record should be
gone yep it is
and so we've created an application
where we can update applications
we can create an application we can list
all the items and we did all of this
using uh just open source Solutions
through node.js and I was with using
express some of the components come with
Express
mongodb for our database and then
Mongoose to connect to our database
okay everyone so we will go ahead with
the next set of interviews which is
related to your angular
so angular is as popular as I can react
okay so there are some questions which
are usually asked like what are the data
binding
okay so the data binding is actually the
process which allows the
application
okay to have some data associated with
your
HTML page
from your typescript classes or the vice
versa
okay so the data binding is the one
through which you bind the data okay so
you can see here it says like angular
uses two-way data binding when the
changes happens in a model it will be
affected in a view and whether changes
happens review it will affect the model
also so it is used to
typically keep the model and view in
sync with each other to have the data
interchange
what is the typescript typescript is a
typical
I would say a language which is used
by angular okay to develop angular
component Services pipes decorators and
multiple things it is a superset of
JavaScript and it supports JavaScript
libraries and apis it is a pure object
oriented in nature uses object-oriented
principles better development time fast
to load and additional features to the
JavaScript for sure
okay what is an aot compilation how it
is different from jit aot stands for
ahead of time compiler which is
converting all angular and HTML and
typescript code into the JavaScript code
during the build phase before the
browser downloads and run the code Okay
so aot
is far more faster and light weighted in
the size just in time compiler is a by
default compiler Okay so
it is a process where the compiling
computer code is the machine code during
the execution of runtime
so this ensures the faster rendering the
browser it also known is called Dynamic
compilation
are we clear so when you want to develop
this aot compiler you always use hyphen
hyphen aot
okay so here you always use jit compiler
because that is a by default compiler
you use when you say NG build
next what are the pipes in angular so
pipes means that their decorators they
never change their default value but
just for the representation purpose they
change the values okay to look more
better the way they always want
okay so pipes are ready made or else it
can be customized created angular also
comes with lot many predefined pipes
okay like it comes with the pipe symbol
here okay so you can change the pipes
together it can be provided with some
arguments at the runtime with the colon
sign
okay now you pass the input you put the
pipe and get some result
with some decorated outcome now you can
see the pure pipes uses the pure
functions
clear so this pipe doesn't use any
internal State and the output Remains
the Same as long as the parameters pass
to stay the same angle calls the pipe
only when it detects the changes in the
parameters being passed a single
instance of the pure pipe is used
throughout the all components
okay so this is how you see how the
pipes are being used so we have defined
the pipe okay which is the value called
true in Fall for the pure and giving the
class by implementing pipe transform so
you can see here the impure pipes for
the say for every change detection
actually happens in an angular and
impure is called
with regards to the changes in the input
fields
okay they will be calling every time so
multiple pipe instances are created for
the C for these pipes and push pass to
these pipes can be mutable by default
all pipes are pure only if you want to
make it impure you always say like pure
colon true
or
pure colon false
now what are the promising observables
in angular see promises it is a typical
JavaScript object okay it it emits a
single values at a time they execute
immediately after the creation and not
cancelable they are pushed error to the
child promises
okay where the observables are only
executable when subscribed to them they
won't call unless you subscribe to them
using subscribe methods so they help
perform operations like it for each
filter and retrieve and everything when
you unsubscribe this they won't get
called and won't listen anymore
what are the form controls and the form
groups see the form controls and form
groups these are two predefined objects
comes with your
angular
so these all text boxes
from you take the input it may be radio
buttons it may be the drop down it may
be the check boxes are called form
controls
okay so form controls is a class that
enables the validation for every single
input class whichever you are creating
it now so they check the values which
are touched untouched or the dirty
clear now we talk about called form
group they are basically forming a group
which
under which you have a call relevant
Fields joined together are called what a
form group
okay so form group class represents a
group of controls like you talk about
address contains city state and pin code
these all three can be together called
as a form group
okay so the form group class basically
returned true if all controls are
basically what the valid
okay and they are designed to provide
all the necessary validation errors
what is the eager and what is a lazy
loading
okay so eager loading means what it is a
default module loading strategy followed
in an angular
Eagle loadings are used before the
application starts
these are typically useful for the small
scale applications
lazy loading however is designed for
dynamic loads of features only on demand
this makes your application far more
faster so in a bigger application we
really don't make easy eager loading
because it hamper the performance and
you want only when the client asks you
want to use lazy loading
what existing interpolation in angular
see string interpolation is written
under the double curly braces it is a
typically One Way binding where you get
the data from the typescript classes and
display directly over your browser it
denotes with the curly process and it
always display the data comes from the
component to the view hello this is
Matthew and we're going to be going
through some of the simple questions
that you would be asked during a node.js
interview what we're going to do is
we're actually going to break out the
section into three key areas that'll be
beginner questions there will be an
intermediate questions and advanced
questions and the expectation is as you
go through this video is that these
questions could be pushed together as
you're going through the interview kind
of think of it like this is if you've
answered the beginner questions that you
would get asked at the beginning of the
interview with confidence and Surety
then the client is going to then jump to
those intermediate Advanced questions
quite quickly and they're looking for
people who can help them serve and solve
their problems at that more intermediate
and advanced level so let's just get
started so the first question you're
probably going to be asked is you know
you know what is node.js you know do you
know what it's for and essentially
node.js is and one of the most popular
if not the most popular uh open source
cross-platform JavaScript programs and
it allows you to build out web
applications that run on the server it's
extremely flexible it allows you to
implement a lot of solutions outside of
just the the core programming runtime
and it allows you to build Solutions
extremely quickly in an open source
mindset for devops
it is used essentially for creating
client-sized web applications
we'll see this later on and you may want
to talk a little bit about using
express.js and how you can build out
apis to work with node.js and connecting
to databases such as mongodb
and that is also really good for being
able to store a data intensive
applications that are asynchronous and
event driven in their model and this is
important when you're talking about
creating applications that can scale
rapidly
so you can then ask be asked you know
how does node.js work well node.js
itself is actually built on the V8
engine and the V8 JavaScript engine is
the same engine that runs JavaScript in
your Chrome web browser extremely fast
it allows for high output and
non-blocking uh through your i o input
outputs and is is single threaded event
Loop
so you're going to be a van asked you
know where can you use node.js and and
the reality is the applications for
node.js keep expanding but there are
some core applications that you can work
with node.js right now so such as web
applications distributed system and
network applications uh probably
referencing the web applications is a
really good starting point because here
you can actually talk about maybe some
examples that you've done where you're
building out some of these web
applications indeed one of the things
that you want to be consistently doing
and preparing your answers with is
examples of work that you have done now
it doesn't matter if those examples are
purely experimental or training examples
that you've done the fact that you've
actually worked with node.js and created
a distributed system or a web
application is really valuable because
it shows that the person that you're
meeting with that you have knowledge and
understanding and practical experience
of applying the theory of working with
new Js with the practice of working with
node.js
so we asked about you know your answer
and essentially the i o refers to the
transfer of data in and out of a system
and that's really it you know there's a
reason why Google calls that conference
i o it's the transfer of data in and out
of our brains at that conference the
application is same here it's about
moving data in and out of systems
through using node.js and that every um
event can be tracked and whether it's on
a physical device a network or files
within a system again it's input and
output
so let's go through and you know you're
going to be asked you okay and you
explain the difference between front-end
and back-end development and this is a
question that I can ask a lot when I'm
meeting with clients and you know people
get really confused about what is the
difference between front-end and
back-end development bottom line front
end is what gets resolved inside of your
web browser or the app on your mobile
device backend is what gets resolved
essentially um what we call the the back
office or server-side applications but
that's becoming more and more synonymous
for what gets running the cloud
so web applications
um really get a lot of the functionality
of a web application gets run in the
front end and I think with CSS HTML5 uh
client-side JavaScript so we can get
right in the front end everything else
such as connecting to a database gets
run behind the scenes in the back end
and so you know anything that's going to
have like Graphics is going to be on the
front end apis are going to be run on
the back end and then just finally some
of the scripting languages are using on
the front end so HTML CSS JavaScript
those are all Common Core scripting
languages that you would use you can use
Frameworks such as angularjs and
react.js or View and those would be a
front-end Frameworks uh back-end
Frameworks will include Java PHP Python
and node.js are some of the back-end
Technologies you'd also throw in their
dot net as well I mean it's just the
whole you know Litany of front-end and
back-end Technologies and Frameworks
that you can use and this is a actually
a good point to kind of explain the
experience you have outside of just
working with node.js but other
technologies that you've been working
with that potentially that the client is
also using
so another question you're going to be
asked when you're looking at node.js is
you know can you tell me about npm and
so when somebody asks you what is npm
the first thing you're going to respond
is do you mean node package manager and
the reason why you want to respond like
that is that you want to qualify that
question with understanding that you
know what they're talking about but you
want them to verify that and so node
packet manager is npm
and it's responsible for packaging all
of your modules that you're working with
in node.js and we have a whole series of
videos that we've done on node.js and
every single one of them includes
references to npm
so you're going to be asked you know so
okay you tell me um what it is you know
can you go into a little bit more um
details you know so you can provide two
main functionalities and so one of them
is being able to manage online
repositories or modules and packages
um so you can go to like
search.nodejs.org and you can find a
packages that you can install Into Your
solution such as express.js and it also
provides a command line utility that
allows you to manage your packages very
quickly through terminal window or
command line
I use vs code a lot Visual Studio code
and it has a command line utility built
right into it that allows me to interact
with npm
so what are some of the modules in
node.js and so you know modules
um in node.js they're essentially like
JavaScript libraries so you can think of
some of the JavaScript libraries that
you may have used the functionality is
somewhat the same but they're designed
for node.js and to run on the server and
there are ways in which you can go ahead
and create some of those modules so for
instance if we're creating a web server
you can actually use the require
commands to be able to require that the
server be there so the example we have
on the right hand side shows that we
really do need to have HTTP which is a
web server and we require that to be
installed and so that if you're running
that npm package it will actually
install the HTTP server and then you can
actually write some code to actually
then listen on the localhost port 2000
for where you'll be running your app
application
and there are just you know there's a
whole bunch of modules like I come with
node.js right out of the gate and here
are some of the modules that you have
and we also referenced that just earlier
on HTTP is a core module for uh running
a web server uh you have a utility
function that is useful for developers
to assess features within your node.js
project you have a URL module for any
URL passing you'd be doing
and you also have a stream which allows
you to be able to stream data in and out
of your system and be able to manage how
that's been worked and then zlib which
allows you to compress and decompress
files so that you can keep your storage
of files to a minimum
so a question you're going to be asked
is you know why is node.js being
preferred over backend Technologies such
as Java and PHP and particularly with
gyro it's a very mature stable language
it's been around for more than 20 years
you know PHP
um runs some of them the most powerful
and largest websites out there such as
Facebook so why would you use node.js
well the first response is kind of a
gimme but it is really fast and if you
watched any of the videos that we've
done on node.js building out Solutions
and developing the solutions you'll see
just how fast it is the second is the
really kind of the secret sauce with
node.js is the node package manager and
no package manager allows you to install
additional functionality such as Express
or as a database into your
solution really quick green and there's
over 50 000 bundles available for node
package manager
if you're building out a real-time
application that's data intensive and
you need to have apis quickly developed
then node.js is another great it's
really the great solution for you it
allows you to build out these Solutions
really quickly
and there is a easy synchronization
between the server and the client due to
the code base
and then finally because the structure
of node.js is Javascript if you are
making the pivot from being a front-end
web developer to node.js it's just going
to make it a lot easier for you to pick
up node.js because you have that common
language of JavaScript and on top of
that JavaScript is the world's most
popular scripting language
so let's talk about some of the
differences between angular node.js and
so and the reason why this question may
come up is the person interviewing you
is seeing whether or not you do know the
difference between a front-end framework
and a back-end framework and this is one
of those questions where you can go well
there are differences but the
differences are because they complement
each other so angular is a front-end
development framework whereas node.js is
a server side in framework are the
differences though between the actual
Frameworks themselves is that angular is
written in typescript which is a
modification of JavaScript node.js is
written in C and C plus plus
anger is used for building out single
play client-side web applications and so
that's a keyword there is client side
whereas node.js is about building out
fast and scalable server-side Network
applications uh so uh again the two
complement each other
uh angular splits web applications into
the MVC and model view control
components whereas node.js generates a
lot of database crazy it does more than
that as well but you can think of
node.js as that glue to your database
so let's talk a little bit about when
you're connecting to a database with
node.js and so you're going to probably
asking what is the most popular database
used with node.js and there are a couple
mongodb is largely the most popular
nosql cross-platform database MySQL is
also very popular and that's a more
traditional relational database
you would go with mongodb for really
more modern solutions when you're
looking at creating an application
that's going to really scale into just
managing masses and masses of data that
has to be created red updated and
deleted very very quickly
for some of the other popular libraries
that you use for node.js Express JS is a
very popular one and I really like
working with express.js allows me to
build out web applications really
quickly more importantly it allows me to
build out apis very quickly and which
you know apis are essentially web
applications themselves but being able
to do that very quickly with a framework
like express.js is very useful uh
Mongoose is an application that makes
connecting to a database really
easy so here is an example of express.js
which is a in itself really a flexible
but a solution that you can do lots with
and Mongoose which is a more focused
solution which allows you know to you
make it easier to connect to your
databases
so you know what are the pros and cons
of working with node.js there's lots of
ways we explain this earlier on that you
can actually build out applications that
run on the cloud why would you you know
what's uh the pros and cons so a pro is
that node.js is extremely fast at
processing thing and event based model
uh it really is fast I can't is if you
have something that is a very heavy
computational task it's not so good at
that now I will caveat that this is that
node.js is getting better all the time
and so you might have to be provide an
example of what a very heavy
computational task is and that may be uh
calculating a risk on an insurance
application against many many variables
that maybe something that's seen as
computationally very heavy but what you
can do in that example is you can then
offload the task to another Solution
that's designed for it and use apis to
pass the data back and forth Pro
JavaScript is used for building out your
applications with node.js great lots of
people know JavaScript
a restriction and again this is evolving
as JavaScript itself evolves is that
when you do a callback you may end up
doing lots of nested callbacks um if
you're doing something that's very
complicated again another way around the
con and so this is one of the things
that I always look for is if you have a
blocker or a barrier
how do you get around that barrier and
so for instance when you're talking uh
to your recruiter
you can say look the reason why I use
node.js is that it's fast it's event but
it's driven I can use JavaScript there
are some challenges and but what I do to
get around those challenges are and
that's where you can say that you know
you may run the complex script off and
you may write that in net or Java or PHP
and then use an API to do the response
back into node.js so you get the
benefits of Both Worlds but minimize the
investment in having to manage a complex
environment such as Java versus a
relatively simple environment with
node.js the node package manager makes
it extremely easy to access just an
awful lot of functionality with over 50
000 packages there's a package for that
so from being able to have a tool that
creates unique identifiers that you
might need to have for generating
content that gets posted into a database
through to being able to connect to
databases through you know to running so
many different solutions and the npm
package manager with its access to so
many different packages makes it great
for getting access to all that content
now Khan is working with relational
databases with node.js isn't as easy as
a nosql database now you can do it and
there are ways around that and what I
would do when this question comes up is
always kind of pivot to say hey this is
how you can actually then get around
building out that application
designed for streaming huge amounts of
data in and out a con is that node.js is
single threaded and so it can be CPU
intensive but again there are ways
around that and a good way around that
is getting your solution and elastic
environment such as the cloud
so what is the command used to import an
external library and so to import an
external Library the command is the
require command and so an example we
have here is you can assign a variable
and the variable is going to be for HTTP
and you're going to then require the
HTTP service and that means that the
application itself won't run unless the
external Library the HTTP library is
installed
okay so those were our introductory uh
questions for node.js this kind of pivot
and take a look at the intermediate
questions that you would be asked
so what does event driven programming
mean so event driven programming means
that if something happens something else
will happen in response so for instance
if you click a mouse that Mouse click is
an event that means something has to
respond to that event uh just think of
it as cause and effect it's just the
basic motion of physics so that's what a
vent driven programming means
you also look at it as a callback
function so that when an element is
executed something will happen in
response
so what is an event Loop in node.js so
an event Loop in node.js is when you do
an asynchronous call and what that
essentially means is that you are
sending out data and then a non-blocking
input output from node.js is pulling
data back in
what is an event emitter in node.js so
an event meta has really two areas of
focus one is that it manages uh the
classes that hold all the objects within
your event and we have an example of
this on the right hand side and then
whenever an event actually is thrown the
functions are then called on that event
synchronously so for instance we have in
our example on the right hand side we
create an event and then we have the
functions and the executed in a series
from that event
so let's talk about the API functions in
node.js so there are two types one is an
asynchronous non-blocking function and
the second is a synchronous blocking
function and the difference between the
two of them is asynchronous is that
there is no structure to the order
if I have the API is resolved
synchronous means that when the feedback
from the API is received you have to
execute the response in a series for how
the response is sent to you
so what is a package Json file so the
package Json file is at the heart of our
node.js package when we actually will
initialize a solution a folder to be in
node.js package
you'll find that the package itself
holds all of the metadata that's
particular to the project you're working
on such as project name version
requirements it is you have to have it
installed in the root of the directory
for the project and again look at any of
the videos that we have on node.js we do
have demonstrations within those videos
that actually then go through and break
out how to create that root package and
you'll see how you can actually then go
ahead and update the instructions or the
metadata within the package so here we
have an example of what that metadata
looks like so again this kind of
continues that question of what is a
packet Json file and you maybe ask you
know what is the metadata and why is it
important and the metadata is a basic
Json collection of pairing of a key
details such as name version description
and then and the custom version that you
put so for instance under name you could
create a name for your project there
can't be any spaces what is the version
and the description and what is the main
or starting path and for the solution
typically that would be index.js but it
could be anything.js but index.js is
typical simply because
index.html is the starting point for a
typical web application
so how would you use a URL module in
node.js
so with a URL module what it allows you
to do is really two things one is that
it provides the resolution passing of a
URL for Utilities in your application
and then it allows you to extend your
module with built-in Solutions and split
up the web address into a readable
format
so in this example we have the URL and
the response it would would give for
that URL which will then be a year and
month and it'll be in a readable format
so they would read out as 2020 and then
the month
so what is express.js and you've heard
me mentioned this a couple of times in
the video and we actually have a
separate video on express.js
um I would express.js is a web
application framework that allows you to
build out Web Solutions for both mobile
and traditional desktop right inside of
node.js so it's very easy to use
and being able to install and web.js is
as simple as requiring Express to be
installed in the example that we have
here on the screen it's a full solution
of showing how to actually build out a
solution with web.js so in this example
you start off the first two lines
required Express to be installed and the
store comes from node packet manager
then we have a simple application that
will then send to the browser window a
hello world message confirming that
Express is up and running and then the
third block of content starting with
virus server actually will Define the
port where your application is going to
run so in this instance the port is
going to run on localhost and the port
will be Port 8081 and so you can
actually go to localhost colon 8081 and
when you do that that will trigger the
Apple application that will forward up
the message hello world and it's all
coming from express.js
so what are streams in node.js so
streams are objects that allow you to
read and write data continuously back
and forth within your application and
there's really four different types of
streams there's readable writable duplex
and transform
the readable one strength for which data
can be read
the writable streams that you can
actually write to a duplex is a stream
where it is both readable and writable
and transform our streams that can be
manipulated the data while it is being
read or written
so how do you update and delete a
dependency so say for instance we want
to install something like Express so if
you wanted to install Express what you
would do is you would just write them
inside of your project you want to go to
terminal window and write in the command
npm install Express
if you want to update the dependencies
within your node package manager to
update all of them all you have to do is
write the command npm update all
dependencies
and then if you want to explicitly
uninstall a dependency such as
express.js that's using the uninstall
command and so that would again be going
to terminal window and you would type
npm uninstall Express
and again it's really easy to create a
simple server in node.js that will run a
simple command the HTTP service is
actually built into node.js you don't
need to use express.js I typically use
express.js when I want to do a web
server because typically what I find is
that I will want to go and do something
more complicated but if you want to do
something that illustrates just the core
functionality within node.js you can
actually just require the core HTTP
service that actually comes as part of
node.js and then you can actually then
go ahead and tell it to create a service
and then to write in plain text I
command or text string such as this case
it'll be hello world and that would pop
out and then the final line is to then
listen that if you go to a web browser
that's on
port127.0.01 or localhost and go to Port
colon 8080 once you actually go to that
that will trigger this application and
you'll get the text hello world pop up
on your screen
so explain synchronous and non-blocking
apis in node.js
so all the apis in node.js are
asynchronous which means that they are
non-blocking which means you can run
them continuously and scale around that
which is just fantastic it's one of the
reasons why node.js can scale so fast
and the eighth means that the apis can
return data send data after it's been
called and really increase the
efficiency of events as they are
triggered Within node.js
so how do you implement async and
node.js and so the example that we have
on the left hand side allows us to
trigger async and it's using the async
function and as you can see in this
example it's actually something that can
be done very quickly in this example
we're actually making a command to logo
host and an app that's running on Port
3000 and then depending on what we get
if there's an error message and then
we'll have error message go to the
console log which is the terminal window
and if we get a response to an
application then we'll actually get a
positive response which would be fetched
response so again very quick and easy
that you use the async function to be
able to build out and you to get your
asynchronous code
so what is the purpose of module exports
so a module export is a way to
encapsulate your the entire code for a
solution in a single package in a single
file and then you can then share that
with other developers so you're all
working from the same environment
so what is a callback function in
node.js a callback function is
essentially that once you run and you've
triggered an event and the response has
been given uh you want to be able to
then have a callback to validate that
the task is complete bongodb has
consistently been ranked as one of the
top five noise scale database Management
Systems so if you're someone who's
applying for the position in database
management roles you will almost
certainly be working with mongodb at
some point now whether you are upgrading
your skills or interviewing for a
database management position using
mongodb it's a good idea to be familiar
with the most frequently Asked mongodb
interview questions and answers in the
latter case it is beneficial for you to
prepare for the interview so that you
are not caught off guard even if you are
just interested in learning about
mongodb for the sake of upskilling keep
in mind that acquiring this kind of
knowledge may lead you to looking for a
better job which means you'll be facing
an interview sooner on that note every
one welcome to Simply coach YouTube
channel I hope you guys are doing good
and staying safe in this tutorial we'll
be discussing some specially curated
mongodb interview questions that you
must Master to crack your next interview
so firstly let us discuss the agenda now
this mongodb interview question is
intended to give you a general idea of
the types of interview questions you
might face now we'll be covering some
theoretical as well as practical
questions in this tutorial now typically
recruiters begin with simple questions
and gradually increase the difficulty
level so in this mongodb interview
questions tutorial we'll start with the
basics and the progress to more complex
questions now before we begin with the
types of questions that are being asked
here's a simple and quick tip for
everyone who's watching this video now
make sure you have the never give up
attitude I know it's that time of year
where placements are going in a rampant
way but and I know you might be giving
interviews uh regularly and what if you
didn't get an offer in one of the
interviews from that so make sure you
have that attitude of never give up and
prepare for your next interview and
whenever you're giving an interview make
sure you are interactive being
interactive is one of the most best or
best way you can say in order to get uh
you know hired by the recruiter so make
sure you're conversing properly with the
interviewer while asking the questions
and finally behave professionally which
is another key aspect while giving an
interview so let us now discuss the
first question which is the basic
question which will be asked which is
explain what is mongodb and its features
so this is how you can answer mongodb is
basically an open source cross platform
nosql document oriented database
management system now nosql pen can be
utilized as a substitute for traditional
relational databases like SQL and MySQL
which is dependent on the SQL language
right so if you want to work with large
data sets of distributed data then nosql
databases may be quite supportive which
are used to store large volumes of data
are in the form of documents which will
offer the developers the flexibility to
work with the evolving data models as
there is no fixed schema in this now
relational databases such as MySQL and
Oracle store data in tables and rows
right they are based on a branch of a
theory known as relational databases now
these relational databases are
structured and tables can be linked with
each other via a foreign key which is a
property of relational database which is
asset property which is being Satisfied
by the relational database but whereas
the mongodb being a documented oriented
database it can handle only that sort of
information and store as well as
retrieve information from these
documents only it provides the
flexibility as well as scalability that
you want with the querying and indexing
according to your requirement this
mongodb basically is based on json-like
documents where we store all the
information in that so this is how you
can answer the question which is what is
mongodb and its feed just
well the next question is what are some
alternative nosql databases to mongodb
now we have various Alternatives from
mongodb such as Cassandra Apache
Cassandra is a free and open source
distributed nosql database management
system which is again similar to that of
mongodb to handle large amounts of
unstructured data across the servers
providing High availability with no
single point of failure Apache Cassandra
is a database which can be a right
choice when you need scalability and
also High availability without
compromising performance next we have
redis redis is actually another uh
popular nosql database which is an open
source which is implemented as a
distributed key value store with
optional durability it can be also used
as a catchy add-on message broker also
we have other types other popular nosql
databases like Amazon Dyno dynamodb
Apache headspace and neo4j now HP second
is an open source non-relational
distributed database guys it is
generally written in JavaScript and it
is also developed as part of the Apache
software foundation so these are some of
the examples and can be used in
alternative to mongodb
all right let us now move to the next
question which is what type of nosql
database is mongodb now in general we
have four different types of categories
when we talk about in which category
mongodb comes utter so basically we have
key value column based document database
and graph database now when I talk about
key value these database store data as
an index key and value pairs this
database is stored data in a schema-less
way example of a key value data store
include Cassandra redis dynamodb and Etc
next we have column based now column
based or column store type of database
is the one where these databases are
designed to store data as Columns of
data rather than as rows as data if it
stores in a row type of data it becomes
a traditional which is not a noise
database right so again example of a
column store databases are hbase even
Cassandra comes under the column based
as well next we have the document data
base which is actually the type of nosql
database that we are looking for which
is mongodb now document databases had
designed to store documents with each
document having a unique key and popular
document databases are couch base and
mongodb and finally we also have a graph
type of database where they are based on
graph Theory so these databases have
basically designed for data which needs
to be represented as graphs so the data
that is present in this sort of database
is interconnected with multiple number
of relationship between them in in the
form of graphs and trees and a popular
graph database is neo4j as well as big
data so this is what mongodb is and it
comes under the document database type
of noise scale database the next
question is how does mongodb store data
now data in mongodb is stored in based
on documents or the Json style data
structures documents contain one or more
fields and each field contains a value
of a specific data type so mongodb
stores data records as documents which
are in the form of based on documents
which are gathered together in
collections so these documents as we
said earlier has a sub specific data
types including let's say arrays normal
General data and these documents tend to
share a similar structure which are
organized as collection so you can say a
group of documents are kept in a
collection it may be helpful to think of
documents as in a comparison to the rows
in a relational database so fields are
similar to columns and collections are
similar to tables in mySQL database
which is again a no it's a relational
database so this is how mongodb stores
data the next question is mongodb is a
schemailers database if yes how do you
create schema in mongodb now the scheme
of a data base describes the structure
of the data to be stored right in a
relational database the schema defines
its tables its fields in each table and
the relationship between each field and
each table so if you take SQL as an
example which is a schema based database
right so in schema is defined by the
tables and the fields that is the
columns and rows that are present in it
and the relation between them
on the other hand we have mongodb now in
documented oriented databases like
mongodb data is stored in collections of
key value pairs now given that Json is a
schema free data structure and that
mongodb depends on it it would be more
accurate to say that it has a
dynamically typed data so whenever you
create an insert a document to create a
schema it will automatically create one
for you so whenever a document is added
the database will automatically create
the corresponding collection
the next question is how is mongodb
different from SQL and better than MySQL
now mongodb is again a documented
oriented nosql database which is used to
store high volume of data and which
needs to process your huge data in a
quick session now it is a database that
came into picture around the mid 2000s
and it is again considered into the
category of a nosql database whereas
when you take SQL SQL is a programming
language used to communicate with and
manipulate relational databases for
example MySQL now there are quite
differences between both of these
databases basis right being being one as
a relational database the other being
relational and non-relational database
there are quite differences between them
so for example if you take the structure
in SQL data is represented in tables
whereas the data is represented in
documents and this further documents are
stored in collections now schema again
SQL has a predefined schema so whenever
you are creating a table you need to
predefine its schema whereas mongodb
does not have the implications of
specifying any schema before working on
it so it has basically a dynamic schema
next we have this scalability the data
in SQL can be vertically scalable and
when it comes to mongodb both horizontal
and vertical scalable of scaling of data
is possible when I talk about
transactions SQL also supports Atomic
operations and follows asset properties
whereas Bongo DB does not have proper
support for transactions and it follows
cap theorem and finally the type of
operations now some operations that we
perform in relational databases like SQL
for example SQL supports join operation
whereas we don't have the same sort of
join operation and mongodb so in this
way mongodb is different from SQL and in
some ways it is better than MySQL in
terms of processing a lot of
unstructured data and also has certain
features like replication sharding and
mapreduce and some of more critical
features that are not present in MySQL
well the next question is what are the
different data models in mongodb now
data models are categorized into two
types the first one is embedded data
model the next one is referent data
model now if I talk about Emirate data
model embedded documents capture
relationship between data by storing
related data in a single document
structure whereas reference data models
store the relationship between data by
including any links or references from
one document to another
moving on to the next question the next
question is how does indexing Works in
mongodb now a good indexing strategy be
it a relational database or a nosql
database it is essential for ensuring
that your database returns your results
as quickly as possible now mongodb
indexing is a special data structure on
which the index is created to hold the
data of a specific fields in a document
now in the absence of indexing in
mongodb there is a need to scan every
collection which is basically a
collection scan so mongodb indexes make
it unnecessary to perform a collection
scan which involves looking through
every document in collection from
matches to your query it also provides
effective indexing strategy now any
collection in mongodb can have one or
more indexes and those indexes can be
made on one or more multiple Fields And
even through throughout a mongodb
database so you need a good indexing
strategy to quickly add let's say
effectively access the data you required
from it and it also provide search
efficiency now indexing is a necessary
operation in mongodb which will bring
search efficiency in various execution
of statements so this is how indexing
Works in mongodb
so moving on to the next question what
is mongodb replication and sharding now
if I talk about replication replication
means duplicating the same data across
multiple mongodb servers so the main use
of replication is the data is available
at an instant way that is high
availability of data and it also
supports data redundancy and multiple
copies of of the data are being saved
across servers and also it provides data
recovery and backup options as well so
in a nutshell you can say that database
replication is the process of copying
data from one database in one server to
another database in another server
ensuring that the same data is available
on more than one mongodb server so again
the main purpose of using replication is
data redundancy and high availability so
by keeping data several copies or
replica stored on physically separate
servers it will ensure that the data is
protected and it is also accessible
whenever we need and also by generating
multiple copies of your data replication
enables you to increase data
availability which is also another
important factor this is especially
helpful if a server fails so in that
case you can use the replication and
finally you can also recover the data
that is lost due to any uninterrupted or
any hardware failure issues
now if I talk about shading sharding is
also similar to that of replication but
it is a method of Distributing data
across multiple databases and mongodb
supports this deployment of data with
having large data sets and high
throughput via sharding
so let's take an example so you can give
an example to the recruiter like this
let's say I have a database having two
million users and it has a capacity
which is 2 million records now what I'm
doing is I'm basically Distributing the
data across multiple databases and I'm
storing different data in different
databases now we have two machines which
has one million user capacity and
another one million user capacity
so in this way you can add more and more
multiple databases in order to store
your data
so by adding more capacity to a single
server such as adding more memory and
processing units or adding more RAM on a
single server that can be done using
sharding
let us now to move on to the next
question which is explain horizontal and
vertical scaling now vertical scaling
refers to adding more resources like CPU
Ram or any hardware or hard drive disk
space to your server which is again a
database or an application server which
is done on demand on the other hand
horizontal scaling refers or involves
adding more processing units or physical
machines to your server or databases now
mongodb which is a nosql database
handles horizontal scaling through
sharding so in a nutshell you can say
that vertical scaling can be used in
order to increase or decrease the
capacity of existing Services whereas
horizontal scaling adds more resources
like virtual machines to your system to
spread out the workload across them the
next question is when should we embed
one document with another so you should
consider embedded document that is sub
document whenever you rely on these four
factors that is when the relationship is
one to few that is it can be one two one
too many but not one to one so for
unlimited use case you should start
considering separating sub documents
into another collection the next
situation is when retrieval is likely to
happen together which will improve the
performance in such case you can embed
one document with another the next
factor is when updates are likely to
happen at the same time you can use this
multi-document transaction by embedding
data model and finally when the field is
rarely updated in such case you can use
the embedded document
well let us now move on to the next
question which is what are replica sets
and explain primary and secondary
replica sets in mongodb the process of
replication as we discussed earlier is
done via using replica sets in simple
words it is a group of mongodb processes
to keep the same data across different
servers now a replica set is basically a
collection of related mongodb nodes
which must have three nodes at least now
one of them must be a primary and the
rest secondary ones and a replication
structure can have up to 50 nodes so the
main types of nodes that we have is
primary and the secondary or you can
call it them as primary and secondary
replica sets now when I talk about
primary replica set it is the primer is
the member in the replica set that
receives the write and read operations
but read operations can be pointed out
to secondary nodes changing the
configuration at the moment to perform
the query beside is the replica set can
have only one primary node at most and
talking about secondary the secondary is
the node where the data is replicated to
maintain a copy a replica set can have
one or more secondary nodes and the
clients cannot write data to secondary
ones only they can read from them and if
at all there is any failed node it works
as a secondary node again until it is
until a new primary node will be
replaced with that so this is what a
replica set means and the type of
replica set which is the primary and
secondary I hope you understood this
so moving on to the next question which
is what is the use of capped collections
now the size of collection in mongodb is
typically unrestricted right so the
collection increases its size as more
documents are being added to that now a
capped collection is a special type of
collection that has either a fixed
number of documents in a collection or
fixed number of elements so it creates
new documents by overriding the oldest
documents present in that collection so
collections can have maximum size or
document counts that prevent them from
growing beyond the maximum threshold
that is being allocated and all capped
collections must specify a maximum size
and may also specify a maximum document
count only now mongodb removes older
documents if a collection reaches the
maximum size limit before it reaches the
maximum document count so overall the
structure and functionality of a capped
collection supports high performance for
credit operations like create read and
delete so this is what cap collection
says and some of it characteristics and
why we use it
let us now move on to the next question
which is how can you store images videos
and other large files now we often need
to store files in our databases but
mongodb sometimes or it doesn't let you
store any file larger than 16 MB in a
normal document so what you have to do
instead mongodb has a functionality
specifically for storing large files and
it goes by the name gridfs yes you have
heard it right grid FS is a driver
specification for uploading and
retrieval of mongodb files which are
larger than 16 MP in order to store
images videos and other large files it
is one of the most popular
specifications and it it has a size
limit of more than 16 MB so you can
store images videos that have size more
than of 16 MB now chunks of files like
beaten audio it update of PDF file or
anything it is being streamed as a
chunks so these are streamed into the
database and each chunk is limited 255
KB in this size this means that the last
chunk is normally either equal to or
less than 255 KB so whenever you read
from grade FS the driver resembles all
the chunks as needed this means that you
can read sections of a file as per your
query range
so I hope you understood uh what is grid
fs and what is the process to store
images videos and other large files
which is of more than 16 MB so basically
the interviewer want to know that
whether you are not familiar with the
concept of grid FS so that is the reason
he might ask you this question so you
have to be well prepared for it
well the next question is explain
aggregation in mongodb mongodb
aggregation process the data records
during an aggregation operation and
returns a single competent result just
like any other operations that are
performed in a relational database
similar to that aggregation is also used
in order to act on a group of values
from multiple documents present in a
collection to perform operations for
this grouped values and return a single
competit results now it actually groups
multiple documents which applies an
aggregation operation and it is
basically returning as the particular
value that we want from that operation
now there are various ways on how you
can perform aggregation we have three
different ways of carrying the
aggregation process in mongodb the first
one is aggregation pipeline next we have
mapreduce and finally we have single
purpose aggregation so you can further
explain each of these aggregation uh
depending upon the interviewer's
preference so basically agree
application process in mongodb is
modeled on the concepts of data
processing pipeline so multiple document
enter the pipeline and then these
documents are being transformed into the
aggregated results next we have the map
reduce as the name suggests it does to
operation which is mapping and then
reducing that operation so it will map
each document and process along with one
or more objects for each document and
reduce phase in which output of map
operations are being combined together
and finally we have single purpose
aggregation operation where these
operations aggregate all the documents
from a single collection in mongodb now
even though they provide a simple access
to the basic aggregation operations they
lack the flexibility that are being
provided by the aggregation Pipeline and
map reduce operation
so these are the three uh aggregation
pipeline method which they go through
first is basically the math stage which
will filter the records or the documents
we need to work with uh and next it
performs the group operation which
basically is the aggregation and finally
it will sort the data so it will sort
the resulting documents the way we
require that is an ascending and
descending order now just like uh any
other operations given by aggregation
and mongodb we also have five different
types of operations that we can perform
which is sum which will add up the
values of every document next we have
average which will complete the average
value of every document and we have Min
which returns a minimum value from a
document and we have Max which will
written the maximum value within a
collection and finally we have Push
which will add the value to an array in
the document moving on to the next
question what is mean by ID field in
mongodb ID is the field that uniquely
identifies a document present in the
mongod EB collection so when you are
trying to insert a new document into the
database mongodb will automatically
create a unique ID field which will have
a unique value to its name now by
default mongodb creates a unique index
for the ID field during the creation of
any collection and the ID field is
always the first field in the document
and if the server receives a document
that does not have any ID field first
then the server will move the field at
the beginning and also ID field can be
avoided in the document that you want to
return by setting the value of the ID
field as 0 in the query
so what are some utilities for backup
and restoring in mongodb now by default
mongodb shell does not include any
import export of data or even
duplication or retrieval of uh data from
other uh you know applications but
however mongodb provides the utilities
and database tools to take backup and
perform the restore operations now
mainly we have four type of backup and
restoring options which are input
 export dump and malware
restore so you can use one of these
utilities like Dom import export
and restore to move your data in and out
of your mongodb database now the most
commonly used are mongodum and
restore the mongodon utility creates a
binary backup you know of a mongodb
database the mongodom tool is the
preferred method of dumping data from
your Source mongodb deployment and if
you're trying uh to restore the data
that you have basically deleted or
dumped you can use the Monger register
in order to fetch back the data that you
have dumped
so the next question is can you explain
about mapreduce process in mongodb map
reduce is basically a data processing
Paradigm for condensing large volumes of
data into useful aggregated results so
basically mongodb provides the map
reduce features for only aggregation
purposes and generally there are two
phases of the map reduce as you can see
in the name which is mapping and
reducing so in the first phase each
document is processed and emits common
and redundant part of the document to
pass a unique record for the next phase
and in the next phase all the unique
part gets together and aggregated to
produce a single result and finally we
have a query here we'll pass the query
to filter the resultant set so with the
help of map reduce user can perform
sorting filtering and document
modification as per their need
so moving on to the next question which
is how does mongodb Ensure High
availability of data
in general higher availability refers to
the uh you know Improvement of a system
or any applications availability by
minimizing the downtime caused by
routine maintenance or any hardware
related uh you know issues so mongodb
automatically stores copy sets and
multiple copies of data distributed
across servers and data centers now in
general mongodb is one such database
which can provide High availability for
the users by using features like
replication and sharding now in
replication the replica sets help
prevent website downtime using native
duplication and automatic failures now
mongodb has a great support for high
availability without no thought through
replication set but replica set is not
enough for a production ready system
that is it requires a bit of planning in
order to deploy this so sometimes it
might be an issue but in most of the
cases if the system crashes or the
hardware or software faces any issues uh
you know ODB in the data mongodb helps
you recover and backup your data in the
system
so the next question is what is the role
of profiler in mongodb now so far we
have discussed some of the basic to
moderate uh level questions guys now
from here on you will find some
practical as well as you know advanced
level questions so you might need to
focus a little bit and even if you're
not confident and if you don't know the
answer which we are discussing now you
can directly tell to the recruiter of
the interviewer that you do not know the
answer but you hope that you have an
idea on this and you can work on that
and you can get back to him so again
let's get back to the question which is
what is the role of profiler in mongodb
now database profiler is used to collect
information regarding the queries which
are executed on an individual database
instance so basically this uh profiler
in mongodb database allows you to
collect performance data about
operations occurring on a mongodb
instance
the next question is can we use regular
expressions in mongodb now in SQL we do
have regular Expressions where we need
uh where we write a query to find
certain patterns that are present in our
database table right in a similar way
regular expressions are also used to
match patterns in a document just like
finding a pattern in an SQL tables so
regular expression basically provides
patterns a sequence of characters for
matching and defining a search pattern
and also retrieving an unidentified
field using a certain pattern becomes
easily within a document and querying a
database in order to find a smaller
subset of data within a collection we
can use regular expression so regex
operator in mongodb provides regular
expression capabilities from pattern
matching strings in the queries and the
syntax is followed as DB dot collection
name dot find mention the field name and
mention the rayx keyword and mention the
pattern now the pattern can be of any uh
of your choice
so the next question is how do you
search for documents in which a specific
field has one or more values now you can
say this is a bit of practical question
guys the interviewer wants to know
whether you are not uh whether or not
you are comfortable and have an idea of
using various operators in mongodb so
you can use the DB dot collection file
operation and also use a query operator
which is dollar in in order to specify
the field and the values that you want
to retrieve or you want to search for
inert document so for example I have
given an example which says that in
order to return all employees whose
title is product manager or executive
director in such case the query would be
DB dot employees dot find mention the
field which is title mention the uh in
which is a query operator here mention
the product manager and executive
director which we are trying to find so
if there is any record or the person who
is associated associated with this title
of product manager or executive director
it will retrieve the record now we have
a person name whose first name is Rahul
and last name is Kumar whose ages 29 and
title is product manager so this is how
you can search for a document with a
specific field which has one or more
values
so the next question is which command
are used to insert single and multiple
documents into a collection now we
basically have two types of commands
which is DB dot collection dot insert1
which will insert a single document into
a mongodb collection and it returns a
document containing the inserted
documents ID field and next we have the
same uh command but the keyword changes
which is insert mini which is insert a
single or even multiple records uh into
a mongodb collection again it returns a
document containing each inserted
document's ID
well the next question is what is the
difference between all and in operator
in mongodb now both all and in operator
are used to filter documents in a sub
array based on a conditional statement
so but there are
some differences or subtle differences
between all and in operator now when I
talk about all operator all operator
retrieves all the documents which
contains a subset of the value we pass
and this subset might be in any order
but whereas in operator retrieves all
the documents which contains the either
of the values we pass
moving on what is the next question is
both rights and rates become faster when
you add more slaves to replica set as
the statement true or false explain the
reason well this statement is false now
a replica set can only have a primary uh
at any particular time that is having a
one master with other nodes the
secondary notes being slaves so all
right operations are performed only on
the master node read operations on the
other hand can be performed on any
instance which can be a slave or a
master node so as a result adding more
slaves to a replica set accelerates only
reads operation and nods the and not the
rights operation so the statement is not
valid and it is a false statement we
cannot uh you know write and read both
uh operation when you add more slave to
replica set
the next question is what is Shard e and
mention the components of mongodb
sharded cluster now what is a short key
chart key is used by mongodb to
distribute the documents of a collection
across charts now on charting a mongodb
data set a short key is automatically
created by default so the short key can
be in the form of indexed field or
indexed compound fields that will be
used to distribute the data among the
shots generally The Shard key is used to
distribute the mongodb's collections
documents across all the shards where
the key consists of a single field or
multiple fields in every document now
the idea is to have multiple replica set
with multiple primaries which would
basically divide data and load it among
themselves and each of these replica set
is called as shut
chat basically has three components
which is basically Shard Mongoose and
config serger all this together
comprises of a mongodb sharded cluster
now when I talk about Shard what is a
Shard Shard contains a subset of the
sharded data okay A Shard is basically a
single mongodb server or a replica set
that stores a partition of the
application data that you have divided
now next we have the mongos Mongoose
router or the it is a router of
operations now because each chart
contains only part of the cluster data
you need something to root operations to
the appropriate charts that's where
mongos comes in the Mongoose process is
a router that directs all the reads
writes and commands to the appropriate
shard in this way mongos provides client
with a single point of contact with the
cluster and finally we have config
servers now Mongo's process are
basically are durable should be durable
that means it must be in a position to
store the metadata in order to properly
manage the cluster right which we have
formed with The Shard key so that's the
job of the config server this metadata
includes the cluster configuration the
location of each database collection and
the particular range of data there so
this is what basically shark Key is and
multiple components that are included in
the mongodb sharded cluster
so moving on to the next question which
is the joint plus is a key feature of
relational database systems what is the
mongodb equivalent if any and are there
any limitations now whenever we hear
about joints we have like different
operations like inner joint out design
left join and uh you know cross join so
similarly we have a question here that
means if we talk about no SQL that means
we do not have no joints that means we
do have joints or we do not have joints
that's the main question but the thing
is we have a join equivalent in mongodb
also which is the lookup operator which
is a significant disadvantages that is
it does not work in charted collection
right so it's worth noting that rather
than looking for a direct equivalent to
join mongodb developers often simply
denormalize the data and which
eliminates the need for a join you know
operation in a mongodb database so in a
nutshell you can say it performs an
outer join through a collection in the
same database to filter the documents
from The Joint collection for processing
now the lookup operator adds a new array
field to each input document and this
new array field contains the matching
documents from The Joint collection
so the next question is mention some
pros and cons of normalizing data in
mongodb database now normalizing data is
a key factor in relational database but
what about mongodb now updated documents
is fast for raw normalized data and it
is relatively so slower for denormalized
data well on the other hand reading
documents is fast in denormalized data
and slower for normalized data so
denormalized data is hard to keep in
sync and takes up more space so rdbms
generally have this organic support
for normalization and a lot of data to
be managed as a separate entity whereas
nosql dbmss like mongodb do not have
this active support for normalization
so the next question is what are the
advantages of using mongodb now there
are various advantages of using mongodb
for example it is an open source DB that
is it is ready readily available for
everyone to download and perform the
operations right away and it is also
easy to use the syntax is also user
friendly just like SQL it is also highly
flexible which allows you to store and
work on different data types and allows
you to store unstructured data of
different types in one or more documents
and the security is also a Paramount
Feature for any user right so mongodb
provides Advanced security features as
well and we also talked about high
availability in our previous question
and it also has reliable indexing for a
faster retrieval of data it has a
flexible schema design unlike the
predefined schema in relational
databases so this flexible or the
dynamic schema design allows you to meet
the ever-changing conditions of the Big
Data applications uh you know with the
vast amount of data that is being
incorporated into the documents you can
have a better Edge on the data if you're
working on large scale applications then
mongodb can be a great choice for you
with all this it also gives you high
performance which is another key feature
of mongodb and one of its greatest
advantage of a noiseql database
and that gives us the last question of
our interview question uh which is what
are some applications of mongodb now
mongodb being a noise called database is
widely popular in many uh sectors
nowadays and some of the major
applications or real-time use case of
mongodb is it is used in iot which is
internet of things with the world
rapidly advancing in uh you know in
technology iot plays a crucial role and
it is important that we uh as a user you
know have these uh intention to store
the data and have that data predicted in
any sense now the data is only getting
larger and larger and we also heard this
phrase that data is the new oil so with
the coming in the coming years the data
is exceptionally going to rise and we
need mongodbs to store this uh huge or
huge volumes of data into our uh
databases right so it is one of the
applications of mongodb and we also have
mobile applications and in order to
perform real-time analysis and we also
have uh it is also used in catalog
management content management and for
product management and various others
sectors as well now companies also like
to use nosql databases uh because of its
flexible uh design and the need of you
know storing data without any uh
predefined schema makes it a best nosql
database like companies like eBay
Shutterfly New York Times Verizon and
many other big companies use uh mongodb
nowadays and also the one of the real
life application of use cases the best
example you can give is aadhar card
which is India's unique identification
which is uh based on identifying a
person's you know identity so the other
uses mongodb to store this massive
amounts of demographic and biographic
biometric data of over more than 1.5
billion uh you Indian users so other
users mongodb in order to store the
images QR code details you know the
personal details of the user in its
database so these are some of the
applications of mongodb so this brings
us to the end of this full course on
mean stack for 2023 we hope you had a
lot to learn and if you have any doubts
