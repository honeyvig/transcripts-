hello everyone this is dr. Mary from
Team MDS conquer so now we'll go I am
going to discuss about the development
of the palate and muscles of the soft
palate and the palate anomalus so the
these are the contents of my video
coming to the brief introduction this
actually this palate will have two
components one is hard which is that is
bony part which is called as a hard
palate another is muscular which is
called as a soft palate which is
pleasant posterior so you can see here
hard palate in a soft palate so the
element of the soft palate begins
forming the fifth week in the fifth week
of interrater in life and it keep forms
from the three processes mainly that is
to palatal processes and one frontal
nozzle process and the primary palate
formation it is formed by the merging of
two median nasal process where as a
secondary palate formation between sixth
and eighth week of the development
secondary particles and here the shells
will grow inferior ly in the vertical
direction and along the sides of the
tongue then tongue contracts in the
eighth week then parrot or shells will
flip in superior direction then they n
long gate and we mu medially and fuse
with each other to form the secondary
palate so that is regarding the
formation of the soft palate primary
palate and the secondary planet and this
secondary palate will meet the posterior
portion of the primary palate and fuses
together forming the final palate at the
twelfth week of the entire time life so
you can see here this is the secondary
palate and here this is the primary
palette and this muscles of soft palate
will be developed from this this tensor
veli palatini
first to develop from their first
pharyngeal art at the 40 days of
conception whereas levator Villa
Palatinate Pareto Ferrand is derived
from the fourth pharyngeal arch muscular
you will
from the fourth fire in jail and Pareto
glosses dollars from the forethought so
all these from the four thatch whereas
the first Randall arts use eyes to the
tensor veli palatini and this soft
palate is like a muscular four which is
movable okay which is husbanded from the
posterior part of the hard palate and it
also separates this nasal firings from
the oropharynx you can see a hard palate
and is the soft palate then there are
two surfaces of this soft palate and is
anterior surface and posterior surface
and here the differences are mentioned
the convex concave and convex stand
stratified squamous very straight
respiratory epithelium content Palatine
glands whereas attached to the tubule
elevation and mark my median Rafi and
continuous superiorly with the floor of
nasal cavity so you can mention this
difference between the anterior surface
and the posterior surface of the soft
palate and borders there are of superior
water attached to the hard palate
inferior is free and from the lower free
border a part called B you utilize
developed and later lead to curved folds
of mucous membrane external a trillion
downwards anterior fall is called as a
palate o colossal arch whereas posterior
fall is called as a palate or pharyngeal
arch seeing here this is a posterior
facial pillar this posterior four and
this is the anterior fashion pillar
which is the anterior fold then
structure the soft palate consists of
muscle fibers aponeurosis lymphoid
organs glands blood vessels and the
nerves and this is very important if
they are asked about palate you have to
write about this palette and aponeurosis
and this is the fibrous sheath which is
attached to the posterior part of the
hard palate and it splits to enclose the
musculus Iwilei and accuse origin and
insertion to all the polluting muscles
you can see here this is the Palatine
aponeurosis
coming to the muscles of the soft palate
so this
a group of Muslims of the soft palate
which includes tensor veli palatini
levator villa polity musculus usually
palatov losses in the palate or fire in
this you can see you the waiter will a
palate in me this is the tensor veli
palatini this is the palate of fire in
years and this appellative losses and
this is a muskiness usually this you can
draw like in line diagram first coming
to the tensor palate any if origins at
the scaphoid pose of the pterygoid
process and the lateral side of the
cartilage of the auditory tube and it
entered into here it it it becomes ten
dinners and around and curves around the
happiness of the medial pterygoid plate
so it is the hammerless which wheat
becomes occurs around this kind then it
spreads out into the soft palate is a
palatine aponeurosis then coming to the
levator villa palate and it forms a bulk
of the soft palate origin is from the
inferior surface of the petrous temporal
bone and lower part of the cart least as
part of auditory tube whereas eat
inserts into the anterior surface of the
palatine aponeurosis of is the levator
villa palate oniy then musculus Newville
a it is lies in the midline enclosed in
the para peloton aponeurosis origin from
the posterior Mason spine I'm the
insertion into the mucous membrane of
the uvula so this is the musculus you
will a shown here then coming to the
palate of oranges it consists of
anterior part in the posterior part
posterior part belongs to superior
constrictor muscle of the pharynx
originates from the Paladin upon Arras
is insertion posterior part into the
pharyngeal rafi and anterior part into
the posterior border of thyroid
cartilage so you can see here this
fellow too far in this muscle here
then coming to the palette or glosses
this palette of losses muscle is I mean
it audience from the aponeurosis and
undersurface the posterior minds from
the hard palate and it inserts into the
palate or gloss and folds and into the
sides of the tongue so this table
represents the action of the muscles so
muscular civilly shortens the uvula
elevated panettone elevates the palate
and open up the pharyngeal end of
auditory tube but as tensor palatini
will depress the palate and causes
tension in it and the palate or glosses
closes the oropharyngeal islamists and
palate of oranges will elevate the wall
of the pharynx so these are the this
table is important but you can write as
these like you can depict it completely
in your exam which gives the entire
actions of the soft muscles of soft
palate then there is an other important
structural disk or as a passive enriched
you have to write this point and this is
formed by because some some of the upper
fibers of the palate or pharyngeal pass
circularly deep into the mucous membrane
of the pharynx and from the sphincter
internal to the superior constrictor so
these fibers constitute the pass events
muscle which on contraction rises bridge
called as per sevenths Ridge on the
posterior of the firing so this is
present near the posterior fall of the
fire and so you have to write the entire
regarding the specimens Ridge and what
is the significance of this range when
the soft palate comes in contact with
this bridge it closes the pharyngeal is
famous hence during swallowing speech
vomiting gagging this Ridge helps to cut
nasopharynx from the oropharynx is very
very important so you the Kumble sorry
you have to mention ever regarding this
passive and syringe then coming to the
blood supply greatest paladin branch of
mics with the Adria Satori ascending
palatine branch of facial artery palate
and branch of ascending pharyngeal a
tree and tonsillar branch of dorsal is
lynge other blood supply arterioles
operation venous trainees is because of
pterygoid in the firing
Fluxus of wings and lymphatics into
upper deep cervical and the retro
pharyngeal lymph nodes the now supplied
with with a greater Palatine known as Oh
Palatine lesser Palatine middle Palatine
Einhorn's in our branch nurse so motor
is where all muscles is supplied by
pharyngeal fluxes whereas tensor veli
palatini he is the mandibular no because
we have read that yeah
ie how you people have seen that trends
develop alottoni from the first ad side
so it is supplied with a mandible or no
then the secret or motor they come from
the facial now and the taste fibers are
derived from the face you know then this
movements and functions the soft palate
controls two stages that is upper airway
or pharyngeal instuments and upper food
where oropharyngeal islamists so during
the speech this oropharyngeal ISM is
closed or open so that more donación are
correctly pronounced during sneezing as
aid is directed through the nasal and
oral cavities without damaging the
narrow nose so these muscles help in
that and even this muscles have a very
important role in the swallowing that in
the second stage of swallowing then this
completes the anatomical structure of
the palate development of the palate and
the muscles of the soft palate then
coming to the applied aspects you can
mention these applied aspects again can
be grouped into anatomical anomalies
like cleft palate and this is the
syndromes group of syndromes which are
associated with a cleft palate so you
can mention few syndromes in from this
slide then Velo pharyngeal insufficients
it is due to the anatomic dysfunction of
the palate then bifid uvula remember
this all of the malformations are
anomalies like inherited disorder this
bifida will are most commonly seen in
the males then coming to the
morphological variations of the soft
palate
you can see this down the radiographs
there of type 1 which is leaf-shaped or
lanceolate shaped type 2 wit is a rat
tail shaped type 3 it is a bird-like
shape you can see here type 4 is a
straight line tyfa is a distorted soft
palate that presents the s-type seek is
6 is a Kruk shaped appearance and the
most common type of soft Palaces type 1
whereas the most common scene in
obstructive sleep apnoea type 6 so these
points you can mention so those are the
soft palate variations of soft parent on
the late encephalo Graham studies then
even you can mention about the paralysis
of the soft palate these are because of
the lesions in these regions which
causes nasal irritation nasal twang of
voice flattering of the palatal Arts and
deviation of the uvula see you can see
here the depressed palate and art and
they EULA is deviated towards the normal
side then posterior parent else'll which
is very important in the prosthodontics
during the facilitation making functions
it returns a maxillary denture and
reduces accumulation of the food in
there behind the denture coming to the
oral submucous fibrosis even it involves
their muzzles of the palate and the it
involves the palate region so you can
mention this oral submucous fibrosis
also as an applied aspect then
obstructive sleep apnea this is because
of elongated issues of soft palate
Dedham of the soft palate and tonsillar
hypertrophy so even you can mention this
is applied aspects then Pat ek most
Lingle seen on the palate right so these
are the various causes of the pen Petie
cave which occur on the palate so you
can mention few of them few of these
causes in the applied aspects
then coming to the bacterial infections
like streptococcal pharyngitis tertiary
syphilis which forms gamma and leprosy
these are those are the bacterial
infections which mainly involves a
pallet and coming to the viral
infections herpangina which most is seen
in the children which is caused by
coxsackievirus type here you will see
the viral ulcerations on the palate then
fungal infections most of the deep
fungal infections like histoplasmosis
cryptococcosis blastomycosis
mucormycosis all these involves the soft
palate which causes the necrosis of the
palate I which caused the perforation
partly perforation and you will see them
some important manifestations of HIV on
the palate like these are the conditions
or religions where you can manifest in
the HIV like a Tomatis candidiasis
herpetic ulcers leukoplakia Kaposi
sarcoma Optus ulcers petit k and
cryptococcosis actinomycosis and
papilloma virus infections all these are
the list of solutions which occurs in
the palate in the HIV patient then most
of the saliva gland tumors can - allegra
gland tumors will involve the palate so
you can write about that celebra gland
tumors and also celery necrotizing sino
metaplasia which is a non inflammatory
and in on you sorry it is a inflammation
in or neoplastic condition where you can
see unilaterally mostly on the junction
of hard and soft palate because of this
trauma then you can write by plyometric
adenoma most in sixty eight point person
cases you can seem UK epidermoid
carcinoma you can see involving the
palate and there are other miscellaneous
lesions or disorders like Epstein pearls
we say the developmental cysts which can
see merely nearly along the mid palatine
buffet then bones to audience which you
can see the soft palate and on the
sanction of the hardened soft palate and
also the allele a rich
instrument itis Nikitina which is
because you can see the inflammation of
the minor salivary glands which you see
it on the palette which is
tobacco-related then lymphoid aggregates
it's a bitter like the elevated nodules
and have a slight I'll orange hue which
can be seen on the soft palate and after
stomatitis which occurs on freely
moveable mucosa and in traumatic also
traumatic burns or thermal burns you can
see on the palate and this traumatic
ulcers may be because of the irritation
of the denture and denture sore mouth
that is stomatitis that is like type 1
type 2 type 3 dentist or my deities can
also seen on the palate so these are the
I mean like applied aspects we should
have given many applied aspects were
given in this video so you can select
few of them and you have to write the
applied aspects when they give a
development of the palate or muscles of
the soft palate you have to mention
those anomalies development anomalies
okay these are the references of the
video
