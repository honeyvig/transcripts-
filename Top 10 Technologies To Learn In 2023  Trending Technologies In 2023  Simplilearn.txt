technology refers to the application of
knowledge for the betterment of human
society over thousands of years
technology has evolved providing humans
with major comfort from creating the
telephone to the world of tablets and
phones from making computers to
developing highly intellectual robots
technology has been evolving in almost
all possible Fields providing various
job opportunities that are continuously
growing day by day
in this video let's discuss some of the
best Technologies for the coming year
Yes you heard it right we will focus on
the top 10 Technologies to learn for
2023
stick to the end of the video to know
which is the most trending technology of
2023 but before we begin consider
subscribing to our Channel simply learn
and hit the Bell icon to never miss any
updates so if you are a tech geek here's
a question for you what was the first
digitally operated and programmable
robot called here are the options
unicorn unimate unifac and yeah let us
know your answer in the comment section
below so without any further delay let's
check the technology which is at number
10 on our list
10 extended reality extended reality or
XR covers everything that falls under
augmented reality AR virtual reality VR
mixed reality Mr or anything in between
businesses and major industries like
entertainment marketing and design
benefit massively from extended reality
Frameworks according to Globe newswire
the extended reality Market is set to
grow from 26 billion dollars in 2020 to
as high as 397 billion dollars by 2026
boasting a cagr of
57.91 with technological giants like
Google Samsung and Apple looking for
extended reality experts regularly the
demand for trained Professionals in this
domain has grown substantially boasting
average salaries of 68 thousand dollars
to one hundred two thousand dollars
annually
let's unlock the next technology
training at number nine Edge Computing
more of architecture rather than
technology Edge Computing is a
distributed computing pattern that
brings data storage and computation
closer to the data source thereby
improving the response time and saving
the bandwidth it's considered an
important factor for the success of the
5G and iot industries as per reports
Edge Computing is estimated to reach
101.3 billion dollars with a cagr of
17.8 percent
thanks to an exponential increase in the
job market big names like Amazon HP and
IBM higher Edge Computing experts with
an average salary estimated at one
hundred and seventy thousand dollars per
annum the next technology on this list
is 5G and Wi-Fi 6. we live in a world
where massive amounts of data need to be
transmitted quickly with the increased
adoption of video conferencing meeting
reliable connection and higher bandwidth
this is for 5G and Wi-Fi 6 comes into
play
5G networks are slated to have more than
1.7 billion Global customers by 2025.
according to the GSM association with
the major players being Samsung Cisco
and Nokia among others the worldwide
market for 5G is also anticipating
growth with cagr of 67.1 percent
propelling newer Technologies like iot
and virtual reality into mass production
for the public Wi-Fi 6 on the other hand
provides improved security and high
internet speed even when congested it is
expected to grow from 11.5 billion US
dollars in 2022 to 26.2 billion US
Dollars by 2027 with cagr of 17.9
percent
up next we have blockchain blockchain is
now revolutionizing every sector from
Banking and Healthcare to politics these
are a few industries that may profit
from establishing a decentralized
digital Ledger that monitors and saves
data in several locations making
forgeries difficult companies that use
blockchain are HSBC Barclays Walmart and
Pfizer to name a few
blockchain developers need to know
cryptography data structures and
computer networking according to reports
by 2023 the market evaluation of
blockchain is expected to reach 19.9
billion dollars with a cagr of 42.8
percent with the rise of nft craters are
earning vast amounts of money next on
our list is cyber security and digital
trust several organizations have fallen
prey to cyber attacks including big
names like Facebook LinkedIn and Yahoo
the onset of the covid-19 pandemic has
triggered a rise in the number of cyber
attacks across the globe hence the field
of cyber security holds Paramount
importance in today's Times a few of the
best cyber security companies are Cisco
Microsoft McAfee and IBM knowledge of
operating systems networking and
virtualizations are must knows in the
cyber security domain recent reports
suggest that the global cyber security
markets is expected to reach
31.82 billion US Dollars by the end of
2023 with a cagr of 15.2 percent
the technology trending on number five
is Robotics and automation robotics is
an influential industry gaining momentum
over time in the coming years robotics
will offer a lot to the world like smart
factories the adoption of agile Robotics
and cobots to name a few some companies
actively working in the field of
Robotics are Boston Dynamics and
Universal robots
some core robotic skills you need to
possess are python Matlab problem
solving mathematics and machine learning
the global robotics Market is estimated
to reach 70.84 million dollars by the
end of 2023 with a cagr of 10.5 percent
at number four we have iot Internet of
Things quickly becoming an integral part
of our lives iot or The Internet of
Things is a futuristic technology
recognized for its social and
technological Marvels iot devices are
increasing by almost 31 yearly and
according to reports there will be 30
billion iot devices by 2022. the number
of active devices is estimated to double
by the end of 2023.
iot has aided firms in improving
customer service streamlining operations
and increasing profits mindtree IBM GE
digital and Verizon are a few companies
getting more involved with iot
the top in-demand iot skills are machine
learning and AI python JavaScript big
data and node.js according to reports it
is estimated that the market value will
reach or even exceed
566.4 billion by the end of 2027 with a
cagr of 6.7 percent
now coming to the top three we have
Quantum computing
Quantum Computing uses the properties of
quantum physics to perform calculations
and simulations that would not be
possible on a traditional machine
while not just a research experiment
anymore Quantum Computing is a tool
changing the face of several Industries
including medicine biology and climate
change
big names like Microsoft Google IBM and
Intel are in the race to build Quantum
Computing tools
to learn Quantum Computing you need to
know programming mathematics mechanics
scientific Computing and algorithms
reports state that the quantum Computing
Market is estimated to reach
411.4 Million by 2026 with a cagr of
24.2 percent at the runner-up position
we have proof of work and proof of stake
decentralized cryptocurrency networks
must ensure that transactions are
carried out safely and securely without
a centralized organization like Visa or
PayPal to accomplish this networks use a
technology known as a consensus
mechanism proof of work and proof of
stake are the two consensus mechanisms
that enable all the computers in a
crypto Network to concur on which
transactions are valid
proof of work is the older one of them
used by Bitcoin ethereum 1.0 it uses
mining by miners around the world and
proof of stake is the newer consensus
mechanism that powers ethereum 2.0
cardano tezos which employs a network of
validators to validate the new
transaction update the blockchain and
earn a reward if to excel in this
technology you should have Proficiency
in at least one high level programming
language a solid grasp of cryptography
and security principles knowledge of
smart contracts and familiarity with
algorithms and data structures
according to statistics it is estimated
that the market value will reach 69
billion by the end of 2030 and the
technology that has taken the World by
storm ranking at number one is AI as a
service gone are the days when you
needed a hard copy of a map to travel to
your favorite place as Google Maps has
efficiently replaced them with its
powerful ai ai or artificial
intelligence is the top most trending
technology today it enables machines to
think and act like humans now talking
about AI as a service
aiaas is a third party offering AI
Services which help individuals and
organizations to conduct AI experiments
at low cost some top companies using AI
as their core technology include Google
Amazon apple and Microsoft the market
value of AI is projected to reach 42.4
billion US dollars with a cagr of
29.75 percent
that concludes our list of the top 10
Technologies for the year 2023 so if you
