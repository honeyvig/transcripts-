hi my name is Christian Lopez and I'm
currently working at Credit One Bank as
a data scientist I live in Las Vegas
Nevada with my family
although I hold the cognitive
Neuroscience degree I've always had a
passion for data engineering
after graduating I joined a financial
institution as a data analyst now I've
been working as a data scientist for
over a year and a half
although I had already taken data
science and data engineering courses in
the past I knew that simply Learners
comprehensive program would offer the
projects that I needed in order to
succeed I knew that in order to grow in
my current position I needed to take on
data engineering projects and simple
Learners program was a way to do it I
came across a postgraduate program in
data engineering from Simply learn in
conjunction with Purdue University after
looking at the curriculum I knew it was
the right program for me I'm so happy I
made this decision
along with some new projects I was also
offered a 15 salary hike on my current
job my simply learned data engineering
certification was recognized by my
current employer and gave me tremendous
opportunities to grow
overall it was such a tremendous
experience the program and the
instructors were top-notch and they were
always available to answer any of the
questions that I had during the duration
of the program I am so happy I made this
decision to take this course and I would
really recommend it to anyone trying to
advance in their careers
during my free time I really like to
spend time with family and friends walk
my dog and Play Soccer outside
