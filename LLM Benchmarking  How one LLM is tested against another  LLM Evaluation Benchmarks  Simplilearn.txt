hello everyone I am M and welcome to
today's video where we will be talking
about llm benchmarks tools used to test
and measure how well large language
models like GPT and Google Gemini
performs if you have ever wondered how
AI models are evaluated this video will
explain it in simple terms llm
benchmarks are used to check how good
these models are at tasks like coding
answering questions and translating
languages or summarizing text these
tests use sample data and a specific
measurement to see how will the model
perform for example the model might be
tested with a few example like few short
learning or none at all like zero short
learning to see how it handles new task
so now the question arises why are these
benchmarks important they help
developers understand where a model is
strong and where it needs Improvement
they also make it easier to compare
different models helping people choose
the best one for their needs however llm
benchmarks do have some limits they
don't always predict how well a model
will work in real world situation and
sometimes model can overfit meaning they
perform well on test data but struggle
in Practical use we will also cover how
llm leaderboards rank different model
ped on their benchmark scores giving us
a clear picture of Which models are
performing the best so stay tuned as we
dive into how llm Benchmark work and why
they are so important for advancing AI

below and the pin comand so without any
further Ado let's get started so what
are llm benchmarks llm benchmarks are
standardized tools used to evaluate the
performance of La language models they
provide a structured way to test llms on
a specific task or question using sample
data and predefined metrics to measure
their capabilities these Benchmark
assess various skills such as coding
Common Sense reasoning and NLP tasks
like machine translation question
answering and text summarization the
importance of llm Benchmark lies in
their role in advancing model
development they track the progress of
an llm offering quantitive insights into
where the model performs well and where
Improvement is needed this feedback is
crucial for guiding the fine-tuning
process allowing researchers and
Developers to enhance model performance
additionally benchmarks offers an
objective comparison between different
llms helping developers and organization
choose the best model for their needs so
how llm benchmarks work llm Benchmark
follow a clear and systematic process
they present a task for llm to complete
evaluate it performance using specific
metrics and assign a score based on how
well the model performs so here is a
breakdown of how this process work the
first one is setup llm benchmark come
with pre-prepared sample data including
coding challenges long documents math
problems and real world conversation the
task is span various areas like Common
Sense reasoning problem solving question
answering sumary generation and
translation all present to the model at
the start of testing the second step is
testing the model is tested on one of
the three ways few short the llm is
provided with a few example before being
prompted to complete a task
demonstrating its ability to learn from
limit data the second one is zero shot
the model is asked to perform a task
without any prior examples testing its
ability to understand New Concept and
adapt to unfamiliar scenarios the third
one is fine tun the model is trained on
a DAT set similar to the one used in The
Benchmark aiming to enhance its
performance on the specific task
involved the third step is the scoring
so after completing the task The
Benchmark compares the models output
with the expected answer and generates a
score typically ranging from 0 to 100
reflecting how how accurately the llm
perform so now let's moving forward
let's see key metrics for benchmarking
llms so llms Benchmark uses various
metrics to assess performance of large
language model so here are some commonly
used matri the first one is accuracy or
Precision measure the percentage of
correct prediction made by the model the
second one is recall also known as
sensitivity measure the number of true
positive reflecting the currect
prediction made by the model the third
one is F1 score combines both accuracy
and recall into a single metric weighing
them equally to address any false
positive or negatives F1 score ranging
from 0 to one where one indicates
perfect precision and recall the fourth
one is exact match tracks the percentage
of predictions that exactly match the
correct answer which is especially used
for the task like translation and
question answering the fifth one is
perpect gges here it will tell you how
well a model predicts the next word or
token a lower perplexity score indicates
better task comprehension by the model
the sixth one is blue bilingual
evaluation understudy is used for
evaluating machine translation by
comparing and grams sequence of adjacent
text element between the models output
and the human produced translation so
these quantitative metrics are often
combined for more through evaluation so
in addition human evaluation introduces
qualitatively factors like coherence
relevance and semantic meaning provide a
nuan assessment however human evalution
can be time consuming as and subjective
making a balance between quantitative
and qualitative measures important for
comprehensive evaluation so now let's
moving forward see some limitation of
llm benchmarking while llm benchmarking
available for assessing model
performance they have several limitation
that prevents them from the fully
predicting real world Effectiveness so
here are some few the first one is
bounded scoring once a model achieves
the highest possible scores on The
Benchmark that Benchmark loses its
utility and must be updated with more
challenging task to remain a meaning
full assessment tool the second one is
Broad data set llm Benchmark often rely
on Sample data from diverse subject and
task so this wide scope may not
effectively evaluate a model performance
in edge cases Specialized feelds or
specific use cases where more tailored
data would be needed the third one is
finite assessment Benchmark only test a
model current skills and as LMS evolve
and a new capabilities emerge new
benchmarks must be created to measure
these advancement the fourth one is
overfitting so if an LM is trained on
the same data used for benchmarking it
can be lead to overfitting where the
model performs well or the test data but
struggles with the real task so this
result is scores that don't truly
represent the model's broader
capabilities so now what are llm
leaderboards so llm leaderboards publish
a ranking of llms based on the variety
of benchmarks leaderboard provide a way
to keep track to the myard llms and the
compare their performance llm
leaderboards are especially beneficial
in making decision on which model Su you
so here are some so in this you can see
here open AI is leading and GPD 40
second and the Llama third with 45
parameter B and 3.5 Sonet is there so
this is best in multitask reasoning what
about the best in coding so here open AI
o1 is leading I guess this is the oran
one and the second one is 3.5 Sonet and
after that in the third position there
is GPD 4 so this is in best in coding so
next next comes fastest and most
affordable models so fastest models are
llama 8B parameter 8B parameter and the
second one is L ma Lama 70b and the
third one is 1.5 flesh this is Gemini 1
and lowest latency and here it is
leading llama again in cheapest models
again llama 8B is leading and in the
second number we have Gemini flash 1.5
and in third we have GPT 4 mini moving
forward let's see standard benchmarks
between CLA 3 Opus and GPT 4 so in
journal they are equal in reasoning CLA
3 op is leading and in coding gp4 is
leading in math again gp40 is leading in
tool use cloud 3 opas is leading and in
multilingual Cloud 3 Opus is leading so
