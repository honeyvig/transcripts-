yeah hi good evening one and all okay
now I will be discussing few important
things which are important in need point
of view related to the students topic
that is allergy and hypersensitivity
okay of course it is one of the
important topic in related to the
community and I'll just go I mean like
very precise in am secure point of view
okay so coming to the basic
classification of hypersensitivity which
is given by Coombs and gel so initially
the classification contains only four
types that is type one immediate which
is also called as nei a topic and
anaphylactic these two types are
subtypes in type one and the second one
is antigen antibody mediated and third
one is immune complex mediated and type
4 is cell mediated which is also called
as knit delayed hypersensitivity and
recently added is fifth one which is
sometimes called within a subtype of
type 2 means the fifth type will be a
part of types - okay so we'll go in
detail in respect to each and everything
coming to the type one type one is
immediate which is also called as in a
atopic or anaphylactic okay so the type
one is generally an allergic reaction
that is provoking when it is reexpose to
a specific antigen
so if basic definition of
hypersensitivity is very simple when you
get exposed to a particular antigen the
body will get sensitized to it so when
you are repeatedly exposed to the same
antigen the body will show some sort of
reaction in the form of symptoms
clinically that is called a
hypersensitivity okay so the exposure
for the type 1 can be either inhalation
or injection or ingestion and it is
mainly mediated by IgE antibodies or IG
immunoglobulins and partially by cd4 th2
cells and marsh
and as already said like a topi is a
subtype of type one and it is caused I
mean this Adobe is generally a
genetically mediated which is under the
control of chromosome number six
yesterday we have viscous question and
I'm security later to the chromosome
number six that is H Elia complex is
coded by the short arm of chromosome and
number six Omega naught chromosome
number six is important altitude and
this causes an inflammatory response to
and immediately it can be an immediate
which can takes place in a few seconds
two minutes or it can be prolonged and
it can be either local or systemic and
the symptoms ranges from mild irritation
to sudden depth due to an electric shock
okay so the treatment options are you
need to prevent this for this you need
to do and histamines you need to you
epinephrine you need to do
corticosteroids so this is the basic
treatment option will be discussing the
treatment options in detail further so a
simple physiology how it goes like
whenever this pathogen whenever this
allergen or whenever this antigen enters
it's sensitized and activates the IgE
production once the IC is produced IC is
going to bind to the marsh cells with
this FC receptor so when repeated
exposure of the same antigen occurs the
mast cells get activated and they
release the calcium whenever the calcium
rises and the calcium religious and this
is going to give you the clinical
outcome of the clinical effect so some
common examples I mean your pamper your
MCQs will mainly moose in these common
examples they just give okay this
particular SD phenomenon is seen with
which type of hypersensitivity that is
type 1 okay you taqueria seen with which
type of hypersensitivity hi favor
seen with roots type of hypersensitivity
anaphylactic shock is related to which
type of hypersensitivity these are the
most commonly asked questions so please
make a note of all of these examples
examples are the most important thing
when we talk about hypersensitivity okay
so some dental materials will be
concerned with type 1 hypersensitivity
but most of the dental materials will
show type 4 hypersensitivity the most
common into industry okay 10 - material
related hypersensitivity type
for if they ask both type 1 as well as
type 4 type 4 is more compared to type 1
so make a note that is more important
rather than anything here ok so we are
done so the next one is about the
treatment option for this
hypersensitivity the basic treatment
option how we need to go ahead the
documentation everything you should make
a note and whenever this anaphylactic
shock is there you need to take a few
precautions of this maintaining of ABCD
a way everything and everything should
be maintained CPR if necessary should be
done all these are basic things you just
go with the slide and I'm not going to
discuss much about this but the main
important aspect is forma logical
management if you go to the first
treatment that is for a moderate
reaction intramuscular injection of
epinephrine one is to 1000 0.3 to 0.5
milligrams is star and C true so just
make a note of all of these just go
through them first and second lines are
most commonly asked as an excuse and of
course corticosteroids too so just just
go with these slide it's very important
so the most commonly recent last
questions is the most important cell in
type 1 hypersensitivity is cd4 pH 2 cell
and the most important cell in the late
phase of the type and hypersensitivity
is Norfolk ok these are the most two
important things that you have to have a
look so coming to the type 2 type 2 is
antibody mediated okay of course you
know that the body can have the sense to
recognize the self antigen self cells
and non-self cells okay which are like
foreign bodies so that is main main main
concern in the case of a type 2 antibody
dependent type 2 and upon to dependent
his antibody produced by the produced by
the immune response to bind to the
antigen on the patient's own cells
surface and it can be an intrinsic or an
extrinsic intrinsic is antigen present
on the parent I mean the patient cell
whereas an extrinsic is some object is
observed on to the I mean the parent
cell as a foreigner as a foreign antigen
is called as an extrinsic and the main
immunoglobulins that are concerned with
this type 2 hypersensitivity is IgG
an idea and they go with in a classical
pathway okay the the complement system
which is concerned with this type of
hypersensitivities classical pathway so
make a note the immunoglobulins that are
present in the classical pathway are i
GG and IgM as well as the
immunoglobulins that are more concerned
to that of the type 2 hypersensitivity
are again
IgG and IgM okay this is very very
important and the mechanism by which
they causes this acute inflammation is
by the membrane attack complex which
causes the lysis and that will be
discussing about the pathophysiology in
detail so this is a simple like I mean
in simple terms the type 2
hypersensitivity is exhibited by three
mechanisms one is let I just want to
make it as simple as possible the first
mechanism is phagocytosis phagocytosis
mechanism okay in this phagocytosis
mechanism the main phenomenon is
generally by the activation of IgG and
IDC and IgM so whenever this IgG is
activated okay it get sensitized with FC
receptor and it's causes oxidation and
phagocytosis and similarly ITC and
Isaiah
they activate saw the activates the c3 B
and C for B okay
which calls this phenomena this is one
type of activation of this type 2
hypersensitivity and the second
mechanism is whenever the I mean like
self-reactive B cells are activated
self-reactive B cells are activated
during the reaction it's going to
activate the IgM and it's going to
activate the IgG with the help of cd4 T
helper cells so whenever these two are
activated it attaches to the host system
either in the attachment either by the
intrinsic as well as an extrinsic which
is already discussed and if you go
further in detail whenever an antigen
which is coming from the extrinsic is
attaching to the host cell immediately
the body sends this IgG so this aunty
this immunoglobulin which is also called
as an antibody is going to react with
this antigen which is present on the
surface of the host cell to form
antigen-antibody complex so whenever
this antigen-antibody complex is formed
there will be activation of complement
system so the complement system
activation takes place by two mechanisms
one is immediately the C one is going to
get activated with FC portion the C one
is going to activate the C 2 C 3 C 4 and
C 5 okay so out of these complement
components few components they get lysis
lysis and they're differentiate into two
parts that is C to differentiate into C
2 a C 2 B similarly 3 C 3 a c 3 b c 4 h
c4 b and c 5 s c 5 ok out of these the a
components that is c 3 a c 4 a c 5a they
act as an a chemo tactic factors okay so
these chemotactic factors they extract
the neutrophils and they causes the
degranulation and they causes the cell
in depth okay because it's seldom this
is one mechanism and the second
mechanism is the by the activation of
the second component the second
component left over is C Phi B with c6
c7 and c8 and multiple c9 factors means
many c9 factors they combine to form a
membrane attack complex okay that is
called as net mca this mca is going to
inject or it's going to penetrate into
the cell membrane and it opens the cell
memory whenever it opens the cell
membrane due to the osmotic differences
the fluid moves inside and the cell wall
i mean the cells will swallows and the
cell will lysis so these are the three
mechanisms by which the type 2
hypersensitivity activates that one is
by phagocytosis second one is by the
neutrophil degranulation okay third one
is by the lysis that is also stated with
the mca molecules okay so these are the
few examples the phagocytosis examples
are autoimmune hemolytic anemia
autoimmune thrombosis
thrombocytopenia and inflammation
related or good poster syndrome some
fingers vulgaris and acute rheumatic
fever and the cellular dysfunction sir
you can just make a note of these
examples these examples are very very
important coming 2 type 3 type 3 is
called as an immune complex mediated it
occurs due to the immune complex antigen
antibody
reactions which are not removed from the
circulation and this is most commonly
seen in the various tissues but most
frequently seen in the case of a kidneys
joints lungs and skin so the mechanism
is very simple okay
in the first phase a large quantities of
soluble antigen antibody complexes are
formed in the blood and they are not
removed by the macrophages this is the
basic mechanism by which the type 3
hypersensitivity starts and the second
one is this is antigen antibody
complexes or discharged into the
capillaries between the endothelial
cells in the basement membrane so
initially they are in the middle now
they are disclosed into the space
between the basement membrane and
endothelial cells they are these are the
antigen antibody complexes and the third
phase is the Z antigen antibody
complexes they activate the c1 that is
classical component pathway leading to
the vasodilatation of this particular
area so further activation of complement
system is completed and they they
attracts these leukocytes to the
particular area so the local leukocytes
shows their action release the killing
agents and they destroy the and they
destroy and causing massive inflammation
leading to cell death and humerus right
so these are the basic examples that you
have to make a note ok
serum sickness post streptococcal
glomerular nephritis okay system equal
opposite dramatis these are the most
commonly asked questions related
examples and the rest examples you can
just go ahead with the dental pulse and
coming to the type for has already said
it is a cell mediated or delayed type of
hypersensitivity and it is mostly
mediated by the T lymphocytes and in
specific it is cd4 T H 1 and 17 ok 1 and
17 are more concerned with this whereas
T 2 T 2 is more concerned with type 1 ok
cd4 T 2 is more concerned with type 1
and cd4 th 1 and th 17 are more
concerned with type 4 and classical and
the most common example is Chebarkul and
reaction will be we will be learning
about the tuberculin reaction further in
detail okay so I mean this is taken from
a decent book the beautiful reference
you just learn this okay
the standard diagnostic test for the
latent
we're closest is chipper clean skin dust
okay
basically it is of two types one is the
Chebarkul intest okay menthe rocks text
and second one is half stressed so in
this in this small truck stress what
you're going to do is very simple you
are going to inject the PPD that is the
peptide derived molecules into the
dorsal aspect of the forearm and you are
going to observe it you are going to
observe for the in duration and the
palpated area after 48 to 72 hours and
you have to measure that okay if the
integrator area is greater than five
millimeters okay for one international
unit of PPD if it is one international
unit of PPD if it is greater than five
millimeters then it can be considered as
positive if you are giving five units it
should be greater than ten millimeters
so in such cases you can be considered
it doesn't bother to just go ahead read
read completely completely about this
read this slide is very important and
second one is something like a gun
okay that is a half test is something
like a gun which consisting or has six
needles and you need to press on the
dorsal aspect of the skills and in this
test they have given gradings the
gratings are ranging from frying fry
gratings that is great zero no reaction
grade one is less than four discrete
papillae and great to you just go ahead
okay this is also it's very very
important these two tests are very
important and they have seen many
questions related to these two tests and
coming to the rest of the examples that
are related with the type 4
hypersensitivity few autoimmune diseases
and infectious diseases are present
tuberculosis leprosy
histoplasmosis toxoplasmosis please make
a note of each and everything make a no
traumatic arthritis will come here and
rheumatic fever will be coming in the
type 3 hypersensitivity
okay so make a note and but the most
important question related to this is
majority of the dental materials they
show type 4 delayed hypersensitivity
okay so the last but not the least it's
a new one it's a very very rare
condition they can call it as in a
subtype of type 2 hypersensitivity and
the most common examples of the Graves
disease when mice to migrate if you find
option 5 whenever they ask questions
related to my smugness of Graves disease
if you find type 5 hypersensitivity you
go for it if you don't find type I
hypersensitivity you can go for type 2
hypersensitivity because it is a subtype
of type 2 hypersensitivity and one of
the most commonly seen diagram is
question related to the hypersensitivity
is patched as don't don't don't
I mean like don't confuse with the
Petacchi okay pathology test is related
to the Bechet syndrome and pass test is
related to the allergic okay if you want
to identify the allergen that is causing
the disease you are going to attach a
patches of all the collected allergens
onto the body and you are going to see
the integration okay this is a method of
pax test and one more question is the
hypersensitivity associated with the
dental materials it's type 4 and type 1
and the most common hypersensitivity
associate with the dental materials in
Skype for make you related
hypersensitivity in attics close
hypersensitivity and everything it comes
under the type 4 hypersensitivity very
very I mean in few conditions you can
see type 1 hypersensitivity in the
dentistry also materials okay that's all
guys I hope this is a useful video for
you and will be coming with a few more
updates like this for a specific and
important prophet SAS as
hypersensitivity is one of the specific
topic and I mean directly or indirectly
you need some sort of concept oriented
things related to this so that's the
reason why we have made a video probably
will be coming with more and more videos
for you we are done for today
all the best keep working hard
