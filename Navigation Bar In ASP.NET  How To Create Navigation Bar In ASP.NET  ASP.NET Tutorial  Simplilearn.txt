hey everyone i welcome you all to
another session by simply learn
in this session we will learn about
asp.net navigation bar
this video will explain you about
asp.net navigation bar and guide you
through it
let's look at what's in it for you in
this session
we shall begin with understanding what
is asp.net
followed by which we will look at what
is navigation bar
and finally we will look at a demo on
how to create a navigation bar
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
click down the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn
watch the video till the end so that you
don't miss the demo so without wasting
any further time let's get started
what is asp.net
asp.net is a server-side technology used
for developing dynamic websites and web
applications
it is the latest version of active
server pages
microsoft released asp.net in 2002 and
had an extension dot aspx
what is a navigation bar in asp.net
navigation bar in asp.net is used to
create a navigation header for a website
or a web application
it makes it simple for an application to
browse
asp.net has three navigation controls
dynamic menus tree views and site map
path
dynamic menu displays the standard site
navigation menu
whereas treeviews displays a multi-level
navigation menu
and sitemap part displays
a trail to the current page and linked
to the previous page
now let us look at a demo on how to
create a navigation bar
so we have opened visual studio 2019
go to file
new
create a new project
we'll select asp.net core web app model
view controller template scroll down
so select this template
click on next
provide the project name
since we are creating a navigation bar
so write the project name as
navbar
click on next
and if you want to change the target
framework you can change it here
i'll keep
the default one
click on create
so here you can see the project is
successfully created
let's click on view and open solution
explorer
so now let us run this and see what is
the output
here you can see the build has started
here you can see it is running on
localhost and
this is the default nav bar
which is created so what we'll do is
we'll go and
change this navigation bar
so go back to visual studio
go to solution explorer
go to views go to layout.cshtml
open this file
and here you can see
if you look look inside the header this
is the navbar
so what we'll do is
we'll delete this nav bar
so this is the small code which i have
pasted here so i have created a class
nav bar and provided the background
color as dark
and i haven't provided any link as of
now and i have named it as simply learn
and similarly i have created another
class
in this class i have created a drop down
in this top drawn i have named it as
courses articles and others
so let us go and run this
and see the output
so this is the navbar which we created
they simply learn home about and we
created a drop down
resources in this drop down we have
courses articles and others
similarly we have contact us and we have
this search bar
so this is the nav bar which we created
so we'll go back to the code
so here we have created
another class
navbar contact us and this is where we
created the search bar
so with that we have reached the end of
