hi everyone I'm abisara and welcome to
the simply land YouTube channel this
session we'll introduce you to the te
inter module its widgets and their uses
after that using these widgets we will
create a dollar to Rupee converter but
before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel
like the tutorial and hit the Bell icon
to never miss an update and I hope the
screen is clearly visible and the audio
is fine if yes please type in yes in the
chat section below and if there are any
issues to let us know before starting
let us have a simple question to brush
up Ona knowledge and your question is
list tle and range are the dash of data
types and your options are sequence
types binary types buan types or none of
the men mentioned above please answer in
the comment section below and we'll
update the correct answer in the pin
comment you can pause the video give it
a thought and answer in the comment
section and and insightful for you guys
if you are focused on building strong
foundational skills for career growth in
that case you can check out a free
course to Learn Python Basics with a
completion certificate from skillup by
simply learn you can check the python
Basics free skillup course with the link
in the description box
below and with that we will start our
tutorial for TI
int so first we will create a
folder I will move to C
drive and in Python projects I will
create a folder with the
name tier
tutorial and inside I will open the
command Pro
and write the command code space period
and press enter to open my IDE that is
I'm using the visual studio code you can
use any ID you want or you have your
hands
on so now we will make a
file and name it as TT
dopy you would be amazed to know that
there are various GUI Frameworks for
python but only teiner is included in
the standard library that is if you
install the python it would come along
with that only you don't need to install
it again or write any command to install
it again and T has a number of
advantages the same code runs on Windows
Mac OS and Linux since it is cross
platform oriented and in contrast to
other Frameworks work teiner is
lightweight and generally simple to use
this makes it an appealing option for
creating GUI apps in Python so starting
with first we will import tein module
for that we will write the command
import take enter and we'll use an
allias
here and we'll import it as
TK so so first we need to create a tick
into
window and we will add a single widget
in that and show you guys how we will
create that
window so first you will get your python
ideally open and just import the te
inter module as we have imported here
and now to make the window we'll write a
command
window equal to TK what we have import
it and we'll write
TK and enclosed Circle brackets here
window is an instance of T TK class now
we will create a new window and assign
it to the variable window so this is the
TK
class now when we write window main
Loop so it will repeat the loop and when
we add widgets in it it will keep on
repeating and it will show you the
window with all the widgets so first
we'll save this file and run
it you can see that we have the ti enter
window
here so this is how you create a tick
enter window
now moving on now we will set the title
for the T inter window I will show you
again as it was showing
TK it's showing TK so we will change the
title for the take enter window and to
change that we'll write a
command window dot
title and in the circular brackets we
will write the title we want for a tier
window I will write simply learn tier
tutorial so
yeah I will save this and run this file
for you guys so you can see that
it has shown the title so we'll just
stretch it and you can see the title
here so we can stretch the take inter
window till we have not set the
resizable method false false if we set
it as false or zero it would not be able
to stretch The Tick into window as we
are able to stretch it now so this Arrow
it won't be available after we set it as
false now moving
on after setting the title now we will
set the geometry that means the
dimension for the take inter window for
that we'll use the geometry method and
it's a fundamental method which decides
the size position and some other
attributes of the screen layout we are
going to create so for that we'll write
a command window dot
geometry and
inside you could write the dimensions
first we will set the width that is
x-axis we'll set it as 600 pixels then
we'll write small X then the Y AIS or
the height of the window we'll set it as
500 and after that we will add Plus
what this indicates is 290 pixels that
is the window will appear on the screen
290 pixels from the
x-axis and for y- axis we will add 10 so
it would appear 10 pixels from the Y
AIS so we'll save this and run it you
could see that 290 pixels from the
x-axis and 10 pixel from the Y AIS and
we have set the geometry that is 6 00
pixels that is the width or the x-axis
and 500 that is the Y AIS the
height so now moving
on now we have created the window now
we'll add a widget and show you guys how
we add a widget before
that uh let us know what kind of widgets
we have in Tio so in this tutorial we
will be learning around five wigets so
we will start with label and label it's
a widget that is used to display text on
the T inter window or your screen and
next we would be having the button
widget that can contain text and can
perform an action when clicked it could
have any action or it could have just a
text without any action then we will
have the entry widget it's used to get
any entry from the user or a single line
of text it also get multi lines of text
for that we have to set other
attributes and next we would be seeing
the frame so a frame it's a rectangular
region used to group related Widgets or
provide padding between
widgets so these are the five wigets
that we would be learning so I counted
you four but here you will learn other
widgets that would be
canvas and you would see the photo image
object and other things so moving on we
will use many
widgets first we'll create a single
widget and show you guys how we'll
create it and we'll start with the label
widget so for that we will call the
label class for that
and I will set you greeting for you
guys so greting equal to
label
so here we will use tk. Lael class to
add some text to a window we will create
a label widget with the text hello
Learners welcome to TK tutorial and
assign into a variable grading as we
have assigned started assigning it and
the window you created earlier doesn't
change you just create a label widget
but you haven't added it to the window
yet there several ways to add widgets to
a window right now we can use the label
widget and then we'll use the grid
method or the pack method or the place
method to show that widget on your
window screen or on the tier window so
starting with creating the
widget now we'll set the text for it
and
text that would be equal
to hello
Learners and welcome to T
tutorial and by the way guys uh some
people call it as sko I col tto and many
colleges TK
inter so you guys can pronounce it at
any
way okay so welcome to T enter
tutorial
now here we will use the place method so
for
that we'll use
greeting dot
place and here we'll use
TK do
level and we will place it at here we
will assign the coordinates as we have
created a window with xaxis and Y AIS
here we will assign our x coordinate as
190 and y
coordinate as
210 as we have the window and in that we
have xais at full length of
600 and y axis with 500 so we are
placing it at 190 and at y- axis at
210 and similarly with the place widget
we have like take enter has three
buildin layout managers that use
symetric methods to position widgets in
an application frame uh first we have P
widget that organizes widgets in
horizontal and vertical boxes that are
limited to Left Right top bottom
positions and many other positions each
box is offset and relative to each other
and here we are using the place so Place
places wigets in a two-dimensional grid
using X and Y absolute coordinates then
we have the grid so grid method locates
widgets in a two-dimensional grid using
row and column absolute
coordinates one thing is important when
you use this pack place or
you should not be combined these all in
the same master window instead choose
one and stick with
it further you will know why we should
stick with one
only so here we have created a label and
placed it in a variable grading so we'll
save this and run the window you can see
that we the T window has appear here and
we can
see the text that is placed on a label
and the text says hello Learners welcome
to the te enter
tutorial now moving
on we will command
this and now we'll add some
functionalities to the label widget
only so for that we will create
label and here we'll not assign it to
any
variable like we will assign it to a
variable and name it as label
only TK do
label and this would be capital for
label and
inside We'll add the text
and that would be
same that would be hello Learners
welcome to TK
tutorial after setting the text for our
label here we can set the foreground and
background
color so for that we will write FG that
is
foreground and that would be equal to
white
color and we'll set the background for
the label as
green for that we'll write the command
BG equal
to
green and
now now
to uh get this label showed on your
ticker window you have to use any of the
three method methods that is pack place
or
grid so now we will use the place method
only so first we'll write the variable
name that is
label and the place
method and inside we'll set the
coordinates that is X =
190 and Y =
to 210
now we'll save this and run the file for
you guys you can see that the label as
good the background color is green and
the foreground color for text is
white so now moving on we can add other
attributes to the label
widget and that would be the width and
the
height so
for that we'll write width that would be
equal to
30 and height we'll set it as
10 so
now we'll save
this and run the file again you can see
that uh it has expanded itself so we
have set the
width equal to 30 that is the x-axis it
has expanded to 30 pixels and height
equal to 10
pixels so uh I have told you that label
widgets are used to display text or
images and the text displayed by label
widget can't be edited by the user it's
for display purpose only label widgets
display text with the default system
text color and the default text
background color these are typically
black and white respectively but you may
see different colors if you have changed
these settings in your operating system
and you can control uh sorry control
label text and background colors using
the foreground and background parameters
as we have seen
that so moving
on uh as you have set the color uh with
the words here you could also set them
with the hexa code
so to set them with the hexa code you
could just write the hexa code for the
color and here I
will use this purple color or what there
would be a
specific like the dark blue
magenta but you call this color so I
will save this
and run it for you guys first I will
close this so here you can see
that I have set the color with the hexa
code and like the text it's coming out
of the width so for that we'll set the
width as
50 set it as
500 set as 50 close the previous window
save the file and run it
again here you can see that we have set
the width s50 and Y AIS that is height
as
10 so moving on we will start with
button widgets so we'll close this take
into
window and command command down
this
now let's start with button
widget so button widgets are used to dis
play clickable buttons like there would
be text and those buttons would be
clickable you can configure them to call
a function whenever they are
clicked and in many ways a button is
just a label that you can click so as we
have set the height and width for the
label we can set it with the same
parameters and the differen is you can
just click and that turns out to be a
button widget
so to make the pattern
widget we will start
with
variable and to set the button we use TK
do button and inside we will set the
text that would be click me to say
high so when you click
it I
will have to set a function to get its
functionality so click me to
say
I so this would be the text that would
be displayed on the button and then
we'll set the
width for the button and and we'll set
it as
25 25 pixels and then the height and
that would be 2 pixels so width that
would be equal to 25 and height that
would be equal to uh we'll set it as two
pixels
only and then we'll set the background
color that would be white and we'll set
the foreground color as black
background color is
white and for foreground we'll use
FG and that would be equal
to
Black and now if you want to add some
functionality you can add it in the
command
so first we will declare the function
and add the functionality for a button
and after that we can use the
command
so we'll just pack it and see how a
button looks in a t
window so for that we will
use okay you have written it
here sorry for that
so we are set with a
button yeah we'll save this file and
click on the Run button you can see that
uh the button is displayed on the take
to window so it's clickable
so that's what make it differentiate
from the label it's clickable now we
will add functionality so
that we can have some text when we click
on
this so for
that first we'll create
a and we'll create the function here and
name it as
hello and here
we will create a
label in this
function and inside we will place a
text and that would
be I Learners Welcome
To
tenter tutorial
and
now in this function only we
will set like in the label for the label
will set the foreground
color uh forr color we will set it as
white and background color we will set
it as green
okay now we will pack it so that
it gets visible on a tick into window
so we can also pack it
here we will just use the pack method
and it
will get showed up in a take to
window so now we have created a
method or a function and we have that
functionality now we have to set the uh
this functionality to
a
button so for
that we
will write
command and that would be equal
to the name of the function that is
hello
and it's Capital
HED
okay and we have packed the
button so no need to do it
again so we'll save
this and run it so you can see that uh
we are seeing a button here and that
says click me to say hi that is what we
have set the text for it when we click
it we see the functionality that is it
has displayed a label with background
color that is green and foreground color
that is white and it displays the text
as hi Learners Welcome To teiner
tutorial
so this is about the button widget now
moving on now we'll start with the entry
widget so for
that oh
sorry first we'll comment
this and we'll also comment this
function so now we'll start with the
enter
Viet so why we use enter viget when we
want to get text from a user like a name
or an email address we use an entry
widget it's a display that display a
small text box that the user can type
some text into so creating and styling
an entry widget works pretty much
exactly like the label and the button
widgets so we will start with the entry
widget and for that first we'll create a
label only and on that label we will
place the enter
widget so first we'll create a variable
and name it as label only and after
that we
will go with this like creating label
and then we will add some text to the
label that would
be it will ask for what is your name or
will just add name to
it and here we will create the ENT
widget for that we will create a
variable and name it as entry and now
we'll create the entry
vidget so this is the simple method to
create any entry widget we have created
that and now we have to place or pack or
grd it to get a display on a take window
so here we will use
pack label do
pack and we'll also pack the enter
pet so we are done now we'll save it and
run it you can see that we have created
a label and place the text here that is
name and beneath that we have packed an
enter widget and inside we can enter
anything that's my name abisara and you
can enter
anything so these are the basic
functionalities for the entry vet you
could see our other videos to get the
hands on this entry widget and other
widgets to get the other attributes and
functionalities and use them in any app
you want to
make so moving on we will command this
this or I will give you an another
example for the entry
widget so for
that first we will create a label only
and
inside we will place the master that is
the window and assign text to it and
that would be name only here we will
create a form and it won't be having
some functionalities to store the
information but it would be a form for
name email
password and for that we'll use the
enter
widgets so we have created a label here
and here you
will so we will use the place
method to get it displayed on the take
into window and we'll set the x
coordinate as 30 and
by as 50
pixels and moving
on we will set the entry widget and a
label first we'll set the label for
email
so for that we'll also create a
label and inside we'll pass the master
that is
window
and set the text as email only
so it get displayed on the
label now we'll use the place method
only
to get it displayed on our TI into
window
and for
this I will use x = 30 and yal to 19 it
would in the
same x
coordinates and in y direction it would
be shifted downwards and that would be
yal to
19
now I will create another label and
store it in a variable that would be
password and to create it I will write
TK do
label Sor and
here the
small n for label and inside we will
pass the master window that is window
and set the
text as password only
and now we will place
this
label and we'll set the x coordinate as
30 and y will shift it downwards and set
it as
130
yeah so these would be the
labels and
now see these levels like how the paste
so you can see name email password and
now we will place entry widgets in front
of
them so to get the entry widgets first
we
will assign a variable and inside that
we will create an entry
widget that would be tk.
entry and inside we will pass a master
window
and now we will place this at xal to 880
like it would be sufficient I think so
we will see when we will get the this SP
now okay so we have set the x coordinate
as 80 and Y is 50 now we will make
another entry widget for email and then
for password so for this we will name
the variable as E2 and here we
will just a
second
okay okay we'll do
it tk.
entry and it would be capital for
that and that would be the master window
and we'll place
this at x =
80 and Y will shift it downwards that
would be same for the label email that
was
90
and now we'll create another variable
that is
E3 and for that
have created an entry
widget and now we will place this and
set the x coordinate as 880 only and y
coordinate that would be the same for
the label that was
130
so we will save this
and run
it you could see that name email
password that are the labels and we have
go to enter widgets and it's
overwriting so we will set this as
100 we'll save it and run it you could
see that it has shifted 20 pi apart from
this uh from its previous
position so this is about the ENT widget
so this is a basic tutorial so I won't
be getting into the get method delete
method or the insert method so there are
three main operations that you can
perform with entry wigets that is
retrieving text with get method that is
to get method and deleting text that is
with delete method and inserting text
that is with insert
method so we
will do this much only in this basic
tutorial and moving on now we will
create some frames so frame widgets are
important for organizing the layout of
your widgets in an application like you
have many widgets and you have used
around three to four widgets and you
want to organize them so you have to
create widget that is frame and inside
that frame widget you can organize all
the other
widgets so an empty frame widget is
practically invisible you won't be able
to see that if you haven't placed any
widget in that so frames are best
thought of as containers for other
widgets you can assign a widget to a
frame by setting the widgets Master
attribute as we have set the master
attribute as window in the enter widget
and in the label as we have seen in the
entry wiget example so here we will
start with creating
frames and for
that
first we will assign a
variable frame _ a and that would be
equal to tk. frame we will create a
frame sorry
and now we will create a label for
that and we
will assign the variable as label _ a
and that would be equal to TK
do
label and
inside we would get this label fixed
into the frame so for that we will set
the master as
frame so we have set the variable as
Master here and this variable contains
the
frame
now we will add the text to the label
and that would
be this is frame a we will name it as a
and here we can set the background color
also so here we will use the exxa code
for that we won't write the simple name
of the color so here we will write the
hexa code
and have taken its inverted
coma so now we have to set the
background color and that would be in
the inverted formas only so we'll start
with hash and and we'll set the color I
remember theod for 4 682
B4 two
color so you will get the background
color and now we will pack this label so
that it gets
displayed when take window
okay so for that we
will write the variable and use the back
method and now we'll create another
frame and store it in a variable frame
underscore B and inside we will create a
frame TK
dot frame
and here we will create another label
that would be label underscore B and
that would be equal to TK do
label and here we'll set the
master as frame only as we will be
setting this label into the frame so for
that we'll write frame undor
B now we'll set the text text that would
be this is frame
B
okay now we'll set the background color
and we will set the background color
different from the
above so you can differentiate
that so I
99 67 a
and for the hexa code you have to use
hash so what you call this color like
light red light orange or
anything so
just get that
sorted so we'll pack this widget for
that we'll use the variable label undor
P we'll use the pack
method and we have packed it
now we will save
this showing the
red okay we have not Place inverted Comm
so we'll save this and run
it label is not defined so we have
written label
[Music]
okay so sorry for my silly mistake so
we'll save this and run it again for you
guys so here we are not able to see
it so what oh we have not packed the
frame here so we would not be able to
see
that so we'll pack it here only so first
we will pack frame underscore a
dot
back and then frame underscore G do
pack now we'll save this and run it
again you could see there's two frames
displaying that is this is the frame a
and this is the frame B and this is the
label on above the frame and if we
just swap these packs what would happen
let's
see we'll save this and run the file
again you could see that the frame has
been shifted so the pack method it just
pack the widgets line by line by line in
a layer form so you must be careful with
that okay so now we'll see some app exp
for
the
frames we have seen how to create a
frame now we'll
see how these frames can be displayed
how how its appearances are like we have
the five appearances we will discuss
it and we will adjust these frames
according to their appearances and these
appearances can be called out with the
method or with the attribute that is
reliefed
so frame widgets can be configured with
a relief attribute that creates a border
around the frame you can set relief to
be any of the values uh that is the flat
value that we have seen that has no
border effect the default value then
there is sunun that is Su Ken in the
capitals that it creates a sunun effect
I will show you like what that effect is
then we have the raised then Groove and
the ridge so so for that we'll see a
simple
example and one important thing to apply
this border effect we must set the
Border withd attribute to a value
greater than word greater than one this
attribute adjust the width of the Border
in
pixels so for
that uh we will create the
frames and we will start with
border and that would be equal
to we will create a dictionary
here so for the flat
keyword we will create
a in the capital letters we have to
write flat
okay and for the sun
can we will
create TK
dot
second
okay and inary we have to place the
Bas and after sunen we have raised
Groove and rge so for
that we'll write
raised and we will get DK I have done a
mistake
above so this would be TK do s
comma and now we will have the group
order it is TK
dot
Groove comma and after that
r that is TK do
R
okay
so now
now we
will run a loop
for Relief underscore
name
comma
relief
and set the
border and that is we will I trade these
items one by one
and now we
will create a frame that would be DK
dot frame and set the master as
window and
the equal
to relief and set the Border width
that's also the point and we set it as
five
okay and
now we will back this
Frame so for that we'll use the pack
method do
pack and now we will create a
label that is TK dot
label and
inside we'll set the master as frame and
text we'll set the text
as Rel uncore name
and then we'll pack this
label okay now we'll save
this and display it for you guys so you
could see that first we have the flat
frame then Sun can then raised then
Groove then
rid
okay so if you want to set these frames
on the left side for that you can use TK
do left
tribute we'll save this and run it for
you
guys oh U we have to assign it inside
sorry I will save this and run it for
you guys so you can see that it has
shifted to left like all these are
packed in the left
Direction all the
frames so now moving
on now we will see the frames with
different
colors I'll just command this down
and now we will get the frames we'll
start with a variable and name it as
frame one and create a
frame TK
do
frame with capital F and inside we'll
set the
master as
window and width as 100
and height as 100 and background
color we'll set it as
red and now we will pack this
Frame so this Frame would be of the red
color so to pack this we will write
frame one that is the variable in which
the frame has been stored and we'll use
the pack method
so we have packed it now we will
use pill to fill this frame in the whole
window with that we'll write fill equal
to TK do Capital SX so it will get this
Frame fulfilled in the window in the X
Direction and similarly we will create
create another
frame I will copy paste it and name the
variable as variable as frame two and
inside I will change the
color and I will set the width and
height
now okay I will show you
like how it will
work pack this Frame two do
pack and now we'll also so set another
frame and name it as frame
three
okay and for this also we have to set
another color so that we can
differentiate that which frame is this
so we'll set it as blue now we will save
this and run it so you can see that uh
we have set the width and height but we
have used the fill attribute to fill it
in the whole
ex X Direction so it has good fill
up so these are the three frames we have
created now we have seen the basics or
the beginner for the T into module now
using these modules we will create a
simple project that would be Dollar to
Rupee converted as I have told you
earlier in the starting in the
introduction for
that we will just create a new file and
named as
dollar to rup
P converter
py so if like rupe
so here we will use the current value of
what $1 is equal to Rupee we will set it
as current value so we will search it in
the web and use it in a function okay so
we'll make this project a simple one or
just a simple app to get your hands on
with these
widgets okay so starting with importing
so first we'll import T
enter and as we have seen earlier we use
allias for that and here also we'll use
that and after that we
will create window that is equal to TK
or TK
class and window
dot main
Loop okay now we will set the geometry
of the window so for that we will
write and we will set the xais with 300
pixels and small X and Y AIS is 250
pixels okay and we won't be adding some
pixels to the x or the y direction it
will just come in the default section
that uh this ideally would get it appear
to okay now we'll use the configure
function and set the background color so
with configure you could set the
background color and other attributes so
for that we'll write
window do
config and inside we'll set the
background color
BG equal
to and I remember the hexa code for that
here we will use hexa code or you could
just write the name of the color Okay E9
67a we have used it previously the light
red
color okay now uh I have discussed with
you that the resizeable function but we
haven't used it in the
former that is the py file but here we
will use so for that we'll write window
do
resizable and inside we will set the
width equal to
false and height also as
false so you won't be able to adjust its
width or height width or
height and you won't be seeing any arrow
for that okay like if you place the
cursor on the border of the window now
you won't be able to see any error to
get it stretched out in the x or y
direction so we
have use the resizable function for that
now we'll set the title for this window
for that we'll write window do
title and inside we'll write the title
that would be dollar to rupe converter
converter
okay now first we will start with a
label and we will add the heading
as Dollar to Rupee converter
only so for that we will create a label
and place it inside the variable
L1 TK Dot
label and inside we will pass the master
as window and set the
text as dollar to rupe
converter and we can set the font also
okay for that we'll just use the font
attribute and inside we have to place
this in a circular
braces so for that we'll write we have
it inverted
comma uh we'll use aial
here okay and set the font size as 15
now we'll close the circular
bracket okay
we have to close one more and we'll set
the foreground color as
white
okay and we'll also set background
color and that we would set as hexa
code
B c0
c0
okay and that would be in the inverted
Hess else it would be termed as the
comment only and now we'll close the
circular
bracket
okay and we will pack it at the last
only now we will create another
label and for that we'll store it
in L2 variable for that we'll write TK
do label and inside we will pass window
as
master and
text and here we will set the label as
enter dollar amount okay
so that we'll write
text enter
dollar
amount
okay now we will add some functionality
and after amount we'll write the
colon now we'll set its
font in the Circ
Braes and we'll set this also as
a and set it size just smaller than the
heading that would be Dollar to Rupee
converter we set it as
10 okay
and we'll set it as
bold this we have to place it in
inverted
commas and after the font we'll set the
foreground
color that would be equal to
White and then we'll set the background
color we have taken the inverted coma
white now we'll set the background
color and for that we'll write the hexag
code
and that would be
A5 69
BD so we'll
see this purple
color so I call it
purple I'm bad with color so you can
see what you want to call this color or
like what's the fundamental name of this
color
so now we have created two levels enter
dollar amount and now we create we will
get another level and that would be for
amount in rupees like after we will
execute the Dollar to Rupee so that
would be displayed in that label that
would displayed just beneath this label
that we will be creating that would be
L3 and for that we will write tk. label
and inside we will pass the master as
window and set the
text S amount in
rupees
okay and now we'll set its font
and we'll set it same
only
as
area and with the font
size 10 and we'll also set it as
bold
okay so outside this
font we will set the foreground and
background color and that would be
foreground
color
white and background
color we'll write the EXA code for that
only and that would be same A5 69 VD
okay now we will create entry
widgets
so first entry widget that would be
for entering the amount enter dollar
amount
so this enter wiet would be B beneath
the enter dollar amount
label so for that we will create a
variable even1
and get an entry vet TK do
entry and we have e capital for the
entry and inside we will
pass master as
window and we'll set the font as areial
in the cir
Braes
okay and set the font size is 10 and no
bold for
it okay and in the window first we have
created the heading that was in the
label that is Dollar to Rupee converter
then we have cre a labor enter dollar
amount and beneath that we have created
an entry widget in which we will enter
the dollar amount and then we will
create a button to convert this dollar
amount into the
rupee so now we will be creating a
button so we will name the variable as
button
one now we'll pass
the window as
master and set the
font is
aial
and one size is 10
only
no but for Buton first we have to set
the text number what it should
display so it should
display
convert to
doar no convert to dollar convert to
rupe
okay so we have
set the
text and we have set the font and now we
have to place a command and that command
we have to place a function so that it
should convert the dollar amount into
the rupee so we have to create a
function we will create
it create it
here okay
and name it as convert
only so for
that we'll
write
convert and inside we will set a
variable and integer
type and here we are using the get
method to get the text that we have
inputed in the entry widget that is
stored in the even variable
and after that we will create a variable
F and inside we will write the dollar
value against a rupee that is
8071 Rupees is equal to
$1 so that would be multiplied with the
dollar
[Music]
amount that would be
C but we
will get it
oh
sorry
okay so
now now we
will now we will create a text
widget so for that we will create a
variable that is
T1 and create a text widget
TK dot text and inside we will pass the
window as
master and set the state as
disabled I will tell you
why
disabled and set its
width
as 15
and right as zero
okay so we'll also configure this in the
function
okay so we'll configure this and write
as T1
dot
config and we'll set it
State equal to
normal
okay and T1
dot
[Music]
delete that is if you want to delete you
can delete it test one by
one TK do
and and T1 do
insert and set it as it State as
disabled
okay now we will pack all these
widgets first we'll start with labels L1
do
pack then L2
dot
back then entry widget that is stored in
even even dot back
and
then
button do
pack and then
L3 dot back and then P1
dot
back okay
now we'll save this and run
it okay uh so we have to
create empty
text like empty labels
we will create it
here
Mt underscore
L1 and create a label that is TK do
label
okay and inside we will
pass window and set the background color
equal to
it would be e 99 67 oh
sorry E
9967 A that is the light red color okay
and here we will create an mty
label that is TK
not
label
and now we will pass the master as
window and background
color as light red only you'll write the
same hexa code
e99
678 sorry
I press shift also with
that
so
okay
now now we see our program and run
it so we're getting an error that
is defined at State equal to
normal okay
able to find so we'll just run it again
only okay we got that so you can see
that it's not resizable
we have created the convert method to
create the dollar amount that is we have
entered the dollar amount that is one
and we click on the button that is
convert to dollar it would reflect us to
8271 and if we get it deleted and enter
the dollar amount as 56 and click on the
button that is convert to dollar it
would display us as 56 into the value
that is
8271 so this is the small project that
we have created using the widgets that
is the T into widgets so I hope like you
