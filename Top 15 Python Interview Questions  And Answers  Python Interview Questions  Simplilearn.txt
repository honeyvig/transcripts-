said guys here's the agenda for our
today's session so guys we will be
covering questions from arrays list
strings then we will move on to doues
and set moving ahead we will also have
questions based on recursion algorithm
problems data handling and data
visualization so let's get started but
before that I request you guys that do
not forget to hit the Subscribe button
and click the Bell icon for further
updates so guys let's get started so
here's our first interview question that
is given to aray write python function
to return the intersection of the two
for example if we have X = to 1590 and Y
= 3029 then it should return 9 and zero
so how you will approach this problem by
coding in Python you can take your time
and then you can come to the solution so
guys in order to solve this question we
will have to create a python function
that will find the intersection of two
arrays and this function is going to use
the set data structure to efficiently
determine the common elements between
the two list so guys first what we are
going to do let us create a function
first so we are going to say the name
def intersect and you can just call it
as arrays okay and then let us give the
two argument A1 and
A2 pretty fine till here now after that
convert both of the list and sets to
remove the duplicates and allow for
intersection
so what we are going to do we are going
to create set one okay and this is going
to be set of array
one okay then next what we are going to
do we are going to create a set of two
okay and this is going to be assigned to
set of array two pretty
fine now now what we have to do guys we
have to find the intersection of both of
the sets so guys we can give a variable
name sets intersection so sets Okay and
this is going to equal
to set one okay
dot
intersection of set
two very easy guys and then we have to
convert the intersection set back to a
list before returning this list so what
we can do finally we can just
return
so return list and here we can give the
intersection of the same
so now we have done that let us take
example of the same so for example we
can take say x = to
15
09
and yals to say 3
0 2
9 and finally we are going to call this
as
result so rest equals to and finally we
can just call our function so our
function was intersect arrays so we can
just copy this and we can give the
arrays name that it will be X comma y
fine and then we can finally ask to
print the
result so in this way we are going to
find the intersection let us run our
notebook so we can see there are some
errors coming up so
okay so we can see that the answer is
coming 0 and N pretty fine right now so
we have completed our first question now
let us move to the next question so guys
our next question is given an array find
all the duplicates in this array for
example we have 1 2 3
1365 and we should return only one and
three so we can see one and three are
the only one which has been duplicated
so how you are going to approach this
problem you can pause this video for a
while and then you can come to this
video and then you can watch the
solution so guys to find all the
duplicates in an array in Python you can
use a dictionary or the collections do
counter to count the occurrences of each
element and then gather those with the
counts greater than one so for example
I'm going to show you a dictionary so
what we can do we can define a function
first say let's find a duplicate So Def
find say
duplicate and in this we are going to
take an argument array
Define now after that let us declare a
dictionary with name as
counts okay and let us create an list of
duplicates after that what we are going
to do we are going to count each element
in the array so let us go to the fall
Loop so
for Num in
Array
Okay then
if num in
counts okay then what I'm going to do
I'm going to put this that count
num or
else what we can do
we can
count on that num equals to
one so finally what we are going to do
in this code that we are counting the
occurrences of each element so we are
using the for Loop and we are
maintaining it with the count okay now
as you would have got the idea regarding
this so let me write this variable now I
hope so till here you are clear with it
in the next we are going to collect
elements that appear more than once so
guys for key and value in counts. item
if the value is greater than one what we
can do we can append that key okay I'll
show you right here what I mean so here
we can apply the for Loop so
for
key comma value and
counts and
okay so for key value in counts.
items so if the
value is greater than one okay what we
are going to do we are going to append
this list so
duplicates do
append with the required
key okay now what what we are going to
do finally and finally we are going to
return our duplicates
so so finally this function is going to
return duplicates now let us have the
example usage for example we have this
input
array
say one 2 3
1 3
6 comma
5 and the
result is equals to
find SL
duplicates and we are going to put the
input array
so now let us cross check the functions
we have so it is f
duplicate this is
we're going to exclude this now let us
run our this code so it says there is a
error okay now let us see what's the
error in this so it says for key and
value in counts. item okay so it says
unindent does not match the outer end so
there's indentation problem okay so guys
as you can see all over here we have
given our duplicates 1 2 3 1 3 65 and we
are finding the duplicates in this input
AR and our result is 1 and three very
easy so go through this question this
question has a high probability of being
asked in the interview question so don't
miss it out now let us move to our third
question so guys our next question is
that you have to rotate a list to the
right by K places where K is a non-
negative number for example we have an
input of 1 2 3 4 5 and k equals to 2 so
your rotated array is going to look like
something 4 51 2 3 okay so basically
when k equals to 2 so 0 1 and two so
after this all the numbers are going to
come first and then in the same process
like 1 2 and three are going to go back
so it's a rotation problem and let us
see how we can approach this
problem so guys in order to solve this
problem of rotating a list right by K
places where K is a non- negative you
can use a straight forward approach then
this involves slicing the list and
rearranging the parts but here's the
another way you can try it that is by
normalizing so guys since the rotating
the list by its length suppose it has a
length of n it results the same list so
you can normalize by K by taking K mod n
or k percentage n where n is the length
of the entire list so what is going to
do this is going to handle the cases
where k is greater than n okay so let us
try to see the problem so we have
created a function called def rotate
list and I have taken two parameters
nums and K now here I'm defining n as
the length of the given list so if n is
equals to zero I want it to return the
nms okay the given parameter which we
have given okay the length of the given
list so now after this we have to
normalize so in order to avoid like it
we K repeat where K becomes greater than
n so k equals to K modul N so this is
our normalization and after this we are
performing the rotation so by Rotation
by slicing so rotated list equals to
nums of minus K dot plus nums of K so
this means that till K you have to
partition it okay and after post of K
you have to do the partition and after
that we are returning the rotated list
so you can see the input list we have 1
2 3 4 5 and here k equals to 2 so what
is going to return so the given list
okay so K dot means since two and post
two and pre2 so you have to take that
into consideration so guys after post we
are adding the pre so for example K = to
2 so 0 1 and two so these comes so four
and five is be going to be put all over
here then after that threee of two are
going to be placed and finally we are
concatenating it so 45123 is going to be
our output so let us run this program
and we can see we are getting the output
4 5 1 2 and 3 very easy problem okay now
let us move on to the next problem so
guys the next question is given an
integer array find the sum of largest
contiguous subarray within the array for
example given the array a equals to 0 -1
- 5 - 2 3 and 40 so it should return 70
because of three and 40 so there's a
note also that if all the elements are
negative then it should return a zero so
it has given the case study for example
you have to consider an integer array
and you have to find the sum of largest
contiguous subarray so this is a
subarray problem let us try to approach
this so for example we have the input
list 0 -1 -5 - 2 3 and 40 so we have to
take a case on this and it should return
70 so guys to solve this problem you can
use the cadan algorithm which
efficiently finds the maximum subarray
within the time complexity of ofn and
this algorithm maintains the running sum
of Maximum subarray found so far and
updates it as it traverses the array
additionally to handle the case where
all the elements are negative so such
that you want to return zero in such a
case you can initialize the maximum sum
as zero so here's the python
implementation of the scene so guys
here's the solution to this problem let
us Define the function Max subarray and
which is going to take nms as the
parameter now we are going to initialize
variables to tracks the current sum and
the best sum found so current sum equals
to zero and maximum sum is also equals
to zero then we have to Traverse through
the array and update the current sum and
Max sum accordingly so for example for
Num in nums okay then we have to update
the current sum and reset it to zero if
it becomes negative so if current sum is
less than zero then you have to put the
current sum equals to zero and then
update it that maximum sum equals to Max
of you can take a Max function then take
Max sum and the current sum and finally
we are returning the max sum so this is
very easy so basically what we are doing
so we are taking two variable current
sum and Max sum and we are traversing
through this nums array and we are
finding that if our current sum is
equals to Z
okay then we are updating our current
sum such that current sum equals plus
now okay so we are adding the current
sum with the given number like the
iterator number basically we are using
for example if it is one so current sum
will be equals to 0 so 0 + 1 will be
there and then if it goes negative so if
current sum is less than zero then we
are putting it to zero very easy suppose
if you have negative numbers in your
array so that covers this situation now
I hope so you have got the idea
regarding the same and finally we are
taking the maximum of Max sum and the
current sum okay so in this way we are
going to print the maximum part of it
which is 17 now let us take this and let
us try to run our application so you can
see we have printed 70 so this clearly
covers the idea regarding this question
now let us move to our next question so
guys our next question is def find tles
and list in Python and what are the
major differences between them so guys
this is one of the very basic question
so in Python list and tles both are
sequence data types that can store
collection of items they are used to
store multiple items in a single
variable and have several similarities
but there are significant differences
that affect how and when you should use
each for example if you take a list so a
list in Python is a mutable changeable
ordered sequence of elements each
element inside a list can be accessed
added edited or removed and lists are
defined by having values between a
square
bracket for example if we Define a list
say list l so which is equals to say 1 2
3 and also we can put
hello pretty fine and also we can add a
Boolean value so let's add
true now let us talk about the tles so a
tle in Python is a immutable or
unchangeable ordered sequence of
elements this is very important and once
a tle is created you cannot change add
or remove its elements tles are defined
by having values between parentheses and
this way we cover the definition of tles
so for example if we Define the tle so
it it is going to look something like
this so T equals to say
we take the parenthesis and suppose we
add 1 2 and three this forms our tle now
if we talk about the major differences
we know that in list are mutable okay
and tles are
immutable so that's the basic difference
next you can talk about their syntax so
like if you talk about list they use
square brackets whereas tles uses
parenthesis if we talk about performance
guys then t are faster than list because
of their immutable nature of tles Now
list being mutable they are slightly
slower as compared to tle okay and they
also require additional operations for
memory so in this way you can
differentiate between tles and list now
let us move on to our next question so
guys our next problem is on anagram so
it says given an array of strings group
anagrams together okay okay suppose we
have strings like eat T tan eight Nat
bat so our output should look like
something like this it should be eight
eat T natat tan and bat okay now to
solve the problem of grouping anagrams
together forming a given array of
strings you can utilize a dictionary to
help organize words by their signature
so guys what's a signature a signature
can be formed by sorting the characters
in each string which ensures that all
anagrams will have the same signatures
so for example what we are going to do
we are going to create a dictionary so
you can use a dictionary to map each
sorted version of a string such that the
strings to a list of strings can be
added and when it is sorted you can
match that signature then you you can
use the sort each string for each string
in the list you can sort the strings to
generate its signature and add the
original string to the corresponding
list and then finally you can collect
the results so basically here's a python
implementation of the scene so guys as
you can see all over here we have
defined the function named group
anagrams and we have taken arguments
words so here's our dictionary anagram
dict then we are taking the for Loop and
finally we are sorting it okay with the
empty string using the join function
okay and we are using the sorted
function then if sorted word not in
anagram dictionary then what we are
doing basically we are putting it into
this anagram dictionary with the
category of the sorted word which we
have created so this is the required
variable okay now this will be equals to
an word dictionary now finally if this
does not happen then else you can put
anagram dictionary in the sorted words
and you can upend that it in the word so
these are the certain things where word
is our iterator okay so this is equal
ALS to a number which we are basically
storing so now finally we are extracting
the list so we are presenting the groups
into a list okay so finally the
dictionary is converted into the list so
list anagram dict values and finally we
are returning our result so here is our
input words and finally we are calling
our function with this word as the
parameter so let us run this and let us
see whether our output is coming or not
and we can see we are getting the output
of the anagram words so eat T eight tan
Nat and bat so we had this as the
anagrams are certain things like suppose
it is there so T is ending with t so it
is next word is starting with t you can
see the next word is ending with a and
here the next word is starting so
similarly tan and Nat are grouped and
bat are grouped so what we have to do
all over here the entire logic Remains
the Same and it is here so you have to
create a variable all over here sorted
word and let's say be empty and you have
to join it with the word word means in
the griven dictionary whatever the word
like suppose eat T tan so initially we
are putting it in empty words now if
this word okay if this sorted word is
not in anagram dictionary means it is
not present in our dictionary so we can
just do what we can put this in our
dictionary so we can take this parameter
as sorted word okay and put that word in
this so similarly like we are grouping
in this case like eat and T okay now
else if it is not present in our
dictionary so anagram sorted dictionary
is appending that word okay so here the
assignment is happening and here we are
appending it so finally which results us
e tee eight tan Nate and bat very tricky
question has a higher probability to be
asked in the exam now let us move on to
our next
question so guys our next question is
given an integer n and integer K output
a list of all combinations of K numbers
choosen from 1 to n for example if n =
to 3 and K = 2 you have to return 1 2 1
3 and 2 3
so how is this going to happen so guys
this is going to happen by generating
all the possible combinations of K
numbers from set of numbers ranging from
1 to n you can use this so there is a
python iter tools. combination function
and this function is designed to
generate the combination without
repetition based on the specified length
so how you can do this so for example
you can import iter tool okay from
combinations and then you can generate
the given combinations so let me show
you so guys as you can see all over here
I am importing iter tools from
combinations then I am creating a
function Dev generate combinations NK is
a given parameter okay where I'm
creating a range from 1 to n so range
function I'm using and I'm putting this
from 1 to n plus one and I'm storing
this into the variable or assigning it
into a variable called numbers this then
I'm using ID tools. combinations to
generate all the combination of the
length ke and finally we are converting
it into a list and storing it in the
result so in this function basically
what we are doing so we can see there is
a range 1+ n plus one so this is
basically generating the numbers from
one up to n and the combinations of
number comma K you can see so in this
line so what this is basically doing
this is producing the com combination of
numbers in numbers okay taken k at a
time so each combination is returned as
a tle and all the combinations are
stored in a list so this output of tles
in the list represents the combination
of numbers chosen so if you need them in
specific format like list of list
instead of list of tles you can convert
them accordingly now let us run our code
and we can see we are getting it in the
form as 1 2 1 3 and 2 three
so this is generating the same and so we
are getting an output of list of all the
combination of K numbers chosen from 1
to n so in this scenario I have put Nal
3 and K = 2 very amazing question has a
higher probability to be asked in the
exam now let us discuss the next
question so guys our next question is
pretty interesting and it says write a
function to generate n samples from a
normal distribution and plot them on the
histogram so guys in order to solve this
question you need to know about normal
distribution so to generate the samples
from a normal distribution you can plot
them on the histogram so you can use
Python's Library called as numpy for the
generation of samples and mat plot clip
for plotting the histogram so here's the
implementation so guys as you can see
all over here we are importing numpy as
NP and we are importing the mat plot lib
okay then finally we are defining a
function plot normal distribution
samples and here we have to take the
three parameters the first one is n
second one is mean and the third one is
standard deviation we have initialized
mean equals to zero and standard
deviation equals to 1 then we are
generating n samples from a normal
distribution with specified mean
standard deviation and with that we are
going to plot the histogram so it's more
of a mathematical problem but if you
have a little bit idea regarding normal
distribution you can achieve this so we
can see there is a parameter n where the
N denotes the number of samples okay and
mean is there for the normal
distribution and similarly we have
included standard deviation for the
normal distribution finally here we are
generating the samples so samples equals
to we are using the nump library so np.
random. normal okay and I have given loc
location equals to mean scale is
standard deviation and of the size n so
it is very standard and after that we
are plotting the histogram with PLT
doist so I've have taken samples then
bins equals to 30 Edge color we have
given black and Alpha equals to
0.7 and finally we are putting the title
as histogram distribution sample on the
X level there is a value and Y is
frequency and we have put the grid as
true and finally we are asking it to
show it now let us run this so we can
see it has generated the histogram of
normal distribution samples very
interesting question I hope so you are
clear with it now let us move on to the
next question now guys let us take a
question from pandas a very popular
Library so the question says that what
is the difference between apply and
apply map functions in pandas so guys in
pandas the functions apply and apply map
serve different purposes although they
both apply a function along the x-axis
of the data frame or in Panda series
but here you can use them so for example
in apply is used to apply a function
along the axis of the data frame so it
can be either a row or a column it can
be used to operate on the entire row or
column at once and this function is
extremely flexible and can return a
single value or a series or even a data
frame then if we talk about flexibility
guys it works on a complete row or
column and can be used to implement
aggregation transformation and other
operations that consider multiple
elements at once so for example let me
show you so say we have
this
import pandas as PD okay then we can
Define our data frame so DF equals to PD
do data
frame and
finally here we can give as a
all over here and we can give the value
as list as 1 2 and
three
similarly we can change the given
thing as
B and we can change this value as
four five and
six and and finally we have closing this
so by applying a function to each column
say default axis equals to zero so we
can store the result certain in
something like this so let us create the
variable called result and this is
equals to say DF DOA apply okay and we
can use our Lambda expression so
Lambda
X and here we can take
x.
Max okay
minus x.
Min pretty fine so we are applying a
function to each column all over here
and if you talk about like apply map so
apply map is used to apply a function to
each elements of the data frame so this
method is available only for data frames
not for series object that is the most
important thing and if we talk about
element wise operation so apply map
operates element wise and it is very
suitable for operations that depend on
the value of the single cell and they do
not need to consider other elements in
the row or column so guys that was a
basic difference between apply and apply
math functions now let us move on to the
next question so guys our next question
is on strings and it says given a string
return the first occurrence character in
it so on none if there is no recurring
character for example if the input is
python interview questions and the
output is n so as you can see N is a
recurring alphabet so we have to find
the recurring character in this given
string so guys to find the first
recurring character in a string you can
use a python function that tracks a
character you have seen as you iterate
through the string you can utilize a set
to efficiently check if a character has
appeared before so for that here's a
simple implementation so slides as you
can see all over here we have defined
the function first recurring character
and we are taking input string as a
given argument now here is a variable
called scene and it is stored as a set
now let us iterate through the each
character in the string so for car in
input string if car is present in this
set so what I want to do I want to
return the first recurring character
then finally we are adding this
character into the set if it is not
already seen and if it is not present we
are returning the none very basic for
Loop and conditionals we have applied
okay now in this we are presenting the
input string okay and let us see what
our output would be when we are calling
the given function so you can see we are
getting output of n so this is very
basic guys and I hope so you have got a
brief idea regarding this now let us
move on to our next question so guys as
you can see our next question is given a
positive integer X return an integer
that is a factorial of x if a negative
integer is provided it should return
minus one and implement the solution
using recursive function so guys we have
got a problem on recursion and it is
mostly asked in TCS or extens interview
question so whenever you are having a
technical round so you're going to have
a higher probability to be asked now let
us see the solution of this question so
guys to calculate the factorial of a
given positive integer X using recursion
and to return minus one for negative
integers you can Implement a simple
recursive function so here's how you can
do it so you can see all over here we
have defined a function def factorial X
okay so if we are hitting our base case
means x equals to Z what we are
returning it as one and if the input is
negative we are returning minus one as
indicated and finally we can see a
recursive case so if it is not hitting
both of the cases then we are basically
returning X into X factorial x -1 so
basically what it is doing guys so say
if we put X = to Zer so we know that we
are getting its factorial as one now we
are getting factorial of one now if x is
greater than 0 say suppose we are taking
one so 1 into factorial of 0 so
factorial of 0 is 1 so 1 into 0 will be
one similarly next if x = to 2 so 2 into
factorial of one so it becomes two so
you can see we are going to get a series
of multiplication so in that way we can
find this solution using recursion so
let us try to print the output so we can
see we are getting output as 120 minus1
and one so we have finally completed
this problem using recursion definitely
try this problem guys one of the most
frequent ask questions in the interview
now let us move on to our next question
so guys our next question is given an M
byn Matrix with positive integers
determine the length of longest path of
increasing within the Matrix for example
let us see so guys in order to find the
longest increasing path in an M * n
Matrix of positive integers you can use
a technique called depth first search
approach and combined with
memorization this problem is going to
involve exploring all the possible paths
from each cell and caching the result to
avoid redundant computation now so in
this approach we are using DFS with
memorization for each cell in The Matrix
use DFS to explore possible increasing
path starting from the cell then cure
the length of the longest path starting
from the each cell to avoid the
recomputation then also go on the edge
conditions like you will only move to
the adjacent cells that contain a higher
volume to ensure that the path is
increasing finally you have to implement
the steps so you can create a DFS
function that explores all the four
possible directions like up down left
and right and it is returning the length
of the longest path and finally use
memorization table a 2d list basically
to store the length of the longest path
starting from each cell iterate over
each cell in The Matrix and you can
initiate a DFS if the cell hasn't been
explored so here is the implementation
of the same so guys as you can see all
over here we have created a function
called def longest increasing path and
we have taken an argument called Matrix
so if not Matrix or Matrix is present
okay then we are returning it zero and
finally we are defining our DFS function
with I and J as the two given variable
so if it is already computed then return
the cached value so if memo of I and J
is not equal to zero we are returning
the given memo then we are exploring all
the possible four directions like 0 1 1
0 0us and - 1 0 so it is denoting
the up left right and bottom and say we
have initialized our maximum length as
one okay so in order to find the DI and
DJ means the distance what we are taking
the two variables as n i and NJ okay and
we are incrementing it with I and G and
then finally we are using if an i is
greater than zero it is less than M and
NJ is greater than equal to Z and less
than n so finally The Matrix is also are
seeing in this Matrix we are seeing that
n i and NJ should be greater than the
Matrix of I then finally we are printing
the maximum length so using the max
function we are finding the maximum
length and we are returning this DFS and
finally we are storing the memo of I J
equals to maximum length so which is
basically our cache length and finally
we are returning the maximum length so
you can see later on what we are doing
we have taken m&n and and we are
multiplying the length of the Matrix
into length of the Matrix Z so later on
we have created the variable called memo
all over here and in this we are
multiplying it with n okay for element
at zero index and in the range of M and
we have initialized our result equals to
zero then we can start DFS from each C
for I in range of M for G in the range
of n we can result equals to maximum
result of DFS i g so here we can see The
Matrix of 9994 668 211 so let us see
what is our longest increasing path so
this was a basic idea regarding the code
the code can seem a little bit more
exhaustive but if you try to do it with
the concept it will be solvable now we
can see the longest path it's showing is
four so this is the output of our given
problem so let us go again with this
problem so here basically in this what
we are doing is we are traveling from 1
to 2 2 to 6 and 9 so that has become the
four okay so this is our longest
increasing path so 1 to two Okay then 2
to 6 then 6 to 9 so this is our maximum
path we can follow so four is the given
output now let me go through this
problem once again for example here we
have taken a DFS function okay so this
DFS function is called recursively to
explore each Direction it checks whether
a move is valid stays within the bound
or moves a higher value then you can see
we have taken the use of memorization so
memo of inj is stores the length of the
longest increasing path from cell inj so
guys this reduces the time complexity by
avoiding the recalculating parts of the
same cell then we are doing the result
calculation so we are iterating through
each cell starting a DFS if the longest
path from that cell has not been
computed then we are printing the
maximum value obtained from all the dfl
calls and that is our result so this
approach is basically efficient for
matrices where many values are not
recomputed due to caching thus making it
a feasible for larger matrices so that's
the solution of this problem now let us
move to our next problem so guys our
next question is explain flask what
flask is and its benefits so guys as we
all know that flask is a popular
microwave framework written in Python it
is called micro framework because it
does not require particular tools or
libraries it has no database abstraction
layer form validation on any other
components where pre-existing third
libraries provide common function
however flas supports extensions that
can add application features like here
we can say suppose if you want to add
Simplicity flexibility okay lightweight
features then you can use it flask is
also extensible that it can be extended
with extensions available to additional
functionality like object relational
mappers form validation upload handling
and various open authentication
Technologies and several common
Frameworks related tool then you can
also say it has a buil-in developer
server and debugger so flask also
includes a built-in server and debugger
which makes it easy to develop and test
your applications locally so this is
flask and this are some of of its
benefits now let us move on to the next
question so guys our next question is
what is the difference between list
arrays and sets in Python and when you
should use each of them very basic
question guys so guys in Python list
arrays and sets are all Container data
types that store collection of items
each type serves a different purposes
and use in specific scenarios depending
on the needs of the program so for
example list let's are like R1 the most
versatile data structures in Python they
are ordered mutable and can hold a
heterogeneous assortment of objects then
if I talk about characteristics lists
are ordered meaning that the items have
been defined in order and that order
will not change until unless you change
it so guys as you can see all over here
that lists are mutable meaning you can
change their content without changing
their identity you can also have a
duplicate element in a list so it is
always advisable to use list when you
need an ordered collections that can
change and might include the duplicate
entries suitable for the cases where you
need to perform frequent read and write
operations now if I talk about arrays
arrays in context of python arrays
module or the numpy arrays are
specifically optimized for numerical
data and offer more storage efficiency
and operations which are tailored to
numerical processing like you can use
numpy arrays and a situation when an
extensive set of operations are for
mathematical and logical based arrays
are also mutable and ordered so you can
use arrays when you need to store large
amount of numerical data for scientific
Computing or other operations that
require efficient and compact storage
with vectorized operations like for data
analysis machine learning or any task
that requires efficient array
computation the next one is sets so guys
sets are unordered collection of unique
elements they are like mutable and
provide operations to perform common
sets of operations like unions
intersections differences and symmetric
differences sets are like unordered so
they do not record element in position
or order of insertion we can use sets
whenever you need to ensure that a
element appears only once in a
collection so ideal for membership
testing removing duplicates from
sequence performing mathematical set
operations like Union intersection
symmetric Etc so this was all about this
question now let us move on to our next
question so guys let us move to our
final question that is what are some of
the common ways to handle missing data
in Python and which method do you prefer
and why so guys as we all know that
handling missing data is a crucial
aspect of data pre-processing especially
in real world scenarios where data
incompleteness can skew or invalidate
analysis python particularly with
libraries like pandas and numpy provides
robust methods for dealing with missing
data so here are some of the common
strategies the first one that is is
removing
data okay so like dropping rows or
columns with missing values using dropn
function okay so you can use when this
data set is too large or when the
missing data is not significant and it
is not likely to introduce bias so in
that scenarios you can use it there are
certain drawbacks to it like you can use
valuable data also that could be
critical for analysis the second
technique that comes up to my mind is
imputation so guys when you're are
filling missing values with either a
test statistic like mean median mode
okay for numerical data or a frequent
category for categorial data this can be
done using fil now or a simple imputer
from skarn impute so you can use it when
the Integrity is crucial and you cannot
afford to lose data points
a drawback of this is that potentially
it is introducing bias or affecting the
distribution of the data so using
algorithms is a third
part repeat so third one is predicting
the missing values using algorithms to
predict missing values based on other
data in the data sets techniques can
range from simple linear regression to
more complex approaches like K nearest
neighbors or random Forest so when the
missing values are substantial and
there's a reasonable hypothesis that
other variables can predict the missing
values so you can use this so it is
computationally intensive and can
overfit if not properly tuned next one
is using a constant to fill the missing
data
so guys filling missing data with a
constant is not present in the data
likeus 999 for instance like to
differentiate the real data from the
field ones so often used in modeling
competitions or specific algorithms that
can handle peculiar values and interpret
them appropriately the drawback of this
is that it can skew the analysis if not
handled correctly so Guys these were
some of the common ways to handle the
missing data in the python now for me I
would like to prefer the imputation
because imputation combined with
indicator variables especially for data
sets where missing values are
informative so guys in this way it can
yeld a better result so guys that was
