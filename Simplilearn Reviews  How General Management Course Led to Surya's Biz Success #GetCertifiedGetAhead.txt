my sister was studying a second of
Dentistry I remember her telling me how
hard it was for them to conduct rural
Dental camps because the dental armers
would only have a capacity to treat one
patient at a time so we came up with an
idea of inventing tental trolleys where
students can carry many trolleys in
their transport and they could treat
many patients in the dental rural drives
this is when we found L Innovation LLP
currently one of the the fastest growing
Dental R&D engineering company while
pitching to the investors for funding I
found that there are many management
Concepts that I was not aware of hence I
researched and joined I am indoors epgm

learned a lot and built a strong
networking within my
batch hi uh my name is Su I'm rajandran

never think of the future always take uh
small steps each time and that's all my
uh childhood is all about as a startup
founder uh we always face a challenge in
the initial stage but Contracting that
we have something Grant in hand so the
financial was not a problem for us in
the initial the main problem what we had
is customer acquisation that's the main
challenge we faced navigating through
problems is what uh we did through as a
team work so we did some market research
customer acquisition plans hiring some
mentors through that we overcame the
problems and struggles and still we have
some problems left with us so we are
technically strong we have built the
product we went for investor for funding

students there in terms of
Entrepreneurship and uh research and
development when you want to become a
successful entrepreneur you need to have
proper financial planning I see many
students jump into entrepreneurship
directly I say them that they need to
work in a relevant industry for a year
or two gain some experience save some
money and not to have big Financial
commitment and then start a journey
that's where uh I I see them will
prosper in life
