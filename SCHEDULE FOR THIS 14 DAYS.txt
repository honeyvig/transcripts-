yes hi everyone and very good morning to
one and all
here we go through the schedules and if
you see this today's
5k the paper was in the in the range of
need and the questions were measure that
the bushings are easy but it's all about
like what what is at the end ok this
course are pretty good when come back to
the last week and I can see the people
are working hard because the number of
people who has qualified the exam are
increasing week by week we we we came
across like 170 180 odd people who has
made this yesterday and I was very happy
seeing the top scorers and there is lots
of improvement in many of you guys ok
that's what we need when we are
approaching towards the examination
so going in detail into this 14 days
plan of action that 14 days we are going
to cover the general are not Delta
anatomy and dental histology and
covering few other topics which are
important in examination for interview
so this sort of core relationship study
is very very important when you are
approaching towards examination
right so a covering under subject while
you are dealing with one subject it's
going to save your time that is the
smartest thing rather than saving your
time it's going to increase your
confidence levels of tackling the
particular question in a particular
topic so this what the plan of action is
so first day that is the 31st July today
we are going with
embryology and I mean details about the
development and growth of the teeth
which is dental histology part whereas
embryology you can go with your general
and automation I'm going to post few
slides in the group we can just follow
them so followed by osteology
coming to the 2nd august you are going
to cover salivary glands general anatomy
point and dental histology of the saliva
glands followed by the thyroid glands
and not to me and surgical parts of
thyroid glands even surgical parts of
salivary gangs and thyroid leads which
are important both in the general
surgery as well as in the oral surgery
please make a note of it
coming to the third Isis you are going
to cover enamel and dentin and pulp and
Anatomy of the tongue that is gentle
Anatomy again suppose we can cover in
the part also so forth I guess you can
cover cement Imperial irregular bone or
a mucous membrane that is a pareo path
as well as the oral history part
TMJ maxillary sinus can be covered in
jungle Anatomy or lobotomy and oral
history also this is using primarily
dentition
calcification in eruption of the tooth
and the occlusion what illusion is one
of the important concepts in the case of
prosto as well as in the case of
inductors we're in conservator - so
vascular marrow sublevel supply of head
and neck calcification eruptions of the
teeth physiological form of the teeth
and the peridot shape so this is what
the plan of action for these 14 days and
I hope you people will definitely catch
up this because the schedule was made
not to make you too
irritated because if you if you go with
only and not to me definitely it's going
to saturate your levels and make you
feel frustrated so that's the reason why
we have started with embryology that
school osteology may be tricky
salivary glands and thyroid glands
interesting and I will take in pulp and
tongue you can make it go forward by
cement PDL and a lot of bone what will
make us remember and find TM Jen my
exhibition is merited and followed by
the irritating things of the vascular
now supply a muzzles of head and neck so
some sort of a not an autumn a related
stuff may make your I mean make your
preparation volatile so that's the
reason why we have distributed dental
histology which is comparatively easy
dental a note I mean numerical based
concept based but it's easy compared to
general and also we have distributed in
such a way that you will not get
frustrated and definitely the team is
going to increase your confidence levels
apart from this making the subject more
interesting so this is one and the
second thing what I want to share with
you is
about the plan of action like what we
are going to do from now the rapid files
will be more focusing on the basics I
feel like majority of you people are
good at clinicals okay so
from the inputs taken from the last
batch toppers they
they're requesting that the the main
motto is to focus more on the basics
rather than the technicals because
clinical point of your MDS Conger is
going a bit good good in the concept
wise and so let's deepen the subject
wise when compared to many other
Institute's and basics basics we just
want to focus more on basics from the
from this
Chris I mean from in this last four four
three to four months so that's the
reason why the basics graphic fest will
be focusing more on the basics rather
than going for the technicals for at
least like one one and half months so a
input of like 10 to 20 percentage of the
basics will be covered in the rapid
files in the span of this one two months
so once we are done with is one or two
months last one - once we are focusing
in a balanced way that we are where we
we go into cover like the clinicals in
the similar way as that other basics so
that is what the plan of action is
so apart from this there are few more
questions that were posted by the group
mates I just want to give solutions for
these questions sorry I am an intern
completing my course this number I'm not
getting time to read in the college and
after college I am reading just for one
hour I'm just following the wot subgroup
discussions but unable to complete the
topic schedule of the day I am left with
the automax official and processor
posting so I am thinking to bunk these
three months and read at home after
exams I will go through the extensions
okay that's a very fine because we have
already explained about this in the
group itself that you need to take your
own move for your preparation because
life is all about taking a risk if you
want to earn or if you want to achieve
something you need to sacrifice few
things and you need to take a risk the
risk may be a positive or a negative one
because success is going to decide if
you are successful the risk is a
positive if you are not successful that
it is going to be negative so you are
taking a risk but if you make it as a
successful thing definitely this risk is
going to get positive in your life
so for me to the management of time for
the intense
yeah it's the difficult thing I accept
it but if you see the tapas of this week
and exam
out of top ten
eight an intense
heat or intense similar way they are
attending the colleges similar to you
they are acting the clinicals similar to
you they are going to complete the
internship and the numbers similar to
you they may bunt the college for three
or four months and prepare similar
everything is similar but it's all about
the way we think okay life is all about
illusion according to me
it was an illusion right so I am an end
up eg I am working in the in the
department spending with the time with
the patients spending with the time in
all aspects what I need to do again in
coming and taking discussions all about
the illusion but in terms solution is
very very high because it leaves with
something like
which can be modified if you if you have
a positive illusions this one if you
have a negative thing that's going to
pull you back yes I will not have time I
will not have time I don't have time I
don't have time I don't have yes you
don't have time yes I have time I can
use the time in a better way yes I have
a little time but I am ready to use in a
better way definitely will have them
you will have a time if you have that
intention of yeah how to do this I have
to finish this yes you can do this maybe
it may not be possible when you are
posted in an endo Department or when you
are posted in a processor Department may
not be few colleges people they don't
hello the interns to study that's okay
that's okay but whatever you how you
should use them in a efficient that's
what I mean I mean all this - on is like
you need to use in an efficient way if
you have one of us use it in an
efficient way rather than keeping your
mobile phone talking with your friend
chatting with your friend studying that
that doesn't mean you are using the time
what you have an efficiently you said
like I already had a limited amount of
time so now you need to use that limited
amount of time in an efficient way so
that the efficient way is going to give
you a better results this is what the
solution I can give so banking the
college and studying it's all your moon
your risk so I hope that your risk
should be converted into a positive risk
with a good success so this is what a
solution that I can give for you
so the next question is curosurf
honestly I need some motivation I felt
like I lost the persistence and from the
past two months I'm not able to
concentrate all about okay this is all
about like what you need to do for the
four months right so that that's what I
was planning to you okay I was so
demotivated people have finished the
pulse why so fast it don't come back
first of all don't come back because
it's all your game your life so there is
no one that's going to enter your life
and they said it's not about a
comparison it's about like doing
yourself motivating yourself it's all
about like motivation if you have a tick
member and over you even if I motivate
it may not reach you but if you allow it
it reaches that's similar because
motivation I can give but you have to
accept the motivation solutions I can
give you have to accept the suggestions
so things are like it's move it is very
important that I am NOT I'm motivating
the resists impulsiveness you're
accepting is that is more than 90
percentage so I feel like you are more
important in this cycle whether it is
with me or whether it is with X Y Z or
anyone you are more important rather
than the person on the other set so you
decide what you are going to do we are
going to help you we are going to give
solutions we are going to use the stuff
we are going to motivate you okay we
will do all sorts of things because it
is not 1 and 1 like we have 700 to 800
strength 800 people I mean at least less
out of 800 there are 400 people who
prepare seriously right so for these 400
we need to work we need to do our job so
it's all about you need to tackle them
accept them using a better way that such
that the results will be positive I mean
the confidence will raise so that's what
I mean so the four month is left our you
are with 20 to 24 are subjects it's very
easy it's very very easy if you follow
the group blindly if you if you take the
suggestions in a positive sense it's all
about being positive I mean you need to
be positive and if you are doing the it
definitely you'll end up with success
it's not about don't worry about what
the things are done I have wasted two
months for these are how they say two
months for that okay so over now you
should not waste a single stick thinking
about the past you have to work hard in
a better way thinking about your future
what what I am going to be next year by
this time yeah a perfect GDC this is
what my dream is this is what my dream
College is this is what my dream
Department is I want to be okay
celebrate your next birthday in a better
Judy's in a better department with a
better capitis that's what your
intention is because this goal or this
rain is going to make you to send the
better to society you know in a better
lifestyle I mean this can help you to
bring your bring back your family to a
good status so these are all the things
you have to do you have to think not
about what was done in the past past is
past you think about future you feel
about future now if you start doing that
definitely
there will be a positive vibrations that
are going to influence you motivate you
and once you get motivated no one can
stop you that's what I mean right so
plan of action you can just follow a
concur with a few modifications in the
preparation so that's we are going to
have a balanced preparation because we
are already done with a few of the
subjects in the second round so we need
to focus more on the cumulative - every
day I feel like you guys need to break
the subjects like at least you need to
give one hour one and half hour per day
for cumulative okay so break it into
three parts make it as half an hour half
an hour half an hour so this week you
are having a 14 day schedule so
every day you can cover half half half
an hour a series of just half an hour
per day for the first week so first week
you are going to cover three subjects
everyday half an hour so it's going to
be 3 and half hours per subject in a
week so next week you are going to cover
other three subjects so totally you are
going to cover a cumulative of 4 6 or
less which are already terms that is
endo medium cons oral pathology or OU
medicine and already all you do this
similarly balancing you you covering the
regular subjects apart from this one and
us over he is giving for the cumulative
so this sort of thing may or may not fit
you but this sort of thing definitely
going to increase your for pleasure is
because you feel like okay I have done
with the presences is a gentle a lot
generally Road and dental histology
apart from this I have covered all the
past six subjects in the cumulative so
that that that sort of word at that sort
of meaning to your heart and brain will
definitely increase your confidence
knows please see coffees okay
so this is one more question how done my
internship in 2016
December 20 I did not have any plan to
do MDS after my internship I started
working in the cleaning when it's our
friends on getting MDS through the NEET
I decided to do ambience good
and I got information about MDS FUNKER
then I joined the group since two months
and fallen the robe I really felt good
when I joined this group and again
confidence that I can make it if I
studied fine so I decided to quit the
clinic and I came back to your hometown
Assam now I want to give hundred
percentage that's very good work I like
this one 100 percent is whenever you're
starting you have decided or if it's
starting giving this 100 percentage this
is what the life is whatever you do
start giving hundred percent distillate
okay why don't you start this no one can
stop this these two hundred percentages
are more than enough for you to be in
the GDC by next year
okay but I'm not able to give it I am
getting all the negative thoughts that I
can't make it because
only four months are there and I'm
getting scared - and I can't take River
College seed because I have a middle
class from my family ok that's fine
that's fine I can give a good good
answer pants okay like it's all about
like I was telling the lag a path slide
that
you need a fetcher you need to you need
to grow up the family need to grow up
it's all in your hand you have studied
in Bandung little means your parents
definitely have spent some time and some
good an ample amount of amount
financially on you by giving some sort
of hopes on work so it's time so that
you need to return it back not by
getting into private colors rather than
thereby getting into good UDC you can
earn you can make money and you can give
some sort of things for your parents for
this happiness okay so you have decided
quitted the clinic can be of plan to
give 100 percent of let q hundred
percent as though don't think about the
future
don't think because we know what we we
we don't know what we are capable of for
example a raise of 100 people
hundred people are running running
running they're running very very hard
and the person who is in the fourth
position
he looks forward we always look forward
in the range right we never look
backward that is the mistake actually
right so we will look forward in the
race we will how only three individuals
will feel that okay
I'm in third position there's still more
people who are running in front of me
but actually there are 98 people who are
behind you if you see back you will see
them they are struggling more to beat
you so never think that I mean I'm in
third position or I'm in fourth position
because we know we don't know ability
because there are many other people but
behind us
okay so this is all about like you need
to descend you are capable enough if you
have hope and
once you do that definitely you are
going to because we never see back we
once start seeing back you confidences
linkage okay there 98 people
right then thank you people so it's all
about like our mental ability which is
going to decide the things it's not
about like okay yeah yeah I mean exam is
a exam is not about getting 240 of 240
it's all about like getting the best
mark in order to in all the students
among all the students you need to get
the best month the best mark maybe is
144 160 or 180 but we always think that
okay we'll have to be perfect we have to
be perfect it's not about perfect it's
all about the perfection it's about the
best among the worst along the worst
code you should you should get the best
so that's that's what the all-india
first rank is so don't ever stress
yourself at least for these humans know
how to complete everything I have to do
everything no I have to give myself
that's the best one I have to give a
hundred percent is it's not about I have
to complete this by today it's all about
I have to use the time and myself in
efficient being this time come on let's
and the things you said like I have four
months and you said like I want to give
hundred percentage give hundred percent
is in this four months don't keep how to
complete hundred percent as Ursula's
don't keep I have to do six or seven
revisions like the tapas what they do
don't do that
give your best in is four months that's
what I mean that's what the result will
give if you give these four months the
best what you can give by just following
the group definitely I can see injuries
if you have that commitment and jeans
and you will be fine sure you will be in
agitation
these are the few
important things I mean there are many
other things I got in the form of a text
messages or in the form of a call so how
answered many such things in the past
seven to ten days but many of these are
correlated I was just having a
discussion over it one more thing is
about health issues of the parents
yesterday I was talking with one more
girl because of the health issues of the
parents yes you're the one who has to
take care of your parents for sure and
it's all about like you have to give
your best like her mother is for feeling
well not feeling well there's a father
is not feeling well they're not feeling
good so you have to do your services
don't think about this that is the tire
it's all about priority with happy issue
with your boyfriend or a girlfriend
definitely that should be second
priority when compared to your
preparation if you have a issue with
your mother and father what if you have
a health issue with a mother and father
definitely that's going to be the first
priority and compared with the exams so
it's all about deciding your priority
and preferably I feel like at least
these four months your first preference
and first priority should be the
exam should be the preparation after
four months you do whatever you want no
one is going to ask you because if you
have a successful success in your hand
if you have a best GDC in your hand no
one is going to question you what her
done what you are doing but if you fail
people are going to question John people
are going to answer you and further
God's sakes definitely we will we don't
have a correct reason why we are here
why we are on the negative side because
simple answer is if you have suffered
soon here are the reason if you have
failure you are there is it for any
question you are the reason maybe there
is a periodic
answered with you that I done this
because I have failed I have a lot you
have done because you it starts with you
you are the reasons if you're successful
you're the reason if you're failure
you're the reason so this is what
salvation for this week and I hope you
guys are doing good and we still need
more more energy yes for these four
month whatever you do take night road
make super or anything but you need to
study hard you need to work hard you
need to study hard at least for these
four Muslims because these four months
are going to decide your career result
are going to decide your future are
going to decide what you are going to be
in the industry in the upcoming
35 to 40 years so 35 or 40 years is an
ample amount of time we already have
spent 5 to 6 years of the industry right
now few people that 10 years
across nine years so now it's it's our
task because we need to work at least
for the 10 hours in the dentist and ten
years in the industry to make it better
30 to 40 years of legit so decide your
your call is
is going to decide your fate your
department is going to decide your fate
in fact your core pages are going to
decide you of it so all these you need
to have the best only if you how best in
yourself you are going to have the best
colors you are going to have a best
department you are going to have good
intelligent awesome copies so all the
best this rock rock rock because this
week is going to be a dry pad so the
team is ready and definitely will
execute them in a better way to make it
interesting and to make you to motivate
trying to reach you in a better position
okay all of us have a great day and a
week please work hard for this 14 days I
want to see a better better scores in
the next next week examination
