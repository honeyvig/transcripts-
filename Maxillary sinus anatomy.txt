hi everyone myself dr. CT team MDS
conquer so the next important topic from
your Anatomy is a maxillary sinus for
your basics paper so we'll be discussing
this in this particular presentation
so first the contents include for this
particular topic if it comes as an essay
it's write always better to write the
contents so which include the
introduction development microscopic
fishes Anatomy the blood supply the
lymph lymphatic drainage the nerve
supply the relations to the adjacent
structures followed by the functions and
the applied aspects okay
lastly the conclusion and references so
this is how you have to write the
contents so let's start the introduction
so it's also called as the mastery and
row or entre off high mode and it
becomes apparent by the 17th today in in
utero or in Caltrain life it becomes
apparent by the 17th today itself so
it's a paid sinus its largest paranasal
sinus and it is present within the
maxillary bone so this is how you can
start the introduction so coming to the
development so it is exactly I have
given the exact sequence of how it is
being developed so please do note it so
if you write it as a flow chart by
keeping arrows in between it's very much
fetching okay so the development
initially it follows a marvel or
morphogenetic events in the
differentiation of the nasal cavity
later horizontal shift of the palatal
shifts occur followed by the fusion of
cells with one another followed by that
nasal septum separates the oral cavity
from the two sections of the nasal
chambers then presumably influences
expansion of the lateral nasal wall and
the wall again begins to fold followed
by braces pre nasal conchae
and the tree nasal or the sub adjacent
meters are being formed the inferior and
the superior meatus remains like a
shallow depressions in the first half of
the entire trying life and later the
middle meatus expand into the lateral
nasal wall so the inferior and the
superior meatus actually remain like the
shallow depressions whereas the middle
meatus actually expands into the let
then the cartilaginous skeleton of the
lateral nasal capsule exactly gets
established followed by that expansion
of the middle meatus into occurs in a
inferior direction which is occupying
more of the maxillary bone and at the
end the Missouri sinus gets established
so this is how you provide the
descriptive sequence or the entire
sequence you can follow which is given
in in this particular presentation or
you can have a look in your in the
basing or the embryology textbook okay
so at birth actually it is the size of a
small pea then it starts increasing in
its size so about 7 to 8 a.m. until
posteriorly 3 to 4 mm ideo distally 4 to
6 mm high and 6 to 8 ml in volume so it
again if the teeth starts erupting it
descends downwards okay so it is tubular
at birth so this shapes
that's very good if you're right so it
is actually this tubular shape in in the
birth over you're in childhood and
pyramidal in Edel's okay the shapes of
the maxillary sinus you need to mention
okay ultimately the size exactly
determines or it depends upon the head
'try factors so it actually continues to
go throughout their life so next coming
to the microscopic features it has three
distinct layers so we are done with the
development part so development of
Magdala sinus is very important so you
have to write the sequence followed by
the how it does size at the birth and
also the shape at the birth followed by
the shape at the childhood and the
adults all these you need to mention
later you have to write the microscopic
features which has three distinct layers
that is epithelial layer the basal
lamina and the sabapathy layer layer so
the epithelium is actually
pseudostratified columnar or ciliated
and it is derived from the olfactory
epithelium and it provides motile
apparatus to the sinus epithelium the
cilia actually provide the motile
apparatus to the epithelium of the sinus
okay this is little microscopic features
next cunning coming to the anatomy so
here you have to end the microscopic
features now then you have to enter to
the anatomy you can draw a diagram of
showing the nasal cavity as well as the
sinuses the pate sinuses
the pyramid shape okay so the anterior
wall is a facial structure of the other
facial surface of the maxilla
infraorbital canal deflects the roof
onto the anterior wall and it is related
to the facial surface of the cheek by
the canine fossa as seen in the diagram
later the roof it is a thin orbital
plate of the maxilla which separates
orbit and contents from the sinus okay
it is the roof so we are done with
anterior wall and the roof annex coming
to the base it forms a medial wall of
the antrum it separates from the nasal
cavity it is usually thin and it is
convex towards the sinus and where it
forms an aperture called as a here it is
semilunaris and it is reduced in size by
thick mucosa of the nasal cavity so this
is the base next coming to the floor
floor is nothing but that a lower part
of the maxilla so the adults four to
five and below the floor of the nose the
children it corresponds to that of the
nasal flow and the roots of the
maxillary teeth we know it provides or
it produced elevations into the flow
when we see a in the radiograph we can
see the maxillary molar roots are being
elevated within the flow so that's
nothing but the floor of the maxillary
sinus so you have to write the AL
anterior wall the roof the base and the
floor next coming to the Austrian of the
antrum so it opens into the nasal cavity
and it is situated at the highest part
of the medial wall and it opens in wire
middle meatus and it varies in its shape
okay this you have to write again and
coming to the blood supply
it is the superior alveolar branch of
the maxillary artery and the branches of
the greater Palatine artery and the
venous drainage is from the parathyroid
plexus the lymphatic drainage through aa
stem into the nasal cavity and
infraorbital foramen ultimately goes to
the submandibular lymph node so this is
how you have to write the lymphatic
drainage okay and next coming to the
relationships is superiorly to the orbit
and its contents medially to the nasal
cavity and inferiorly that is below to
the maxillary molars and also the
alveolar process of the maxilla so this
is how we have to write
detail anatomy of the main structure of
the Missouri sinus its lymphatic
drainage is blood supply and its
relations so coming to the functions
functions is like it lightens the skull
weight the important function and also
it is resonator on it modifies the voice
so it acts as a resonator and it
modifies the voice okay so next also it
serves as an insulator to prevent the
cold air from cooling down the
surrounding parts and it helps in
shaping the front part of the skull and
positioning the orbit orbits in a
binocular vision and provides thermal
insulation for the brain ends also
increase the area of olfactory membranes
so all these other functions you can
just write one line functions no need to
give any description is only for your
knowledge sake after it in here but it's
of no need only the important the one
which is given in yellow color if you
write it's more than enough okay the
other functions are besides all these it
includes some sort of shock absorbers
for the skull and also it secretes mucus
to keep the nasal cavity moist and it
helps in floatation of the skull in the
water so these are the various different
functions of the maxillary sinus you
have to write it even if it is asked in
anatomic question you have to write the
functions it will increase the bulk of
the answer as well as it affects your
marks okay
daughter diagrams if you can draw the
diagrams along with the relations if you
can explain by neat label diagram it
will be really attractive to the
examiner okay so next coming to the
developmental anomalies it Luke and I
just named these three the a genesis a
pleasure and i population okay later you
have to write the inflammatory
conditions a sinusitis the famous so for
the most commonly seen condition is a
maxillary sinusitis so what could be the
inflammatory conditions and what could
be the non-infectious like the elegy or
any exposure to chemicals and all that
so you can write the infectious as well
as non-infectious causes of the
maxillary sinusitis and also you can
give a mild description of the symptoms
that the patients will have heaviness
over the sinus and when he bends ahead
he has more of pain or pressure on the
sinus
and also he has radiating pain over the
maxillary molar roots of the maxillary
molars so all those symptoms you can
write okay so in increase the size of
your answer so that's it students so you
can write this references in conclusion
you can guide the magneri sinus is a
pyramidal structure which is present in
the maxillary or in the face middle part
of the face which is very important and
you can write a bit of its functions and
you can end up the answer okay and then
you can give these references if you can
code any article if you have gone
through any article or it related to
magneri sinusitis you can write rest if
these references are enough and even if
you can write the grey's anatomy as well
so but any two textbooks and two
articles are enough for the basics paper
okay
