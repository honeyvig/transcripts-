yeah hi - now I'm here to go with some
quick recap which are very very
important in examination point of view
so first about the bus and their
dimensions - 2 4 5 bird the length is 3
millimeters diameter is 0.8 millimeters
and the main uses are crucial
convergence and the smaller version of
this / is 330 bird which is used in the
pedo patients and the head length is 1
point 6 millimeters birds that are used
in the inlay preparation or 271 with a
diameter of zero point eight millimeters
116 L bar where L stands for long that
is 0.5 millimeters in diameter and as it
is long it has more land that is 5
millimeters basically used to prepare
the dowels and the bells and next about
the hot issue lasers which are used to
cut the tent inner structure so make a
note about these two hard tissue lasers
and of course you have a question on the
seawater laser which helps in the pit
and fissure sealants of course we have
shared the notes related to the lasers
lasers are very very important so please
do go through the notes of lasers which
is very very important part few
important basic related questions that
is type of hypersensitivity that's shown
by anthrax phenomenon is type 3 of
course you know type 1 is a topi
anaphylaxis which is mediated by GMO
global ins whenever tetanus toxin is
given antenatal knee okay it's going to
protect both the mother as well as to
children we table is going to occupy one
half of the protein content for the body
and one third of the calorie content of
that particular day clotting factors
sorry clotting factors which are
decreasing the pregnancy are 11 and 13
whereas which are decreased in the
stored blood are five and eight
shrinkage lung is a feature that is seen
in the case of SLE if you want you can
add butterfly rash is also seen in the
case of SLE 17 D vaccine is used to cure
a low fever most heat since - vaccine is
OPV and the vector which is used in
transforming that this is that is change
favor is loose and the minimum
concentration of the fluoride for the
disinfection of a drinking water is 0.5
milligrams per liter
whereas in the case of disinfection of
swimming pools it is one milligram per
liter is already discussed on the
problem Pulse Polio immunisation first
started in India in 1995 and the
communicability is best measured by
second ray attack rate okay so the ACE
consideration for the marriages in India
for the females it is 18 years and the
males it is 21 Millions I hope you are
very good this you very good at this
this is a very important area where you
can get decent number of questions if
you are not perfect with this go back
and check this hypersensitivity video
that is there on MDS Concord channel so
that is going to help you out in in
solving many questions okay so I am just
going to give him a rough idea that is
type one I G mediated and I have like
the set of P type 2 is cytotoxic our
satellite ik mediated okay so these are
the examples which is mediated by GM and
type 3 is immune complex mediated these
are the two favorite examples again the
its GM type 4 is delayed
hypersensitivity these are the two
favorite examples and it is mediated by
the T cells scintigraphy which is one of
the modality in the case of your nuclear
medicine and the material that is used
most commonly they will ask a question
about this that is TC 99m is a dynamic
and a minimal invasive diagnostic tool
to assess the salivary gland function
and to determine the abnormalities in
the gland uptake and excretion okay this
is basically a pure gamma rays okay pure
gamma rays are emitted from this
nucleotide which helps in diagnosis of
the ductal obstructions or silyl it's or
any any sort of abnormalities can be
used in identifying identifying next
about the elastics this is the
orthodontic's part so class 1 class 2
class 3 elastics so class 1 they are
inter arch elastics which are stretched
between the molars and the an tedious ok
they are generally used to close the
spaces and retraction of the teeth
whereas class 2 they are inter means
that from one area to other area so they
stretch from the lower molars to
the upper anteriors and they are used in
the treatment of cluster so class two
useful in the treatment of class two my
electrician whereas class three are
quite opposite to that of the class the
stretches from upper more arts to that
of the lower anterior they are used in
the treatment of class three
malocclusion okay so please these two
areas are very very important class one
is intra class 2 and class 3 are inter
maxillary whereas class 2 it stretches
from lower Mona's to that of the upper
anterior elsewhere as class three
stretches from upper molars to that of
the lower interior's next few important
things about a reparation I hope you're
very good at this basically I mean you
can go through the underline stuff
basically the important things are the
material that is used as this aluminum
oxide and the particle size is 2 to 25
to 30 mm mm but recently they have tried
by ugh gas has been used in the place of
aluminum oxide and the normal exit
pressure of this is 60 to 120 pounds per
square inch in a conical manner okay
the distance also increases as the
distance between the nozzle tip and the
to think liters if you want you can go
through how the preparations will be for
example if you see the internal line
angles are useful near around by air
operation generally they are rounded
line angles are rounded in this
preparation but however if the tip is
placed within one millimeter from the
tooth surface the internal line angles
can be sharp similarly in the case when
the bevel preparations are required the
nozzle tip should be kept at a distance
of five millimeters for the preparations
which required some bad joint the tip
should be placed one amount from that of
the tooth surface so these are the
difference like if you change the
distance from that of the tip of the
instrument to that of the tooth surface
there will be modification in the
preparation
so what modification at what distance
make a note it is important next one is
a few important questions about bonnet
amalgam so basically the main reason why
they have tried this is to increase the
bonding between the Malcolm and the
registration because the retention of
amalgam is
basically a mechanical retention so they
wanted a bond between the tooth surface
so all these have tried the first thing
is they painted the walls of the cavity
with a layer of zinc phosphate cement
and then condensed amalgam over that bed
surface that is the first day out right
then after they have tried a technique
called a selective interfacial
amalgamate amalgamation liner which is
just a combination of poly carboxilate
cement and amalgam alloy particles the
strength they have gained is 2.4 MPA
which is not sufficient and not
desirable then they have tried a
different thing and that is called as
net bonad amalgams so these bonded
amalgams examples these examples are
important one is for M ETA and the
second one is MMA tbp okay so these two
are an important examples of bonito
Malcolm and of course you can go through
the slide ok everything is clearly given
but basically the confusion areas the
sinus okay helps in better receptors
whereas the carotid body helps in chemo
receptors okay so next is about the
markers of the B cells the B cells
markers are C D 10 C 19 20 21 23 and C D
79 a whereas the markers of the memory T
cells are cd45 arvo whereas markers of
NK cells are CD 16 and CD 56 done for
now it will be coming back with some
more important stuff in the next video
