hey guys and a very warm welcome simply
learn
in this video on php web development we
will learn how to create a website with
the help of php
we'll also be using html css bootstrap
and mysql in this tutorial
so get ready to create your very own
website
now before we get started with the step
by step tutorial let me give you a
glimpse of website that i'll be building
in this video
so let me just quickly go to my browser
and type in localhost followed by the
name of the folder where i have created
the website
so i'll be making a photo gallery
website
like this
so in case you're a photographer you can
build a similar website in order to
showcase your talent
and if not you can always create your
own personal website for anything you're
passionate about
so
without any further delay
let's get right on to a tutorial
so first things first let me show you
the environment that we'll be working on
while creating a website
so we are going to be needing
two softwares that is
visual studio code that we'll be using
as our id the code editor
and the second one would be
xampp
now zamp is a web server solution
package which we generally use in order
to manage our database and create a
local web server
you can download it from these
respective websites
since i've already downloaded downloaded
both of these softwares so
we'll be skipping that
now
let us begin
so
after that you've installed both of
these surface just go to your
c drive
locate xampp folder
and inside the xampp folder look for
htdocs
and inside this htdocs
name a folder you can
name it anything
i'll be naming it photo since i'm
creating a website regarding photos
and then right click inside this folder
and click on open with code
so this opens up our visual studio code
and as you can see our photo folder is
visible here
now also one thing that we need to do is
go back to this photo folder
right click
and create two new folders first one
would be css so it's considered a good
practice even if you're using a single
just a single css file it is considered
a good practice to create a separate css
folder inside your project folder
also
create another folder
and name it images so this is where
we'll be keeping all the images for the
website
so let us go back to visual studio code
so as you can see both of these folders
are now visible here
now
go on and click on new file
the first file
that we are going to create is index.php
inside this index.php will be writing
the code for the main page of a website
so let us start
first
click on an exclamation mark
and as you can see a block of code
already written is
visible here now
so
we just need to add a few things
first
let us
put the title the title would be
of course
go to
gallery
next up
we need to add a few links to our
webpage in order for it to function well
so
the first link
would be
this is a link to
link this page to
bootstrap
you can also easily find it on the
internet
or you can just
type in from here
let me just go to the browser to check
if this link is working
yeah
seems fine to me
now we are going to add
another
link to it
now this link will be for the link for a
css file that we'll be creating later on
since we'll be
putting that css file inside a css
folder
i am going to link it to
style.css
so that's it
we are done for the first part of a code
now let's
end this head section
and
move on to the body section of our web
page
so inside this body section what we
first need is
to add a few scripts
for our page which will be responsible
for the design of our web page
so
these are the three scripts
that i'll be linking to a webpage you
can just
look and
write them as it is
also keep these three scripts at the end
of your
body so
any code that will be writing inside
body will be above these three scripts
now let's
design the web page
so the first thing that we'll be needing
is a navigation bar in a web page so let
us quickly go to the browser
so instead of writing an entire big
block of code
we can just copy it from the internet
so
bootstrap provides it
you with many such designs so what we're
going to do is we will type in navbar
bootstrap
and hit enter
so as you can see
just
scroll down and as you can see this is
the navigation bar
which this code will display
also
there are different navigation bars
according to your need
along with the code so you can just
copy any of the one you like i'm going
to be copying this one
click on copy
go back to the code and
just paste it
so now what we have here is our
navigation bar ready
so
let us go to the browser and check
how does our web page look
so after the host what we're going to do
is we will write the name of the folder
in which we are writing a project which
is photo
well there seems to be some
problem since this nav bar is lacking
the css design let us go back to our
code and see
what went wrong
well yes this css file that we linked
here after css there is not a dot but a
slash i think it should work fine now
well
the problem still persists
let me go back and recheck
well yeah i've made some spelling error
here
this is bootstrap not bot strap
and let us go back
reload
and yes as you can see our navigation
bar is
well and good
let's go back and make some changes to a
navigation bar the first change that i'm
going to be making is i will
change the color theme of the navbar
to
dark not mark
yeah go back
reload
and looks better
now
here
auto gallery
good
also
since i'll be using the drop down menu
it is absolutely up to you if you want
to use it or not since i'll be using it
i'll just change the
name
to
categories
and the three category
will be the first is
nature photo photographs
the second would be
architecture
and the third
would be
travel
so let's go back
refresh categories nature architecture
and travel so this travel looks a little
different from this nature and
architecture
so as you can notice this this line that
is dividing
this section to this section so let's go
back so
that line
comes from this part of the code so
we'll just copy
and paste it here
looks good
now that we're back we don't need
this
disabled
and the search bar
so i'll be removing that
particular part of the quotes
and this form2
go back to the browser refresh
and
all of the parts of the
navigation bar that we don't need are
now have now been removed
also this link
would be
for
about section of the webpage and we will
also add another section or another link
that would redirect us to the contact
part of the web page so to do that to
add another link we will just copy this
code
and paste it
and instead of about
this will be contact
go back refresh
home contact about categories so this
categories should come before
these two
so
what we're going to do is we will just
copy this section of the code
and put it after the drop down menu
right
now go back
refresh
until we copied it instead of
cutting it so
it's now visible twice
reload
home categories contact and above
looks perfect
so you see now that's the beauty of
building a website you don't have to
write the entire code by yourself
there are
codes already written for all these
kinds of stuff this navigation bar the
carousel that i'm going to be using in
the website the blocks of photos that we
are going to display
on the web page and a lot of design
templates you can call them have already
been written for you to use them instead
of wasting your time and writing the
entire
long blocks of code
now next up what i'm going to do is i'll
just go back
to our photo folder
and inside this
images
i'll just
copy the images that have already
downloaded
copy
go
back
images and paste it here
so now that we have our photos inside
the images folder
let's go back to our code and
write
a
carousel code or just copy it from the
bootstrap
go back to bootstrap
here
look for carousel
so as you can see this is what a
carousel looks like so a big
photo
in
on the front of your web page as you
already saw when i showed you the
website
these are the different types of
carousels available on the bootstrap
website
you can use any of them
so
the first one is just a single photo
second one
is slides of photos
third is slides photos with this marking
and the final one would be all of them
combined with captions so of course
we'll be using the final one
so copy the code for the final
carousel or whichever one you like and
go back to your code
and here
after this navigation bar
paste your calendar code
click on save
go back
and refresh
so
since we haven't added any images here
there are none visible but you can see
this
carousel has been added to our webpage
so
let's go back and now we are going to
add the images that we just
pasted in this images folder
so in this carousel code
look for
image src so this is the location
of the image that will be displayed
so
type in images that is the name of the
folder from where you will be picking up
the images
for slash and
let me just
go back to this images architecture or
yep
so architecture 4
in this alt
type in
architecture and here
is the heading so this is part of the
caption
of the
carousel so
i'll be writing arcade texture
here and i'll make this heading a little
bigger
it's three i think h3 would do and i
don't want to add any more descriptions
if you do you can write all of that
inside this paragraph
but
i won't be so i'll just remove it from
here
i'll do the similar
with
this
so
what we're going to do is we will write
images
slash
and go back
what image i'm going to be adding nature
4 would do
nature
or
type in
nature
similar
to what we did
above
h3
h3 remove this
and now
here the last one would be
travel
h3
h3 and
let me just
type in the
travel five
travel
pipe
and in this alt
type
travel
and we are good to go
okay let's reload
and voila so our
images are visible here with this
beautiful carousel
and you can forward them and
well
does this not look beautiful to you
so architecture
nature
and travel
but
as you can see we have some problem here
the images are way too big to fit on
this part of the screen
and it's going all the way down
and this part of the carousel is not
visible on the main page when someone
opens the website which absolutely does
not look good
so
what we're going to do for it
now to fix this what we're going to do
is we will go back to a code editor
inside the css folder
we will create the file that we linked
at the start of our tutorial style.css
and
here
just
write this code
margin
0
adding also zero
and
box sizing
would be border box
so
now
to display the images
on the
just on the main page of our website
what we're going to do is we will
put a dot go back to the
main index.php and from here
copy this
name of the class carousel item
go back to style.css
paste it here carousel item
and type ing
and inside this
we will define the width
and the height of the image so the width
would be 100
and we are going to keep the height at
95
we h so that it does not go beyond the
webpage
let us quickly save it
go back
reload
and yes
it looks great
and
it's also visible on our screen now
now next up what we're going to do is we
will be creating different sections on
this very
webpage
for the different categories that is
nature architecture and travel
so
go back to the code
under this
carousel code
let us start writing our first section
that would be
section
class
so
i'll be using
my four and by four
the first depth
so what we want is we want the text to
be in the center of the page so
the class would be text center
and
the first category is nature
now the next thing that we need to do is
we need to add the images to it so how
do we do that
also we are
not to display a single image
on
on the entire web page what we need is
we need to display small
three blocks of images in a row
so
we
need to create another div
class
and inside the class
we will define the column
for large
systems
for the
mid ones
and
for the mobile devices
so
after you've written this class after
you've written this div
the images
doesn't matter the size of the screen
only three images will be displayed on a
large and middle screen and a single
image will be dis visible when open on a
mobile phone so
all in all your website will be very
responsive to all the
devices that you will be using
let's just close it and inside this tip
what we're going to do is
we will link our
image
and
the image
would be
since this is nature
let's use nature1
which image would give we have already
used in the carousel
nature 4
so let's skip that
and
put the class as
fluid
and padding
bottom padding would be three
well i think
it's
done so this is the
first section let's go to our page
refresh
so nature and our first image is also
visible here so what we need is we need
to display two more images in this row
go back
and it's now all copy and paste
just
not this part
this part of code
copy
paste
and paste
so
now
nature to
and nature 3
go back
refresh
okay there seems to be a problem here
let us figure out why this is happening
okay we forgot to add the
road if
and without the road if the images will
not be displayed in a row
but of this
so
container
fluid
i'm using this
since
just a second
let me paste it here
yeah
and
we will create another div
named row
and
our entire code
will go inside it
and we'll paste it
let's go back and check if it changes
anything and it does so our images are
displayed perfectly
our first section that is nature for our
categories is complete now
now next what we need to do is
i think you guessed it
we just need to
copy this section
and paste it
twice
since there are two more sections so
after the first section
in the second one would be
for
architecture
the images we need to change
architecture 1
architecture 2
and
architecture three
yeah
refresh
nature architecture
and well nature again because we did not
edit the third part of the code
so the third part of the code
will be for
travel
let us quickly
add the images
so travel 2
travel 4
and i
think we use travel
five already
so
travel six
and go back
refresh
and travel images architecture and
nature so
half of our website is already done guys
now
what we need to do is we need to create
two more sections for the contact and
about so
for the contact part of the webpage
we'll be needing a form that we will
then go on and
link to a database that we'll be
creating later on and the about section
will be responsible to
give
some information regarding the website
regarding the photographer that have
uploaded the images
so
let's go back to our code and
move on to creating another section for
the
contact
so
wait let me just copy only this section
of the code
and of course
we'll be needing a closing tag
this will be
contact
us
and
let's
create another div
class will be
50 and m
auto so
why i'm doing this is because
inside the contact will be creating a
form
where there will be columns
and to manage the width and margin of
these columns i am writing the class for
it
inside this tip
we will write a form
inside the form the first thing that we
need is action
and the action for the form
will be
about
dot php this is a file that we'll be
creating later on
and
the next thing is method
which will be post
let's close this
create another div
class named
form group
okay
from group
close it
inside
this i'll write a label
that would be
name
this will be our first column input
type text of course
let's give it a name so this is very
important
so the name that you're going to write
here
should be
matching should be matching with the
name in the database
and class
from
control
now
just copy this
paste and
paste
so the second section would be for
email
type will also be
email
name will also be
email
third would be for the number
let us keep the type text in case
someone wants to enter the
sud codes
and let's go back
refresh
check
contact us
the fields are visible now what we need
is a submit button
so after this step
let me
create a button
type
submit
class
so this
will make the button look
green adding some
css
and
the button would be called submit
go back
refresh
submit button is here
now
let us also create a section for the
about part of the page and then we'll
move on to
making our database
so to do that what we need to do is
we'll just copy this section
for the about
paste it here
close the section
and here
let's
start writing the code
the class
container
fluid so
why are we using this container fluid
class is because sometimes when you
don't use this class
the images or text from your web page
tends to
create
so you can see a scroll bar here
vertically it tends to create another
scroll bar
horizontally which we don't want
so container fluid
close the step
inside it
let me create a class
text
center
it will say the name mac
you just kept some space
and
write a paragraph
with a class of course
text
center
otherwise the text will start from the
extreme left it would look weird
and
close it
let's add some bold
and right
let's see i am a
passionate
photographer
interested
in
working
architecture
nature and
travel
photography
next would be
um
[Music]
a
full-time
freelancer
with an
experience of
five
yes
i think this would do
refresh
oh we did not change this we'll just get
right on to it
contact us i'm a passionate photographer
interested in working architecture
nature travel photography
freelancer and all of the things that we
just written about mac
we just need to change this
to
[Music]
about
and i think we're done
yes
so
our web page is almost complete guys
now we need to do some
changes
or add some things so the first thing
that we'll be adding is
an
about
php file
and inside this about.php file we will
be creating a connection with our
database
and fetching the data from it
or sending the data from our form to the
database
so before that
let's go back
to the browser type in localhost
followed by php
my
admin
click enter
but before that
you must
open xampp control panel and start the
apache server and mysql server since i
already did i did not show you the steps
so after the mysql server has been
started you can see this phpmyadmin
panel and from here we can create
databases
so inside this phpmyadmin
click on new
and let us name our database as
graphy
click on create
now what we are going to do is we will
create a table
where the data
will be stored from our form
let us name the table as users number of
columns would be four
the first column would be
course id
which will be auto incremented
the second column would be named
type variable character
250
third is
email
also
variable character 250
and the final was our number
variable character
250
and
click on save
so as you can see the structure of our
table
the table users has been created inside
the database photography
now we need to go back to our code and
write the code php code to connect
our form to this database
so first variable that i'll be creating
is
con to connect
the database
since a server is locally hosted the
name of the server would be
localhost
root
that is the default
now if
connection
so this
if condition will check if the
connection is successful or not and if
successful display
connection
successful
next
also
add if the connection is not successful
we should always have an error message
connection
[Music]
failed
next what we need to do is we need to
mysql i
select
underscore
bb
and inside this
we need to mention the name of our
database which is
let's just go back and recheck
photography
because the name is
very important if you
mess with the name the entire code goes
away
now
let me create some variables which will
fetch
the data
from the form
in order to send them to the database
so
let's keep the same names so that we
don't
create any confusion
email and of course
number
post
so now that we have our variables we
need to run
a
query
so
since we are fetching the data from the
form and inserting it into a table we
need to run a query for insert
into the name of the table that is users
and then
name
email
number
followed by the values that
we'll be
giving them
so
notice this is the
name of the
fields that you've given in your table
and
this
these values are these variables that
we've just created
so
inside it
name
second would be
email
and third would be
number
i think the query is done
now
to check if
it works
we will run another query
and i am going to add a header file here
because once you click on submit button
let me just go back so if you click on
submit button here
the page will redirect
to a different page which will just
display connection successful we don't
need that we need to stay on this page
itself so in order to do that
i am writing this header file
with the location
of
index.php
enter
and
i think we are done here
now
let's go back
and
add some details mac
mac
address simply
learn.com
number would be one two three four five
six seven eight nine
zero
click on submit
go back to your database
click on browse
and if the connection would be
successful you can see the
data here
and we can mac
email and number
that's great
so
now let's move on to the final section
of the website
so
how do we make this categories
navbar work
well it's pretty simple we just need to
redirect to a section
of a web page whenever clicked a button
so when we click on nature we need
a web page to be redirected to this
section
so
let's just go back to our code and what
we're going to be doing is we will
create
links just a second
for every section of our webpage so
let's go back to the first section that
is
nature
and here
right
give it an id
so the id for this section
would be
nature
close the tag
cut
and
paste it here so as you can see
this id
this section of our web page is enclosed
in this id so now with this a tag we can
refer
our this section of the web page
to any button
similarly
we will add
another id here
so the id would be
architecture of course
make sure the spellings are correct
put it after the section
now
go back a id
this would be
travel
okay
just
a second
cut it
place it here
again
what i'm going to do is instead of
writing it again and again
i'll just copy it from here
paste it
since this is
contact us
let me just put
con
detector contact yep
and the section
right
and
this will be
of course
about
yes
good now what we need to do is we need
to refer these sections with the
respective ids to the buttons
go back to the navbar code on your
webpage
so here is a navbar code so inside it
you can see after every button there's a
reference you just need to
add the name of your id
do not remove this
and
architecture
travel
contact
and
about
let's go back
refresh
click on categories
okay
what happened here okay no
nature

so as you can see whenever you click on
submit
it redirects you to the front of the
webpage
i don't want that
yeah the database is working so just go
back
to the about.php
and here we added the header location
index.php so it is redirecting
the
code to the
start of the web page
what we need to do is we need to
redirect it to a particular section that
is contact so just add
contact in front of it
save
