this is dr srikhan from team mds conquer
and i'll be discussing about the plan of
action for radiology
so radiology is one of the most
important
subject in the examination point of view
because most of the questions are being
integrated
or interlinked with radiology that can
be
your general medicine or that can be
your oral path on oral medicine
or that can be your oral surgery or that
can be your endo even indoor questions
are linked to radiographs
and their futures and the questions are
being integrated
so if you take just need into
consideration okay
according to the nba blueprint the
radiology is going to carry more than
eight marks okay and
if you take aims into consideration like
just go
through the rough
ideology and if you have more more most
of the questions are being
linked to the radiology and radiographic
diagnosis point of view
taking all these into consideration i
have prepared a blueprint
where we are going to cover radiology at
our best
from all the aspects
november 11th and november 10th we are
going to focus on the first chapter
that is radiation physics where
we are going to learn
some things some aspects some concepts
which are not actually part of your
radiographic diagnosis
means they are not much helpful in your
integrated questions okay
and the second one is your radiation
biology
third one that is 13th november we are
going to focus on
intraoral radiographic techniques as
well as the processing and faulty
radiographs
most of the questions are being picked
in the fall faulty radiographs okay make
a note
and the next one is the 14th november
we're going to focus
on external radiology and their
modifications
okay your your diagram based questions
particularly in your
inicit were being focused on the extra
oral techniques
the angulations the extraordinary
techniques how the head position
everything is there most of your
questions are being
asked and your 15th november we are
going to
focus on opg and anatomical landmarks
okay your questions are being asked uh
by giving an opg
asking you to identify the a's of the
child or which is
which is a part of your pedo and dental
or not and
they're asking questions on different
different aspects like an
anatomy of head and neck okay so they're
asking questions which bone it is which
part of the bone it is
so such questions are being asked of
course i i hope most of you are familiar
about your anatomical landmarks in iopa
all those are very very important areas
and being asked
and i want to mark this 16th november
that is advanced amazing techniques
so apart from normal things what we
learn your intraoral extra world
there are some advanced amazing
techniques like mri
ct cbct now if you open your recent
aims that is your recent sessions of
aims
cbct is one of the star area okay where
the questions are being posted
are application based questions in
relation to the implants
application based questions in relation
to the endodontics microendodontics
cbct or ct or mri or the latest
advancements in the imaging techniques
are at most important areas where the
questions are being asked
and if you open your normal or basic mcq
books what most of the people you are
reading
these areas are being completely
neglected
questions are coming but still neglected
okay so
it's an important that you have to go
back and do
an important material over this area
which i'll which i'll
explain you in detail on the website and
in our groups
the next one is okay this is a very
important aspect that is 17th november
radiographic diagnosis simply they are
going to give some radiographs
knew how to do the radiographic
diagnosis or sometimes
you may give you the radiograph
associated with the clinical scenario or
the clinical findings
so you have to interlink both the
clinical findings and your radiographic
findings
which you got in the part of
investigations and you have to come out
with the
diagnosis part 18th we will be having
some discussions that is
uh radiographic image based and
case-based discussions okay
i mean like case-based and image based
are the discussions that
go throughout your preparation phase
because now most of the exams whether it
is neet or whether it is inicet whether
it is
inbd or whether it is any sort of
examination
okay if you just go through the recent
question papers of all of these
examinations whether it's a gulf based
exam
or an australian and accounts based exam
any of these exams
most of the exams they are asking
integrated questions okay they are
linking the questions from one area to
other area
so the next verse is the 19th november
we have radiographic manifestations of
all the systemic diseases
20th november is some one of the topic
which is
completely ignored and completely
neglected so you need to do
some medical related stuff of radiology
also medical related means nothing but
your medical friends mbbs friends will
have a radiology as a major subject
so there are few contents few important
contents which are important from dental
point of view and being asked questions
your radiation therapy
like in your oral surgery or in your
oral medicine
when you are going through the tumor
cyst you have something called as
radiation therapy for the tumor cysts
so what radiation therapies has to be
done what is intra-oral radiation
therapy what is extraoral radiation
therapy
they are they're similar they're
something like even if you take your
uh prosthetics into consideration when
you're talking about the
uh special prosthetics okay there are
few special prosthetics
which are like given inside the oral
cavity so that a radiation device is
being kept
so there's something like a
brachytherapy teletherapy there's so
many such such things
which you have to make and apart from
this there are many things which we will
be
discussing in detail and everything okay
so 21st i want you
guys to keep it as a revision and 22nd
is your examination
on radiology so this is what a rough
territory to schedule relate to the
radiology
but i feel like you need to do like you
need to
i mean i cannot give uh suggestions from
the day one
but what what i'm going to do is like
you need to do some sort of core work
from the day one okay
which we will be discussing that extra
work which will be discussing on the
group individually
and we will be proceeding so 22nd number
2020 is going to be your
d day for radiology
so the next important thing what are the
things that you have to do
i want everyone to keep the star book
white and pharaoh
as a reference book for radiology
throughout your preparation phase apart
from this there are few things that you
need to do from different areas and
different books
which we will be discussing on the group
as of now the star
uh reference book is your white and
pharaoh the few contents
okay how to do this from this book this
from that book which will be
discussed and will be shared on the
group don't worry about that
and of course is already discussed in
the orientation class that
i feel and i i recommend strongly
uh if you want to do an mcq book okay
so i strongly recommend dentist clinical
part okay you need to do dentist
clinical part for this
and of course the next important thing
is power play books
uh part three will have your radiology
being integrated with oral medicine and
oral path
so apart from this i request everyone to
finish your smart notes that are
available on the website
okay take the daily exams and and
read the relevant content and
explanation to each and every question
because most of the questions are being
picked from the standard books
and the books and the topics where
all the examinations are being asked
okay so
i don't want to discuss all the secrets
on the
on the video which we are going to share
in social media
but all the internal things of the
strategies plans and everything will be
discussed personally
on your respective groups on the website
done for now love learning with team mds
