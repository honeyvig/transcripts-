yes hi everyone so uh I'm coming today
with uh some interesting topics which
are related to the basics okay actually
this was posted by one of the student in
the group as a tout so as they're very
very important in the examination point
of view so I just want to cover them in
detail and in brief okay I just want to
make the discussion very simple and I
just want to cover this stuff very fast
okay coming to the topic the topic is
about okay is about
enzymes so uh the basic thing uh I just
want to describe about these enzymes are
uh coming to the uh you just need to
know about this
Hine okay this is actually a functional
part of engine the functional part is
nothing but an active part functional
part is nothing but active part and it's
this this henzy is going to contain a
combination of two two things that is
one is protein part and second one is
nonprotein part okay so protein part is
again EPO enzyme the protein part of
this H enzyme is called as an EPO enzyme
and the non- protein part is called as a
coenzyme I hope you are very clear the
functional unit of an enzyme is hallo
enzyme the hallo enzyme contains a
protein part and a nonprotein part and a
protein part is EPO enzyme and non
protein part is
Coen and coming to the uh aake statement
that is most of these enzymes and most
of the enzymes are proteins and uh I
mean you know that proteins can be
denatured at a higher temperature so
enzymes can be denatured at a higher
temperature that's one other important
statement you need to make a note apart
from these uh recently a few uh RNA
molecules uh they have similar
properties of enzymes so enzymes most of
the enzymes are proteins and very few
are
RNA okay few RNA molecules can also act
as en that's that's the actual meaning
of the statement okay
so want to go for the
uh next move I just want to go for the
next move the next move is about the
classification of enzymes I hope you
guys knows well about this
classification if you have remember
there is something called as an OT Hill
okay we used to remember this as an OT
Hill so if you go in detail that is the
one o
is
oxido
reductases one is oxido reductases means
there will be transfer of hydrogen
molecule A2 + B is going to gives rise
to A+ bh2 means these are the enzymes
that are involved in the oxidation and
reduction reaction and the second one is
T that
is transfer ages where there is a
transfer of a functional group one from
one molecule to other molecule for
example ax + B gives so there is a
transfer of this x so it is going to be
BX + a transfer this is transferred from
A to B that is transfer and the third
one is H that is
hydrolases hydrolases are the enzymes
that involve in the hydrolysis of the
compound or the molecule for example a B
plus H2O gives rise to a h plus b o this
hydren this water molecule causes the
hydrolysis of this molecule and gives
rise to this ah and B so this is called
as a hydrolysis so these are the ones so
we are going to deal now with il we are
done with o HT now we are going to deal
with
il so next uh I I
is isomer is I think you know the
meaning of isomer isomer is a similar
molecule with a change of orientation of
things here and there uh they are
similar almost like but there will be
some sort of structural change isomers
okay so that is called as an isomer and
Then followed by two L's that is
liasis enzymes that are involved in the
addition of the removal of the molecule
like water they can they can remove or
Add Water they can remove add ammonia
they can remove or add CO2 such
molecules are called as an ales a b + XY
gives rise to a x
plus b y so this is this is what liases
and the last one is
liases liases uh are the one that that
going to uh catalyze the synthetic
reactions which where two molecules are
joined together and ATP is produced two
molecules A and B they are join together
and finally the outcome is an ATP so
this this is the meaning of lies lies
two molecules combined and they release
an ATP and I hope you are clear with
this basic classification they may ask a
question related to the basic
classification so you're clear with the
structure uh all this H enzymes EPO
enzymes and all these and I hope you are
very clear about this so uh the next
important thing I just want to discuss
are the
factors the factors uh that are
affecting this entic activity okay uh
these factors uh coming to the uh basic
things uh I just want to discuss about
the concentration of the enzyme first so
because this is the one that's going to
decide if you take the relationship of
these uh the concentration and velocity
it's just like a straight
length excuse me so as the concentration
of enzyme increases
increases the velocity increases means
uh the velocity as well as the
concentration of an enzy are directly
proportional to each other this is a
simple thing the concentration of an
enzyme is directly proportional to
velocity of the reaction I hope you are
clear with this so the next is second
second factor is very important factor
many of the questions will comes under
the second factor is about the
concentration of the
substrate there is a slight variation
when you compare with the concentration
of enzy increasing in the substrate
concentration gradually increases the
velocity of the reaction within the
limited within the within the limited uh
within the within the limits of the
substrate level so that's what means uh
if you if you go through the graph of
this substrate
concentration as well as plus
velocity there will be a drastic
increase then after slopes then after
slopes and at a level where the
saturation occurs it
remains constant so if you categorize
them into A and B and C so a is
something like directly proportional
almost B slight decreases C they become
constant so again I'm just repeating the
statement increasing in the substrate
concentration gradually increases the
velocity of the anamatic reaction within
the limited range of the substrate
levels whenever the substrate levels are
gone the reaction will become constant
okay so that's what it mean so in this
we need to learn about few things one
is I mean in particular about this graph
and there is some some sort of
mathematical equations and I want you
guys to learn about this uh mathematical
equation in detail okay so this
mathematical equation is something like
uh the reaction okay e is enzy plus s
means substrate so it gives rise to
formation of es that is enzyme substrate
complex which again dissociate into
enzyme plus protein so this forward
reaction is stated with a constant value
that is k1 this backward reaction of e s
to e plus s this is stated as an a K2
constant and this is stated as an a k K3
constant so obtaining from these
constants they have come out with a
formula that is called as a km km is can
be called as an mm constant mm constant
is nothing
but which is M uh menance constant or it
can also be called as in a BH constant
the B H constant is called as a
BRI BRS
and hen's constant so it can be called
as these constant so obtaining from
these K values they came out within this
km that is KM is equal to K2 + K3 by K1
I hope you are very clear K3 is here K2
is here and K1 is here so km is equal to
K 2 + K3 by
K1 so with this uh I just want to
explain what is KM actually so if you go
through the uh graph again okay that is
substrate concentration plus velocity
graph which which slopes back so this
value is called as a velocity this is
the maximum velocity right so it is
called as a
Vmax right this is the V Max Max but in
the a category okay there is a constant
proportion up to this level right so
this is called
as
km this point is called as a km point
where it strikes half of the
Vmax so this is Vmax this point where km
strikes is called as a half of and km
value means it it's almost like uh
proportional to each other means the
substrate concentration is directly
proportional to the velocity such value
is called as that's that at that point
it is called as an a km so I just want
to give the definition of KM let let's
make it very simple the km can be
defined as in a substrate concentration
it on substrate right so it is a
substrate concentration to produce half
of the maximum velocity right so km is
nothing but it is the substrate
concentration to produce the half of
maximum velocity in the enzimatic
reaction it can indicate that half of
the enzyme molecules are bonded within
the substrate molecule where the
concentration is equal to km value so
very clear km value is a substrate
concentration where it produces the half
of the maximum velocity and you know uh
the km value of majority of the enzymes
in the human body is 10^ of - 5 to 10^
of -2 moles you need to make a note of
this value this is important value which
was asked in the exam many times and
what km is going to do okay km is going
to give a hint km values are generally
constant for enzymes and it's a
characteristic future of a given engine
okay and it represents the strength
because km is going to form ES which was
discussed in the previous slide okay e
plus s is going to form ES so km is
going to give information about the
enzyme substrate complex so a low km
indicates strong efficiency means a low
km if km values are low there is a
strong efficiency between e and s
because it's opposite if km values are
high there is a
weak weak there is a weak efficiency
between this enzyme and substance so km
value is going to give the strength of
es and it's going to determine how
efficient they are if it is increasing
in the case
so there will be decreasing in the
efficiency if there is increasing in the
km there will be decreasing the
efficiency if there is decreasing in the
km there will be increasing the
efficiency because it's going to give an
information about the form D complex
rather than the infinity between these
two right so the normal values ranges
from 10^ of -2 to 10^ ofus 3 moles so
this is
what uh about this km values uh the half
of the maximum velocity and the
substrate concentration all the things
so from the this they obtained an
equation they will ask this equation
that is v v is nothing but measured
velocity if you are measuring the
velocity of an En at a particular point
that gives the measuring velocity V is
equal to V Max V Max is the maximum
velocity into s s is nothing but the
substrate concentration by km km you
know that km is equal to K2 + K3 by K1
K2 + K3 by K1 so km+ s so this is
an Universal
question you can whenever they're
keeping an exam on enams this question
is must so V the measured velocity is
equal to V Max that is a maximum
velocity into the substrate
concentration by km is equal to this
plus the substrate concentration so this
is an important formula that you have to
remember at any
cost so after this I just want to
discuss about the third
factor that
is effect of
temperature so the effect of temperature
as already discussed it is almost like a
proteins so it have a similar effect
like that of proteins if you take the
graph of temperature and the enzyme
velocity it increases it it is it is a
bell shaped
graph so the velocity of an En reaction
increases with increasing in the
temperature up to maximum and then it
declines and it's a bell shaped graph
please make a note and the optimum
temperature at majority of the enzymes
in the human body are active is 40° to
45° C this is an important
McQ but there are few exceptions
that
Venom
phosphokinase
and
muzzle edin late and this is also a kise
which are active
even at 100° C so whenever the
temperature ranges these deg cenra few
of like uh 40 40° to 45° is a maximum is
is an Optimum temperature majority of
the enzymes are active when it crosses
50° Cen there will be D but there are
few exceptions these are the few
exceptions you have to make a note so we
are done with the third Factor
temperature and now we are moving to the
fourth Factor the fourth factor is
effect of
pH it has a similar effect like if you
take increasing in the pH decreasing in
the pH is nothing but increasing in the
H+ ion concentration I hope you know
this so whenever there is increasing in
the H+ ion concentration that's going to
affect the enzyme directly or indirectly
so if you take the graph between the ph
and that of the Velocity so it is again
a bell shaped graph so majority of the
enzymes are very active at pH of 6
to 8° that is the neutral pH almost so
however there are few exceptions that we
know about this pepsin which is activate
1 to 2 pH and we know that acidic
phosphatase we know that is active at 4
to 5 pH and we know that the alkaline
phosphatase alkaline means it is active
at alkaline levels that is 10 to 11 so
please make a note we know these uh pH
values please make a note it's a bell
shaped again similarly Optimum is 6
to8 few exception that pepsin is 1 to2
acidic phosphatase is 4 to5 and alkaline
phosphorate is 10 to
11 so we are done with the fourth Factor
now we are moving towards the fifth
Factor fifth factor is the effect of the
product concentration means a plus b is
somewhere giving ab ab is the product
when there is increasing in the product
concentration it's going to have an
influence on the reaction so whenever
there is increasing in the product
concentration it's going to act on these
uh initial ingredients or the Catalyst
that is helping the reaction to occur
it's going to act there and it's going
to decrease so whenever there is
increasing in the product
concentration product concentration
definitely there will be decreasing
increasing in the
velocity of the reaction I hope you are
very clear with this okay so this is the
fourth fifth Factor we have done and now
we are moving towards the sixth Factor
sixth factor is
the effect
of activators so there are few things
that are going to activate the thing
activate the reaction activate the
velocity so if you take the structure of
engine the enzy is going to have
somewhat like an active site active site
is a very flexible one and it modifies
according to the substrate the substrate
is going to come and it's going to
insert in the active site and the
reaction goes this is what actually the
mechanism so the few activators that are
going to activate and that's going to
change the velocity so they can be
categorized into two types one is the
metal metallic cations so majority times
uh the activators are mainly C you can
see mg + 2 you can see mn+ 2 you can see
Jen plus 2 you can see calcium plus you
can see Co + 2 you can see CU + 2 you
can see na plus and k+ and there are
many and very few times you can see that
Ann Ann mostly you can see CL minus
that's for that two for MLS you can see
this okay so these are the two c
category of ions that are available
majority of the ions that helps in this
activation are cations right so the next
one is like two categories of enzymes uh
require Metals for their activity they
are a that
is metal activated enzymes so they need
metals to get activated so these are the
metal activated enzyme the main
important thing is that metal is not
tightly held by the enzyme and can be
easily ex changed with other ions means
here the metal is not tightly bonded it
is not tightly
bonded and they can exchange the places
like the active site can be exchanged
with one metal to other metal for
example like mg plus2 can be replaced by
CA plus2 while you're going for atps
engine so similarly so the second
category is metalo enzymes first
category is metal activated enzymes
second category
is Metallo enzymes Metallo enzymes uh
these enzymes hold the
metals rather tightly which are not
readily exchanged means here the bond is
very weak in the metal activated enzymes
here the bond is very tight here there
will be an exchange here there will be
no
exchange okay so uh this is the factor
this is the effect of activator so I
just want to make a note I just want to
add uh in the this activators coming to
the metalo enzymes there are few things
you have to remember that is the metalo
enzyme in phenol
oxidase is copper please make a note of
these These are asked these are
previously asked questions most common
that is
pyate oxidase the metalo enzyme
is
magnesium sorry
manganes and the last one
is
cytochrom oxidase you have a metal
enzymes like
iron and
copper okay I hope you're clear with
this and coming to the activated site
the activated site is going to have an
enzyme structure I just want to add one
one note about this activated site the
activated site is going to uh have two
two locations this you already described
this activated site this is an activated
site it's going to have two components
one is
substrate
binding site second one
is catalytic site it going to have two
SES substrate binding site and catalytic
site and this is a structure so it's
going to contain ammonia acids and the
major ammonia acid which is frequently
found in the active site means active
site is also a structure it's going to
contain ammoni acids we know that Ammon
acid are 20 I mean 21 is 21st Ammon acid
is there but majorly 20 so out of this
20 Ammon acid the Ammon acid that is
most frequently found at the active site
is
C okay so I hope this is it's already
crossed 22 23 minutes so let's close the
discussion and I hope this is a useful
video uh signing of Dr
Sant MDS conquer and thank you
