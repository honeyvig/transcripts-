if you want to get certifi then go for
it but if you are doing it for hack of
it I'm not sure it is going to benefit
you the most important thing is not
about getting a certify but having a
Thrust to learn a new things and finally
implement it in a daily
life I did my CSM certification from
Simply learn and beside being a
certified scrum master I'm a much more
productive person at my
work myself Chan desia and this is my
journey so I done my master of computer
science in Gujarat vidy Ahmedabad I am
currently working in a senior software
engineer in brain wire and also I'm a
playing a role as a Udu consultant where
I learn the different business area like
sales Erp purchase human resource R
Rental and all the business case study
that we are actually day-to-day
implementing for the our
customers I faced one of the setbacks in
the past uh it is around 8 to 10 year
back one of the reput company when I was
doing a internship at that time they
fired me after few few week of my
internship so suddenly I depress and
difficult to handle all those
situation after few days I determine
myself and improve it in a day-to-day
basis so that I can overcome all the
challenges that I have faced when I was
working in my organization few different
colleagues are talking about the
different terminology like what is the
scrum what is the aile what is the
Sprint and how we are managing the
Sprint plan so at that time I realized
that it is very hard for me to
understand I done a different research
over the internet where I found that one
of the reputed organization simply learn
is available for us so I watch lots of
YouTube video where they provide the uh
detail understanding of the terminology
and all so I go to the simply learn uh
website and I choose my reputed course
as a scrum
Master as per my learning experience um
I can say that simply learn is a best
choice for us because the mentor are
delivering the training it is very
phenomenal to us I took a one of the
mentor uh called VI angiras he explained
a different business case study with the
help of practical
approach I learn it and implement it it
is not just about the theoretical
concept but I learn a practical concept
along with the training so it helped me
to gaining my knowledge and simply learn
is one of them which is playing a key
role in this area and I'm really
thankful to them we learn lot of things
especially when we are unaware about
Real World Knowledge after completion of
my course I realized that how I was
working earlier and how I working right
now it is totally greatly improved so I
advise to my colleagues and other
professional if your goal is to only
certification then it is not creating a
value in your life so I would highly
recommend you can do a certification
with highly reputed trainer plus
whatever learning approach that you have
got from the trainer you can implement
it and it is definitely create a value
and it is also help you to Long journey
of your career
