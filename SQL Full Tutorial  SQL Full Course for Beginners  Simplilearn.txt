Microsoft Excel is a software product
designed and developed by Microsoft is
storing data in an organized way that is
rows and columns and Microsoft Excel is
also capable to manipulate data through
some mathematical
operations followed by that Microsoft
Excel is also used to extract the
insights from the data and represent it
in the form of visually appealing graphs
and charts now we have a basic
understand understanding or an overview
of what a Microsoft Excel software
product is now moving ahead we will
understand the fundamentals of Microsoft
Excel so following are some fundamentals
that you need to know before getting
started with Microsoft Excel so
basically when you install the Microsoft
Office in your computer you will have
various Microsoft products out of which
Microsoft Excel is one of the product so
we will be dealing exactly with that
particular product that is Microsoft
Excel so when you get started with
Microsoft Excel this is what you will
see in the first page so this particular
page is called as Microsoft Excel
homepage where you will be having
various varieties of sheets Microsoft
Excel will give you some suggestions
based on the type of sheet you want to
work with we will see this in a better
way through the Practical session so
once you get started with the sheet you
will have some more options so this
particular option is called as the
toolbar menu you will have the file home
insert draw page layout formulas data
review View and help so these are the
tools that you will be using to work on
your data using Microsoft Excel
furthermore we have a toolbar ribbon so
when you select some of the other option
from the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help buttons you will have a ribbon so
for example you can see that I have
selected the Home Tool here so when I
press on the Home Tool this is the
ribbon which Microsoft Excel gives me so
this ribbon has some options in it which
can perform various operations now in a
further more detailed way we will have
toolbar groups so when you see in the
previous slide we have a complete
toolbar ribbon so this particular ribbon
is segmented into groups so you can see
the first group as paste Cut Copy format
painter etc etc and the second group is
the font the size of the font and to
increase the size of the font to
decrease the size of the font bold
italic underline etc etc and here you
can see the text alignment so each and
every group has separate functions so
each set is called as a
group and I think you can see a small
Arrow option over here so this Arrow
option is used into the toolbar groups
when the group is not able to fit all
the operations or all the
functionalities in one single provided
section so when you click on this
particular Arrow Mark you will have
another dialogue box so this is called
toolbar more options so you can see that
when I clicked on this icon you can see
a new dialogue box which opens me a new
set of operations which are not able to
be fit in this particular group so we
will also see more about this in a
better way in the Practical session now
moving forward we have cell and address
so when you open a Microsoft Excel sheet
you can find boxes so each and every box
is named as a cell and each cell has its
own address for example the highlighted
cell over here has an address B three so
B is the column name and three is the
rule
name and apart from that you can have
the sheet tracker in the bottom left
corner of the Excel sheet where you can
navigate through different sheets and in
the bottom right corner you have an
option of increasing or decreasing the
sheet size so these are the basic
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel that you
need to keep in mind before getting
started so we will have more on this in
the Practical session so now we enter
the demo inventory in Microsoft Excel so
we will be using Microsoft Excel to
create a sheet of the employees in a
company so basically an employee in a
company has employee ID name and
designation salary etc etc so we will be
trying to create the same table using
Microsoft Excel but before that let us
understand the fundamentals of Microsoft
Excel through the Practical demo first
so I have started my Microsoft Excel and
this is how the homepage of Microsoft
Excel looks like so you have a blank
workbook over here if you want to create
a new workbook you can select new Option
so Excel will provide you with various
variety of sheets you can see money in
Excel adjustable meeting agenda
streaming showers small business cash
flow and many more if you're not able to
find what you're looking for then you
always have an option of selecting the
particular type of sheet what you're
looking for so you have various options
if it's business if it's personal if
it's planners and trackers list budgets
charts etc etc so let's imagine that you
wanted something from business so just
by clicking at business option the Excel
will load a variety of sheets related to
business options so this might take a
while so you can see that the Excel is
loading few types of
sheets so you can see that Excel has
provided us with some online varieties
of sheets for example any calendar
business expenses Channel marketing
budget budget summary report blue
product list etc etc you can see
construction proposal enro your name at
Excel has car so Excel will provide you
with some variety of options based on
your requirement now for this session
let's get started with a blank workbook
which looks something like this since
this tutorial is based on the
fundamentals we'll go with the blank
workbook now over here you can see the
toolbar that we discussed earlier that
has the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help so this is the toolbar and under
the toolbar I have selected home and you
can see this is the particular ribbon
what we discussed about this particular
ribbon belongs to homepage and when you
select file option you'll get back to
home and if you select insert option
you'll have another different ribbon
with different groups etc etc so every
particular tool has different ribbons in
them and remember the extra options that
we discussed when you press over this
Arrow key this is it so when you press
the arrow key you'll have few more
settings which cannot be fit in this
particular section of groups so you can
have some variety of options over here
of changing the font changing some
effects to the text font size and font
style etc etc apart from this we have
also discussed about the cells in every
sheet so this particular cell has an
address so you can see the address over
here which is B3 so B happens to be the
column name and three happens to be the
row name now we also had a discussion
about the sheet tracker right now we
just have one sheet if you want multiple
sheets you can just feel free to select
on the plus option which will always
create you some extra sheets and you can
navigate through sheets just by pressing
on the sheet
name and when you get back to the bottom
right corner you have an option of
increasing and decreasing the cell size
or the sheet size now let's keep it
default with 100% now these are the few
fundamentals that you need to keep in
mind before getting started with
Microsoft Excel now that we know the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel let's
get started with a practical session
which is about the employees details in
a company now let's select this
particular cell and let's type in
employee details
yeah we have the cell now an employee
details table will have the information
related to employees so the information
will be about name it will be about
employee
number it will be the
designation and maybe
salary and maybe blood group as
well and uh let's take another one which
is phone
number
yeah so so far so good and uh you can
see that we have some problem with this
particular column the designation the
name uh the the name of the designation
is practically good but it is not
visible so when you uh when you're not
on that particular cell you can see that
the name is incomplete over here so you
can always fix that you can just you
know manually change the size of the row
or cell or you can also feel free to you
know double click on that cell which
will automatically you know set the size
of that particular cell and same goes to
the blood group just let's try to double
click on that and same goes to phone
number
great so you can see that the employees
details are just confined to the first
two cells it's supposed to be somewhere
in the middle right so no problem we can
do that as well we can select all the
cells and we have an option of merging
them you can just select this one which
will help you with merging and centering
that particular data to the center part
so that's how we do it now let's get
started by adding the names of the
employees uh let's add the names
Joe
John uh Mary
Mark
Susan and
then
Jennifer let's type in
Mike let's Tye in
them Jeff Jeffrey
yeah we have a couple of employees now
let's type in the employee numbers
yeah we have the employee numbers now
let's type in the designation okay let's
choose uh Joe to be the CEO of the
company and John as the software
developer
and Mary as
tester Mark and
finance Susan also in
finance and Jennifer in
testing and and mic in uh
marketing same goes for
Tim and again Jeffrey into software
development and uh
uh Morgan into testing
again now let's click on C so that it
gets you know resized according to the
length of the text now it's done so
let's get into
salary uh
$10,000 and
$115,000
$199,000 let's say increase the salary
of a CEO so let's keep it $1
lakh and finance again
20,000 so yeah the salaries are
allocated again the blood group e
here we have the blood groups now let's
type in the mobile numbers
[Music]
yeah now we have typed in some random
mobile numbers as well so uh yeah this
is how you can add in some data into
your table and now let us imagine that
you forgot to add or remove a column so
let's imagine that we wanted to add a
serial number as well but somehow we
forgot to add it now you can always add
a new row or column for example here we
wanted to add a new column so we just
have to right click on a select the
insert option here we have a new row now
now let's type in serial number
and let's type
one now can you see the small box option
over here if you just drag it you can
you know copy paste all those over here
and now let's right
click and fill series now we have the
employee number starting from 1 to 10
that's how you do it and apart from this
you you can also uh you know change the
font of the entire row you can change
the font to say
Roni and you can always also change the
font and same goes to the employe table
you can select it bold it and you can
also increase the size and again select
a color for the text maybe a different
color green would be
better and uh you can also select the
entire cells and align them to the
center looks more good and you can
select or double click the row names so
you'll have the proper spacing between
all the rows and columns so we have
double click on the column right yeah so
basically that's how you make things
happen now let's save this so I'd like
to go to the save option and uh EMP
data let me save this in my local
location and just save it's done so
that's how you work on your Excel file
with some basic data and to learn more
don't forget to get subscribed to Simply
learns YouTube channel and don't forget
to hit that Bell icon to stay updated so
you are the first person to get an
update on any technology not just Excel
now let's get back to the Practical mode
and now we are on our Excel spreadsheet
so here we have some text boxes on the
column A and on column B we have lower
and upper okay so um we have a mix of uh
uppercase and lower case in our text so
first we'll try to convert them to lower
case and then we'll try to convert the
entire text into upper case so for that
you need to press on equal symbol and
select the lower formula tap and you
selected the function and now click on
the cell A3 that's your cell address and
press on okay now all the letters are
converted to lowcase so we had J in the
uppercase which is converted to lower
case now all you can do is drag the
formula to all the cells and and it will
be applied to all the cells right now
let's similarly try to convert into
uppercase and tab space and there you go
you have selected the formula now the
cell
address press
enter and drag the same address I mean
drag the same formula to all the cell
addresses and the echo all the cells are
converted to uppercase now that's how
you convert the cells or data in Excel
to uppercase or lowercase in Excel now
we are on the Excel spreadsheet
now here we have some sales data based
on a store now what we going to do is we
going to add some multiple rows or a
single Row in this particular data so
here you can see the region wise
category wise State Wise subcategory
Wise and their sales and quantities
right now let us imagine that you must
have to add a sale data here right so
let us imagine that on the row 7th you
were supposed to add some detail for
example some technology related sale
happened on that day and you missed out
to add it right so how do you create a
new Ru now so for example if multiple
sales happened on the same day like 3 to
four and you missed out them so how do I
add three to four rows in between the
existing data right so don't worry about
it it's completely simple all you have
to do is select the row and right click
and press on the option insert now this
will insert one single row if you wanted
to add add one single U row or you know
toule and if you wanted to add multiple
rows for example you wanted to add three
rows all together then it's also simple
all you have to do is select three
rows and right click and press on insert
and then you have three rows so there
you go so that's how you add multiple
rows in a Excel spreadsheet or that's
how you add one single Row in an Excel
spreadsheet now we have started our
Excel worksheet and here you can see we
have employe details on our worksheet
now all of a sudden uh you wanted to add
employee second name as well or a last
name right so you are a beginner and you
don't know how to add a column or you
know you might be a little ambiguous
right so instead of using this simple
step you might end up creating a whole
new sheet or maybe other approaches as
well which are time consuming so let me
give you this simple step all you have
to do is is select the column so here
you wanted to add a last name right so B
is your column with the first name and
here you wanted to add a second name or
the last name which is in between the
columns B and C so remember that Excel
adds a column always towards the left
side of a column so here if I if you
wanted to add a column next to B then
you want to select the column C and
right click and select the insert option
so that it can be added in between B and
C which is is adjacent to B so let's
look at it right so you have added the
next uh column or a new column right
next to the column B and it's in between
the designation and employee name now
you can add your you know second name so
that's how you create a new column in
Excel now in case if you wanted to you
know create multiple colums all together
so uh here we have or here we needed a
second name also here you have a
designation and you wanted to add
another column which you know assigns
manages to the employees right so let's
delete it uh Delete the second column
and let me explain you how what I want
to do so here you wanted to add the
second name of the employe and also the
manager of these employees right so here
you wanted to add two columns Al
together right uh and now you might be
wondering could I add two columns
together uh or will it work only for the
one column thing right no it it works
for two columns and also more than two
columns alog together so you wanted to
add two columns here right so select the
two columns you can you can select or
you can click on the column C and hold
that left key and drag it along the
right side okay so here I've selected
two columns and here it's three right so
you can see here uh it's 1 48 5 6 7 6 R
cross 3C thatan means you have selected
three columns if I navigate on the four
you can see we have selected four
columns right now right click and select
on insert and you'll have four columns
in between employee name and designation
now you might have to add your second
name manager's name manager employee ID
you know and the department everything
or you can add anything or any number of
columns in between the existing columns
now we are on our Excel spreadsheet now
you might want to you know add uh some
extension to your data since we have
sales here you might want to add the
dollar logo right so if you have like
five to 10 rows then it's easy but if
you have multiple rows then it might be
a little time consuming in such
scenarios you might want to select the
entire column right so how do you do
that in a shortest method so there are
multiple methods to do it so the easiest
one the first and the easiest one is
clicking on the column number of our
column name so here we have the column
name that is e and if you click on it
the entire column is selected and here
we have numbers so let us imagine that
you wanted to select the row number two
click on number two and you have all the
rows I mean the entire row selected all
the cells are
selected right so this is one way and
again there is another way where you can
just you know uh click on the first
table header and press control space bar
so the combination key is control space
bar for columns and if you want to
select the entire row it is shift space
bar so this is the method two and
another method so you might have a doubt
here right so when you click on the
column name or when you click on the row
number the entire row or entire column
gets selected right and you wanted to
select only the cells which have data so
we have another way for that so you can
select the cell now hold the control and
shift key and press the lower Arrow key
to select the entire column with cells
having data so there you go you have
selected all the cells in one single
column with only data and all the cells
which do not have data are not selected
same applies to rows as well control
shift right arrow key or left Arrow key
based on your rows and all the rows with
data will be selected I mean all the
cells in a row are selected not the
entire row
and uh coming back to the first question
that is adding the dollar symbol so here
we have General so go to the data type
and add
currency so you have rupees here so
currently we are in India so we have
rupees now what is the advantage of
selecting the entire row when you don't
have any data in the 57th row or the
next cell right I'll show you now let us
add the number 100 and press enter there
you go let us add another number like
1,000 and press enter so the data
formatting is automatically applied to
all the celles so most of the time your
sales or the data sheet will be varying
you might have to add or remove elements
or numbers right so in such scenarios
this will be helpful now comparing two
different columns or multiple columns
happens to be an important job when
you're working in data analytics as you
have to come up with some decisive
decisions based on the data now if you
had to do it manually then you might end
up taking hours or days based on the
data set you're working with but if I
say that you can do it within minutes
then it would be interesting to work
with right now we'll be doing the same
now we'll work on a sample data set
right on my screen so here we have
column 1 and column two now our job is
to compare the column one and column two
and come up with the result now the
first and the simplest way to do it is
use the buil-in conditional formatting
which comes with Excel by default now
all you have to do is select all the
data and navigate to home and in the
home go to Styles group and select
conditional formatting and in
conditional formatting you can see
highlight cells so in that you can use
duplicate values when you click on
duplicate values a small pop-up window
will come on your screen and here you
have an option of choosing whether
duplicate or unique so duplicate means
you're comparing the cells and you can
see there are some duplic cells which
are present in column one are also
present in column two now you can also
check how to uh you know find out the
unique values which are only present in
column 1 but not in column two so you
can just press unique and there you go
you can find it now you can also try to
you know change the color by filling
with green for The Unique columns and
duplicate cells with color red now this
was the first method and you can also
work out some different ones like uh you
can just directly uh press equal to and
select the cell and equals to and the
next cell press enter and if there is a
match it will give you true if there is
no match then it will give you false now
you can drag it down and see which all
are matching and which all are not now
you can also make some minute
modifications to this so uh if in case
you didn't find the data then you can
say not found so for that uh you can try
if and inside brackets and then you can
give the value as not found if true it's
found first you have to give the True
Values so for true you can write it as
found and in case if it's not found then
you can write it down as not
found there you go close the bracket
press enter and there you go if there is
a perfect match you will have found and
if there is no match then you'll get not
found now so far we have discussed uh
comparing two cells using conditional
formatting and also by using equals to
operator and trying to uh add some
tweaks to the equals to Operator by
involving with if operator and apart
from those we also have another way to
compare two columns in Excel so another
way is using the lookup functions so
we'll use a simple V lookup function to
compare both the cells so for that let's
type in equals to we look
up space and uh select the cell you want
to check for and then the range of
elements you want to uh compare and then
I'll press F4 to log
them now uh you want the data from
column
one and now you want the exact m so zero
press enter so there you go so the
elements which are present in column 1
and column two are been displayed here
so but in case if the elements are not
found you'll get an error so let's look
at that simply drag the formula to all
the cells and there you go so the
elements which are matching will give
you the proper result but the ones which
are not matching will give you not
applicable or error message this this
can be fixed we can make some minor
tweaks to the same
formula so we can add if
eror
comma simply write an as not
found and close the bracket so that
should do so we have closed the bracket
and press enter there you go now simply
drag this and soon you can see the data
which is having no match is shown as not
found now uh there is another
possibility okay let's get back to
another different sheet so this should
work so uh we we already have the
formula so let's erase that first I'll
erase the whole
data and even this one
yeah now we have the clear column for so
here you can see we have Ford India and
here you can see we have just Ford and
similarly here you have Mahendra and
Mahindra and here you have Mahendra
right so in some situations you might
have to compare two different columns
but the names might be a little
different right so for example uh if
you're working with Oracle and and if
you're working with Oracle America and
you have in the first case is Oracle and
in the second column is Oracle America
then those are one and same but you have
some minor text changes right just like
here you have Fort India and here you
have for so what if you had such kind of
issues so you can also make some minor
tweaks to it so using the same lookup
formula you can add equals to we look up
and also the comparison cell which is
this one and you're not you're not
stopping there you're trying to add the
wild card here so the wild card is HRI
which means if there is anything like uh
if you get the comparison between the
first cell and the second cell which
matches and if there is anything extra
rather than the actual cell please try
to consider it so that's what we're
going to do so after entering entering
the wild card symbol you'll select the
range of columns which you have to uh
you know fetch the data from and then
try to fix them using function key
F4 you're looking from the column number
one and then you're finding the exact
match now you can close it and
enter now let's try to drag
it there you go so you have the data
Mahindra and Mahindra hindai India Honda
India yeah so that's how you try to use
uh comparing cells in Excel now you can
see I'm on my Excel worksheet and I have
one table on my worksheet right now so
you can you know transposing or you know
converting Rose to columns is a very
simple task I'll explain you in two
different ways so the first way select
all the sales that you have on your
sheet and press on contrl C so it will
give you the copy option option and then
you can also paste in the same sheet or
if you want you can go to a whole new
sheet and select the paste option over
here but before selecting the actual
paste option you can see a small drop-
down icon click on that and navigate to
paste special and in this you can see
transpose option click on that or you
know make sure that it's checked and
press okay now you can see all your
columns have been converted into rows
and and all your rows are converted into
columns so this was the first way and uh
what is the second way you ask me so
it's really simple select one cell
somewhere and you know you can or let's
create a new sheet as well so here you
can you know write down the formula as
transpose and select the array which you
want to transpose so this is the
array so transpose is basically an array
function in Excel so once you are done
with you know selecting your data press
enter there you go so all your rows are
now columns and all your columns are now
the rows now on my spreadsheet you can
see some data which is the sales data of
quarterly basis and the four different
zones that is northwest southeast so you
can you know make things look better by
hiding these columns and if you hide
these columns it's critical for the end
user to identify which columns are
exactly hidden right to make things a
little easier for your end user you can
select the columns and then go to the
data option and in the data option click
on the group option so this will group
these columns and you will have the
symbol of minimization which will help
you hide these columns automatically and
unhide these columns automatically now
let's also try to group GH J
columns and there you go now similarly
let's also try to group the rows of
North and rows of
West then you have the row of
South and row of
East right now all these rows and
columns are been grouped now all you can
do is just click on the minimize button
and those will be minimized similarly
the rules right and to unhide them all
you can do is click on the plus icon and
they will be
unhidden you can also try to ungroup the
columns and rows all you have to do is
select the columns and click on the
ungroup option similarly the row as
well and that's how you can group and
ungroup rows and columns in Excel now we
are on our spreadsheet and you can see I
have some sample data on my spread sheet
and it does have some blank rows now how
do I eliminate these blank rows so one
step is you can you know select the
entire row and try to right click and
delete
it again this sort of method might take
hours to get rid of all the blank rows
and most of the time you might end up
even selecting the rows with data in it
right so if I want to select multiple
rows then I'll be selecting some rows
with data as well which might be a
little Troublesome in the future now
let's try to use the easier way now for
that go to the find and select option
select the go to special option and in
that select the blanks option and press
okay now hold control key and press
minus key and you will have an option of
deleting the Cs now select the entire
row now we are selecting the entire rows
with blank data and press okay and the
cells will be shifted now this was
simple but let me show you another
example so even here we have some blank
rows but in between those blank rows for
example take cell 17 or cell d17 or row7
we have some data testing and here in
the employee ID we have some data in
a26 and again in b39 we have some data
that is first name
right in such scenarios how do I
eliminate data so we have a simple Logic
for it so all we need to do is add
another row which is to count the number
of cells in the row now that can be
count now here equals to the function is
Count
a let
Tab and the sales will be from from A2
to
G2 press enter now you have 7 so now we
are basically calculating the number of
cells so if you apply the same to the
entire um data set let's drag
it and there you go so there are certain
places where you find zero which are
basically the empty columns right now
let's let's do some formatting if you
need let's try to add
filters crl a contrl d and now table
will have filters and
headers now here you can see the drop
down icon click on that now instead of
select all what you can do is Select
zero now you will be highlighted with
all the rows which do not have any data
select all those and press on delete or
what you can do is the same way control
minus there you go
now clear the
filter now all you have is the data
without any kind of blank rows so all
the rows that had some amount of data
retrained and all the data or all the
cells or all the rows which do not have
any data which are completely blank they
have been eliminated so here you can see
columns and rows so especially the
fourth row and the column C right so uh
currently we have data on our uh
spreadsheet and it is exceeding the
number of rows currently with visible on
our screen right so when you scroll down
you can see that the header or the
headers of all the columns are getting
vanished or scrolled up along with the
data right and you might want to keep
that so that you'll have reference to
every single aspect of or every single
cell data you're refering to right so
for that reason you might want to freeze
this and also you might have a doubt
what if uh even even I had this data in
the column section right and what if I
had to freeze that and you know when
when you scroll this and keep that data
uh set on the column as it is right so
we can also do that let's look at both
of them so there is a simple process to
do that all you have to do is select the
cell or for which you want to uh you
know set the or freeze the column
adjacent to it or the row adjust to it
right so currently I want to let me
expand it so currently I want to freeze
this particular row right and this
particular column so the cell I would be
selecting is the first cell here that is
D 5 right so when I select this
particular cell I can be able to freeze
this particular row and this particular
column so now you need to navigate to
the toolbar and then select the view
menu and inside view option you can see
there is an option of freeze pains right
so click on the drop down so you can see
three different options as we discussed
earlier we can either choose to freeze
an entire row that is a second option or
you can freeze the entire column that is
the third option or you can freeze both
that is the first option right freezing
rows and columns so let's select this
one and see if our rows and columns are
frozen or not right so now let's scroll
down and you can see our row is
successfully Frozen there right and
similarly scroll towards right and you
can see our column has been successfully
Frozen right so this is how you freeze
rows and columns or you can freeze pains
in Excel now here on my sheet you can
see we have some numbers that is $10 or
$10.20 $22 $ 53.1 two $12 and $110 now
the task is to convert these numbers
into word format that is representing
the numbers
alphabetically right this might be a
little curious and we also might end up
searching for a predefined method which
is not readily available in Excel but
there is a way where you can create a
function using Excel VBA or macros now
again creating a macro is completely
complex now identifying the trouble
Microsoft has already come up with a
readily available macro code on their
official website which will support the
various versions of Microsoft Excel
starting from Microsoft Xcel 365 to all
the way up to the older Excel version
that is 2010 now you can scroll down and
use this particular macro function which
Microsoft has readily made us available
and use this to create our own macro in
Excel VBA now let's get back to Excel
and you can create a macro using the
developer option now developer options
will not be readily available in
Microsoft Excel to activate developer
option go to home and go to the options
menu in the
last and here go to customized ribbon
and here in the second drop- down menu
you can see developer option by default
it will not be checked click on the
check option to activate developer
options and press okay now you have your
developer options ready click on
developer options click on Visual Basic
and here to insert a new macro click on
the insert button click on module and a
new matro window is readily available
for you now control V to paste your code
and your function is with the name
number to text right now close the
matro and here your function will be
readily
available equals to and the function
name was number to text press tab to
select the function and select the cell
where you have the data close the
function press enter
now drag the same formula across all the
cells and here you have the text
converted from numbers so here we have
$102 and you have $102 $22 and no cents
$53 and2 $12 and no sense and $110 with
no sense now that's how you can convert
numbers to words using the macro which
is predefined for excel in the Microsoft
website so for example
uh let us imagine that you wanted to
create one single cell for all the
employees in your company which stes the
first name second name or last name
including the email IDs at one place
right if you want to do so like let us
let us let me show you how it looks like
so let me copy this
here then that's the first name now it's
your second
name along with the email ID now let us
imagine that you wanted to store all the
employees in the same way right so you
can do this by using combined operation
in Excel now all it takes is just a
simple formula that is equals to and the
first cell
address
A2 and you can use an enter
sign now you can use the next cell
reference that as
B2 and then colon and the last s address
that is E2 now press
enter so when you press enter or tab you
will get this particular answer but this
data is completely uh in a state where
you can't understand it right the first
name last name and the email ID has got
comine all together so you want to use
some spaces right so all you need to do
is just make a little modification to
this particular existing data so you can
press another ENT and include
spaces and then you can separate the
email ID and the name with some
colon so now we have separated the first
two cells that is the first name and the
last name with the space using the
ampers sense and then again we have used
an ENT to include the colon and see that
we have also included a space between
the colon marks that it getss separated
cleanly and now let's try to press Tab
and see the result so there you go the
first name and the second name is
separated by space and the email ID and
the complete name is separated by a
colon now you can use this to all the
cells and there you go all the first
name last name and the email IDs have
been printed here so that's how you use
the combine operation in Excel and you
can see on my screen we have the sales
data of one single employee in the month
of January okay so this is the sales
data of John in janary sales now let us
imagine that we have the same person's
or same John's data of sales of all the
three months okay so here we have the
sales data of John for January February
and March and you wanted to Club all
these three months and write it down as
quarter one right so let us try doing
it now you can see that uh only January
is replaced as quarter 1 and February
and March are still uh remaining the
same so let us try to delete them so we
have deleted them and I think now it
looks like uh this is a sales data of
one single quter that is qu 1 but again
qua 1 is under column B and anyone who
looks at it feels like this data is of
January February and March and all the
quarter 1 details are only present in V
column but C and D are completely you
know different from this one right so
you don't want that kind of an
impression on your uh you know the one
who are presenting to you so in those
situations you want to merge all these
three columns and make sure that the
quarter one is present somewhere in
between the cell so that all the data
looks relevant and uh it it defines that
these data elements belong to qu one
right so there is an option in Excel to
do that so select all the cells that you
want to merge and going to home button
and in home button get into the
alignment group and select merch and
Center so you can do it directly also
you have a couple of more options that
is merge and center merge across merge
cells and unmerge so we'll go through it
by one so first we'll go through merge
and center so there you go the cell's
got merged and it has been aligned into
center now again if your manager or
anyone Superior to you wants this to be
you know independent like they want it
to be in terms of January February and
March so that they can have access to it
in month-wise so you want to unmar it
back right how to do that now so the
same menu and select unmar and there you
go you have your data back in the
original form again all you have to do
is you know rename a few
cells there you go and you have it back
right so in a few situations okay you
can also add the BS so that it looks
more relevant now um you know let's try
to Merch this again and merch in Center
yeah now again uh let us imagine that
you are going through an appraisal cycle
and you also wanted to add some commands
about the sales happening in your
company uh regarding uh all the
employees right so also we have that
here now let me expand a little
bit Yeah there so again let's Marg and
center now uh you wanted to you know uh
you wanted to take a review of your
level one level two and level three
managers so you have all the three um
rows here but you can see the cells are
not merged and uh you wanted to merge
every single row so merging and
centering everything rowwise would be a
little time consuming I mean three
columns is okay but what if you had like
uh you had to take a review from a
couple of more managers like 5 to 10
right or imagine you wanted to write
some random comments apart from review
you wanted to write some random comments
based on month-wise uh sales or
something like that so it would be a
time consuming right so apart from that
you have another option where you you
know select all the sales and come over
here and select the option of merge
across and all the celles will be merged
all together at once and you will be
having those individual rows where you
can write down your reviews like review
one and so on
review two right so this is how the
option of merch across works and we
already have been through the mergin
center and merge is completely similar
to merg and Center so this is how merg
and Center merge cells and uh merge
across and unmerge celles in Excel now
there are multiple ways to add date to
Excel spreadsheet for example equals to
today this is a shortcut method and you
can enter done you will have today's
state but again there is some problem
with this kind of approach so today's
date is 4th of September 202 do now if
you open the same spreadsheet after
today that is tomorrow or day after
tomorrow then you will have a concurrent
date that is 5th of September or 6th of
September right the date will always
vary or get updated according to time
now you don't want to change that or you
don't want that to be happening with
employe state of joining right it should
be stagnant it should not vary right so
there is another shortcut way apart from
using the datetime functions there is
keyboard shortcut where you can add date
to excel that is control semicolon so
this is the shortcut way to add date to
your Excel spreadsheet and this
particular date will not change this
will remain the same constant date
throughout the time now there is a
chance where you might also have to add
time to your spreadsheet that is date of
joining and time of joining right so
there is another simple shortcut where
you can add time by just pressing three
keys that is holding control holding
shift and pressing semicolon then you'll
have the time so this is how you can add
date to your Excel spreadsheet and add
time to your Excel spreadsheet and this
date and time will remain constant it
will not vary like the TRD function that
we have used here so you can see on my
screen we are on the Excel spreadsheet
and on my spreadsheet you can see dates
in column A and different formats in
column C D E and F respectively
Now by default the data type or the data
present in the a column will be
considered as general and there are a
few situations where even if you try to
format the date in your format like you
know the customized format you may not
be able to do it because it's still
under the general data type so for that
for being on the safer side what we will
do is select the data and navigate to
the data toolbar and in that you have
the text to columns option
press that and remember to have the
delimited icon you know you might be
having the dash as your icon or slash as
your icon for the delimited thing and
select that and next next and here you
can see right it's in general mode so
you can press on date and DMI will be
your date format that is date month and
year now click on finish so it's been
formatted now now let's copy the same
data and paste it in all the four
formats so so that we'll see the
different formats that we can change to
or customize to right so there you go
let's expand the columns a little bit
now we have day month and year so now
you might want to change a couple of
things right for example you wanted to
change okay let's see the menu so the
way is to select the CES and right click
and select the format sales option and
in here you can see the date function
and in here you can see different types
of modifications that you can do to your
data right
so you might want to also change your
dates based on the location so right now
we are in India and imagine if you
wanted to you know change something
based on us or if you if you're having
your client in us and he wants the dates
in US format you can also change that so
here you can see English United States
and press on that press okay and you can
see it's been changed to us format where
you have years in the first place months
in the second place and dates the last
place right and now let us imagine that
uh your client does not want the dates
all he needs is just months right you
can also do that get back to the format
sales option go to custom and here
instead of uh you know uh month date and
year all you can do is just write down
month and year and select okay so you'll
have only month and year not the dates
now your client is being a little more
you know he wants a little more detail
and he wants you to add a lot of
granularity to your data which includes
day time Etc everything right so you can
also do that so the same way go to
format sales custom and here I think
it's in date itself so let's navigate a
little yeah here so you have the day
date month and yeah press okay so there
you go right so that's how you can do it
and now now let's try a little bit more
if we have a few more options
pending so go to format
sales and
custom and you also have
timings so here you have date month year
and timings press okay and there you
have all the timings as well so since
these dates are you know I created them
just a few moments ago to keep it simple
so I did not have to add the diamonds
here so if you are Keen about adding the
timings you can also do that for example
if you wanted to add the timings of the
employees logged in and logged out you
can also do that using the same format
and you can see now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet and you can see we have a
column of dates and on the column B we
have age now how do you calculate the
age using the date of birth so this is
completely simple all you have to use is
the dated IF function or if you also
call it it as date diff function based
on your choice we also have a specific
entire tutorial based on date diff in
Excel for further information that video
will be linked in the description box
below you can go through it or you can
use the end screens and I cards link to
this video to get back to the tutorial
based on date diff in Excel now let's
calculate the age of these dates or
these people with these datea births so
all you have to do is type equals to and
type dated
F and open a bracket we need three
parameters here that is the date of
birth that is the first parameter now
the second one is the today function
because you're calculating the age of
these people as per today right so we
have a today function in Excel press on
Tab to select it and give a close
bracket now comma and if you wanted to
calculate the age in terms of days you
have to um you know give d as as the
input yeah here it should be D as the
input and don't forget to use the double
codes here and if you use the single
codes there might be an error so use
double codes if you want it in the Days
part you can give days and if you want
it in months you can give months for now
we want in ear so we will be giving y as
the third parameter and press enter
there you go you have the age here in 26
years you can drag the same function and
you have the ages here as you wanted
right so this is how you calculate age
in Excel and on my Excel spreadsheet let
me expand
it we have two different timings that is
in and out so here we are considering a
scenario where we are calculating the
total number of hours worked by an
employee in an organization so the end
time will be the time where the employee
loged in and the out time will be the
time when the employee logged out so
here we have made some minor cell
formatting so when you right click on
any of the cell you can get back to the
formatting celles option and in that
option we have selected the am p.m so
there is also another option of choosing
the 24-hour timing that is
1320 uh 1330 so this represents the
24hour
format but since we are you know working
on office timings let's keep it as am
p.m okay so there you go so we have our
uh timings of in and out now to
calculate the time difference between
the in time and out time so this
particular calculation is completely
simple all you have to do is press
equals to select out time minus select
in time so there you go press enter and
you have the total number of ask the
employee has been working in your
organization so here also we have made
some minor cell formatting so usually it
comes out as Am Pm right but instead of
that we have made a minor cell
formatting we have navigated into time
and we have selected the 24hour
formatting so that we have just RS in
our output so that's how we have
calculated the time difference between
two in times and out times of an
employee using Excel now Dax in Excel is
a sophisticated formulas type language
that comes in handy while working with
relational data and extracting
information via Dynamic aggregation
functions Dax in Excel stands for data
analysis Expressions Dax functions are
completely familiar to the general and
default functions that are available in
Excel now Dax allows users to perform
slightly escalated and advanced and
custom calculations upon various data
types like character data date time time
intelligence functions and many more and
in Dax there are a variety of functions
such as Dax table valued functions Dax
filter functions Dax aggregation
functions time intelligence functions
date and time information time logical
parent and many more now in today's
session we will look into one such type
of Dax function in Excel that is Dax
date and time function in Excel now
without further Ado let's get into
practical
mode and we have started our Microsoft
Excel inside Excel we have opened a new
blank worksheet Now navigate to data
option in the toolbar and in that go
to the power pivot window
window now we have entered the power
puot window and inside that you can see
the option of get external data click on
that and you can see a variety of
options that is you can get the external
data from a database you can get from
web servers that is from data service
and you have also other forms of data
sources and existing connections for now
we will take other forms of data that is
a Microsoft Excel data which is in our
local system select next now provide the
location of your folder just
browse and we will select Dax employee
data
open and there you go we have our data
connected to our powerpint window click
on next and there you go you have the
selected table and Views click finish
and you can see the data getting
imported into your power
window there you go by default if you
want to add any tax related functions
into your powerpint window you'll have
an external added column over here which
looks something like this if there is
not an external column you can also add
the column it's not a big trouble now we
have some data here that is the employee
ID employee name designation of the
employee Department of the employee
salary and joining date Etc right let's
expand this View and see what's what's
more in it
so this column is the date of birth and
this column is the employee joining date
right now we have so much of data now
let us imagine that we want to calculate
the retirement age of all the employees
so now let's rename the column to
retirement
date so we have our new column that is
retirement date now we will make use of
Dax date time functions to calculate the
age and find out the exact retirement
date of that particular employee so let
us imagine that every employee will
retire after the age of 65 so we have
our date of birth of every employee and
the joining date of every employee now
we'll come up with a Dax dat and time
function and calculate the age and then
we will find the retirement date of that
employee now every Dax function starts
with the same method or the same way as
the simp
Excel default method starts that is by
starting with an equals to and then we
will find
eate eate
and and now our first parameter that is
the start date that is the employee uh
the date where the employee joined the
organization so our sheet name is sheet
one now our joining date is in the F7
column select F7 press tab to select it
and comma Now how many months so each
and every year will have 12 months so 12
months into the age that is 65 Star 65
and now you can close the uh function
and press enter and then you'll find the
retirement date of that particular
employee so there you go so we have the
employee dates that is Employee
Retirement dates for all the employees
so the first one that is Jack has the
retirement date of 19 February
2085 and similarly Jenifer has her
retirement date at 15th of August 2084
so that's how we use the Dax functions
in Excel so this is one of the several
Dax functions in Excel that is Dax date
and time functions in Excel so you can
see that I've got some data which is
first name of the employee last name of
the employee and phone number and let us
assume that uh your manager has given
you a task to identify all those uh
employees which did not give an phone
number so you wanted to identify them
using a check box right like you will be
providing a check for all the employees
that we have received the phone numbers
and you will not be checking the
employees which did not give the phone
number right so let's try to do that so
to include a checkbox you might want to
get into the developer option
but for few reasons Microsoft has
disabled developer option by default to
enable developer option all you have to
do is just navigate anywhere on the
ribbon here and right click and then you
can see customize the ribbon option when
you click into it you will be redirected
into the ribbon option and here you can
see the developer option on the right
side right this one so by default you
can see that your developer option is
not enabled to enable it you have to
check in it and there you go you have it
now so press okay and you'll have the
developer option now go to the developer
option and select the insert option and
there you can see the checkbox now draw
the checkbox
anywhere I'll draw it over here and
there you go you have the first check
box right now if you want you can even
customize this
so carefully click
it you can edit the
text and write it
as done
okay now you can even copy this to all
the
sales just select and drag and there you
go now you can go ahead and check all
the employees which you have received
the phone numbers and you can eliminate
the ones which did not provide you with
the phone numbers
that's how you can do it and there's
also another option where you can use
this to include it in a formula since
this data is only of 25 rows you can
manually check in the data and you can
leave the data which is you have not
received but what if you had 2500 right
then you might need formula so in such
scenarios you can use a formula so how
do you use that so for example uh if
this particular box is checked then you
will get a True Value here and if it's
not checked you will have a false value
then you can use that Boolean value to
include in your formula right sounds
interesting now let's try to implement
that you can right click the cell and
you can find format
control then you can see here you have
an option called sell link here select
the sell
link and press press okay so here you
can see if you have checked this the
value is true and if you uncheck
this you can see the value turned false
now you can use this particular cell
reference for including this in a
formula now let us also check how to
include checkboxes on Google Sheets in
Google sheet it's really simple all you
have to do is get into the insert option
and you can see a readily available
check boox you don't have to use any
developer options over here and there
you go you can just SH now let us assume
that you're giving an important
presentation and you're also requested
by your manager to add the Excel
document that you have used to create
that particular report which would be
something like this when you click on it
it will open a new Excel document or
Excel Window with all the data in it
right so how do we do that let's look at
the demo now let's have a blank slide
and let's get back to the source where I
Excel file is located that is in my
documents so we are currently in my
documents and we have the Excel file
which we used for creating that
particular report now if we copy and try
to paste it on our Excel document it
would look something like
this and clearly it's not visible and
it's not accessible right so instead of
this there is another way where you can
directly add the Excel document in the
form form of logo which is a rather
simple idea all you have to do is just
click on the insert option in the
toolbar then navigate to the text group
and here you will find the option called
object click on the object and it will
give you a new window where you can
identify which type of document or
object you want to add either create or
create from file so we have the file in
our local system so we'll choose create
from file browse and from browse we will
go into the documents section where we
have our Excel file click on the Excel
file and click on okay now if you want
the data or Excel file to be displayed
in the form of an icon then click on the
display as icon section and here you can
change the icon so you can choose any
one of the given options let's choose
this particular one and click on okay
another okay and there you go the icon
will be now displayed on your Microsoft
PowerPoint PPD which is completely
clickable as the previous one whenever
you click on this the Excel document
will be opened so that's how you add
Excel document into Microsoft PowerPoint
now we are on our Excel spreadsheet and
here I'm trying to insert some images
onto my spreadsheet so here we have
company logos and Company brand names so
since we already have the brand names
what we need to add here is the brand
logos okay so how do I add such kind of
an image into an Excel spreadsheet that
you might be thinking that Excel
spreadsheets are just for data not
multimedia image of files right so no
it's not it's completely wrong you can
also add your images onto your Excel
spreadsheets it's completely simple so
click anywhere on the Excel spreadsheet
navigate to the insert button select the
illustrations option from the addin
group click on that and you know in the
drop down you can see the pictures icon
or the pictures uh button click on
that and select from this device or if
you have an online stock image you can
take that or you can also check out from
online pictures for now I'll select the
device this
device and here I have some images the
images what we need are simply learn and
simply code logos press okay or insert
so here you have
them now you can also adjust the size of
the image using the small buttons here
PR it over
here and
done so you might be wondering is it all
done is there anything more to do or
just adding an image is done no most of
the times when you create or you work
with Excel spreadsheet you will not just
you know add some data and add a
relevant image to it most of the time
you add some graphs or you most of the
time you'll add some charts uh to
showcase the data dashboard right so it
will be something like this so this is
how you add the image or graph onto your
uh uh dashboard and sometimes you might
not have enough place to uh display your
entire dashboard during those situations
what you do is you try to hide the row
or column so now let's try to hide this
particular room let us imagine that you
wanted to show only uh two uh charts and
there is no space for your third chart
in such scenarios you might want to hide
or remove that third chart okay so let's
try to hide it and see if gets if it
gets hidden or not when you try to hide
it you can see the column A has no data
and the row number four is been hidden
so we have three and five but what about
the image it is still present right so
if you want to make sure that the row
also hides the image you you might have
to do a little formatting with it so
select the image go to picture
format or you can also right click and
directly navigate to picture format this
opens up a set of options and here you
might want to go to the U third uh one
which is picture format third and select
the properties and here select the
option of move and size with cells so
when you select this when you try to
hide this it will will also I mean the
graph of the image will also hide along
with the R so that's how you do it so
how to insert PDF in Excel now there are
multiple ways to insert a PDF into Excel
so we will go through a couple of ways
first is here let us imagine that we
wanted to insert some PowerPoint
presentation in PDF format into our
Excel sheet so that belongs to excel
Basics now click on the cell where you
want to add the PDF or just click any
cell in the Excel spreadsheet then go to
the option of insert in the toolbar then
navigate to text option click on it and
select
object and here you can select create
from file and then you can browse and
here you have your Excel Basics PDF in
my documents click on that select insert
so here you can just press okay and the
PDF will be inserted now you can
minimize the size of PDF to fit the
cell there you go the PDF code
successfully inserted into your Excel
spreadsheet now let's discuss about the
second way now the second way is
completely same the only difference is
you can add some logo to your PDF so you
can see it has been added in direct form
of a PDF like what's the first slide of
the PPD but instead of that if you
wanted to highlight it as an icon then
you can select the display as icon
button here and press okay now you don't
have to reformat the size of your PPD or
PDF all you have to do is add the logo
to your PDF and it will also include the
title so this is another way of adding
uh you know PDF to your Excel sheet now
another way so a few times you don't
want the first page of the uh PDF to be
visible or any kind of logo of that PDF
reader to be visible on your spreadsheet
sometimes all you want is some dedicated
image or a dedicated logo right so this
time let's try to add a dedicated image
to our PDF so go to insert again here
you can see the illustrations option
click on picture and from this device so
I will select the simply laun logo and
now you have to resize the logo a little
bit to fit the
cell there you go
now you can uh you know click on the
right click button and and select the
option of Link now um select the
existing file or web page option so if
you are interested to learn more on
hyperlink in Excel we have a dedicated
tutorial on that please go through
hyperlinks in Excel by simply learn
which will explain you everything about
hyperlinks in Excel how to insert them
different types of documents to be
inserted and how it works in real time
for now let's try to insert the existing
web page and go to documents navigate to
documents and inside this you have the
Excel basic PDF click on okay and it is
been added to your image so when you
click on it it will open the PDF
document attached to it so when you
hover over to the cell you can see it
will ask you a permission do you want to
continue or not just click on this
ignore the warning so you can see the
PDF has been successfully open convert
PDF into
Excel now to do this let's get back to
the Practical mode and try to convert
some PDF data into Excel now you can see
the PDF document which I'm looking to
convert from PDF to excel so this
particular PDF document has a table so
this is the statewise GST collections
that happened during March of 2020 now
we need to convert this Tabet data from
PDF format to excel format now we are on
the Microsoft Excel now to initiate the
process we might want to choose a blank
workbook for this so now we are at the
blank workbook and the complete sheet is
empty now let's go into the data option
in the
toolbar and in the data option of the
toolbar we
have the ribbon of get and transform
data in this ribbon you can can see get
data option select that and you can see
various options here from file from
database from Azure from other sources
Etc now we need the first option that is
from file and in that we have a drop
down and in that drop down you might
want to select the PDF if you have a
Json file you can also choose from a
Json and if you have the data from XML
you can choose that and even you can
extract the data from text or CSV as
well now we need the PDF option so
select the PDF Now navigate where your
file is existing so my file is on the
desktop and now let me select the PDF
document select import now Excel will
automatically analyze the tabula data in
the PDF format and give you the results
now according to excel there are
multiple tabula formats table one table
two so basically this table is one and
the same so all the 29 states are fixed
in one table itself but since the PDF is
divided in sheets this particular
document is considering the first table
as a separate table and the table which
is present in the third page as a
separate table so we have table one
table two and there are few more tables
which Excel is assuming that it might be
table but it's not and another table
which is page number 002 it is a table
and another one is right here now there
is an option of selecting all the tables
all together at once or you can select
only one table which you want to select
so if you select multiple items Excel
will automatically give you an option of
choosing your tables you can just take
and select the tables you want or you
can directly select the table you want
on your Excel
sheet so right now let's try to select
multiple tables so I'll be selecting 1 2
4 and 5 and this particular one is not a
table so I'm eliminating that now you
might want to choose the load option so
Excel is now loading the
[Music]
data now all the data has been
successfully
loaded
now yeah it is giving us a notification
that all the data has been successfully
loaded and now just right click on it
and here choose the option load two and
here select table option and if you want
the data to be U you know loaded to a
new worksheet you can choose that and
select
okay now you can see all the data is
been successfully loaded in the form of
tabula format in the new Excel
sheet similarly let's try to load
another
page in the table
format new worksheet
select
okay and the third
sheet now get ready to impress your boss
by converting all the PDF data into
Excel sheet just in a matter of few
seconds with few steps and there you go
all the four tables have been loaded
successfully in the form of excel in
just a few steps now this is how you
convert PDF to excel that is how to add
tick mark in Excel now on my spreadsheet
you can see some employee data so
they've been assigned a task and they
want to update the task status as done
and not done using symbolic statements
that is tick mark and into marks now how
to do that it is really simple we'll
discuss two different ways the first way
is to do it by conditional formatting so
click a sell on the task status go to
conditional formatting click on the new
rule yes of course we can use the icon
settings but we want to automate it so
click on the new rule right so here
instead of two color scale select icon
sets now go to the settings here we
don't want the third symbol so select no
cell icon and here instead of percentage
number formula let's add just a simple
number and the second one as well just a
simple number now in the icon settings
select Tech Mark you have various types
of them you know the circular Tech Mark
and let's select the generic Tech Mark
without any outer circles and into here
generate x mark and now let's set the
values when the value is greater than
zero it will be green and when the value
is less than or equal to zero it will be
X and the reference value is zero and
here also the reference value is zero
everything is okay click on okay and
done and here you cannot see the logos
yet we need to add some formula here
which is equals to if click on Tab to
select the symbol and if Cell address C2
is equals to
done then the value should be one else
the value should be zero close the
bracket
enter right now you can see this
particular logo here now drag the same
formula it's done now you can see we do
have numbers you can eliminate those
numbers as well just edit the rules
and here you can see show icon only
click okay and the numbers will be
removed also edit the second one and
there you go the numbers are gone and
only the symbols remain now what is the
second technique the second technique is
available in the developer options you
can activate it by you know uh going
into the options here go to file and
here go to options and here go to
Advanced customize ribbon and in here on
the right hand side you will get
developer options click on the tick box
and it will be enabled now go into
developer options and click into insert
menu click on the form controls or
active X controls select the checkbox
and now just place it over here you know
you can edit this particular checkbox
delete everything drag it as checkbox as
well now you can drag the same cell
across all the functions and you will
have the check box as well now you can
click on it and see if it's done or not
that is how to add Watermark to excel
now on my sheet you can see some data so
here we wanted to add some Watermark
logo to your uh Excel spreadsheet so
that it looks genuine and work by you
right so that's the overall idea of
adding a watermar now go to the insert
window and in the insert window go to
the text option click on that select
header and footer once you select header
and footer you can see something on your
screen like this so in this box which is
highlighted by a cursor is where you're
going to add the picture on my top in
the menu bar you can see header and
footer elements in this select the
picture element and it will navigate to
you to a different option window since
we are adding the image from our local
system select from file or if you are
adding from your Bing or any search
window you can also add that or one
drive as well but now let's go with from
file it will directly navigate you to
the pictures folder in your local system
so here is my simply learns logo click
on it and select insert now you can see
the images added in this format which is
ENT and picture and you might wonder
where is the picture it is actually
present to view it click on any cell in
the spreadsheet and there you go you can
see it now you might be wondering the
image is a little towards top and
abnormally placed right right so no
worries you can always you know format
your picture just press enter and use
enter to move your picture towards the
center of your data spreadsheet and also
there is another option of format
picture alog together here you can
adjust the height and width of your
image by you know increasing and
decreasing width or increasing and
decreasing height using the arrow marks
also works and apart from this there is
another option of picture formatting
where you can choose your image to be
washing out black and white gray scale
or anything so currently I'm going with
automatic which will automatically
adjust the brightness and you know
everything for your image it looks
perfectly fine so click on okay and
there you go right so now this should be
fine right now everything is done and
everything is automatically saved if you
are having that auto save option on your
spreadsheet and let's go back to the
normal view from the header and footer
view click on The View and go to normal
you might be confused right where is the
logo vanish did I have to save it no
it's already saved everything is fine
even the image is there but you cannot
see it in normal view to see it click on
file click on print then you can see the
logo it will be present only on the
printed Pages not on the normal view
okay so that's how you work with the
watermarks in Excel and that's how you
can add and customize your watermarks
using Excel how to modify or increase
inre cell size in Excel now most of you
might probably want to increase just the
cell size or you know just to increase
the visibility of the text so one of the
easiest way is just to press on the plus
icon on the bottom right corner of your
Excel spreadsheet so this will
automatically increase the text size and
you can see the text more clearly now
apart from that if it's just not that
what you want to do you can also modify
by h over to the line between two
columns and right click which will give
you the option of format cells or column
width so either of these options will
help you to maximize or minimize your
column width similarly you can apply the
same idea for your rows as well so you
can either format the cells or modify
the row height of your cell and this is
another way and another simple way is to
just hold that line and drag it so it
improves your the width of the column
and another way is to just over onto
that line and hold it and drag it to
improvise or increase your width of the
cell and same applies to your row so
this is another way so apart from that
there is another way that is format
cells from this particular option in the
home button you can select this and here
you have the row height autofit row
height column width autoit column width
for example let us imagine that you
wanted to you know just by mistake you
uh you increase the cell size and you
want it to restore it back to the
original thing right so you can just
click on the autofit height and click on
the autoit column width there you go it
happens in that way and now coming back
to another simplest way let us imagine
that you are given a lot of data and you
are told to autoit all the rows and
columns now we have already seen the
format cell option where we will autoit
all the Colum and width of the column
and also the height of the rows Etc
right but there is also a keyboard
shortcut to do this so all you have to
do is select a cell and press CR a to
select all the cells in the spreadsheet
and once all the cells are selected all
you have to do is press and hold ALT key
and then release it then the combination
of keys that is H
oi so your column width has been now
adjusted now now the same formula or the
same shortcut key with a small
modification press and hold and release
ALT key now h o and a to adjust the row
height so this is the way where you can
increase or decrease or modify or
autofit all the cells in Excel now you
can see that we have the First Column
that is a column and the first set of
that is text and all the other cells are
numbers but as a whole Excel considers
the whole column as a general data
format so why are we discussing about
this so to create a barcode in Excel you
have to make sure that all the elements
in the column are of Text data type so
the first step is to convert this
General data type to Text data type so
you can do that by going into the data
type and selecting text and now all the
elements in your first column A are type
text now the next step is to convert
these elements into barcode now for that
let's create a new column called
barcode now our new column that is
barcode has been created now the next
step would be is to check for the
barcode font so the barcode font looks
something like this but let me remind
you the barcode font in Excel is not
available by
default don't worry if it's not
available we can download it from open
source so let's go back to
Google so on the Google you want to
search uh for barcode font for Excel so
the one that I would recommend is three
of9 barcode
font now you can download This phont by
just clicking on the download button
over here now I already downloaded this
font on my local system let's now try to
install that now the 3 of9 barcode
folder will come in the form of zip
folder you have to unzip that and after
unzipping you'll get the setup file
which looks something like this which is
3 of9 new select that and you'll be
having the installer file over here you
can install by selecting the install
button over here so I have already
installed it in my local system so it is
readily available for me on my Microsoft
Excel now we might want to create the
barcode for this particular cell in A2
so let's create that so to create a
barcode we need to write in a formula
that is equals to double
codes star double codes and ENT symbol
address of the cell that is A2 another
ENT symbol again double codes star
symbol and double codes so you can
either use this or instead of star you
can use brackets as
well so let's try brackets now select
enter now this will generate another
type of code in your resultant cell now
we will change the font for this
particular resultant cell and we will
get our barcode now you can just drag
all these cells so that you can apply
the formula to all the codes now I got
all the codes over here now select all
the cells get into the fonts and here
select the barcode font and there you go
you have the barcode for all the numbers
you have in your column A so that's how
you create barcode in Excel Excel
flashfill is a feature of Microsoft
Excel where Excel can sense a pattern in
a cell and apply the same logic to
extract the similar resultant pattern
out of the remaining cells in a table
might be a little confusing right so let
us simplify it so let us imagine that
you have a text in one of the cells in
the Excel sheet and you want it to trim
a part of that text for example let us
imagine that there is an assembly an
assembly where the car parts are
assembled together to finish a car so
each and every part has a code the
serial number the product code and the
assembly code Etc right and you wanted
to separate all those three if you
wanted to do that you might want to use
the trim function which might be a
little Trea is to apply to all the cells
but what if if I say there is a simple
key for format using which you can fill
all the columns in the Excel sheet
within a fraction of second sounds
interesting right so that's exactly the
flashfill function in Excel
does now before we get started let me
tell you guys that we have daily updates
on multiple Technologies if you're a
tech gek in a continuous hunt for latest
technological Trends then consider
getting subscribed to our YouTube
channel and don't forget to hit that
Bell icon to never miss an update from
Simply now without further Ado let's get
started with the Flash Fill in Excel for
that we might want to start the Excel to
get in the Practical mode now we are on
the Microsoft Excel and remember the
example we discussed so this is a
similar example now the first column in
the sheet is the product detail so this
product detail consists of the product
code that is 112 next we have the
product serial number that is
100025 637 and lastly the assembly code
that is a s and X now we want to
separate this product detail into three
columns where we have the First Column
to be storing the product code second
one to be storing the product serial
number and the last one to be storing
the assembly code so now if you want to
do that using trim function you might
want to apply the trim function here and
trim out the left part and again for the
product serial number you might want to
use the trim function again which might
go into a little complicated pattern So
to avoid the complications and and
decrease the time spent we might want to
use the flashfill in Excel now let us
help Excel about the pattern that we
might want to generate so the pattern is
112 and the next one is
322 so now you can see that the text was
highlighted that was the intimation from
the Excel that it understood the pattern
now going into the Nexel and holding the
control key and pressing the E button
will help us to fill the remaining cells
in the column B so that's how it is done
and similarly let's try out for the
serial
number for that
the serial number is
one2
5637 now in the next cell we have
13
6582 now we can go to the third cell and
press contr e for Windows and if you're
using a Mac operating system then you
have to press command e and all these
serial numbers will be filled so this
will reduce the time in separating the
pattern and filling the
columns now let's try the last column
that is as SX which happens to the
assembly code next we have f g and V now
the shortcut method that is CR e and
there you go now you might be wondering
will it work only for numbers etc etc or
the text which is properly aligned or
separated using a hyphen no it can also
be used for some random text which is
like like this so let us imagine that we
have a text which is of length like 20
or 30 and you wanted to print only a
part of it so here I'm going to print
the alphabets from position fourth to
position 8th so I've already tried the
first one that is taking out the
alphabets from fourth location to the
eighth location or the pattern of the
text that is i f e from Jennifer Lopez
and in the next cell we have the numbers
starting from the location 4 to 8 so
that is 7767
and similarly we have the other cells
consisting of the names of f cars that
is Alpha Romeo Bugatti Veron and next we
have Superman Returns text so now let's
press the shortcut key that is CR e and
make sure that all the remaining cells
are filled so that's how the Flash Fill
works so the Flash Fill in Excel will
reduce the time consumed to fill all the
columns by separating the text in your
main cell that is the column A which we
have here in this example and it also
reduces the complexity of using a trim
function in Excel is hyperlinks in
Excel now hyperlink is something which
is clickable and when you click on it it
will redirect you to a different web
page to a different worksheet or a
different location in your local system
so there are a variety of options and we
will explore all of them using Excel now
creating a hyperlink is really simple we
have multiple ways now let's write some
text on the Excel
worksheet I'll write simply
long now creating a hyperlink is really
simple you have multiple ways the first
simplest shortcut is clicking on the
cell where you want to place the
hyperlink and holding control key and
pressing K now this will enable the
hyperlink menu box or the dialog box
this is the first way and let me close
it now again we have selected the cell
there is another option where you have
to click on the insert menu on the
toolbar and navigate to Links group
click on the link option and you will
again have the dialog box of the
hyperlink and Excel and the Third Way is
right click on the cell and you can see
the link option in the lost and this
will enable the hyperlink option in
Excel now let's create a hyperlink the
simplest way again control K now we have
a variety of options that is existing
file or web page place in this document
create a new document and an email
address so we will address all of these
one at each time so first one existing
file or a web page now you can select an
existing PDF file or any file in your
local system and hyperlink or create a
hyperlink to the text or you can select
a website link and place it over here
and create it as a hyperlink Let's uh
explore both the options first let's try
to explore the web page option so since
I have written as simply learn let's use
the website link of Simply learn and
create a
hyperlink let me open
Google new tab and let me type simply
learn.com let me copy the hyperlink and
now let's get back to the Excel workbook
now here let's place the hyperlink now
you can press okay and there you go the
hyperlink has been successfully created
now this link is clickable when you
click on it it will redirect you to a
new simply learns home web page right so
this is how you create a hyperlink to a
website now we shall explore another
option that is using an existing file
right let's create a new text box here
let's name it as
existing file and okay existing file
should be good again the same you can
either click uh you know right click and
select hyperlink or control key now
let's select existing file or web page
option now here you can see navigate key
press on that and let's navigate our
files let's select all files you have
remember to select all files okay by
default it shows as office files now
let's explore our file option
so let's select her fundamentals of
computer programming option which is a
PDF file press okay and there you go we
have created a hyperlink so when I click
on this you can directly navigate to an
existing PDF file in your local system
and it will be open as a web page click
on it and you can see the PDF file now
close now another thing when you
navigate onto this you'll see the lenier
HTTP uh address and same happens here
right so if you're a little
uncomfortable watching this lengthier
link you can also edit it you can choose
the option of edit
hyperlink
and see the screen dip option click on
it and here you can change the text
display
option and write it as click here to
know
more press
okay again press okay and now if you
navigate onto it instead of seeing a
lengthier hyperlink what you can see is
click here to know more okay I think I
made a spelling mistake so I think I
forgot an
e somewhere over here yes click here to
no more and press okay right so here you
can see see click here to know more
let's try this again over
here show
edit edit hyperlink screen tap option
and instead of the lenier text box or
hyperlink you can write as click to open
notes or
PDF click okay and click another okay
and you are done so instead of see that
length your hyperlink you can see click
here to open PDF right so so far we have
explored two options that as existing
file and existing web
page right now let's try to explore
another option again uh hyperlink right
click hyperlink and here you have seen
places in document all right so which is
like uh okay let me show this to you
instead of telling you so here what it
is doing is you have the cell A5 and you
want it to refer to A1 or any other cell
in the same worksheet so you can do that
right so now for your reference let me
cancel it and let me create a new sheet
and here navigate me to here right let
me write it as navigate me to here okay
so now what we will do is so here here
we will create that navigate link from
using the hyperlink option place this in
this document you can see the sheet to
option and the cell reference is A1
where we have written navigate me to
here so when I click this A5 cell okay
let me also rename
it write it as navigate cell navigating
cell right
now create
that contr
K let me select sheet two and the cell
address is A1 press okay now what did uh
what What's the change right when you
click on this you will be redirected to
sheet 2 cell A1 navigate me to here
right so this can be like a shortcut
when you have multiple sheets like 100
sheets then you can uh you know have a
different column over here and uh add
the navigation address to all those sell
links you can just click on that cell
and go into the different sheet and to
the specific cell which you have given
the address in our case I have given
sheet to address cell A1 right so this
is another trick now let's get back to
the hyperlink thing again uh control K
and another option is create new
document so you might have been through
you know option of uh having let's say
some cheat sheets or uh clip on clip gos
right so uh let us imagine that you're
working through uh a huge worksheet and
uh you wanted to you know uh have a a
track of everything and keep notes
updating right so it might be a little
complicated to understand so let me show
it practically so let me write down as
clipboard or sticky
note
right okay I think this has a hyper
letters okay this can be used no worries
back
to uh hyperlink option
again create new document now here you
can create a variety of uh documents
right so it can be a text document it
can be an Excel document it can be a PDF
document right for now we'll create a
text document okay uh we'll name it as
uh
tracker. txt so this should create as a
text
document and the location can be
anything so you can you know uh take it
as a desktop documents download so let
me take documents here and select okay
so I'll be having the tracker. txt
located in the documents
folder and uh you can also choose to
edit the document later or edit the
document now let us select edit the
document now press okay and there you go
so you have your text tracker here so
let us imagine that we have worked on
the Excel sheet and we wanted to write
down us a sticky note uh so that we can
remember what we have done on the Excel
sheet so update
one and uh update two now you can close
it so it'll ask for a save option save
it and done and let us imagine that you
did something else and you also updated
something else on the sticky note I mean
Excel sheet and you wanted to update
that on your sticky note so click on it
and you'll see a minor notice over here
from Microsoft Excel based on potential
security concerns you can select yes and
you'll be having access to your text
document again and write down your
update again here update three what you
have written right the latest update
what you
have and you can save it and
close so that's how you keep track of
your sticky note and you'll have all
your updates right now getting back to
the hyperlinks
again uh the last one is email address
so you can also try to add uh okay let
us imagine that you're working with a
colleague and every time you make an
update in your Excel sheet or anything
and you wanted to send him out an email
right so it would be a little timec
consuming that you open your email and
uh comp post something and send it over
here but what if you had a one single
click and access to the email compos
option right that can be done so let us
write down
email B me with the spelling so again
the control K and hyperlink select email
option and you can write down your
email which can be anything so you can
write down your friend's email address
so I'm just writing down some random
email here friend gmail.com
and can write the subject about
update and press okay this will navigate
you to the Gmail option or the mailing
address
options click on it and you'll have a
variety of mailing options Outlook
Office 365 yeah yo iCloud Google Etc so
you can select any one of those since we
have written as gmail.com we'll navigate
to Gmail and all you have to do is login
you know all the formalities and you're
good to go with
emailing so let's skip this for now so
you're you know how to do the rest parts
so so far we have uh you know covered
all the hyperlink options in Excel that
is existing file or a web page place
this in the current executive worksheet
or document creating a new document for
your update thing and uh also including
the email right so so far we have
covered everything around hylink in
Excel and if you have anything to know
more about or if you feel that we have
missed out anything important regarding
hyperlink in Excel you can feel free to
let us know roundoff formula in
Excel now for this particular tutorial
we will be using the student data set
now let's get back to the Practical mode
and start our Microsoft Excel now we are
in the Microsoft Excel and as you can
see on my sheet okay let me expand
this so as you can see on my screen we
have the data set belonging to students
so we have 10 students and every one of
them has name role number class blood
group and marks Etc and at the end we
have the percentage and as you can see
we have the percentage in terms of float
values and we have a lot of decimal
values like eight and above so what if
you wanted to just have one or two
digits after the actual percentage like
80.6 or 80.6 6 right it would be a
little bit more or good to read right so
that's what a roundoff actually means so
now let's work on having rounded off
values for the percentage now let's
create a new
column let's name it as as
um round
of
percentage
great so to actually perform the round
of uh formula we do have a predefined
method for that for that you just have
to type
in equals to round
and there you go we have round up and
round down so both of them perform the
same operation let's select a round up
and this is the m column and the row
number is three so we'll have to press
M3 and the number of values after the
decimal point so now let's select um
one and there you go press enter and the
value should be rounded off now 80. 66
is being rounded off to
80.7 now when you drag the cell to the
all the rules then you can see all the
values will be rounded off here you can
see 75.1 6 has been rounded off to 75.2
and 82.3 3 is been rounded off to 82.4
so we end up with having rounded
off so first we will understand what
exactly is standard deviation so
standard deviation is a calc calulated
square of variance now what is variance
okay nothing to worry let us also
understand what is
variance now the next part variance so
what is variance variance is a measure
of variability it is calculated by
taking the average of squared deviations
from the mean now what are deviations so
slowly you can understand that we're
getting into the topic of statistics and
graphs so uh before getting deep into
into it let's understand what is
deviation so the deviation is a measure
that is used to find the difference
between the observed value and the
expected value of a variable in simple
terms deviation is the distance from the
center point so for example when you are
going through a graph so you will be
expecting some value right and if you
get some difference that is above or
below the expected point that is called
the deviation what is the difference
between the expected point and the
obtained point so that is the deviation
now next is the observed value so the
observed value is the value that you get
in real time unlike the predicted value
so now you might be thinking to
calculate standard deviation we might
need a few more parameters and you're
exactly right so to calculate standard
deviation in Excel you need variance and
then you need deviation and then you
need mean right so all these parameters
are supposed to be calculated first and
then you will be be having the final
formula to calculate standard TV now
that we understood the theoretical and
formula based explanation about standard
deviation it's time we calculate the
standard deviation using one of the most
popular business intelligence tool that
is Microsoft Excel so let's get back to
the Practical
mode so now we are on the Practical mode
and we have some sample data on my
screen right now let me expand it a
little
bit yeah there you go so
as discussed before to calculate
standard deviation we might require the
mean variance deviation and deviation
squared and then we can calculate the
standard deviation so let's go step by
step so the first one is calculating sum
right so to calculate average we might
need sum of all the scores so we have
the index values that is 1 to 10 and
scores of each index value that is 1 to
10 right now let's calculate the sum of
all values here press tab to select the
function select and drag these cells
press enter and then you have the scores
now you want number of indexes so
clearly you can see we have 10 but still
let's count them see ENT tab space to
select and select the number of cells
press enter and you have count now
what's the mean so mean is simply the
average of all the numbers right so you
can either divide the sum by count or
you can simply use the average function
so let's try to use the average function
so that we also have an idea of how the
average function Works press tab to
select it and select all the cells press
enter now you have the average or mean
value now we have the mean value and now
after finding the mean value we are
supposed to find out the deviation so
remember the deviation that is the
difference between the obtained value
and the predicted value right so the
obtained value is this one which is here
in C2 and the predicted value is this
one that is 82.6 that's our mean right
according to formula we supposed to
eliminate the value of obtained minus
the mean right so select uh the cell
equals to
C2 minus the obtained value that is mean
now press F4 to freeze the value and now
press enter so that you can freeze the
value and drag the formula across all
the sets now you have the
deviation
right now the next step is to find the
sum of all the deviation numbers so
either you can apply the sum formula to
all these numbers or you can just drag
this cell over here and the formula will
be automatically copied now similarly
the count function to count all the
values that is drag it and you'll have
it over here right now the next step is
to find out the square deviations or the
square of the deviations which is really
simple all you have to do is equals to
select the cell and uh see that small
hat kind of logo on the number six use
that now into two press
enter you have the square similarly drag
the same formula across all the cells
and you'll have your square numbers
similarly drag this summation function
over here so you'll have the sum of this
and the count number as
well now comes the final
formula now we have the mean value that
is over here let's color
it and we have the variation
Square now that is which is this one
let's color it in a different shap and
we have deviation as well let's color it
in a different shade
now we need to find the variance and
after we find the variance the last step
is to count the standard division or
calculate the standard deviation so what
is the formula to calculate the variance
so for variance you need the sum of
deviation
Square divided by total number of
values minus
1 the center and that's your variance
now now the standard deviation so the
standard deviation is really simple you
need to
calculate the variance to the power
of5 and that's your standard
deviation so that's how you calculate
standard deviation in Excel I hope all
the formulas and the explanation was
clear so you can see that we have got
started with Microsoft Excel and on the
left hand side we have a simple table
with all the teams in an IT industry
starting from it admin testing
development to client consultant support
we have got everything in this
particular
table now our main idea is to find out
the index of these particular elements
for example if you wanted to find the
index of the element marketing then how
could you do it so here let's try to use
the match function in Excel for that we
want look up value and position so on
the right hand side you can see that
I've created two separate columns as
look up value and positions so in the
lookup value column we will be inserting
the value of which you want to find the
index now for example let us consider
that we want to find the index value of
Team
marketing so I'll be writing Marketing
in this particular lookup value
now how to find the index value of the
element marketing for that we will be
using the match function in
Excel now after writing the match
function you can see that it is asking
for three different parameters so the
first one is the lookup value second is
the lookup array and lastly we have
match type so lookup value is the value
of which you are trying to find the
index that is is marketing this
particular cell so we have selected the
lookup value which is the first one next
we have to select the lookup array that
is from which set of elements you want
to find the index so the set of elements
are this it admin testing the column
which we have created the a column now
we have selected the lookup array and
lastly the match type is it you're
looking for less than or is it you're
looking for exact match or is it greater
than match so for now I want exact match
so I will be selecting the exact match
that is
zero now there you go you have the exact
index of the element that is five now we
have selected all the 10 teams starting
from it1 admin 2 testing three
development 4 marketing five so that's
how you find the index of a selected
element in
Excel now we just have like 10 elements
so we have got the uh writing of the
elements or you know uh choosing the
elements in a easy way but what if if
you had like 100 elements right could be
a little different okay so let me put it
simple now you wanted to find the index
value of Finance so right now we have
marketing and you wanted to type in
finance and you missed out a letter
A okay
now you're not finding the right
index to avoid such problems you can
always take the help of data validation
in Excel that is using the list in data
validation in Excel you can see a small
drop- down icon here right you can
choose that and here you can see all the
themes that we have created in the left
column right so here I can scroll down
and choose the finance and there you go
I have the index value okay again we
need to copy paste the same match
function in Excel over
here equals to
match look up
value look up
array and exact
match so there you go that's how you
make use of data validation in Excel and
using the list you can comprehend all
the list elements in this particular
column into the list of data validation
and you can choose the team whichever
you want to find the index for so this
is how you can make use of match
function in Excel or index match
function in Excel to sort data in Excel
so on my spreadsheet you can see some
employee data and on the column f and g
you can see employee date of birth and
employee dat of joining for example you
wanted to sort the employee data in the
form of earliest joining employee and
the latest joining employee right that
is who is the employee who joined first
to this company and who is the employee
who joined last to this company so for
that you just need to select the column
of date so let's select both the columns
and go to home and check or verify if
the data type is date or not so
generally the data type will be set to
General by default by Excel so we need
to make sure that we have the proper
data type which is state now that we
have the proper data type select the
entire column and go to the data option
and here select the sort option and in
the sort option select the expand
selection click on sort and here sort by
employee date of joining and oldest to
newest that's what we wanted the oldest
employee or the you can also set it to
the newest employe to oldest according
to your requirement but we'll go to
oldest to newest according to the case
study right now just click on okay and
that should be done so Emily who a
manager is the oldest employee who
joined the company and Chris who is a
trainee in it support is the latest
employee who joined the company now
that's how you sort date in now on my
screen you can see the sales of four
quarters from different regions that is
east west south north and Central now
you might want to calculate the sum of
sales happened from old the regions in
q1 or you might want to calculate the
sum of sales happened in one region of
all the four quarters that is either you
want to calculate the sum of all the
regions from quarter 1 or you might want
to calculate the sum of all the quarters
in one region right so to do this you
have some simple functions in Excel so
you might say me you have some function
Etc right for that you might want to go
into the you know equal to mode and
fetch some option and subtotal or some
you have to select the function from
here but what if I tell you that there
is one simple easy shortcut where you
just have to make one single click and
you'll have all the sum right so that
seems interesting so on the top in the
home bar select home and in on the top
right corner you have the editing group
in editing group you have aggregation
function that is summation so you have
different aggregations here some average
count numbers Max maximum minimum more
functions here you might want to select
the sum and you can get all the
sumission numbers here so I'll select
one cell so the second query where we
wanted to calculate the sum of all the
sales happened in each region with all
the quarters included that is this one
C2 to F2 right so let us select G2 and
select the auto sum option and here it
will automatically select the r for you
that is C2 to F2 if you want to change
it can also you know change it like
minimize the number if you just wanted
to calculate the sum of three quarters
you can do that so now we want four
quarters so select enter and there you
go you have all the sales of all the
four quarters of east region now if you
simply drag it you will have the sum of
all the four quarters of all different
regions now let us calculate the
summation of Q one of all the regions
that is this one Select Auto Sun and it
will automatically select all the cells
for
you that is from C2 to C6 right press
enter and you'll have the summation
similarly you can you know drag it and
you have the numbers here of all the Q2
sales of all the regions Q3 sales of all
region and Q4 sales of all region now
let us try to change the color that you
can can have a reference that is it's
different it's it's a total sum or right
you just have a reference to identify
it now similarly to this one as
well so that's how you implement Auto
sum in Excel now we are on the Excel
spreadsheet so you can see that I have
five different sheets of the same data
so why do we have that so I'll be
explaining you how to sort data for
multiple parameters so firstly we will
try to sort data in the form of numbers
right so let us imagine that this data
is being shared with you by your manager
and he wants you to sort this data based
on the salary numbers so he wants you to
arrange the data in the form of
ascending order or descending order
maybe which will help him find the
employee with the highest salary right
so how could you do that so it's really
simple you could sort the entire data
just within a few clicks so how would
you do that so since you're focusing on
salary select any sell from the salary
column only right select this particular
column and select any cell in the salary
column get into the sort and filter
options and here select this sort of
arrangement you need that is largest to
smallest or the smallest to largest
since the problem statement was to find
the highest salary click on largest to
smallest and there you go
so you have Tony and the designation is
senior and he works in it support and he
draws the highest salary of
80,000 right and there's also another
one which is Peppa and she works for the
analytics team and now the next sheet
let's get into the sheet two and this
time let us imagine that you wanted to
you know uh arrange or sort the data
based on the employee date of joining or
date of birth right again if you wanted
to arrange the data in which you find
the youngest employee or the oldest
employee of the organization you can do
that click on any cell in the date of
birth column and go back to the sort and
filter and here you will be seeing the
options sort oldest to the newest or the
sort the data from newest to the oldest
so since we want the oldest employee
select oldest to newest and there you go
so the oldest employee is Alfred who is
an associate designation employee and he
works in the admin department and he's
drawing the salary of
25,000 so that's how you can sort the
data when you are trying to sort the
data based on date wise so first we try
to sort the data on the number wise so
you can apply the same for your employ
ID salary and if there is any
possibility you can do that as well and
if you want to apply the same sorting
based on dates you can do that as well
using the Sorting function in the same
way now let's get back onto the third
sheet and here
now uh single column wise is perfectly
fine there is no issues with that now
you want it to you know uh let us
imagine that you have two columns okay
let's eliminate a few columns here
maybe we can eliminate the employee ID
and uh okay let's keep a few columns so
we'll just keep employee name and
employee salary okay so here we are
trying to demonstrate if you are uh
trying to sort the data using one cell
in the column B will it mainous
relationship with the cell a okay uh
that's our query right so let's see I'll
go a little detail so let us imagine
that you wanted to sort this data based
on highest salary okay so when you do
that will it also impact the cells in
the column A so it will basically impact
but just uh it's a query right right any
of you viewers might have that query
will I uh if in case if I try to sort
the data based on this will it affect
the sales on the rest of the data set
okay so in basically it will impact so
I'll try to you know sort the data based
on ascending
order so this is the smallest to largest
and you can see uh the Tony and Peppa so
since I selected this cell in the column
B it also impacted the change on the
cells of column A so that's how the
Sorting works now we'll get to a little
Advanced um sorting techniques so here
we try to I mean already we try to sort
the data based on numbers based on
alphabets based on U you know uh date
date of birth right so I think we forgot
the uh ascending or you know sorting
based on alphabets let's do that as well
select any um cell in the column A and
go to certain filter try selecting a to
z or okay let's try to Z to A okay so
here you can see the U names have been
sorted based on the descending order
from Zed to a right so so far we tried
on alphabets so far we tried on numbers
date of birth and a couple of more
things so let's dig a little deeper and
try to sort based on colors right so for
that you don't uh you know find that uh
extra setting here in the regular
sortant filter so you might want to get
into the data option and here you'll
find another sort function which is a
little Advanced so that's how you do it
so since we have colored in the cell or
column of salary select that salary and
we're going with cell value so in the
cell values section select the cell
color and here on the cell color options
you'll have green blue and yellow that's
what we have used in our um cells so
let's keep Green in the first position
which is on top and press okay now
you'll see green me sorted to the first
position now yellow and blue are left
out so why is that so because you didn't
provide it right so you can do what that
as well uh mean you can always add uh
the setting to
it right select any cell go to sort and
add a level and then again select the
salary and sell values to sell colors
and now the cell color in the second
position would be blue and that will be
on bottom and I can add another level
the same
salary the cell values will be cell
color and uh cell yellow will be
somewhere in between or bottom okay so
based on hierarchy uh it will be
selecting press
okay and there you go so you have cell
yellow and blue at the bottom and green
at the top position as for your
suggestions now we are on the last sheet
so here in this last sheet we are going
to you know um dig a little deeper into
the advanced sorting methods so
previously we tried to apply the
advanced sting methods for colors now
we'll try to apply the advanced sorting
methods based on the data set we have
here I mean the data we have in our data
set right so select the sort option and
let's add a few details right so firstly
let's sort the column employee ID okay
so let's have the smallest to largest or
yeah now that would be good now let's
add another level where we will
sort okay uh I think we will sort based
on employee name that would be a little
better so let's try to uh sort it on
employe name here and here will be
employee salary okay now the cell values
and this would be from a to zed and the
salaries will be from smallest to
largest so basically what we are trying
to do is we are trying to sort the
employee list based on employee names
from a to zed so the employees name
starting from a to zed will be ordered
first and another subset of the Sorting
will be done based on highest salaries
that is smallest to highest so let us
imagine that we have three employees
with Nam starting from a and their
salaries are 10,000 20,000 and 30,000 so
how would it sort so it will sort
basically uh in the alphabetical order
first so first three names will be
sorted and then it will also have
another condition to sort the data with
keeping the lowest salary on top and
highest salary in the last right so uh
this is how the algorithm works for
sorting now let's press okay and see the
output so there you go the names are
Alfred and we have the highest salary
here smallest to highest so this is
25,000 next we have Banner Barns and Ben
so here you might be seeing why we have
been in the third position despite he
has a low salary and name starts with B
right so here it is trying to work based
on the alphabets in the order right so B
A and B E it's not just comparing the
first letter it's also comparing the
following letters as well right so n
comes first R comes later so B is pushed
to the second position a comes first and
E comes later so B A letters are pushed
to the first position and Ben is pushed
to the third position so that's how it
works right so accordingly the set for
BA is created here 3540 next Ben well
and next you have Bobby Brian Brock
Chris Clark right so that's how the data
has been organized and sorted based on
multiple levels of parameters you
provide for sorting so that's how you
use sorting in Excel slicers and filters
in Excel so slicers in Excel are
software filters used along with Excel
tables or Excel pivot tables over a
large amount of data not just filtering
out data but slices also help you with
an easy understanding of the information
being extracted and displayed on the
screen now Microsoft Excel slices are
compatible with Windows and Mac and to
operating systems now let us understand
how to implement slicers in Excel so for
that we might want to get back to to the
Practical mode that is starting our
Microsoft
Excel now we are on our Excel sheet and
as you can see on my screen there is
some data available on the Excel
spreadsheet and this table is not just
any table this table from Microsoft
Excel is been converted into an actual
table as you know by default Excel
considers all the data which has been
inserted into the spreadsheet as a
database and to implement this license
in Excel we might want to create or
convert the format of database into a
normal table for that you can select all
your data and just press contrl T and
that will allow you an option called
convert the data into table now since
this table is already converted as a
table we can directly start implementing
or inserting slices into the
spreadsheet now for that select all your
data
then going to the insert
option and in the insert ribbon you can
see the filters group and in the filters
group select the option called slicer
now you will be provided with multiple
options since we have the columns
employee ID employee name Zone
designation Department salary employees
date of birth and employees state of
joining so we can choose any of the
options available according to our
columns and create the slices now let me
select the first one that is Zone next
designation department and let's also
select employee
name now press okay and there you go we
have our
slices now let us try to rearrange these
slices all you can do is just select and
drag them up
and done now let us imagine that we want
to see or take a look at the employees
who are working in the EAS Zone then we
have all the information displayed on
the screen who are working in the East
Zone they are Jack Tony bner Fred Etc
and their Department designation etc etc
all on one single screen so this really
helps you while you're presenting your
data in a presentation now for a change
let's try to select the department now
if your client wants to select the data
from only analytics Department then you
might want to select on the analytics
key on the department slicer and there
you go you have an employee called luk
hops who works in the East Zone and his
department is analytics and his
designation is contract based and the
salary he is getting is 65,000
th000 now
similarly uh you can see that we have
only selected analytics and your client
also wants data from it support now you
can see that analytics is gone but what
if you want both analytics and it
support then you have an option called
select multiple then you can select
analytics and it support and if you want
HR you can also do that and in the zone
if you want West along with East then
you can do the same east and west and
you have all the employee details and in
the designation let's try to select U
senior
trainy okay select multiple senior
traine and manager so that's how you do
it so that's how it's done and that's
how you implement slicers in Excel to
simplify the filtering options using
slicers during a presentation it is
really simple to add filters in Excel so
we are on a practical mode right now so
on my screen you can see an Excel
spreadsheet of sales data so here you
have various columns regions category
state subcategory sales quantity and
much more right so now let us imagine
that we want to add filters on the
region part so we have south west east
Etc right so we want to you know let us
imagine that you want to extract the
data of only west region and you wanted
a filter so doing it manually could take
a lot of time so using filters will be
helpful now select one cell on the
headers part and select s the filter
option in the data toolbar you can see
the data option on the toolbar right so
click on the data option and navigate to
sort and filter uh group and in that
select the option of filter now you can
see the filters are been added to all
the column headers region category state
subcategory sales quantity right now we
wanted the West category so when you see
or when you click on the drop- down icon
you can see all the options are selected
right the Central east west south every
everything right but now we just want
West one so click on West and select
okay there you go so you have everything
from the west region now let's imagine
that you wanted to look into uh office
supplies only or technology only right
you can do the same with the technology
and press okay and now you'll have all
the technology related sales in the west
region right so that's how you use
filters in Excel or that's how you add
filters in Excel yes goal s in Excel so
for this tutorial we'll be considering
the students database now let's get back
to the Excel so now we are on the Excel
sheet and you can see that in this
particular Excel sheet we have some
student details we have the serial
numbers names role numbers class blood
group and some subjects like math
science computer statistics social GK
and the final marks obtain percentage
and total marks right so let us imagine
that uh a company has come for for an
interview so all these students are
going to attend an interview and uh the
minimum percentage to attend the
interview will be like
75% so you can see that we have 75 here
and all the students have got above 75
except for the one student which is Mike
right so for Mike to attend the
interview he needs 75 percentage or
above so uh he can make some
modifications in one of these subjects
right so there is always an exam after
the exam called as Improvement exam so
if you can like to score some extra
marks in the subjects which you have
scored less so that you can make up to
the percentage what you're expecting you
can do that so here in this particular
sheet uh Mike has six subjects right and
in six subjects you can see he has
scored 76 91 45 71 94 and 62 so out of
these he have scored Less in one subject
compared to all the subjects one subject
is really low that is computers so what
if he can give an improvement exam and
increase his percentage to 75 right so
that can be done so we can do some root
Force methods like we can change the
marks like 55 and then check this
particular one so it's getting 74 right
so using the brute force method will be
a little bit lengthy so you can do this
because it is just a small uh table
which has least number of data and you
just have one single cell to modify so
that can be done in small tables but
what if you had some table with hundreds
of rows or thousands of rows that will
be time consuming right so for that we
have some inbuilt functionality in Excel
that is called goal seek in Excel so for
now let's eliminate the marks
here so we have eliminated the marks and
the upgraded percentage is 65 now we
need the target as
75 okay so let's uh write it
as Mike's Target right we need mik so
Mike's new Target
as
[Music]
75 okay now to make sure that we need a
Mark here which can get mic to 75
percentage we will use the data
operation so here on the toolbar which
has file home insert Etc we have one
other option called as data so when you
click on data from toolbar you'll have
this ribbon and in this ribbon we have
various options so when you come into
forecast group we have an option called
wtif analysis when you click on wtif
analysis you'll have a set of options
out of which we have goal seek now for
goal seek we need to select a table cell
that is this particular table cell that
is
M9 so we need the value 75 here right so
what is the cell that you need to change
here for that you need to select this
one and select this particular cell here
right and now you can select okay now
you can see that Excel has automatically
run all the permutations and
combinations and has come up with a
number so that the overall percentage of
mic will be 75% right so the expected
marks that Mike should be getting in his
computer's Improvement exam should be
equal to 56 or greater than 56 to get
the final Target at 75 so that he can
attend the company's interview so this
is how we use goal set or goal seek in
Excel we are on our Excel spreadsheet
and here you can see I'm trying to
create an calendar for the employees in
the company where you might have to you
know write down the day and month and
year or week of your birth date or maybe
your joining date or maybe also your
last working day right this might be
useful for all the employees to you know
uh avoid them from writing it down
manually so how do I create it so it
takes a few simple steps all it takes is
some data validation methods and also
there is an exclusive video specifically
made on data validation in Excel link to
which is in the description box below or
you can search it on our official
YouTube channel now you can see that uh
the word calendar is on the first cell
that is A1 but we have four cells below
it that is A3 B3 C3 and D3 so you might
want to add this to all the cells right
like may be in the middle so for that
you can do the option of margin Center
also there is a tutorial on Virgin
Center about all the options available
in this particular thing so you can go
through that also and uh here we have
done the first step now all we need is
day month year and week so in a calendar
or in a month you'll have days from 28
29 30 or 31 days right so let's create a
list or the drop down menu for that so
that whenever you click it right so
whenever you click on that particular
cell you will have the list of all the
days available right so let's get
started with that let's create a new
sheet so why are we creating a new sheet
you won't want that all the numbers in
your calendar sheet right over here
right so with that so we are creating a
new sheet and all the data will be
available here so here let's write down
the days first and here the second
number also you can use the option of
Flash Fill so that you can you know uh
reduce the effort here so you can see
the Flash Fill option over here all you
need to do is select the sales and drag
them down until you get your required
dates right so let's keep it till 31
days there you go you have the days so
these will be your days and here now the
next option was month right yeah month
and year now using the same flash F
option you will you know add the months
into your sheet so this will be
Sunday so Excel has this smart flash F
option where you can just drag the data
and everything will be filled according
to your requirements so Sunday to
Saturday now the next one right that is
your
month so same as the before process
we'll create
January you can use the flash Bill
option and all the way up to December
now the last one was the
year so
1990 and
1991 you can select the cells and Flash
Fill Up to
2022 Maybe
yeah 2022 should be good enough now this
is the flashfill option you have here
and also we have an exclusive tutorial
on flashfill Al together you can go
through it for a detailed explanation as
well now coming back to the original
sheet so this is where you create your
drop- down list right so select the cell
where you want to add the drop down list
navigate to data and then here is your
data validation menu so we have a
variety of data validation options over
here there is an exclusive tutorial on
that you can go through it for now we'll
look into the list option only because
we want to create a drop down list right
so here it will ask for Source click on
the source here the source bar right now
navigate to sheet number two where we
have the days options select the
range so this will be your range and
select okay also you can add some
message here right what you can do is uh
in case if there is an error or
something right you don't want that to
be happening so all you need to do is uh
write down is Select from drop
down select from drop down only
so this could be a message select from
drop down only the title is Select
options or just
options in case if there's an error you
can write down your title as invalid
data and you can write on a messages
please select
from drop down
only so um in case of someone tries to
write as 32 or 33 to check the Integrity
of your data validation then they will
encounter an error and an error message
and then they must be understanding what
exactly they try to do and if it's
correct or wrong right so this is to
make sure that whatever the data you
enter is correct and valid so okay and
here you can see select from the drown
list only options with with option list
as title and let's try to enter 32 right
and when you press enter you will see an
error so the error messages invalid data
please try to select from dropdown only
so you can go for a retry and select the
drop down
right so let's eliminate them and now
select something from the drop down so
let's take it
as maybe 10 right so this is how you
cleared the day one now let's try to do
with the month same data validation
option settings will be list and Source
will
be this one
think I made a mistake here so let's
cancel this and go back to sheet 2 and
rename this as our week yeah now coming
back to the month
again it will be a
list and the source will be in sheet to
navigate to the sheet 2 and select your
range and input message the same
options select from dropdown
only and error alert title will be
invalid
data this one will be please
L from drop
down
only it's okay and that's done now let's
continue with here as well let's quickly
do the
same for
it will be a list Source will be in
sheet
2 this is your list press okay and
lastly the week same process it will be
a list Source will be in your sheet
two the input message
options thatle invalid
data drop down
only right so your drop down list is
ready now so the month will be anything
so we have me and yeah can be anything
anywhere so let's take it as
997 and week can be you know the
adjacent week so what was 10th of May
1997 let's check our calendars
was a
Saturday so it was a Saturday and that's
how you create drop down list in Excel
and if you want you can also add borders
to your calendar right so that's how
it's
done so what is data validation in Excel
so it is a feature by Microsoft Excel
where it can restrict data entry into
certain cells by using data validation
and it will prompt the users to enter
valid data in the cells based on the
rules and restrictions provided by the
creator of that particular sheet now
this would be a little confusing to
understand so to understand it in a much
better way let's get back to the
practical way where we will start
entering some data validation rules to
our Excel sheet and try to enter data
into it now we are on the Microsoft
Excel and this particular sheet is based
on employee ID employee name employee
Department employee salary fiscal year
and work timings of the
employees now we will be applying some
data validation rules to each and every
column and try to enter data based on
the rules we have entered now for the
first one which is the employee ID we'll
enter rules based on the employ ID
number so to apply the data validation
you need to go into the data tab on the
toolbar and inside the ribbon you can
see data tools group and in the data
tools group you have the option of data
validation now select the entire column
go to the data tools group select data
validation option and you will have this
particular popup menu and here you can
see different types of options so since
we are entering employee ID it would be
a whole number so let us select whole
number option
and now here you can see the option of
between not equal to equal to not
between greater than less than
Etc so let us select between and let us
assume that your employee ID has five
numbers and uh it should be between
10,000 to
11,000 so let us provide
10,000 and 11,000
now select okay and now the new rule has
been
applied so now the minimum value of each
and every employee ID should be equal to
or more than 10,000 and less than 11,000
and it should have five digits now let's
try to enter a wrong employee ID that is
just one there you go you can see that
Microsoft Excel is not allowing you to
include a wrong number it says this
value does not match the data validation
restrictions defined for this cell so
now you can press retry and try to enter
some number which is in between 10,000
to
11,000 now it is
10,901 and this will take the
entry now let us assume that because I'm
the creator of the I know what
should be entered here but what if I
give this sheet to you and you are the
person who is trying to enter the number
and it shows the error and you don't
know what was the error right to avoid
this kind of confusion what you can do
is you can do some uh ways where you can
provide the message to the user so that
can be done by okay let's select the
sheet again and go to the data
validation and here you have the same
settings now here you have another
option saying input message so before
input message let us go to error alert
now
here the error title would be data
entered is not
valid please enter this is the error
message please
enter
EMP ID
between
10,000 to
11,000 press okay now when you try to
enter the wrong number it will show that
particular error alert
message see data entered is not valid
please enter employee ID between 10,000
to 11,000 now this is fine but how long
this will be you know what if there is
an option where you just hover over to
this cell and it automatically tells you
to enter the value between 10,000 to
11,000 without having to face the error
yeah even that can be done so you can
select the entire column go to data
validation and here this is the input
message this is where you can do that so
here you can write the message name
valid
data please enter
data
between 10,000 to 11,000 now when you
hover over to any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
show you this message where you can
avoid all the errors just select okay
see when you select any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
tell you please enter data between
10,000 to 11,000 so here you don't have
to face any errors right now let us try
to enter the valid data
1
9
02 and it will take it as the correct
value and again 1
903 now in case if you try to provide
the wrong number it will show the
error
see so that's how it is now we have
finished the whole number part now let's
get into the employee name where we have
to provide
uh the second type that is text length
now let us imagine that uh in your
company you're trying to provide ID
cards to your employees and you know
that ID card is really small and inside
that ID card you need to include the
employee photograph and your company
name employee ID blood group phone
number address everything and also you
need to include the name of the employee
so what if there is an employee with
very lengthy name like 30 characters 40
characters yeah in India it is really
possible that you might have a lengthy
name so what you can do is you can
provide the text length where the text
is limited to like 15 or uh 20 uh um
characters so you can include that name
in the ID card so you can do that by
allowing the data validation criteria
with text length uh minimum can be
anything so minimum can be one and
maximum here you can provide 15
and press okay okay minimum we'll change
it to at least uh
two and yeah let it be one so minimum is
one and maximum is 15 characters and
press okay and uh let us also provide
the input
message
enter character type character
data please enter valid name
and error
alert invalid
data please enter valid
data okay please enter
characters less than
50 press okay
now let us try to enter a random name
okay uh we'll enter characters more than
15 here
qu
z uh yeah it's like 1 2 3 4 5
11 okay now this is more than
15 okay I think it's not more than 15
let's try to enter a little bit more
characters yeah
now we have entered more than 15
characters and it is showing please
enter characters less than 15 so now we
can retry and try to enter some valid
name
um now we have characters less than 50
so it will take as the proper name now
let us try to enter another name
I'm just entering some random
data so another name
maybe great now the next type of data
validation is also done now let us get
into employee Department employee
department is something really superb so
I'll tell you about it it's actually a
list now let us finish the other ones
first that is employee salary physical
year and work timings after that we'll
learn about uh the list one now let's
come into employee salary so salary is
something where you have to include
decimal points so now let us go to uh
data validation and inside the values we
have already dealt with whole
number uh text
length yeah now we'll uh deal with
employee salary that is decimal now
minimum is okay what is uh minimum can
be one
0 and the maximum can
be 1
lakh or let us put that as 10
lakhs press okay okay not not just then
enter
valid salary
okay now let's change it to minimum as
10,000 so the employee minimum salary
will be 10,000 and input enter valid
salary
enter
salary
between
10,000 to 10 lakhs
let us include a comma here
too now error
alert invalid
salary please
enter between
10,000 to 10
lakhs press okay now the message and
data validation conditions are applied
to this column now let us try to enter
some invalid data first it will show the
error now we need to enter the valid
data yeah now it is taking the valid
data let us provide 20,000
and this has
35,000 now the next one is fiscal let us
imagine that we wanted to you know work
on the employees for current working
year that is 2020 to
2021 and or you can consider 2021 to
2022 not more than 2021 and not less
than 2021 for that you can provide the
year option as well so for that you need
to select the entire column go to data
validation settings and inside here you
have an option of date so uh let us
provide the date option as between and
start date is
01/01 SL
2021 and end date is 01
sl01
SL
2022 and input
message let us provide data as current
fiscal
year Current financial
year enter
date
between 2021 to
2022 let us copy this and go to error
alert error message will be S
invalid
date select okay now the error message
and uh the data input message and the
data validation rule has been applied
for this column so let's try to enter
some date here you can enter uh 02 of
February
2021 it will take as the correct data
now let's try to enter some wrong data
which is apart from 2022 02
02 20 22 it will not take this it will
throw error
so that's how it works now let us try to
enter as
2021 and this is March it will take it
now another
data 04 this time and
2021 so that's how your uh date data
validation will work now coming into the
next type of data validation that is
time so we have time here let us imagine
that you are providing some work time to
your employees that should be from 9:00
a.m. to 5:00 p.m. not more than that so
you want to keep your work life balance
for all your employees so you just want
them to work between 9 to 5 and that
should be fine and anything apart from
that time should be invalid so you can
do that by selecting uh time option
between it should be in between and the
start time will be
09 0 0 and this should be
uh
17 that is 5:00 p.m. in the
evening and input
message please
enter time
between 9
a.m.
to okay
5
p.m. this should be the input message
now error
alert invalid
time error message okay
now okay work timings now this should be
okay we can do this as two columns
actually let us
cancel let us copy this and paste it
here
you can do it as
login login timing and this should be
okay this should be log
out so this should
be okay so this will be considered as
login and log out times now let us
provide the login time this should be
the right time and uh let's try to
provide wrong timings 08 now it will not
take it it will throw as error so it's
working fine let us provide 10 now let
us provide the log out time it should be
below 5:00 p.m so let us provide five it
will take
it
okay let's try to provide something just
1 minute less than five
that is
59 okay there is some problem in this
let's check
it okay it is taking uh three that is
including
seconds okay let's provide seconds as
well
05 0 0 0
0 okay still there is some
problem okay we have entered four we
should we are supposed to enter 24hour
timing right
14 okay uh it should be 17 I think this
will work yeah now we are following
24hour timing here so let's provide
another timing that is
16 30 0 0 this will be valid and
1530 yes this is also valid now we have
finished almost all types of uh data
validation things that is we have
finished with any value number decimal
date timing test length and the last one
is list so this is where things get
interesting now let's cancel this now
select the employee column now if you're
running a company then definitely you'll
not have only one Department in it you
might have multiple departments right so
let us consider that you have a software
development company so in that the basic
departments will be software development
team and software testing team so what
you can do is you can provide a list
list so using that list you can just uh
H over to that cell select the drop-
down menu and inside that you can select
the option so we will try to work
something like that if we have selected
the entire
column selection
here yeah let us select the entire
column again go to data validation the
selection contains some sales without
data validation settings do you want to
extend data validation to the sales yes
now let us provide the list
option
[Music]
and here Source you can provide
as
developer and
tester press okay
okay now input message select one
select
one error
alert
invalid
data select from
dropdown
only press okay now when you select the
cell you can see small drop- down icon
right so when you press it you will have
developer and tester option
so you can select developer for first
one and for second one you can select uh
tester right okay this is good for uh
one or two options maybe three or even
maybe like five but what if you have
more departments okay let's go to this
uh second sheet where we have the
department data so here we have like 14
departments no 15 departments or 15
employee type names so the first one is
CE second is developer tester quality
analyst system analyst Finance human
resource so so many options are there so
you cannot keep on typing all of them
right so here it is 15 what if you have
like 25 like 50 departments right it
will be tough so for this you have
another option so let me select all this
data and copy this from this sheet to
our employee
sheet let us paste it
somewhere here let's expand this
okay now we have our uh list over here
now let us remove the data validation
from this
column clear all okay now everything is
cleared let's select okay now let us
erase this data as
well now let us apply the list data
validation again from scratch go to
list now here we can select the source
select this particular
cell and drag it until here and it has
been
loaded now go to input
message data
options select
one from the menu or the drop-down
copy error
alert select only from the drop down
menu invalid entry yeah now let's select
okay fine now you have the icon here you
have all the provided
options you can scroll down and select
any one out of these you can select
knowledge transfer for the first one and
second one would be system and list and
the last one would
be human
resources now in the list everything is
fine okay this is showing you the menu
options and everything so but what if
you provide this sheet to your new joiny
or new employee in your company and by
mistake he messes up something like
deleting this okay so we have deleted
systems analyist and when when you click
on the options here you don't have
systems analyist in that place you have
blank space right so there is a way
where all your uh you know data can be
messed up so to avoid this what you can
do is you can actually uh save this data
in a different sheet like I did here
like Department data you can hide this
sheet or you can protect this sheet with
password or something so that nobody can
mess this up so now let us get back to
the employe data and select this column
and uh clear everything press okay and
let us also clear
this and this as well this one too now
let us eliminate the rows or
cells the employee yeah
everything okay now we have basically
not this data from here now let us try
to apply the data validation once
again now here let us select as
list and
uh here let us provide the option let us
go to next sheet let us select all these
options and press okay okay let's
provide input message
data
options or Department options
yeah now let's select
okay now let's hide this sheet now the
sheet has been hidden and you still have
the
options
developer or let us provide
CEO then we have
developer then we
have
test so that's how you can protect your
how to protect and lock cells in Excel
now why do we need to lock or protect
cells in Excel let us imagine that there
is an Excel sheet with really
confidential data and you need to pass
that data to your subordinate or your
colleague to make some minor edits now
let us imagine that the edits are
supposed to be done to only one or two
columns and the rest of the The Columns
should be left as they are now there is
a huge possibility that sometimes
unknowingly or unwillingly they might be
some edits done by your colleague or
your subordinate So to avoid such kind
of unexpected mistakes you might want to
protect and lock your Sal that you don't
want your subordinate or your colleague
to edit so before we begin be kind
enough to get subscribed to our YouTube
channel and don't forget to hit that
Bell icon to stay updated on the latest
it Trends and Tech
content now without further Ado let's
get started with our onepoint agenda
that is lock or protect cells in Excel
now let's get back into the Practical
mode and start our Microsoft Excel now
we are on the Microsoft Excel and this
particular spreadsheet is related to
employ
details yeah now the screen is visible a
bit better now let us imagine that this
is our confidential data and you want to
edit only two columns that is the
designation column and phone number
column now let us imagine that the
company has finished one annual year and
now there are some promotions happening
in the company and let us also imagine
that the phone numbers of the employees
provided by the company have undergone
some changes so now the minor edits that
you want to make are related to the
designation column and phone number
column now you can see that all the
columns that is the blood group new
salary salary hike current salary and
name of the employee serial number
employee number everything is editable
so in such kind of scenarios when you
pass on this data there might be a
possibility where your colleague or
subordinate might end up making some
mistakes right so you want to avoid that
so you can do that by locking the cells
now let us rename the
sheet now the sheet has been renamed
successfully so now you can log the CES
by the following process
so in this process you have two major
steps first one is to log the cells and
the next one is to protect the cells by
a password now when you select all the
cells in this particular sheet you can
just click on this edge here and you
have all the cells selected and now
right click somewhere on the sheet and
you can see an option called format
sales so in this particular option you
have some options provided which is
number alignment font and you want to go
into the protection part so you can see
by default Excel keeps all the cells
locked now we want the phone number and
designation to be unlocked okay so let's
cancel it for now and get back to the
sheet and select the columns D and I and
now let's right click and go into format
cells and in the protection option make
sure that you uncheck the locked icon
now select okay and
now okay so you cannot include the merg
the cell fine we have a cell here which
is merged okay let's remove
that okay now again select the entire
column right click get into format cells
and uncheck the lock option select
okay now we have finished fin the first
part that is locking all the cells which
you don't want to get edit and unlocking
the cells where you want to make some
edits now the second stage is protecting
the sheet now right click on the sheet
name and you can see an option called
protect sheet click that and now here
you can see select locked Cs and also
select unlocked CS so let us provide a
password here so let us use some simple
password so that we don't forget that so
I'll be selecting 1 2 3 and now select
okay reenter the password to proceed now
let us type 1 2 3 again now select okay
and now the sheet is
protected now we have successfully loged
and protected all the cells in Excel now
let us verify that the cells you wanted
to protect are really protected and
locked or not so we have unlocked phone
number and designation and everything
else is locked now let me try and edit
the BL group so when I double click or
try to edit this particular sheet then
I'll be receiving a warning from Excel
it says the cell or chart you're trying
to change is on a protected sheet to
make a change unprotect the sheet you
might be requested to enter a
password so it says that this particular
cell is locked and you cannot edit it
now let us try to edit the phone numbers
which we kept as unlocked so you can see
I can really edit the unlocked cell here
now let me try to change this phone
number let me enter some random phone
number so you can see the cell is
editable now let us go through the
designation column and try to edit this
particular column now since I said that
there's a promotion happening in the
company so the deputy CEO is now the
current CEO of the company and software
developer happens to become the senior
software developer and the tester as
well let us imagine that he will become
the
senior and so on okay so this proves
that this particular sheet is editable
not the entire sheet but only the cense
that we kept in the unlock
mode okay
now this is how you lock and protect
your sales in X now you can see that I
have sales data on my worksheet so uh
let us imagine that your manager asked
you to find the average of sales
happening in your company right so let's
navigate to the bottommost cell and you
know write it down as average
here okay average
sales so here this is a cell where you
want to keep your average right so here
we'll be writing a small formula that is
average and tab to select it now you
must select the array of data
right so this is my array since average
is an array function and now press enter
so there you go you have the average
sales data that happened in your
company so to understand the page setup
in msxl we will go through a demo
inventory in Excel where we'll be
considering some restaurant data now
without any delay let's get started with
the Practical demo now we are on the
Excel sheet and this is the data I was
talking about the restaurant data where
we have the First Column that is Rank
and next we have the restaurant name
followed by that we have the sales
happening through that restaurant and
then we have the segment category that
is what kind of service does that
particular restaurant offers now this is
the list what we made and uh what if I
wanted to represent this data in the
form of a printed paper right so I guess
you can see all the columns and rows
here so you can see that we have almost
like 250 rows so there is no chance or
there is no way to print all those 250
rows in one page of course it is
practically possible but when you try to
read the content it'll be so tough to
read Because all the rows will be clued
together so close so that you cannot
read it so uh you need to print them
Page by page so and you need to also
take care of the data is aligned
properly according to the page size
everything and even you need to take
care of the margins of your page right
so that's what page data basically means
so we had a detailed overview of our
data and what actually we're trying to
make now let us see how page setup is
possible in msxl so to go to the page
setup menu menu or go to the page setup
options we have three methods let's
start with the simplest method so the
simplest method is by just clicking on
file and go to print
option and you'll see all the page setup
options right over here and you can also
go to print menu by pressing a shortcut
method that is control P so you'll
directly end up on the page setup
options now let's look at the second
method so the second method is you can
see the toolbar over here right which
has file home insert draw page layout
formulas data review View and help so
the second method we can use page layout
option from the toolbar and you can see
when you click on the page option from
the toolbar you have a new ribbon over
here so this ribbon is all about page
setup options so it will offer you you
margins it will offer you orientation
size print area brakes background print
tiles etc etc right so all these options
or menus in this ribbon belong to page
setup now let us look at the third
method so the third method is something
similar you have view option on the
toolbar so just select View and you can
see we have few page setup options over
here as well the normal page break page
layout custom views and we have grid
lines formula bar heading zoom in zoom
out select to zoom free certain panes
right so all these are also the page
setup options so we have the three
methods to enter the page setup options
now we are familiar with those now let's
get started with the Practical mode on
page setup for that let me use the
simplest method that is holding the
control key and pressing P which
navigates me to the print
option now we have various set of
options here we have no scaling normal
margins letter portrait orientation
collated print active sheets and note
one for Windows you can see this option
is the printers option for example if
you're connected to a printer which is
the hardware printer then your msxl will
show the printer's name here so other
than printer you can also make some
other arrangements where you can just
directly print your complete data in the
form of PDF and then you can export your
PDF to your recipent that's also
possible okay now let's get started with
the first option that is print active
pages okay to understand this better we
need to create a new sheet not a problem
so you can see that we just have one
sheet over
here so let us kind of select all the
items and create a new sheet and try to
paste it over here or let's try to paste
it over
here okay now let's try to extend
these yeah this should be fine now let's
rename this sheet sheet uh or let's
rename it as
restaurant sheet
two for our reference now let us get
back to the print sheet option so I'll
use the shortest method that is holding
the control key and press P now you can
see that here we have six pages in total
from the active sheets so the current
active sheet is the top 250 sheet so
this particular sheet is the current
active sheet so if we print the entire
data in this particular sheet then we
will end up printing six pages now let
us select the other option where you
have to print the entire workbook right
so now you can see that there's a change
in the number that is 12 pages so what
is a workbook so basically workbook is
the collection of entire sheets in your
Excel homepage so in this particular
Excel homepage you have the first sheet
that is top 250 and the second sheet
that is the resturant sheet two right so
the combination of these two sheets make
up a workbook
so when you select the entire workbook
option you'll have 12 pages so that's
how we use this setting where you select
the active sheets the entire workbook
and there is another option where you
can only print a selected item so if you
want to do this then let's get back here
now what if your customer or what if
your client wanted the top 10
restaurants only so you can select the
top 10 restaurants
by doing
this now you have the top 10 restaurants
let's go to
print so you can see Excel has
automatically selected the selection
only print the selected content only so
you can see we have only the top 10
restaurants or top 11 restaurants that
we have selected in our sheet and it is
ready to get printed so this is how we
use the first option now let's get back
let's not select that and let's make the
pages normal now get back to the print
option again now you can see the next
option that is
collated right so in colet you have
different different options that is 1 2
3 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 and the next one which
is uncollated 1 1 1 222 33 3 so why are
these numbers present here and what does
collected mean anyway so this is your
question right now the answer for this
question will be a little similar to
your examination Hall okay let us
imagine that you are an examination Hall
and you are the invigilator and you have
10 students in your room so you wanted
to provide question papers to all the 10
students okay so you have your question
paper distributed into three sheets that
is you have marked questions and your
questions are fit into three papers
right in this scenario we have 250 rows
and all the data is split into six
sheets that is sheet one or page one
page two page three page four right now
if we wanted to print 10 copies then the
arrangement of papers will be page 1
page two page three page 4 page five
page six in continuous order right that
is CED if you wanted 10 copies of
different different ways where you
wanted to print the first sheet first
then you wanted to print the second
sheet second and the third sheet third
that is you'll have 10 copies of first
page 10 copies of second page 10 copies
of third page and so on that particular
approach is called uncollated approach
and if you're printing the pages in
continuous order for 10 times then that
particular approach is called as
collated approach so this is what we had
to learn about cated and uncol now let's
get back to the third option now let's
press again print now we have our data
over
here there's something
wrong s all the elements control V yeah
now we have our data back now we have
the third option that is the portrait
orientation okay so when we click that
we have two options that is portrait and
landscape so you might be having a good
idea like when you try to click a
picture in your phone we have two modes
as well that is portray mode and the
landscape mode so when you click on the
portrait mode this is how your data will
be looking now to understand the
difference let's click the landscape
mode so when you click the landscape
mode this is how your data
representation will change you'll have a
wider page to print so this is why we
use the page orientation but now let's
keep the page orientation as portrait
orientation
and we have now the fourth option so
what is the fourth option we have
various sets of options in here that is
letter and A4 size there are also some
more page options over here where you
can select the page types you want to
print so basically you'll be having few
more options that is A4 A5 A3 Etc but
here we just have two that is A4 and
letter so basically you'll get those
options and followed by that next we
have margins so here you can see we
don't have any margins for our data okay
so now we can add some margins by
setting up this one as an option like
last custom setting or you can also
choose normal wide narrow right so your
page will be changed according to your
margin size
right so this is how you can change the
margins now let's keep it as default
let's set the normal
one now we have the next option that is
scaling
option so here you can see we are trying
to fit the page so when you're trying to
print these sheets using no scaling then
the actual size of the page will be
printed now you can also modify that you
can fit and print these sizes so you can
remember the first option that I said of
printing all the 250 rows in one single
sheet this is how you can fit it so fit
the sheet on one page where you can see
all the 250 rows are fit into one page
but the data is not readable so but we
don't want this type of an approach
right so let's keep it as the default
one which is no scaling so these are the
variety of options in print now if you
wanted to print the all the six pages
into the PDF format and mail it to your
client you can also do that I think I
have explained it in the first place so
you can see we can do it by just
selecting this option where you can
print all the six pages and into PDF
format and then you can mail them to
your
client and you can also select the
number of copies you want you can
increase the copies to two three and any
number of uh copies you want for now
I'll keep it as one
[Music]
copy now let's print
this now let us select
the
location rename it and publish
now let's get back to documents and see
if the page is printed or
not here you go here we have the restant
data in the form of
PDF so we have our entire six pages of
data in the PDF
format now we are back on the hom page
now we had some limited functions in the
print function over here we have tried
to export the data so you can also
export the data or try to print it from
the print option over here you can just
select that as well make a
f
PDF yes the pages are printed
now there you go we have the restaurant
2 PDF
[Music]
data so so that's how you can print all
your data you can either
choose the export option or you can
either choose print option now when you
see into the print option we have
limited number of page setup options
over here now let's check out what we
missed so we are in the pce layout here
so we had gone through the margins we
had set all the margins and then we have
also gone through the portrate and
Landscape now you can see this size when
we were in the print menu option we had
only A4 and letter but here you can see
there are a wide variety of options that
is other than letter we have tabloid
legal statement executive
A3 right we have A5 and many more other
options and if you want some more paper
options you can go to more and you can
always select few more options that's
how you do it and yeah we didn't had the
break option so remember when we had
been through the print option we did not
have the break option there let's select
this to nor A4 so you cannot see the
break option over here right so here we
have the break option so what does break
option does right you can actually break
the page uh remember we spoke about the
top 10 things or the top 10 rowes you
can always do that so you can just keep
the top 10 restaurants in your first
page and then break the remaining and to
set page brakes you can select the cell
now I need the top 10 so I'll select
this particular cell which is in the
11th
position and now I'll try to implement
the page break insert a page break and
now you can see on my sheet there is a
thin line which is separating the two
pages that's how you can see the
indication of a page break implemented
onto your page now how do you see it you
can see it by selecting control P where
you can see the first top 10 restaurants
being printed on your sheet so there you
go we have the first top 10 restaurants
printed on our sheets so that's how you
use the page print
now let's try to eliminate all the page
braks so you can select braks and reset
all page braks so the page break has
been
eliminated now you can always choose a
background for your data as well you
just uh if you want you can add a
picture to your background I think
that's not available for
now okay you can work offline as well
let us select this one
so you can see that we have added a
background to our
data we can select all the text files
and then we can change the color so that
the text becomes a little visible yeah
that's how you do it now if you don't
want the image to be added on your file
you can also remove that delete page
background and there you go all the
images are gone now the next important
part that is the print
titles now why do we need print titles
for that let's try to print this so now
you can see the first page in the first
page we have the title rank restaurant
sales segment category but if you go to
the second page you don't have that
title right you don't have the title
rank name of the restaurant sales and
their service category so if we want
that then we need to add titles now for
that let's select the print titles
option now let's select the rows to
repeat on top now for that we need the
first row select the first row and this
particular row will be repeating into
all the pages now let's try to print it
so yeah now you can see the titles are
being added to all the sheets you can
see the page two page three page four
page five and page six so you can see
the titles added to all the sheets now
we are on the spreadsheet so here what
exactly are page breaks so page breaks
are something which help you during your
trying to print your data or present
your data in the form of web page right
in those times you cannot fit your
entire Excel data in one spreadsheet or
one paper or one web page right so in
those scenarios Excel will try to
eliminate a few parts of your
spreadsheet or it will try to split the
spreadsheet so how exactly it looks like
so go to the view option and click on
The View and click on page break review
view here you can see the dotted lines
right so these are the things which
separate your data in form of pages so
that it can be printable on one single
page so some of the times the user or
the xuser manually inserts a page break
right so how do you insert it just go to
the page layout and here you can see the
page breaks insert a page break and you
have successfully inserted a page break
again go to the view go to page break
View and here you can see the solid line
so these solid ones are the ones which
are inserted by the users or anyone who
had the access to the data now how do we
eliminate them right so we can eliminate
them and we can try to you know get the
shade back to the normal way so all you
have to do is click on the cell which
has the page break which is right under
the page break go to the insert page
break yeah page layout menu go to the
brakes option click on remove page break
and there you go you have successfully
eliminated the page break and page break
preview to make sure that the page break
has been successfully removed so you
cannot see that anymore so that's how
you try to insert or eliminate a page
break in Excel so conditional formatting
is a method to visualize your worksheet
we already have the charts in Excel to
visualize our Excel sheets in graphical
form but what if you had to see or
visualize the data in your work sheet as
it is so that is where the conditional
formatting comes handy now let's get
back to the Microsoft Excel and try to
implement some conditional formatting
now we are on the Excel worksheet this
particular data set is based on a store
now we have various columns in this
particular data set we have R ID order
ID customer name Etc and finally we have
quantity discount and profits now let's
go to profits uh let us imagine that we
have provided Ed this particular store
with a target of minimum 15% profits now
let us find out the stores that have hit
the 15% Target and the ones which did
not so for that let us select the entire
column now you can find the conditional
formatting option in the home toolbar
and in that ribbon the ribbon with
Styles has the condition formatting
option click on that and you have
various options over here highlighting
the cells top bottom rules datab bar
data scales and icons so data bars are
actually the bar graphs which highlight
themselves on each and every cell if you
implement them and these are the color
scales if you want to implement some
colors you can go through that and if
you want to represent your cells with
icons you can also do that for now let's
highlight the cells so select that and
inside this select the greater than
option and here you can provide the
percentage that is
15% and
the cells or the stores which hit the
target should be highlighted with green
color and select okay and there you go
you have your stores that hit the 15%
Target and the ones which did not hit
the 15% Target now if we want to
highlight the ones which did not hit the
15% Target you can highlight them with
the color
red
so conditional formatting highlight the
Cs less than 15%
with color red and text dark and there
you go it's done now let us consider
another example so this particular
example is based on train data set and
here we have the passenger ID survived
passenger class name Etc now we have a
train accident incident over here now
one is indicated that they are alive and
zero is indicated that they are not
alive now let us use this column and
conditional formatting highlight the
cells
containing the text as one with color
green
okay
and highlight the
cells that contain text zero as red that
indicates they are not
alive and let us select the
icons now we have the icons over here
the X indicates that they're not alive
and the Green Tech Mark indicates that
they're alive now that is how you use
conditional formatting in Excel Excel
now here on my spreadsheet you can see
some data so this particular data has
some color markings so we have used
color codes to Mark the designations of
all the employees with different colors
so for example blue for manager purple
for senior and so on right now our duty
is to count the total number of
employees present in a company based on
the color code this can be using filters
but let's try with color tools now we
don't have a readily available function
in Excel to count cells based on their
colors but we can make use of macro now
to make use of macro you might want to
enable the developer options so by
default these will be disabled in Excel
to enable them right click on the
toolbar and you can see this particular
option click on the customize ribbon
option and you will be provided with
various set of options now on the right
side you can see developer options so
make sure the checkbox is clicked to
enable developer options and press on
okay to completely enable developer
window right now when you click on
developer options you can see various
options here visual Basics macro Etc now
click on the macro to create a macro now
just give a name to the macro function
so I'll give simply long
and press on create to create that
particular macro function so we have
already created a macro that is Count
colored cells which we will be using in
our current spreadsheet for counting the
colored cells now let us erase the newly
created function now getting back to the
original code so how does this
particular count colored cells works so
let us understand the function first
then we will try to make use of it in
the spreadsheet so the function name is
Count color CS as you can see and this
particular function will have two
parameters current cell and spreadsheet
area so the current cell will be the
cell address where the color you want to
count is present and then the
spreadsheet area so what is the range of
cells where you want to locate that
particular color and count the number of
repetition that is the spreadsheet area
and then comes the variables used color
cell range color code and color cell
count so the colored cell which
particular cell is having that
particular color and what color code is
involved in that colored cell and
colored cell count so what is the total
count what is the total number of
colored cells you have in that
particular range that is colored cell
count now let us consider color code is
equals to current cell interior color
that is current cell do interior do
color so this is the function which will
identify the interior color of a
selected cell let us imagine that
initially color code is is equals to the
current cell's color code okay now we
will have the for Loop and that for Loop
will include colored cell which is the
current cell in the spreadsheet area and
if the colored cell the currently
selected colored cell do interior do
color is equals to the color code that
we have selected then colored cell count
the variable which is used to count the
number of colored cells is equals to +
one initially by default it will be zero
in case if this particular if condition
is true that is the current cell color
and the color code given is equals to
same then the value of colored cell will
increase by one and this particular if
Loop will run as many number of times
the condition is true so let us imagine
that the condition will remain true for
five times then we have obtained five
similarly colored cells in the given
range of cells in a spreadsheet and once
the condition fails then the latest
value Pres in colored cell count
variable will be displayed which will be
a final result so this is how the macro
function works now let's close the macro
window and get back to our spreadsheet
now let us try to make use of the macro
function that we just created so that is
equals to count colored cells press tab
to select the macro function and the
first one is the current cell so this is
the current cell where the current color
is being provided comma this cell range
so our cell range will be from C2 to
c31 right so this is the range where we
want to count the similarly colored
cells that is sky blue colored cells
close the function and press enter now
you can see the function has identified
six reputations of sky blue color in
this particular range of cells now you
can drag the same formula across all the
cells and it will be providing the
results of the same so six senior color
that is pink or purple color then two
reputations of this particular color two
reputations of trainy color five for
dark blue and six for green right so
this is how the macro function works and
the key point to remember here is this
particular macro will work only for
manually colored cells so there are
situations where we have used
conditional formatting to color a single
cell let us imagine that we have used
conditional formatting to recognize the
employees with salary above 30,000 as
green color and if we try to use that
particular green color to be counted by
the color count cells function no it
will not happen it will not consider
that color as a feedback or an input now
in future we will also try to design a
macro which can recognize the colors
made by conditional formatting as well
but this particular function will be
exclusively used for manually colored
cells only dated F function is majorly
used to find the differences between two
individual dates so it is also called as
dated if by a few people and a few
people also reference it to date diff
that is date difference so anything is
good now to find the difference between
any two dates let's select a few dates
so the first date would be uh let us
imagine that you're an employee and you
wanted to find out how many years that
you've been working with an organization
so for that you might want to need today
and the date where you join the company
right so it might be date of ch joining
and
today so what's the difference right so
let us imagine that you join the
organization somewhere around
2010
01
05
2010 and today so for today can you can
give any particular
date let us imagine that uh today is 1st
of January 2021 or
2022 now we have up both the dates that
is the joining date and the current date
which can be the current date so the day
can be anything so you might be watching
this on a different date as well so the
date of that day for today would be a
little different so we'll imagine the
today's date as an imaginary date now we
might want to find the difference that
is in terms of ears so you wanted to
find the difference in terms of ears so
here you can find the difference in
terms of ear days and months as well so
currently let's try to find out the
difference in terms of years so for
years you might want to specify the
third parameter in the data function as
y if you wanted months you have to give
the M as the third parameter and if you
want to to find the days you might want
to give d as the third parameter uh so
we have discussed the third parameters
so what are the first two parameters
right so the first two parameters are
the first date and the last date so the
first date in this situation is your
date of joining and the last date or the
final date which you want here as your
today so let's find the difference so
for that equals to so it can be dated if
or date
diff the date if and the first date
which is the A2 and comma the last date
that is P2 and your parameter third
parameter in terms of ears that is why
close the bracket and press enter so
there you go you have your date here so
it's been like 11 years that you're
working with your organization so that's
how you find out the differences so we
have 11 years because uh we did not
finish the 12th year completely so if we
had given the month as U maybe six where
we have finished our total years then it
will automatically change to 12 years
so now for this particular task we will
be considering the student database now
let's get into practical mode and start
our Excel so on my screen you can see
some data related to students now let us
try to duplicate some of the rowes here
so we have selected the rows 8 9 10 and
11 now we shall copy them and paste them
so now these are the duplicate elements
right now there might be possibilities
about the duplication of class because
all the students all the 10 students are
in same class so there might be a
duplication but we are not looking for
such kind of duplications right right we
are looking for the duplication of the
entire row for example we have the
details of mik over here in the 8 row
which has the role number or serial
number as seven name as mic role number
class blood group and subject scores
percentage round of percentage and total
marks so the entire eth row is been
copied here and it is in the row number
12 we have the exact same details so
what if you have the the exact same rows
duplicated so that's what we're going to
deal with we're going to eliminate the
duplicate rows all completely together
now to carry over this task we have to
select the data from toolbar so you have
various options file home insert Etc so
you need to select the data and inside
data toolbar we have the ribbon and
inside ribbon you have got the duplicate
values or remot duplicates uh option in
the ribbon so select all the data select
remove duplicates and now you can see
that we have all our uh column names
over here and make sure that you have
selected my data has headers and then
select okay and now you can see that
Excel has automatically removed four
duplicate values so four duplicate
values are found and removed 10 unique
values remain now another type of uh
remove duplicates can also be done so
you can see that here we have another
data set which has phone numbers or
phone names that is phone makers that is
Samsung Huawei Vio Oppo Etc so there are
some duplicate values in this I've copy
pasted them so now you can also do that
so just select all the
data and now go into home and select
conditional formatting and here select
highlight cell rules and inside that you
have duplicate values selecting this
option will help you identify the
duplicate values in your data set but
not to remove them so you can select
that and you can see the duplicate
values are highlighted over here in the
red color now again you can get back to
data and select the option of remove
duplicates and select okay and the
duplicate values will be automatically
eliminated so that's how you delete or
eliminate duplicate values in uh
data set and you can also see that we
have another duplicate in this
particular row and if you wanted to
select a particular row and eliminate
the duplicates you can also do that now
for that you need to go to the same
process remove duplicates and here
Microsoft Excel is asking you if you had
to expand the selection to the entire
data set or you want to continue with
the selected data set itself or selected
column itself so for that you need to
select the continue with the current
selection and remove duplicates and
press okay and you can see one duplicate
value was found and it has been removed
and six unique values remain so that's
how you use the function of removing
duplicates in Excel so what is summers
in Excel now you might want to calculate
uh the total sum of sales right so let
us assume that this is your entire
storees sales data and you wanted to
calculate the entire sum of sales so
there is a some function in Excel where
you just have to you know select all the
sales and apply some function onto it
and you'll get the sum of all the sales
right so with something like this you'll
select all the sales and then you'll
apply a sums function and you'll get the
sum here and average everything right so
this is fine but what if you just wanted
to find the sales that are happening in
only western region as you can see our
column f is based on region so we have
four regions Southwest East and Central
so your manager asks you to find the
sales happening in suppose say west
region so how do you calculate it would
you manually go into each cell and check
if it's West and calculated that will be
timec consuming right so what if you had
a method which could do it for you just
in a matter of few steps or few clicks
right so that's exactly sum so it will
basically add a condition calculate the
sum of sales where the region is equals
to West simple to like or similar to
seel query right so that is exactly what
we're going to do in Excel today that is
using Summits now let me add here Sales
of West Region now in the next cell
let's add uh sumus function remember
there are multiple sum functions in
Excel so when you type in Su you can see
so many options based on sum right you
just have some some followed by that you
have some if it is just some if not some
ifs today we are concentrating on some
ifs so not just some if we'll go to some
ifs so we'll be having an option of
placing multiple if conditions there so
let's also try that more on that later
now let's press tab to select our sum FS
function now okay we forgot another
important step so before we apply sufs
we need to convert our table into a
table format yes it looks stable but
right now it's not in tabular format it
is in the format of database we know
that Microsoft Excel considers its data
as a database by default so to convert
the database into table just click
anywhere on the data and press control T
so that you'll have a new dialogue box
and it will ask if your table has
headers just make sure that you have
ticked in it our table does have headers
so select okay now our database has been
converted into a perfect table and it's
ready for applying Summers function so
now you can see our database has been
successfully converted into a table now
let's begin with our summers now again
remember we are using some ifs here not
some if or some so select some ifs and
press T and we have our sus function now
the first step which column are we
looking at what are we finding out right
which is a sum range what sum do you
want for now we need sum of sales so
select the sales column and we have have
a simple key function here let's hold
control again press shift and hold shift
together so we're holding control and
shift key together and now we pressing
lower Arrow key once yes the entire
sales column has been selected comma Now
where do you want to look so we want to
look I mean which part of the table you
want to fetch right so this is the
region part we want to fetch right now
so again hold control and shift together
lower Arrow key the entire column is
selected now the next last part so we
want to look into the both of the
columns that is sales column and region
column now which type of data you want
so for now we want Western type of data
that is the sales data which is
happening only in West right so we'll
select this cell with the data as W or
you can also manually enter it for now
let's select the data so I'm selecting
the cell F7 which has uh data as West
right now let's close the parenthesis
and press enter so there you go you have
the sales happening in the western
region now you can also try to format it
in the form of currency so let's use uh
dollars since it is based on American
states so let's use dollars so there you
go now we are having the sales data of
West now let's try to copy the same to
all the for CES and uh for now here
let's type in
East and this can be South right and
this can be your
central there you
go right now you can also copy the same
formula and make minor edits to it so
here instead of f8 you can select uh
East so where is East here and press
enter so you have the sales related to
East now let's try to edit F9 with South
select South Region enter so you have
South sales and what remaining is
Central so let's edit Central as well
and press enter so there you go right
now you have all the separate sales data
from west east south and Central now
again uh you might want a bit more
granularity in data right or in your
reports right like you wanted to find
the sales data happening in West and you
wanted to find out the category based on
only Furnitures so your manager will ask
you okay a fantastic job so now just
give me another minute detail on the
data I want to calculate the sales
happening on West based on category
Furniture right so he wants furniture or
he wants office supplies only right you
can also do that it's not an issue at
all now let's try to copy this cell and
paste it here and sales invest let's add
another another input here on
furniture right now you wanted to
calculate the sales happening in west
region only on furniture so you can also
do that now we can use the same formula
as well just copy paste the formula here
right and you can add few things here
when you try to add a comma it will
automatically generate the next criteria
it is expecting that you are looking for
adding another criteria right now which
column you want you want category so
let's select category you want to select
all the cells same track control shift
lower key and again press comma and you
wanted to select only uh Furniture so
select on furniture cell there you go
now press enter so there you go we
successfully have the sales data from
west region based on category Only
Furniture so that's how you do su in
Excel you can also add a few more
details to it like in Furniture you can
also look only for tables so here you
can see in west region we have furniture
sales data and we have sales data of
West Region based on furniture which
includes only tables you can also do
that using sumus function in the same
way all you have to do is select the
subcategory column and select the cell
which has the data as tables so this is
how you use sus in Excel now creating a
pivot table is just away from a few
clicks trust me is just a couple of
clicks and you'll have have your pivot
table ready to operate now click any
cell or select any cell on your
spreadsheet which has the data and
navigate to insert menu on the toolbar
and select pivot table and that's how
simple it is now automatically Excel
will choose your data you can see the
lines over here dotted lines that means
the Excel has already selected the range
of data that you want to put into your
pivot table and you can either select
the existing worksheet or a new
worksheet I'll select a new worksheet
over here
and just press on okay and there you go
you have your pivot table ready now here
you can see your pivot table is a little
empty all you need to do is drag and
drop the data elements that you want on
your pivot table so here you can see on
our spreadsheet we have some business
data related to a stop which has
furniture and states and subcategories
of the furniture and all the you know in
in category you have furniture office
supplies technology Etc right so those
have some subcategories as well and
different states and the regions as well
and the quantity total sales happen
right so using this business data we can
find out some key insights of this
particular data using our pivot table
right so here we'll add the data now let
me drag the region into rows click and
drag and let me
drag uh categories into columns which
are the different categories which are
involved in sales data and values what
are the sales happened right and there
you go you have Furnitures office
supplies technology as the three
different categories and those are the
sales happened in central East South and
West regions and this is the grand total
and instead of regions you know you have
old regions over here right so Central
East Southwest or instead of uh old
regions or instead of all the categories
you can you know place a specific
category in your pivot table for example
let me push the category into the
filters and here you can see the total
sales happened in those particular
regions now what if someone asks you to
find the sales of Only Furniture right
so your manager comes to you and he'll
ask you getting the sales of only
Furnitures you can select that and there
you go you have the furniture sales in
all the regions right or you can also do
the vice versa you can also drag uh
regions into the filters and if you
wanted to find out the region wise sales
of furniture you can also do that
right so here we have furniture and here
you have all the regions and let us try
to find the sales of furniture in the
central region and there you go right so
this is how um the privot table works
and you can also remove the regions for
example if you wanted to remove a
certain element from filters or anywhere
if it is columns rows anything you can
just drag and drop it right so that's
how it works and also you can increase
the level of detail or improve the
granularity right so here we have U
categories on our uh you know columns so
you can also include subcategories into
the
columns right
and and you have the region wise
sales so in the region filter select
all press okay and in the category
select
all press okay and you have the
furniture here office supplies here and
Technology here and also if you want to
include the quantity how much or how
many number of um you know things got
sold in those particular categories and
subcategories you can also do that so
here in the furniture section books
these are the sales and these are the
number of quantity or elements sold in
in those particular you know sectors so
you can you can also improve the level
of granularity you can also include the
level of detail using pivot tables
in now AutoFill in Excel is a feature
where you can add some series
automatically using Excel for example
let us imagine that you wanted to add
index numbers right so starting from 1
to 10 so manually you will be typing in
the numbers and you'll be doing it right
so instead of this what if I said you
there was a simple way where Excel will
fill all the data for you right so just
start with one two and select these two
cells and you can see the flash logo
over here right so that's the indication
that Excel has understood your pattern
and it is ready to fill the remaining
numbers so as long as you drag this logo
or that ending part where you have a
small square box that will fill all the
numbers until where you have draged it
so that's how autofill works and you
might be wondering will it work only for
numbers no it will also work on some
Logics as well okay this was the first
part let us also look at some other
tricks with autofill now most of the
time you might be just adding one number
and try to drag that itself and the
result is it'll copy the same number all
the time right so you can change it by
clicking on this menu you can click on
fill series and it will change to series
and this was one more trick with numbers
now getting back to the next type so let
us imagine now the next type of series
you want to add is weeks in a day right
so you'll be having
Monday Tuesday Wednesday right so you
can also do the series of weekdays using
AutoFill in Excel as well so drag that
cell and it will give you all the days
or week days in a week now let's try
January and this will give you the
months in a
year in the shortcut way right since you
just added the first three letters of
the month it will recognize the pattern
and it will do the same for you now let
us try the full names of
months right and now let's try to drag
it it'll fill all the full names of all
the
months now let's try the dates so let us
imagine that this is the first day of
the current
year right it will now give you all the
dates of that current month or until the
end of the year as
well there you
go now let us imagine that your manager
tells you to add the dates of working
days in the month of January so how can
you do that it's simple all you need to
do is select the cell go to the fill
option select series and here select
column wise since you want the dates and
columns and here in the type select date
date unit should be weekday and the stop
value should be the next month right
since your manager asked for the week
days of January so your stop value will
be the 1st of February press okay and
there you go so since the 1st of January
is Friday it's selected over here and
the rest two Saturday and Sunday are
eliminated similar
we have all the dates here of working
days only so that's how you use AutoFill
in Exel so on my screen you can see a
simple spreadsheet with student names
and their marks on my sheet so we will
be calculating what are the total marks
obtained by the students in overall
subjects and calculate what is the
percentage now we will carry forward a
few simple inbuilt functions in Excel to
calculate that first we will be
calculating the sum of marks so here
equals to sum
function and select the range of
cells close the bracket press enter so
you have the sum
now so we have to calculate it repeat so
by clicking on the same formula now we
have the total of all the subjects for
individual students and now let's
calculate percentage so usually we use
the you know divide by option that is
divide the total number of marks
obtained by the total number of marks
available that is we will be dividing 47
by 500 and then we will be multiplying
that into 100 so that's how we calculate
the percentage
so sell G2 divided by cell H2 press
enter and you will end up with you know
uh the decimal format that's perfectly
all right now we have also extended the
same form form for all our cells now
select this overall column or select the
highlighted cells right and get into the
data type here you have General so
that's why we have got that uh decimal
format but when you press percentage
you'll have the actual percentage of all
the students according to their marks
achieved now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet and this spreadsheet has
some values of employees that is their
employee ID name designation Department
salary date of birth and date of joining
now our concern is to highlight some
cells which are duplicate in this or
some rules which are duplicate so for
example here you can see on rule number
seven we have the details of Mara and
you can see the same details of MAA in
the row number 14 as well right so you
need to eliminate those cells or you
need to eliminate those rowes now you
can say there is a quick way just few
clicks and those will be elim ated that
is conditional formatting yes that is
also one way but I'll show you what's
the problem with that okay so let us
select the entire table and get into
conditional formatting and here you have
duplicate values highlight cell rules
with duplicate values and there you go
the problem so here we have designation
which is duplicated in certain ways
department and salary state of joining
right so there are certain conditions or
scenarios where you cannot directly
identify ify which is the duplicate row
again you can use the same for this
right so you can select the
entire uh column of employee ID and you
can uh identify the duplicate cells here
since the employee IDs are unique for
everyone so this is a way but let's dig
a little deeper and understand the way
of highlighting duplicates with an
advanced technique so let me cancel this
and for that let's create a new um
column and let's name this as
duplicate
flag e flag
so the new column has been created which
is D flag so here we will be using a
simple formula that is Count F and here
press tab to select the formula and here
we will be adding our uh range that is
which range are you considering so the
range will be the employee ID since
employee IDs are unique for every
employee and
and let's press function F4 to fix it
and now uh again the criteria and the
criteria will be the same cell that is
A2 and now close the bracket and press
enter now let's trct the same formula to
all the
rows okay now here we have now what you
can do is uh sort it in an advanced way
go to sort and filter and custom sort
and here you'll be sorting by the D flag
and it will be smallest to
largest so now uh you can apply the
conditional formatting to highlight it
you can select the column H or the D
flag go to conditional formatting
highlight cell rules and here you can
get into greater than and give the value
as one okay so all the cells which are
you know repeated multiple times will be
selected here and they will be
highlighted with a selected color what
you have given so I've given Red so now
you can select these cells and highlight
them or delete them from your
spreadsheet and now all your data in the
spreadsheet is unique and clean now
let's quickly get onto the Practical
mode where we will have some data sets
over which we will be trying to apply
the charts now there are various types
of charts in Tab and those are the p
chart the column chart the bar chart
column versus line pav chart and Spark
line charts so we will discuss one after
the other first let us discuss about the
pie chart so as you can see we have a
small data set on my screen which I have
personally created and uh this deals
with the companies and this deals with
the shares of the automobile industry so
now for this let's create a pie
chart select all the data and then get
into the tool bar and inside the toolbar
you can see various options and inside
that we going to use the insert option
and when you select the insert option
you will have a ribbon here and inside
the ribbon you can see groups tables
illustrations addins and here you go
these are the charts so now we needed a
pie chart so select on that icon and you
have various types of pie charts you
have two dimensional pie charts three
dimensional pie charts donut type of
charts Etc right so so I would like to
go with the threedimensional pie chart
as it looks a little more appealing and
easy to understand and now there you go
this is the title of the chart and these
are the legends of the chart and this is
the chart area and these are the values
now we can uh you know kind of add the
data labels as well so you can just have
to press the plus icon over here and
you'll have the options you can add the
data labels which will give you a lot
more interesting
values and uh you can also turn this
around as you can see we on double
clicking any part of the pie chart
you'll get this option which is called
as format data point and uh let's
imagine that you wanted to show the
information related to this particular
one which is Volvo which has the biggest
share so this is in front right now now
what if you wanted to show the
information related to data which is
over here right for that you can select
this particular Arrow key and you can
just twist it and there you go it is
coming in front this will be a a great
way of presenting your data to your
clients
right yeah and there is another option
where you can uh directly explode this
like you can pick it out you can see
this right Point explosion where you can
split it out and you can show that
especially like you can highlight it and
show it so that's the you know a great
way of to presenting your data so that's
how you can work with pie charts in
Excel now let's quickly move to the next
one that is the column chart and in the
column chart we have the data related to
some company and uh the profits of that
company based on a year so you can see
that the year has started from 2008 and
it has gone until
2021 and these are the profits of that
company year after year so since we are
dealing with column chart I'll tell you
the simplest way to create a column
chart there is a shortcut key for that
which is alt F1 and there you go you
have the chart right on your
screen now you can uh expand the chart
just by dragging it like that and you
can see that there is some problem with
this chart that is we have numbers here
instead of years right you can see that
the First Column is the years which is
2008 to 2021 but here
you can see we have 1 2 3 4 which is not
proper right so to change the axis that
is you can see the axis which is 1 2 3
let me expand my screen a little bit
Yeah so if you look at my screen we have
two different columns one column is
about the ears and the second column is
about the revenue now what we want to do
is we want to create a line graph where
we have ER on the xaxis and revenue on
the y- AIS and we will be generating a
line graph based on the data we have now
for that we have to select the entire
data what we have then we need to go
into the insert option in the toolbar
and then you can see a lot of chart
options in the insert ribbon now here
you can see that we have a line chart or
area chart option select that and here
you can see 2D line graphs now let's
select the first one and there you go
you have the line chart here now let's
rename the
title and there is one problem with the
chart here you can see that the x-axis
is not actually pointing the ears you
can make a change to that no
worries just right click and then you
you can see the select data option and
there you go you have the edit option
here just edit it and now select the
range I am selecting the ears now let's
select okay and there you go you have
the ears here you can just try to expand
it a little
more
yeah so now you have the revenue on the
Y AIS and year on the x-axis and this
shows the growth of Revenue in your
company so this is how you create a line
graph in Excel now I'm on my Excel
spreadsheet
and I wanted to download this particular
data from a website
now it would be not ideal if I go on
typing each and every individual element
from this particular website into my
Excel spreadsheet right that would take
all day or if in case the data set is a
lot bigger than what it has been shown
on the website or it might be next to
Impossible right basically it's way too
hectic now there is a simplified way
where you can do the same right you just
have to go to the website where you want
to download the data from copy that URL
as it and now back to excel here in the
data section go to import option where
you can find the option which says from
website just click on that now P start
URL now press okay and it might take a
little while to import your data and add
it into your rows and
columns now it will show you multiple
options or whatever the data is
available here and you can select the
data or table which you want to have so
this is not the table what I want to
have this is the one so let's check the
third one this is not the one which I'm
looking for I'm looking for this
particular data this particular table
just click on it and say
load in a few minutes the entire data
will be loaded onto a spreadsheet there
you
go so that's how you can import data
from web pages into your Excel so
Microsoft 365 co-pilot is one of the
latest AI products launched by Microsoft
so the Microsoft 365 co-pilot will be
your AI assistant for all your office SS
from Microsoft so it can help you ease
up your process of making PowerPoint
presentations it can help you write down
the notes on Microsoft Word and many
more but today we will be using this
particular 365 co-pilot for our data
analytics using Excel so let me remind
you this particular AI tool works with
the versions of of Microsoft Office 365
and later right now there should be a
new feature added upto your Excel on the
top right corner of your home button but
again if it's not it's completely all
right you can use your Microsoft home
button where you can find the Microsoft
365 co-pilot so let's navigate to the
home button yeah now I'm on my home
button and here you can see a small icon
which is completely new out of nowhere
this is your co-pilot right and you can
just click on it and you can fire your
co-pilot and uh today's point of
discussion is about co-pilot with
Microsoft Excel so when you are starting
Excel there are some prerequisits when
you're working with co-pilot So
currently it is in the preview mode so
it is capable of using some data set
which is in the table format I have
converted this into a table format it's
really simple contr a to select all the
celles and then control T to convert
this table uh the option I my data set
has headers and okay so your data set
will be converted into a table and
another prerequisite is when you pop up
the Microsoft uh co-pilot it will ask
you for a data set which is under 1,000
kilobytes so my data set here is about
800 kilobytes which should be CLE so the
only process is you just have to click
on this particular option which says
attachments go to the data attachment
you want to work today so I'll be
selecting my sales EU copy and just
press open it will take a little time
because it's completely new so it might
take a little time for that so the only
uh catch is Microsoft co-pilot is a
little slow compared to the other
competive co-pilots or AI modules it's
not a big deal they will catch up soon
let's wait for some time while the D
head loads and then you can fire some of
the commands let's say I have given my
command here please help me create a
regional wise sales report for this data
set and you can also give a few more
commands right so it's loaded right now
you can see the icon here now you can
write down give me country
wise sales
report and just fire the command you can
also um you know perform all your data
analytics what you regularly do right
when you have a sales data set you might
be wondering what what it can do and
what it cannot you just have to build a
story about the report what you want to
create and then just you know write it
down to the co-pilot and it will
generate the report that you are looking
for currently it is working on the
country wise sales report so it should
be giving me the report
shortly it's okay so there are some
problems with this so maybe it's the
data set data type so here we have uh
country and the data is General so you
might want to change that to text format
or character format so you have the text
Data typ here and just okay now save it
back now you can ask the co-pilot once
again okay or let's try to do a
different one okay now here we have the
order date and column C right now let's
say I wanted to find out which day did
they visit right is it a Friday is it a
Saturday or Monday right so just try to
ask the co-pilot let me write it down
can you help me find out which week of
the
day was an order
placed you we have a
column named
autate
column
is B we need a new
column that tells
[Music]
me the
day of the
[Music]
week when an
order was placed so let's file the
command now it should give us a column D
which is an empty column right next to
order date or it should give us the
steps to do the same just by the command
it might take a little
while okay here we have it certainly
I'll create a new column D in you dat
set great this is what we needed and so
on let's try to ask another query can
you tell
me name of the
customer with highest
sale record in the data
set so the previous query which we fired
at will not be reflected on this
particular DD but it can be reflected on
the bis that we shared with the co-pilot
here so currently I don't have a direct
connection with my Excel over here I
think it should be taking some time for
getting me that update over here but
anyways it will be updated in the D that
it is currently dealing with that's not
a problem now let us see what's the
answer I apologize but it seems that I'm
unable to extract any text content from
the uploaded file it's okay let's try to
file there are some discrepancies but it
should be resolved soon but let's try
some other thing like region wise
sale so let's say you are an Excel
expert so you can do it within a few
fraction of seconds you can just apply
filters and get that data but there are
a lot of people new to excel so for them
the co-pilot from Microsoft could be a
boon right but down the line there are
improvements rolling out so I could
predict that it could be a lot faster
and you can have seamless integration
with your Microsoft Excel and your
co-pilot and things could be a lot
easier right so far we have the result
over here so it is giv us a few results
and it is finding a little difficulty to
extract a few that shouldn't be a
problem in a few couple of days where
the new updates roll out so proceeding
ahead let's try to give it another query
also
so let's check the data set so here we
have the categories and subcategories I
think we can give it um okay can you
give
me the category wise profits so here we
can identify which category is
performing really good giving us highest
number of profits so I think let's check
out if we have a profits column yes we
do have a profits column over here so
let's check that brilliant right so it's
giving us distilled reports in one on PR
so that should be helpful for any of the
data analysts which are aspiring right
and which don't have have any idea about
how Exel works okay it seems that I'm
able to extract text content from
uploaded files
okay let's try to copy this and write it
down as okay is it
category okay let's copy this as well I
think it's about the case right
category subcategory okay let's let's F
subcategory category sales
report okay it's giving us the pre
answer to the previous query okay I
think this should help it's enable to
extract a lot of answers so far
currently there should be some
discrepancy but down the line it should
be
fixed en able to extract any text
content from the uploaded file okay so
basically that's how you can work with
your co-pilot in Microsoft 365 XEL so
there are some discrepancies so far so
it should be fixed down the line so
that's how you can use copilot in Excel
for your data analytics and so guys an
Excel data analyst always looks for ways
to improve their efficiency and gain
deeper insights from the data that's
where chj comes in handy so chj is an AI
powered language model that can assist
you in various tasks including Excel
based data analysis and for that data
analysis let's dive into some demos to
see how it works so guys as you can see
this is the chat jpt 4 and you could see
this has the support of D browsing and
Analysis and usage limits May apply like
we have the version that has some usage
limits and for the data I have
downloaded the data from the kle I will
provide you the link in the description
if you want want to download the same
data you can and I have that in my
downloads so this is the data that we'll
be using so the first thing we'll be
doing is data cleaning and preparation
so firstly let's explore data cleaning
and preparation before diving into
analysis it's essential to ensure our
data is clean and ready for processing
so for that we will write a prompt in
chat J and ask him to clean the data
share jpt has the feature to insert the
files provide the Excel file to the chat
jpt and we'll ask him that can you help
me identify and remove duplicates in
this Excel spreadsheet so let's ask him
can you help me identify and remove
duplicates
duplicates from this Excel spreadsheet
from the
provided
Excel spreadsheet you could see that chy
has started generating the response and
he is telling us that he can definitely
help us with that and he's analyzing
that so you could see that J has
provided us the response so let's first
go to our
spreadsheet so this is the spreadsheet
order number quantity ordered
price of each quantity and Order lines
so you could see that first J GPT has
encountered an error and that is with
the corrector and coding mpat and then
he has loaded the spreadsheet
successfully with the second attempt and
you could see that he has provided a
like the smaller or the briefer version
of the spreadsheet that is the data set
consist of sales data with column such
as order number quantity order price
each order line sales order date status
so he asking us could you specify how
you would like to identify duplicates
for example should we consider a row a
duplicate if all its values match and
row exactly or are this specifically
columns we should focus on to determine
duplicates so we should or here we will
be focusing on the column section so
here we want to identify
column
section so is asking which columns they
should identify duplicates so we want
the duplicates in order
number so the J GD has started analyzing
the spreadsheet
so you could see that CH gy has Pur the
response that they have identified a
total of
287 rows in the spreadsheet that have
duplicates based on the order number
column so this indicates that multiple
rows share the same order number
suggesting there might be different
items or transactions within the same
order would you like to proceed by
removing these duplicates while keeping
either the first or last occurrence of
each order number or do you have another
approach in mind for handling these
duplicates so before identifying the
duplicates what we'll do is we'll first
get rid of the extra spaces so we ask CH
gbt that first
find the Extra
Spaces in the
spreadsheet
and help us remove
them so you could see that it has
started analyzing
it so he is asking us that would you
like to proceed with any further
cleaning or data manipulation yes we
want to proceed further with data
cleaning only and now we will treat all
the blank cells if there are
any now treat all the blank cells
if there are
any so the spreadsheet contains blank
cells in the following columns with the
respective counts of blank entries that
is address line two has 2521 blank
celles than the state so depending on
preference or the requirements of data
analysis we can treat these blank cells
in several ways such as filling them
with the T holder value that is not
provided using a specific value that
makes sense for data
that is example a default state or tyry
but potentially leaving them as if
blanks carry meaningful information in
the context of a data so what we will do
we will provide a
placeholder provide a placeholder
instead that
is not provided or not applicable
okay so we would see in that J has
responded that it has replaced the plank
cells in the columns that is address
line two State postal code and territory
with the placeholder node provided so
you could see there's a verification
sample showing the updates so this is
how you could clean the data and now
with chat jpt you can quickly identify
and eliminate duplicates in your Excel
spreadsheet using build-in functions and
formulas saving your time and effort so
that would be done by the chat GPD and
you can download the Excel file from the
chat GPD only after the that you can
just ask him that provide me the output
or the resulted spreadsheet so if we
talk about now data analysis and
visualization let's delve into that so
Excel offers powerful tools for
analyzing and visualizing data and chat
gbt can help you make the most of them
so for this also we'll write a prompt to
the chat JY and we'll write for example
we'll write please create a p table and
a corresponding chart to analyze sales
performance by region so let's see
like this prompt what output does chat
Jey show to us so let's ask him please
create a PR
table and a
corresponding chart to
analyze sales performance by
region so we would you would see that
jut has started analyzing the data and
the spreadsheet and you could see that
the pivot table below shows the sales
performance per region or the territory
so this table indicates that the EMA
region has the highest s performance
followed by regions where the territory
was not provided then Apec and finally
Japan so now let's create a chart to
visually represent this sales
performance by region you could see that
it has provided a chart that is a bar
chart illustrating the sales performance
by
Ty so you could see the guys that it has
provided us the analysis and J jpd can
guide you through the process of
creating pivot tables charts and other
visualizations in Excel enabling you to
gain valuable insights from your data
with ease so let's move to Advanced
analysis and automation so lastly we
will explore Advanced analysis and
automation so Excel capabilities extend
beyond basic function funs and chat jpd
can help you leverage its full potential
and for this also we'll write a prompt
to the chat jpd that can you assist me
in building a forecasting model to
predict future sales based on historical
data present in the spreadsheet so let's
see what chat J respond to us so let's
ask
him can
you assist
me in
building a forecasting
model to predict future
sales based on historical
data so let's see what chj respond to us
so you could see that building a
forecasting model to bre future sales
based on historical data involves
several steps so for this you have to
prepare the data select a model train
the model evaluate the model and make
prediction
so let's start by preparing the data
we'll aggregate sales by order date to
create a Time series of total daily
sales then we'll choose a model based on
data's characteristics so we
will grant the permission to chat gypt
to proceed with the steps so we started
analyzing the
data so you could see that that the data
has been prepared into a Time series of
total daily sales and before choosing a
forecasting model it's helpful to
visualize the sales time series to
understand its characteristics such as
Trend and seasonality so jjt has loed a
daily sales data and then he has given
the visual Trends and the possible
seasonal patterns and the next steps
would include testing for stationarity
model selection and parameter touring
model training and then forecasting so
you could follow all these steps with
the help of chat GPD and could create a
forecasting model if you want we can
move to the next step so you could like
provide a prom to the chat chipy that
move
to or proceed with Next
Step so step by step Chad Gip will
provide you a forecasting model or it
will help you create a forecasting model
as you can see it has started analyzing
it so the augmented Dy Fuller that is
ADF test gives up a P value of
approximately
0.0033 since this P value is less than
the common significance level of 0.05 we
can reject the null hypothesis that the
time Series has a unit root meaning the
time series is stationary so you could
see that he's asking us shall we proceed
with the Sima model parameter selection
yes yes here is the model parameter
selection so you could select any based
on the trends and the bar graph ploted
by the chat
GD so you could see guys that the chat
GD has analyzed the spreadsheet and
provided the response that the grid
search for the optimal Cima parameters
based on the
lower information Criterion suggest the
best fit model uses the parameter 011
and for ARA and 0 0112 that is for the
seasonal component so you could see that
it has provided the model and the
parameters now is asking us shall we
move on to forecasting future sales with
this model yes proceed with that so you
could see that with ch G's assistance
you can build complex forecasting models
in Excel allowing you to make informed
decisions and plan for the future
effectively so chat jpt is a valuable
tool for Excel users and data analysis
offering assistance in data cleaning
analysis visualization and Automation
and by integrating Chad j in your Excel
workflows you can enhance your
productivity and uncover new insights
from your data so you can try J gbt for
Excel data analytics today and take your
Excel skills to the new level and you
would see that uh there's an error in
the analyzing and he has encountered an
error while trying to plot the forecast
with its confidence intervals so this
type of error can occur due to data type
issu particularly when handling data
indices in forecast and despite the seup
the forecasting process using the ca
model was completed and we were able to
generate forecast for the next 12 months
unfortunately due to the plotting issue
he couldn't visually display it so we'll
ask him can you try once
again so you could see that this time CH
jbt has provided us the forecast for the
next 12 months that is the forecast have
been successfully plotted along with the
historic called daily data so here we
have our forecast model and with the
chat G assistance we can move with other
analysis also okay let's switch to
powerp first let's deal with the type of
sources and then switch to excel so now
uh we have landed to the power VI
desktop so here we have a wide variety
of options Excel workbook you can get
the data from hubs you can get data from
SQL servers and you can also enter the
data man
we have another option called Data verse
it's it's another story for another day
and you can also customize your inputs
you can get some data from web pages you
can do some uh data C you know website
crawling and get the data so apart from
that coming back to today's uh subject
which is about importing data from an
Excel sheet so Excel can be a little
tricky sometimes so here we can see an
Excel data file so here we have sales
data for four years 2020 21 22 23 and uh
let's say we wanted to import all these
four files into one desktop powerbi
desktop can you do that yes we can do
that and another way here we have is
Excel data sets and a combined Excel
sheet where we have multiple tabs the
same four years of data which looks
something like this 2020 21 22 and 23
correct so four years of uh data
separated by four different tabs so can
you combine this yes you can also
combine that so we will check out two
possibilities so let's quickly go back
to powerbi window and go to get data and
here we'll try the first one so go to
more and here select uh the folder
option so
file and uh folder Connect Now browse
the folder so we have the browse option
here go to downloads where we have that
folder go to excel select that and press
okay and another okay and we should be
getting the data
shortly now uh here we have combine load
and transform we can just go with
combine and load but we don't want to
have any errors in our data sets so for
saf as side we will go to transform data
and we will shape our data manually and
for more tutorials on explanation on
transform data we have a close of a
video on the transform data in you can
check out that so here go to the first
one you know the binary one where you
have the binary just right click it and
make sure that you remove any other
columns than binary we don't want them
right so uh an extra column is the
custom column and here you go and let
the name be custom name need the name
for that so Excel we need a function
where we can import Excel workbook so
this is the one one Excel workbook and
open a bracket then just double click on
this content or you can use insert and
close the bracket and just press okay
there you go now you have the table over
here you can just expand
it this prefix
okay now again just select the name of
the sheet and of the sheet rest
everything you can delete you don't need
any of those
you have it now expand the
data you can use the original columns as
prefix or not uh you will not choose to
do that press okay and your data should
be loaded shortly you can see we don't
have the names of the columns as the
column headers you find them in the
First Column I in the first row you can
okay let's remove this colum we don't
need the name column we need the r ID
first there you go now you can click on
this option over here where you can find
a small table and second option use
first was headers and that's how you get
the data imported from all the different
sheets into your data set you can once
check the filters just make just to make
sure that we don't have any of the
column headers from four different data
sets as one of the element right so we
don't have it so okay now this is one
way of importing in data and another one
let's say go back to home and we wanted
to import few more data sets uh like the
other one where we have the combined one
right so you have the applied steps
right you can just go on eliminating
them just for demo purposes so that we
go back to the homepage where we didn't
have any of the data set right now let's
go back to the source level
we can also run the source level we have
so you can even close the source level
and close the query
settings
data or we can completely C close the
power query edit yes now let's import
the Excel so this might take a little
while worry
not go to excel Excel workbook and here
just select the Excel
data sets and here we have the combined
data set remember where we had four
different tabs so press
okay automatically it will give us the
power uh query option where we can load
or transform the data now you have 4
different tabs now powerbi or power
query will give you an option of
choosing which particular years you want
to work with let's say I want to work
with only the latest two years that is
2022 and 2023 then I can directly go to
load or transform let's go with
transform as we did previously and here
you can combine the data sets all
together you can just uh use the
uh data merging option and combine these
two data sets so here we have the merge
queries option and you can just
merge here we have the first table which
is 2023 here you just have to select
2022 from the dropdown
the data here and just press on okay and
you will have the data sets SM for more
explanation on how to merge data in PBI
we have a dedicated tutorial on how to
use merge in PBI hello everyone I am M
and welcome to Simply Lars YouTube
channel are you want to get really good
at using Excel well Google Gemini can
help make it super easy Excel is all
about handling data organizing it doing
math with it and making it look nice
with Gemini you can learn all about
Excel step by step whether you are just
starting out or already know a bit
Google Gemini can teach you everything
from the basics like how to write
formulas to more advanced stuff like
analyzing big sets of data all you have
to do is ask Gemini questions or tell it
what you want to learn and it will
explain things to you in a way that
makes sense plus you can practice right
there in the chat by following along
with the examples so if you want to get
really good at Excel without any hustle
just start chatting with Gemini and you
will be an Excel wizard in no time so
yeah guys this is our Gemini promt so
here first we will write how to learn
Excel using gini right just for the
clarification okay so it will give some
prompt see here you can see there seems
to be slight a misunderstanding g at the
large Lang you going interact with okay
so learn Excel Basics you can do you can
learn data analysis with power query and
like this so here we will write give me
week wise
Excel
syllabus okay so it will give you wewi
exess labus so okay so this is week by
week exess cabus basic to intermediate
okay not advance you can learn advance
to so in week one what you can do you
can objective navigate EXC interface
understand basic spreadsheet topics you
can learn introduction to excel
environment working through cell rows
and even you can
just and you can particular modify the
selected text so in week one you can
learn these type of things entering data
text number dates and these and we in
week two you can learn building formulas
with references related and absolute and
you can learn Lo look of functions we
look of index match okay in week three
you can learn conditional formatting and
in week four you can learn a little bit
of data analysis like this okay
so here we can write so this is like you
are chatting with someone okay so you
can write here give me brief
about the week one
syllabus briefly for the
same okay so see it elaborate particular
thing for you so see Master the
interface data entry and editing
formatting fundamental Formula F okay so
what if you want to learn particular
only logical function okay or you can
you want to learn building formulas with
references or you want to learn look of
function or you want to learn date and
time function particular so here you can
ask
Gemini
give okay how to work with date
function in
Excel
explain me with example
okay so till then let me me open the
Exel file for
you okay so yeah so see the date
function is Excel is a handy tool for
creating specific dates of working with
exting so here is a webop so year month
day example right so enter today date in
a Cell let's say cell one okay so Excel
is now
here okay so what he saying so what it
saying enter to date in a Cell let's say
cell A1 you can type directly that is
2024 this this okay let me copy it
directly okay and paste it
here okay why is okay or use today
function okay fine or else you can write
today function write like this so if I
want to write
here equals to
today enter see you can see the same dat
exact
dat or in another cell that is B1 either
enter the following formula you can use
this formula date year A1 month this
this this okay so what it will do so
this part exrate the year sell from A1
which has already did this then month
from sell this is from cell this so this
is how you can learn any formula using
Excel
okay so I will WR
write give
me
example
of data in which I can learn
basic basic formulas
of
excel okay so we will learn we will sort
some try to formulas of excel so this
is our you
know particular data set so as you can
see export two sheets so either you can
go directly to the sheets and you can
say sheets and this Excel are both same
okay so after that what you can do you
can okay first let me try to copy it
okay if possible okay I'm not
sure uh no it came in once and
only yeah so I can
directly so it's creating a
spreadsheet fine open
sheets so yeah so this is the data so
now but learning with formulas so this
data allows you to learn practice okay
what I do just copy
everything copy it and paste
it
fine so now the thing is that I want to
learn some function so calculate the
total quantity of each prod sold by
using the sum function on the quantity
sold column okay so what you have to do
formula in cell E2 for choco chips cake
write equals to Su B2 okay so I can
write here in which column E2 column
E2 column equals to
sum
B2
B2 enter it's 50 as you can see 50 is
here okay so this is how you can learn
you can uh learn average function okay
let me copy that from here and you can
paste it anywhere
okay okay
average of
C2 and C5 okay
fine White's coming like
this okay
E5
right see what's the
issue okay what I can do equals
to average
average of
average okay my
B average
of
this comma this comma this comma this
okay okay so because of dollar it's
happening okay so this is how you can
learn or you can find across all using
function the price per unit column
formula in sell
E5 E5 e 5 if I will copy
it so this is how you
can okay because of dollar is
happening okay see how it will work
now see because of is happening so now
the average of C2 to C5 is two okay so
this is how you can learn you can
multiply you can apply V look up so
these are some additional tips from the
uh Gemini okay
so I want to create a
chart give
me explain me with example
okay so this will will give you some
data see data is there export
sheet so uh we'll copy later okay
fine so these are some additional TPS
are
here so these are the data
okay copy it and paste it here
okay so now what I what can I do is see
select the data highlight the data you
want to include in chart this typically
includes category lbel product name okay
in our example select cells A2 D5 A2 to
D5 from here to D5 okay
right select data then what you can do
you can choose a chart go to insert tab
on the Excel ribbon and locate the chart
section go
to
insert then okay these are some charts
so what you can do I want this chart
okay 2D column
chart okay I selected this the best
chart depends on the data what you here
are some option column chart line chart
okay let's select column chart
okay
insert where is the charts where are
column
chart okay so here you can choose
recommended section okay so these are
some recommended by Excel itself okay so
stack chart is there cluster column
chart is here and this stack bar is here
then clustered bar is here so we will
choose this stack column okay so as you
can see this is your data is ready okay
chocolate chip cookie cupcake bread
lover muffin so this is how you can
learn Excel using Gemini you can ask
anything from beginner level to advanced
level from Gemini it will give you
through it will give it will explain you
repeat function in Excel the repeat or R
is the short form of this function and
this can help you build some good
paragraphs so to just check on the demo
for today's session I've been exploring
a few graphs online and I came across
this particular one so this particular
chart is from mackenan company and it is
the 2023 the year in charts so if we
explore a little more about the years
and the events in this particular
company we found one of the good charts
and since this is the time for appraisal
you might be considering a lot of
opportunities to explore or a lot of
reasons to claim that extra bonus on
your salary paas level now here if you
see we we have some reasons why the IT
team from keny wants to stay back in the
company and some reasons why it may not
right so here we have why I plan to stay
in my current job career development
advancing potential and uh a few more
reasons and accordingly a bar graph has
been designed right so I'll leave this
link in the description box below for
your future reference if you need and uh
let's also take the same data and try to
build a similar chart in Excel using the
repeat function so I have added the same
data into my Excel Trad sheeet now let's
try to create the bar graph firstly I'll
reference the reason let's drag it down
so that we have reasons for all of these
there you go now next one is we will use
the function R PT function and the text
will be windows. that you get the emojis
over here you can take the symbols or
anything that you prefer so I'll be
preferring this particular symbol for
how many times for 47 times which is
available in the cell
B2 we will add if you go back to the
Chart here you can see a circular icon
right so we will add that circular icon
as well and the
symbols look for a dot let's go with
this and add a space if you see the
chart again we also have numbers right
so we're leaving a space and presentent
the number there you go just press enter
and there you have it now drag and drop
this particular formula to all the cells
there you go and now you can expand this
and also take
the
titles and now you have the same kind of
report almost so this also have some
borders and Etc so you can also do that
let's add some borders to our cells you
can add I'll go with all Bs and they've
also highlighted the top five
reasons there you go so that's how you
can create a beautiful bar graph using
the repeat function in Excel which is
about integrating AI into your
day-to-day operations in Excel now let's
quickly switch to the Excel workbook now
here I have a simple basic Excel
workbook and to demonstrate the uh Power
and potential of integrating AI into
your Excel spreadsheet we are performing
a small minor operation over here where
we just have few results right the
students their department and their
percentage now we going to calculate the
result of the pass or fail now you might
be telling me or you you might wonder
this is just a very simple if formula
why do you want to integrate an AI into
this now the speciality is let's say you
are a beginner in business analytics or
data analytics and even though if you're
a beginner you might figure out the
formula but let's say you don't have any
idea on generating a new formula all
together it's like asking a question to
chat GPD so here the AI editor that we
are going to with Excel is related to
chat jpt and it's you know built on chat
jpt so basically it will give you a
query editor where you can just write
your query in very simple terms like
you're just talking to excel right in
the same way like you talk to chat GPD
ask AI Editor to give you a formula to
identify column D numbers and give you
result in column e so let's get started
on how it can be done so it's really
simp
go to the home bar and here you can see
add ends option just click on that and
here we have the ai8 editor in case if
you don't find it just you can you can
just you know download any of the gbd
for Excel so just uh you know click on
this button over here and uh you will
get a search window just type down AI
editor or something so you can just get
one of those just press enter so I'm
using this the first recommendation a
formula editor you can choose any one of
these right Char video Excel we've got a
multiple ones so I'm using first one's
already added into my workbook so let's
quickly go to the AI formula editor you
might have to um you know create your
Microsoft account and try to login right
so here I have the AI generator right
now you can just write it down in your
own terms you can use your local
language can use Excel anything just
write it down the way you want it right
or you can just type down uh give me an
Excel
formula to
identify if the students passed the exam
or not result
percentage percentage greater than or
okay percentage greater than or equal to
35 Plus
is pass and
percentage less than 35 is fail is your
parameter are your
parameters just submited and it will
give you a query or a formula which you
can just copy and paste into the Excel
cell or workbook here we have one you
can just copy it the way it is just
paste it it over here so in place of A1
you're supposed to use percentage enter
now you have the results pass fair fair
right so it is we did not specify the
column number here right in case if we
have specified the column number or
column header which is basically e over
here sorry D over here so we named it as
percentage so we did not and another
thing to recognize we did not convert
this into table so basic few things but
overall you are getting a readily
available formula which is completely
Flawless you can also experiment this
particular feature of AI aided formula
editor with some complex Advanced Excel
tricks as well should you feel that we
should prepare one of the tutorials on
Advanced Excel formulas which are AI Ed
formula editor based videos please do
let us know in the comment section below
and we will get that done for you now we
have opened the Microsoft Excel workbook
here let's say we have a fingerprint ID
for all the employees in a company now
we have about 500 fingerprints here 501
fingerprints right over here right all
these employees belong to different
different departments let's say HR
department development testing sales
marketing Etc right now here in the
second sheet I have a specific list of
employees from HR department let's say I
have about 42 fingerprint IDs here right
now what I have to do is I have to
create a match function and
identify all the 42 HR department
employees in sheet 2 and tag them in
sheet one let's say this particular ID
belongs to an HR department then I
should be writing here employee
from HR department correct now we have
42 entries it is fine but let's say we
had 440 or 450 entries now would you
manually go and you know copy this and
go to this sheet find Control Paste and
find all would you do this task manually
would you do this match list manually
right 440 times this is truly timec
consuming right if there was one single
formula which you can use and identify
all those 450 employees in one go it
could be a miracle right now that's
exactly what we're going to do today so
we will be using an if condition we will
be using an ease num function and along
with that we will use the match function
so these are the three functions that we
are going to combine together and try to
identify the match between the two lists
and give an end result if the employee
belongs to the H department or or not
right now let's do that quickly now let
me write the formula equals to if
condition press after selected Now The
Logical test is at number so you might
be having a question is number since we
have uh the data in a mix and match it's
a number plus text Will this work for
only numbers or will this only work for
alphabets no worry it works with both
numbers as well as character type data
types now I'm going to select the ease
number function now comes the match
function so use the match function press
tab to select now the lookup value so
the first lookup value will be this
particular value which is in the cell A2
don't worry it will automatically change
when the formula enters to the next cell
right when it enters to A3 it will I
mean when it enters to B3 this A2 will
become A3 so no doubt on that now it
will be A2 comma the look up array which
array should I look to find the match so
the lookup array is right over here I'm
ignoring A1 we starting from A2 to all
the way up till
a43 so we have provided the lookup range
or lookup array now the match we want
the exact match no matter what right so
press St to select the exact match now
close this particular match function now
if this condition matches then we should
be typing it as or we should be getting
an end result as employee belongs to HR
department and if not you can just so
you know kind of write another text so
the formula is not completely closed
okay just ignore it okay now we have to
close the bracket with the leading
values so the match function is closed
and after that we need to close the ease
number function now comes to the uh if
condition so if it is true appr then add
this particular value that is employed
from HR
department if not other department okay
other or you can also leave it as blank
okay so this is the formula press enter
so this particular ID belongs to other
department let's eliminate this now
let's drag okay let's name it as EMP
Department details
now let's drag the formula across there
you go now you can also add a boundary
border and now you can add a filter and
uh filter this particular table for
employee from HR department and there is
a small error in the formula but no
problem let's remove the filter and
check the error I think it should be
about fixing the ranges so so let's fix
the range function F4 so we want U the
column to be fixed and the row numbers
can change and here the range what we
are looking at so let's give the range
once again now let's fix fix the range
F4 to fix there you go now enter and we
can also remove this for now I don't
think we need this enter and now drag
the formula yes there you go we have all
the 42 entries so previously there was a
small fixing error so we need to fix the
range of elements that we are looking at
now just eliminate the blanks and just
select employee IDs and there you go you
have all your 42 employees present in
the HR department so that's exactly how
you use the match function to match a
list of elements from from one array and
match it with another array so here I
have already created a sample pelp
generator so here we have some data
validation methods to select the
employee details let's say I want to go
with Brian and here we have his employee
ID his full name and the month March
right and apart from that the number of
hours worked you know and here the total
number of hours he logged in was this
and number of times his client call got
cancelled or he was on a sick leave
casual leave in the month of March and
the total rate for each and every event
so if it's logined he'll get about 45 $5
and in case if he on a leave due to a
client call cancel he'll get $20 for
sick leave $30 casually leave $25 and
public holiday is $30 and end of the day
we can just you know multiply these two
values to get his final salary right so
if we drag this sell across overall here
so we'll get a salary for March right so
this is real time so you just select the
employee name and here you just select
the month which is about present in this
particular sheet here and you will get
all the details right and here is the
time sheet for the month of March and
all the employees will logged in and
what are the events happening right so
this seems interesting but how did we
create it and how come we have all the
employees here without any duplications
when you can see there is a complete
duplicate entries or two three times
entries over here right how did we
filter this out and how did we export
this data into a face lip generator and
how is it looking up at all those values
and how is it summing up the salary
right so we have multiple uh uh formulas
and functions implemented in this
particular fa lip generator so without
further delay let's try to recreate this
particular pay list or pay slip
generator so firstly we will create a
sorted and filtered list let's quickly
rename this as sorted and filtered
employee
list so what we're going to do is
firstly we will try to import entire
list of all the employees present in
this particular organization by using
the unique function you guess that right
so we are just fetching the unique
values one time only for once into this
particular list and we will also if
possible it's not mandatory but here I
have sorted them in the alphabetical
order right so that it is a little bit
easier for you to track now let's try to
name this as
employe right and here I will use the
unique function you and I Q E just tap
to select the function and the array is
here so we have converted this
particular you know table into an actual
table using the controlt function in
Excel and I'll select this particular
you can see that highlighted downside
Arrow right in the bold black color so
that means it is pointing to select the
entire column just click that line and
there you go your entire column has been
selected now this is one way of or one
part of extracting the unique functions
now another one is to try to sort these
employees list in the alphabetical order
right so I'll be using the sort function
over here press tab to select now close
the bracket over here and press press
enter now you have the entire list of
employees in the alphabetical order and
there is no chance for any duplication
in this particular list right so this is
part one you can just quickly save your
file so that you don't miss any track
right and uh the next one is the
activities so one they have logged in
second one they've logged in and by some
reason the client call or the business
meeting has been cancelled so they are
sitting up or they don't have anything
to do maybe they're logging off early
right so that is the second situation
third one is an actual sick leave fourth
one is a planned casual leave and the
fifth one is a public holiday so mostly
many organization five we now we will
copy and paste these uh activities or
events into this particular sheet over
here which has sorted and filtered list
of employees now we are going to
calculate the month here so you can add
month and here you can deal with the
same Mar data that we have used here you
can just copy and paste that value over
here as well so you can also manually
write it down as March 2024 March April
2024 anything correct now we're dealing
with this particular March data so we
will proceed with March data as well now
the last one this can be named as
pay slip
generator right so so if we check the
Bas Li generator over here what we have
here is the first one employee name
right so you can first add that
particular employee select option over
here right select employee and here you
will name or you will try to add the
employee name so if you check this
particular sheet to I have the data
validation option enabled here I can
just select the employees from the
dropdown so let's try to create a drop
down over here equals to or you can just
go to data option here just click the
sale and go to the data option over here
and here you have columns click the drop
down option and go to data validation
now here instead of any value go to list
and here you can give the list of
employees that you recently filter this
is one way of doing it but what's the
downside of it let's say I add a new
employee over here okay let's cancel
this operation right away and let's say
I add a new employee right here maybe as
Jonathan he's a new joiny he's an intern
or you know he is a new joiny something
like that so when I add Jonathan over
here the data validation from this
particular section would not be able to
identify him as a new joiny the list
will end at this place which is this one
right so we don't want that to be
happening now we need to operate on a
different approach for creating this
particular data value validation option
so the approach is really simple if you
just get into this particular sorted
list over here and if you check this
list you can see we have uh the First
Column as employe starting from snoper
to all the way to the last jnan right
now what we need to do is create a new
formula so just enter into the formula
option right away here and use the
defined name option so that you're
defined a new formula all together and
here you can type it down as employee so
you'll list of
employees list of employees you can
write an underscore so that the formula
doesn't uh get confused so here we
have so where it is referring to right
so it is referring to this particular
column so a to a so just add an hashtag
over here so that uh it will
automatically update if there is any new
addition to the list now here we'll
create a data validation go to data and
data tools data validation and instead
of any value go to list and here you
will type the source as equal to
employee there you go uh maybe we have
to do a light change over here okay now
go to sort so here we generated a
formula so okay let's try to review that
formula over here list okay
and so let's go to the employees list
select the first cell over here there
you go and Define a name so the name
will be
EMP list sorted and filtered employees
so here you will be adding a hash so we
have we have written the hash after this
now we want that to go along with the
entire spell from second cell to the
entire existence of that particular list
right in case if there is a new addition
you can enter that new addition and
consider that as an employee right so
youve done that just press okay there
you go now go to the pp generator and
here create a data validation option
let's clear this now go to data data
validation and here you will be
selecting a list and here you will be
writing
EMP list that you just created press
okay now you have the employees list and
in case if you add a new employee at the
end he will also he or she will also be
considered as an employee now part of
the job is done the next is a few more
details like uh the
employee number and employee
name and let's check the yeah the month
correct so now how would you generate
the employee number so employee number
is like fetching when it comes to
fetching nothing is better than a lookup
function or an index match let's proceed
with a lookup function i' go with v
lookup since it's my favorite one so
this B2 will be my lookup value and the
lookup uh table is this particular table
go to a corner and give that this is the
table you are looking get you want the
second column which states to the
payroll ID or employee ID and I want an
exact match close the bracket and there
you go now select the employee number or
employee name here and you will have the
employee number right here and here you
want to add the employee name which is
this particular cell whatever is present
in that particular cell is your employee
name and here you want to add the month
which is this particular month which we
are currently correct so far so good now
we want to create the faft generator so
first if we take a look at this
particular one here we have the
activity and here we have the number of
hours and salary now let's copy the same
is it in our fael generator right here
some formatting if you feel
like there you go we have our formatting
ready and here as well and here we will
add our hours and rate and
salary there you go and I think we
already predefined our rates so copy and
paste the r right
here now we need to calculate the number
of hours logged in and for that we will
be using a simple sumf function equals
to sufs so you need to pay a little
attention to this particular sums
function because everything relies on
how you are freezing the cell values so
you might be a little confused so you
can understand what I mean during the
execution of the sumf function so sumf
and now the sum range so the sum range
is nothing but the hours table right
over here just click on the hours comma
so after hours we will be selecting the
employe correct so the person who is
working which is this particular column
just navigate your Cur
to the location where the cell B2 and B3
are intersecting which is a black line
over there so you can see that
particular Mouse icon which is which
looks like a lower pointing downward
Arrow key just click that downward Arrow
key and your column will be selected and
that's next one now comes the critical
part so you need to go back to the pelp
generator over here and select the
employee name so employee my name is
existing in cell B5 so select B5 try to
freeze it function F4 so that this value
doesn't change because we going to drag
this formula across the next four
activities so when you drag the formula
the formula should be pointing to B5 but
not succeed to B6 B7 Etc right that's
the major thing which you need to make
sure and after that you need to find the
activity right
so go back to the time sheet data and
here is the activity or status Point
your mouse pointer to that particular
location where G3 and G2 intersect so
that you get the downward Arrow key just
click that there you go comma Now comes
another major part pelp generator sheet
so now we are on the pelp generator so
we need an if condition so it needs to
identify if the activity is what's
present in
cell D3 or D4 D5 D6 D7 based on the
table what we have then printed the way
it is and if not just the way it should
be right so you will understand that
more clearly when we start with the F
condition just select the if condition
press tab to select and cell location D3
if D3 is equals to the activity which is
logged in then it should be nothing just
blank if not then it should have locked
in which is again
D3 now close the brackets so close the
functions there you go now press enter
there you have it number of hours now
just drag this formula across all the
rows and you have it so now you have a
realtime pelp generator just uh change
some employees to check if our formula
is working and it's working fine you can
also eliminate the leading zeros but let
but let's keep it right every minute
counts now the final one the salary slip
generator so
E3 Cross or star into the rate enter now
you can drag the same formula across all
the cells to find the total salary now
you can also do a final customization
over here just copy and paste the cell
and drag this and uh you can merge to
salary can even B this here you can have
some of all this enter the final salary
you can also do some formatting so there
you go that's how you can create a
realtime automated BP generator in Excel
