hey everyone i'm shamley and i welcome
you all to this new video of simply
learn on merkle tree in blockchain
in this video at first we will see some
of the use cases of merkle tree
and then we will understand what is a
merkle tree
followed by what is a marble root
after which we will explore about
cryptographic hash functions in
blockchain
and then we will understand how mongol
tree exactly works
after which we will discuss the benefits
of mochal3
and at last we will explore why is it
essential to blockchain
so without much delay let's get started
with the video
but before starting let's have a quick
look at some general use cases of merkle
tree
of course there are more merkle trees
implementations out there git a
distributed version control system is
one of the most widely used it is used
to handle projects by programmers from
all around the world
interplanetary file system a
peer-to-peer distributed protocol is
another suitable implementation
it's also open source allowing computers
to join and use a centralized file
system
merkle trees are used to benefit of
certificate authorities as well
it's part of the technique that
generates verifiable certificate
transparency logs
the final use case we'll look at is
database systems like amazon dynamodb
and apache cassandra
during the data replication process
merkle trees are used by these no sql
distributed databases to control
discrepancies
now the very first thing we will discuss
is what is a mockultry
merkle trees also defined as binary hash
trees are a type of data structure
commonly used in computer science
merkle trees are used to encrypt
blockchain data more effectively and
securely in bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies
it's a mathematical data structure made
up of hashes of various transactions of
various data blocks
in a particular blockchain network
which acts as a summary of all the
transactions in a block
it also enables quick and secure content
verification across big data sets it
also helps to verify the consistency and
content of the data
now that we know about the merkle tree
let's explore what is a merkle root
a merkle root is a simple mathematical
method for confirming the facts on a
mogul tree
they are used in cryptocurrency to
ensure that data blocks sent through a
peer-to-peer network are whole undamaged
and unaltered muggle roots play a
crucial role
in the computation required to keep
cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether
running
now that we know hash is a big part of
mughal tree let's dive down and have a
look at some of the cryptographic hash
functions
a hash function maps any type of
arbitrary data of any length to a fixed
size output it is commonly used in
cryptography since it is a cryptographic
hash function
the hash functions are efficiently
known for one property they can't be
reversed it's a one-way function that's
only meant to work in one direction
message direct secure hash function and
ripe message direct are some of the hash
families available
now let's take an example if you use the
sha 256 hash algorithm and pass 101
blockchains as input
you will get the following output
this concludes that hash functions have
the following key properties
deterministic
pre-image resistant computationally
efficient
cannot be reversed engineered
and collision resistant
now that we know about various aspects
of the merkle tree let's understand how
the mercury works
now that we have a basic understanding
of hash functions we can move on to the
working of mobile trees
a merkle tree totals all transaction in
a block and generates a digital
fingerprint of the entire set of
operations
allowing the user to verify whether a
transaction is included in the block
merkle trees are made by hashing pairs
of nodes repeatedly
until only one hash remains
this hash is known as the merkle root or
the root hash
they are built from the bottom using
transaction ids which are hashes of
individual transactions
each non-leaf node is a hash of its
previous hash and every leaf node is a
hash of transactional data of each block
here's the example of a mokul tree to
help you understand the concept
consider the following scenario
a b c and d are four transactions all
executed on the same block
each transaction is then hashed leaving
us with hash a
hash b
hash c
and hash d
now the hashes are paired together
resulting in hash a b
and hash cd
a mogul root is formed by combining
these two hashes
hash a b
c
d
in reality a merkle tree is much more
complicated especially when each
transaction id is 64 characters long
but this should give you a good concept
of how the algorithms work and why they
are so effective
now let's explore the benefits of mogul
tree
merkle trees provide four significant
advantages validate the data's integrity
it can be used to effectively validate
the data's integrity
takes little disk
space when compared to other data
structures the mogul tree takes up very
little disk space
timely information across networks
muggle trees can be broken down into
small pieces of data for verification
and efficient verification the data
format is efficient and verifying the
data's integrity takes only a few
moments
now that we know the benefits of murkle
free let's explore how it is essential
to blockchain
let's imagine a blockchain without
mercury to get a sense of how vital they
are for blockchain technology
we'll focus on bitcoin because it's use
of mongol trees is not only important
for the cryptocurrency but also simple
to grasp
if bitcoin didn't include morgle trees
for example every node on the mob
network would have to retain a complete
copy of every single bitcoin transaction
ever made you can imagine how much
information that would be
any authentication request on bitcoin
would require an enormous amount of data
to be transferred on the over the
network therefore you'll need to
validate the data on your own
to confirm that
there were no modifications a computer
used for validation would need a lot of
computing power to compare ledgers
well merkel tree are a solution to this
issue they hash records and accounting
thereby separating the proof of data
from the data itself proving that giving
tiny amounts of information across the
network is all that is required for a
transaction to be valid
furthermore it enables you to
demonstrate that both ledger variations
are identical in terms of nominal
computer power and network bandwidth
well that is all about mercury we have
almost reached the end of this video if
i missed anything important do let me
know in the comment section i hope you
