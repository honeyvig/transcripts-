hey what's up Traders my name is Matthew
I've been trading for about 7 years and
in that time I have used trading view
pretty much every day of my life and so
in today's video I'm going to be showing
you guys everything you need to know
about the trading view platform and how
to navigate its interface let's get
[Music]
started all right so first of all up
here we have our profile menu sltrading
view general settings so if you come
down to your profile here is where you
can see your account and billing and the
partner program so the partner program
is an affiliate program where you can
get paid for referring other traders to
trading view I'm not going to lie that's
a big part of why I do this particular
video every few years um so if you find
this video helpful you can find my link
below in the video description if you
want to support the channel so I won't
click on any of these links because
they'll take me off the charts here The
Help Center this is where you will find
a lot of information about how trading
view works so if something isn't covered
in this video or you don't understand
something that I go over this is the
first place you should look for
information it's very extensive Now
notifications relate to your trading
view profile these aren't related to
your trading and they're just like the
social aspects of trading view which
we'll go over later in the video then we
have their what's new change log that
will explain the latest changes or new
features we have dark mode uh we have
the drawings panel which is this panel
on the left you can turn that on or off
you can change your language then you
have your keyboard shortcuts this is
quite useful I have not memorized um the
vast majority of these shortcuts and
then finally we have the desktop app
which I don't use very often uh but it
has come a long way since it was
initially released if you use trading
view a lot and you don't want to um have
it as a tab in your browser I recommend
getting the Standalone app everything in
the app is basically identical to what
I'll show you today so if if you want to
use the app you can still follow along
with today's guide next we have our
symbol list so if you click on this
search uh little icon here we can type
in the various markets that we want to
analyze um so we have every Market you
could ever think of is listed on trading
view from currencies to stocks to uh
cryptocurrency uh Commodities um
everything we have indices bonds even
economic data so you can actually chart
um things like the unemployment rate now
it says here that the interval for
unemployment is a monthly only data set
but here we go uh let's see how many of
you know what this represents um Pop
Quiz you can leave a comment below if
you know what caused this Christmas tree
to appear on the unemployment rate chart
now the symbol search has a few options
we can actually do things like perform
basic arithmetic between two market so
we could divide the Euro doll rate
divided by um unemployment rate and hit
enter and now we're charting the euro
dollar relationship to the American
unemployment rate probably useless
information to know uh but it's pretty
cool that we can do that with trading
view that's a more advanced application
of of trading view obviously if you're a
begin at to trading view I wouldn't mess
around with this stuff but it's nice to
know we have this functionality it's
pretty unique to trading view I don't
know of any other charting platforms
that allow this sort of thing at least
not this easily you can load up the
chart within a minute and have pretty
wacky chart information from all kinds
of sources price sources so that's a
really cool thing about trading view
it's very robust it's very extensive so
you can search for any Market here um
for example if I wanted to see uh let's
search for Tesla stock you can just type
in the company name and here is the
ticker there are multiple sources for
this particular stock um so make sure
you click the correct exchange uh when
you are looking for a particular Market
in this list so let's go to a normal
chart here let's go to euro dollar and
this next button here will compare this
symbol to another symbol so let's add
the Aussie dollar to this chart now we
are comparing the two price sources on
the same chart again this is a more
advanced um concept that trading view
offers I wouldn't recommend playing
around with this until you're very
experience with trading View and trading
but that button can come in handy when
you're analyzing markets against each
other especially when you're analyzing
things like correlation seeing how a
market behaves in conjunction with
another Market or when compared to
another Market moving on we have our
time intervals so these are pretty
self-explanatory if you don't know what
a time frame is or a Candlestick chart
is I'd recommend um researching that uh
but basically these just show the Open
high low and close of this time interval
so right now we're on a monthly chart so
each bar here is representing how price
unfolded within that month green bars
mean it closed higher than it opened red
bars mean it closed lower than it opened
and there are all kinds of time
intervals you can choose from here we
even have range bar charts which I again
don't recommend you try until you're
very experienced with trading but we
have a lot of options here and depending
on your trading plan you can even go all
the way down to Second charts so I can
see what euro dollar is doing second to
second if I want to
I wouldn't recommend trading this time
frame but you can if you want to you can
even type in your own time interval so
if I wanted to see the 33 minute chart
for whatever reason I can just type in
33 hit enter and now every bar on my
chart is representing 33 minutes um so
yeah another very cool feature of
trading view that most platforms do not
offer is custom time sessions moving on
we have our candle type so if you if
you're more familiar with bar charts you
might want to set this to bars but we
have a whole bunch of other options here
we can use a line chart there's a high
low close area so remember I mentioned
that candles have a high an open a low
and a close this shows the high the low
and the close as an area so there's
quite a few exotic options here we even
have Japanese candlesticks so hik and
ashy is what is referred to as a
synthetic bar chart so this is showing
us synthetic price action based on
averages
so these are no longer representing open
high low and close but are representing
averages of price action I'm not going
to go into the math Behind These candles
that's outside the scope of today's
video the whole point of today's video
is to introduce you to these settings
and let's leave it on candles for now
because that's the easiest chart to read
as a beginner or bar charts if you're
more familiar with that but I'll leave
mine as candles next up we have
indicators so this is the main advantage
of trading view trading view has access
to thousands and thousands of indicators
some of them are pretty useless so I
wouldn't recommend adding indicators
just because you can less indicators is
better when it comes to trading I think
that's an objective truth if you can
develop a profitable trading system with
as few indicators as possible that's a
good thing do not add indicators to your
chart just because you can in the
beginning obviously you want to
experiment you want to learn so you
should do that but when it comes to
trading less is more the more noise you
add to your chart the harder it is to
read um that's just an objective truth
when it comes to analyzing statistics
and data so unless you really know what
you're doing and you have a very good
reason for adding an indicator to your
chart don't do it I've seen some
screenshots of people's charts where
they have like you know let's just add a
whole bunch of onto my chart right
now and you can see how very quickly uh
this can become quite unreadable now
this looks a bit silly but you'd be
surprised I get screenshots from Traders
more often than I wish I did where their
charts look like this and it's like a
children's drawing um do not do this if
your chart looks like this do yourself a
favor right click the chart and click
remove indicators and start again using
one or two at a time you'll thank me for
it later if you're a new Trader now if
you're looking for a particular
indicator you can type in the indicator
name here so for example a common
indicator is the RSI we can type in RSI
here is relative strength index I have
favored it using this little star icon
so it shows up very quickly when I
search for it click on that and we've
added that to our chart very simple just
quickly you can also adjust the settings
for this indicator if you come down with
your mouse over the name of the
indicator there are a few buttons here
if I have multiple indicators on my
chart let's add another indicator let's
add the macd that's another commonly
used indicator um if I hover over the
name of this indicator we have an i icon
so I can hide these if I want to or I
can open up the settings menu by
clicking on this little Cog and now we
can adjust parameters for the indicator
we can even adjust the style so we can
change certain colors of things um
trading view is a very visual based
charting platform and it has a plethora
of visual options for all of its um
scripts you can change the color of your
chart the background color you can
change the candle colors you can change
indicator colors uh you can change the
color of basically anything which means
you can get carried away with that uh
but it's a good feature to have because
it really allows you to customize your
charts and and make your chart work for
you um visibility we can even turn off
this indicator on certain time frames so
if I turn off minutes this will no
longer display between 1 minute and 59
minute time frames I personally don't
use this at all but there are reasons
you would if you're analyzing multiple
time frames there might be certain
indicators that you don't care to
analyze on certain time frames um so you
might want to hide them when you're
cycling through your different intervals
so that's indicator settings we can also
open the source code now my main um sort
of vocation on YouTube is teaching pin
script I also teach other uh charting
platforms like real test and I also
teach just general trading um techniques
and things I've learned that have helped
my trading in the past six or seven
years of trading so if you want to learn
pin scripts there is tons of content on
my channel you can go and check out or
you can check check out our website at
pinescript mastery.com I have a free
Basics course there that goes for over 3
hours and we'll introduce you to the
basics of pinescript um but that's
outside the scope of today's video so
we're not going to click on this button
just yet I I'll click on it and show you
the what the code looks like um it's a
bit overwhelming at first but I do have
courses explaining exactly what all this
means and how to write your own scripts
to analyze price your own way so make
sure to check that out if you are
interested you can also click this
button to remove an indicator and then
finally we have these little ellipses
here this allows you to do things like
uh move I can merge these two indicators
into the same indicator um I can move
the macd above onto price so now we have
it overlaying over price I can move it
um to a new pane below and now we have
the macd above the RSI so I won't go
over all of these settings because
they're pretty self-explanatory just two
things I will go over the first one is
adding alerts so you can add alerts to
this indicator and here are the list of
options so if the macd goes from falling
to Rising uh we can generate an alert
that will trigger on our chart or our
phone depending on what settings you
select here you can be notified in the
phone app so you can download the mobile
app and this notification will appear on
your phone or you can show a popup on
your chart or send an email to yourself
you can even automate your trading using
web hooks that's something something I
cover on my channel how to use pine
connector to automate Forex Trading
strategies through trading view alerts
you can play sounds when the alerts fire
this is fantastic for day Traders people
who need to be alerted while they're
sitting at their computer you can click
play sound and your chart will beep when
a alert is fired you can also set up
alerts by clicking on this button up
here alerts and you can select the
indicator or the price chart that you
want to trigger alerts on you can select
your condition so if you were to select
greater than zero then this alert would
fire every time because price will
always hopefully be greater than zero
you can put in an alert name and a
message here and you can even use
placeholders to replace these
placeholders with chart information so
we could replace this value with close
and this would then be replaced with the
closing price of whatever is added to
our chart now the final thing I want to
mention with indicators is that you can
also add indicators is on indicators so
this gets a bit Inception like um we
could add an RSI to the macd uh for
example and now we have an RSI plotting
based on the um numbers generated by the
macd so again that's an advanced concept
that we won't go into any further in
this video but for those of you who are
experienced Traders you can add
indicators on indicators there are a ton
of community scripts that you can choose
from when add indicators to your chart I
won't go into these in today's video
I'll leave these for you to play around
with in your own time um there are tons
and tons and tons and tons of scripts to
choose from again as I mentioned earlier
some of them are terrible some of them
are trash and some of them are fantastic
so you won't really know what's what
until you become more more experienced
as a Trader but uh yeah there are a lot
of options here which is one of the
strengths of trading view it can also be
one of the traps for new Traders so be
careful with what indicators you you add
to your chart as mentioned moving on we
have our indicator templates this isn't
something I use personally but depending
on how you've set up your indicators you
can save a template and load it onto
your chart very quickly and easily using
this button here I already went over
alerts the next feature really really
valuable feature that trading view
offers is the uh replay bar replay
feature so if I click on this and then I
select any bar on my chart all of the
information to the right is Now hidden
and we can simulate price unfolding
using these um this interface down below
here so if I change the speed to One
update per second and click play we can
now watch price unfold one bar at a time
this is fantastic for discretionary
Traders or back testers people who want
to practice and simulate what their
system is like so for example here we
have a key high if I press alt on a on a
Windows computer or command on a Mac and
hit H that'll put a horizontal line on
this uh High here so let's simulate what
it might be like to trade a false
breakout here we've had price break out
of this high and then close dramatically
back below this high so we could use our
short tool I'll come to this bar um
after we've finished with the top bar
here but if I select short and place it
right here at the close of this Spar put
my stop loss above the high let's put
our take profit down at the lows here um
now I can simulate price action
unfolding and see what would have
happened had I taken this trade as it is
this is a great way to practice trading
to learn how to read price um or to back
test a systematic trading system so if
you're a systematic Trader a rules-based
Trader you come up with a trading plan
with your rules and you can simulate it
on historical data to make sure that it
is profitable I have some videos on my
Channel about back testing and strategy
development so go and check that out if
you're new to to trading so now let's
click sell I've just placed a sell order
and now I can hover my mouse over this
sell order I can drag my stop loss up to
where I put the top of this stop loss I
can take my take profit all the way down
here and now we're simulating a trade
using trading views inbuilt simulation
um demo trading simulation this is
pretend money obviously we can't trade
price that's already unfolded that'll be
nice but we can simulate price action so
here I have a about a 4 stop loss and a
$7 take profit I can hit play and we can
see how price unfolded after placing
this trade um and we can click this
button to jump forward if you want to
speed things up a bit or we can adjust
our speed here I can say uh let's go 3x
so now we're unfolding three times as
fast three updates per second there we
go profitable simulated trade you get
the idea so bar replay tool is very very
useful for beginner Traders I recommend
using it if you're new to trading it's a
great way to practice these buttons here
are your undo and redo buttons um so if
I draw something here I can click undo
and I can click redo to bring it back
next up on our top bar we have our chart
layouts and you can see there are a lot
to choose from now depending on your
trading view plan you may or may not
have access to the vast majority of
these I'm on the highest Pro Plan so I
have access to everything trading view
has to offer um including a whole bunch
of chart layouts now most most of these
are obscure and exotic and you wouldn't
really use them most of the time some of
the most valuable ones are these ones
here where you can analyze two time
frames side by side so here I have the
daily chart let's go down on the
15-minute chart now we have the
15-minute chart and the daily chart of
the same Market on the one screen so
where price is down here on this daily
chart is where it is right now on this
15-minute chart this is a great tool for
um day Traders swing Traders traders who
analyze higher time frame to inform
their lower time frame training
decisions very very valuable tool we
also have a ton of exotic options here
so if I click on this eight grid here
now we have eight different markets
they're all the same Market but we could
change these if you wanted two we could
have eight different markets loaded onto
the
one um monitor this is most useful for
um having a screen in your office that
analyzes the M the the market you like
to trade maybe you have a watch list of
eight different markets that you like to
trade maybe the eight you know eight
various currencies you could have a big
TV in your office or a big screen in
your office um can you really call
yourself a Trader unless you have a
monitor in your office dedicated for
trading charts I'm joking you can um but
many Traders do have that you'll notice
on YouTube and stuff like that uh I did
for a long time I don't really anymore
because I trade end of day data now so I
don't really need it but back when I was
uh doing a lot of intraday trading I had
monitors all over my house with um this
sort of layout on it and I could at a
glance see what each Market's up to
that's the main use case of these
different layouts but the split screen
one is great for day Traders and and
multimarket multi-time frame analysis
and then down here you can sync various
things in your layout so if I click
symbol that will sync the symbols so if
I change my symbol here to Kaden both
markets will change at the same time but
we keep our time frame but we could sync
the interval and now both markets are on
the same interval you wouldn't have
these two turned on at the same time
most of the time because it defeats the
purpose if you have both charts showing
the same thing and what's the point but
you might want the same interval but
different markets different symbols or
the same symbol different time frames or
intervals that's how you sync them here
you can also sync the Crosshair so you
can see if I change this chart to to the
daily chart and I hover my mouse over
yesterday's price you can see I'm trying
to use my left hand to show you guys but
you can't see that obviously so I'll
just have to use the mouse if you look
up here when I hover my mouse over this
yesterday's bar you can see that my
Crosshair is synced across to the lower
time frame and that's it the same with
Time same with date range this is just
ways to syn all of your charts together
now I'll go back to a single chart for
the rest of the video over here we have
have our chart layout options so here
you can see I have a few um chart
options if I click trading for example
that will take me to my trading template
you can see I have a couple of
indicators here I have a 50 period
moving average and a RS sign some volume
and ATR indicator those are the main
indicators I use to trade or analyze
price action um but let's go back to
trading view guide I haven't made any
changes so I don't need to save anything
so here are a few options you can share
your chart to other people so you can
share your link to friends or other
Traders maybe you have a trading Mentor
that you want to show information to you
can share your chart to that person by
turning this on and sharing the link so
click copy link send that to someone and
they can see your chart they can see a
snapshot a mirror image of what's on
your chart auto save I'd recommend
leaving on unless you have a reason to
turn it off this will just automatically
save any changes you make to this
template um every few seconds or so you
can rename the template
you can make a copy you can also export
your chart data to excel so if I click
this button I'll get a um spreadsheet
file saved to my desktop computer which
I can then import into other software or
I can perform analysis on that data or
data for you Americans out there um I'm
not going to do that today cuz that's
obviously outside the scope of the video
and this video will already be long
enough as it is but for those of you who
are Advanced Traders or down the road
when you become an advanced Trader this
option is here for you guys here here
you can create a new layout here you can
load a layout if you have a lot of
layouts you might need to click this to
find them I only have four so all of
mine show up here next we have quick
search I don't know what this does I've
never used it before to be honest so
this searches for drawings functions and
settings um okay so we're searching for
drawings here I've personally never used
this feature before to be honest this is
first time I've even clicked on it um so
I'm not really sure how useful it is I
used trading view for about 7 years now
so I just know where everything is I
don't really need this tool but I guess
it would be helpful if you're looking
for a particular thing that's buried um
within one of these drop- down lists
there are a ton of drawing tools with
trading view I use a fraction of them I
use maybe a dozen at most and most of
those uh line tools just simple drawing
tools but if you're looking for a tool
that you can't find for example if
you're looking for line tools you can
type up in here line and here we go next
we have this Cog wheel here which is for
our chart settings so this is where we
can change our
Candlestick um style so we can change
the color of our candles so the left
color is bullish candles the right color
is bearish candles um so we can make our
chart look very wacky if we want to so
red and green is not your thing there
are some trading psychologists out there
who recommend changing these colors to
more neutral colors because red usually
means bad green usually means good in
trading that's a bad way to think
because you can obviously make money in
both directions so perhaps you might
want to tra uh change this to black and
white you can change all of this to
black and white it's going to look a bit
dodgy on a on a dark background but you
get the idea maybe we change these to
Blue um so now we have blue and white
candles a lot more neutral colors uh we
have our price line here here so if I
turn that on or off that's this line
down here might be a bit hard to see but
that's just tracking the current closing
price that's useful for when you're um
you know maybe you're looking a bit
further back and you want to see where
price is currently you can also display
the previous day close so in this case
that's very close to each other on this
Forex Market the day only opened a few
hours ago for me so um these lines are
very close to each other but this would
be useful especially on things like uh
stock markets where you want to see how
price is interacting with yesterday's
close and you can plot the high and low
of price action on your
chart and the bid ask spread which is
useful for uh day Traders it can show
you at a glance how bad the spread is um
the spread is just the difference
between where price currently is and
where your order would be filled if you
were to buy or sell on Lower time frames
this gets much worse so if we go down to
a 1 minute time frame you can see that
the spread is quite large um
comparatively speaking to recent price
action we have about eight 8 pip spread
on oanda or oanda that's the broker I'm
currently on if we go to a different
broker the spread will be different
pepper Stone have much tighter spreads
so tight in fact that they're not even
showing on my chart right now so uh
whatever you get the idea so there are
two ways to get to this setting you can
click on this button up here or you can
right click your chart and come down to
settings let's turn that off uh we have
Precision which is the Precision of your
price quote I recommend leaving this on
default and we have your time zone this
is an important setting for those of you
who um trade in time zones different to
your
exchange I've set this to my time zone
here in Brisbane Australia but you might
want to change this to your time zone so
that when you hover your mouse over a
candle it shows the current time of day
instead of the time of day related to
where the market is trading now let's
just quickly go through these other
options here we have status line that is
up here on the top left of your chart I
can turn the logo on or off the title on
or off open high low and close on or off
um the market status whether it's open
or not um that's usually easy to tell
just by if price is moving so I tend to
leave that off um bar change values so
it shows you the change between the last
closing price we can have volume
plotting up here instead of into its own
indicator box and last day change values
then we have scales uh I won't go over
all of these you can play around these
in in your own time I personally never
touch these settings I've never had any
reason to uh but there are a ton of
different label settings uh price scale
settings and time scale settings if I
went into every setting in detail in
this video it would be 10 hours long so
let's just quickly skip through all of
these again I don't touch any of these
in my own trading um or at least not
very often so canvas is actually kind of
useful we can actually change the color
of our canvas here so the background so
for example I could change my background
of solid and I can change it to Orange
if I wanted to I don't recommend that
color or I could change it to solid
black which actually looks pretty cool
on my monitor right now but yeah you
have a lot of settings here grid lines
you can turn on or off u based on the
transparency here so if I wanted my grid
lines to be very pronounced I could do
that so a lot of options here to work
with um I'll leave these for you to play
around with but now you know where to
find them trading we have our Buy sell
buttons so if I was logged into my
broker I could click these buttons here
to initiate a buy or sell order I'm not
sure what instant orders placement does
uh you'd have to be logged into your
broker to test this but I imagine that
it just doesn't show a confirm option
when you're clicking buy or sell on
those buttons you can turn on sounds um
you can turn on or off your positions on
the actual chart so when you've got an
order filled on your chart you can turn
the display of your open positions on or
off or you can turn your profit and loss
on or off you can change the setting
here to percentage uh beginner Traders I
would recommend keeping this as
percentage so that you don't get your
emotions wrapped up in a trade when I
first began trading turning off my p&l
alog together really helped with uh my
trading psychology helped me be a better
Trader and focus on process over outcome
um but changing this to percentage also
helps because you're not looking at the
dollar amount you're looking at the
percentage of your account balance um
and then we have orders I believe this
shows order execution so it will show a
label on the chart where you bought and
sold and um there's a whole bunch of
options here that I'll leave for you
guys to play around with um I recommend
logging into a demo trading account
before you start playing with these
settings just open a demo trade buy or
sell trade and start playing with these
settings see what they do on your chart
because each broker is probably going to
have a different effect with some of
these settings next up we have events so
this will show economic events for
example if I turn that on and we go to
Aussie do I believe there's an RBA
decision coming out later today and that
should show up here it is click on that
RBA interest rate decision so you can
see let me change my um template
settings back to defaults so the colors
aren't so wacky so down here you can see
we have economic events displaying as a
calendar entry so at 1:30 p.m. my time
there will be a um Australian interest
rate decision from the central bank here
in Australia so that's obviously
important information to know if we go
down to a 50-minute time frame you can
see if I hold alt and hit V I can now
Mark that when price gets to this line I
better be careful with any open
positions I better not open any trades
close to this line because there will be
a major economic decision happening
there I don't think the market will be
surpris when the Central Bank keeps
rates as they are so this will probably
be a non-event uh for for today's
announcement but sometimes these events
can be major they can really have a
major impact on price so it's important
to be aware of them and I would
recommend leaving that on unless you
have a good reason to turn it off um you
can even turn on this line so you can
see a vertical line there something I
haven't gone over is you can change the
thickness and the color of these lines
in uh by clicking on these buttons and
and the settings show up down here so
now I can see a big thick Green Line
telling me that at this time of day
there will be a major news news
announcement and I didn't have to place
that with my drawing tools that's all
handled by this setting here let's turn
that off I don't know what latest news
in Minds is H that's this purple line
here oh this is just economic news um I
ignore this entirely and I would
recommend you turn this off because no
one knows what the Market's going to do
next any better than you do well some
might know better than you do if they
studied economics their entire life but
markets are random and and unpredictable
B don't listen to especially not the
news don't listen to economic news
because journalists certainly don't know
any more than you do about markets so
ignore these altogether would be my
advice that's what I've done the past
seven years and it served me very well
I'm doing just fine with my trading
without reading any economic news almost
ever I read Bloomberg articles from time
to time to stay in the loop of what's
going on with the global economics but I
don't use that information to inform my
trading I'm a purely technical Trader
rules-based systematic technical Trader
and I do just fine without following the
news here you can display your alert
lines uh I don't have any alerts on my
chart so nothing is displaying but you
can turn that on or off here so that's
it for our chart settings here we have
full screen mode um you can see that
took away all of my control panels This
is useful mostly for monitor charts so
sometimes I might you know when I'm day
trading or I want to keep tabs on an
important Market um um development I
might have a chart on a monitor in my
office that's set to full screen like
this and it just shows price action
without any of the Clutter on my chart
but if I hit Escape that will take me
out of that mode next we have snapshot
so this will take a chart snapshot you
can either download the image copy the
image or copy the link um you can tweet
the image if you want to tell the whole
world what you think about a market if
you think anyone cares or you can click
open a new tab and this will show show a
snapshot of my chart there we go and I
can share this image I can save it um
this is great for journaling so when
you're a beginner Trader or even just a
experienced Trader you should be keeping
a regular journal sometimes having
visual imagery to accompany that journal
can help so this is a quick and easy way
to take a snapshot of your analysis
let's say we let's say we uh you know
Drew this line and we were expecting
this breakout and a retest before it
happened let's say price happened here
and we uh let's say price is here and we
we're expecting a retest of this trend
line and continuation we might want to
take a snapshot of this with some text
analysis expecting retest plus
continuation um now I can take a
snapshot save this for future reference
and I can analyze my price uh my trading
and see how I'm doing over time if I
wanted
to um and then finally the final button
on this top bar we've only just gotten
to the end of this top bar this video is
already quite long we have a fair amount
more to go but we're well past halfway
of the main features of trading view a
lot of these other features are optional
um and the drawing tools are all pretty
self-explanatory but let's finish this
top bar at least by going over the
publish options so here you can publish
an idea so this will publish your chart
along with the description
so I if you haven't noticed by now from
my offhand remarks I'm not a fan of
sharing analysis with the world I don't
think it matters I don't care what
Traders think about my trading I don't
care what other Traders are doing I just
care about my system what's my system
doing how is my system performing and I
don't really care what other people's
systems are doing I don't trade their
system I don't understand the systems I
don't care about their analysis so I
don't ever look at ideas on trading view
it's just not something that I care
about I have published ideas in the past
especially when I was a beginner Trader
again that's kind of the cycle a lot of
beginner Traders get wrapped up in this
stuff um and when I started to see
success as a Trader in the beginning
stages I used to share some of my ideas
but I don't do that anymore I just don't
don't care I don't have time for it um I
don't think it serves the trading
Community very much to share um
speculation my hypothesis on where price
might go it's just it's not not helpful
I don't think to most people now if you
have a following if you have a signal
service and you're sharing your trading
ideas with Traders then obviously maybe
this is useful for you but for me I
don't use that you can record video
ideas which is just another way of
wasting people's time in my opinion
unless you're sharing education I could
share this video I could record this
video and share this on trading view I
don't know what the video limit the
length limit is but yeah that that's an
example of useful content if you're
sharing ideas to help Traders learn then
yeah of course that's that's great but
if you're sharing ideas to let the world
know what you're up to with your trading
who cares um you can stream live it's
kind of like Financial twitch I guess uh
I've never done that or never really um
watched anything but again if it's a
webinar if it's an educational thing it
could be valuable if you're just sharing
where you think Aussie dollar is going
to be uh at the end of today then okay
whatever I don't care and I don't see
why anyone else would or should and then
here you can write public notes about
your favorite symbols again not
something I care for but uh these
options are here for you if you do want
to share your opinion with the world uh
trading view is a massively um social
platform social trading platform it
really leans into the social aspect of
trading which can be great I'm not
taking away from that it can be great to
have a community to learn from to share
ideas with um but if you're looking for
trading ideas if you're looking for
someone to tell you what to buy or sell
stay away from this stuff please um it's
just not helpful to you as a Trader in
the long term unless you're learning
unless you're following educational
content people that you trust and
respect sharing their opinions and and
and their process if they're sharing the
process that the the process behind how
they came to their ideas that's valuable
if they're just sharing their ideas and
they're saying buy Aussie dollar because
it's going to go up that's not helpful
anyway that's it for the top bar we've
covered everything all the major these
are the major settings for trading view
everything important is at the top for a
reason it's easy to get to easy to find
easy to access and memorize now let's
move on to uh let's start with the
drawing tools because that's easy we'll
get that out of the way and then we'll
go over to the right side where we have
a few more social aspects and a bit more
complex and advanced trading view
features and then we'll finish with the
Bottom bar so drawing tools are very
self-explanatory we have a lot to choose
from here we have our Lin tools the most
common ones have hot keys so the ones I
use the most are alt H or command H alt
V or command v um you also have alt T
which will allow you to draw a line um
they're the main ones I don't use many
others to be honest in fact the only
ones I really use is all V and all H I'm
a very horizontal Trader I'm not a big
fan of trend lines uh in my trading
personally there are valuable
applications of them but personally I
ITI to support and resistance um and I
do use the vertical tool tool to Mark
dates and times quite frequently next up
we have the Fibonacci retracement tool
something I don't use a lot in my
trading I have in the past for advanced
pattern recognition um there is value in
the Fibonacci tool a lot of Traders give
the Fibonacci tool they sort of write it
off as Voodoo um maybe some applications
of the Fibonacci tool are voodoo but
there are some system some patterns that
this tool can um detect that have an
edge over the markets and I've used them
in the past profitably uh maybe it's a
self-fulfilling prophecy maybe the only
reason the Fibonacci tool works is
because a lot of Traders are looking at
it uh but that's good enough reason for
me if it makes me money um consistently
then I am not going to discriminate
against it I'm not going to shy away
from including it in my toolbox if it's
something I understand and know how to
use um but the Fibonacci tools are quite
Advanced tools so I want to go over
these if you don't know how to use them
just don't use them um they take quite a
while to learn how to use properly so
stay away from these if you're not
familiar with them uh here are the
advanced pattern tools same deal stay
away from these unless you know how to
use them this can be a trap some of
these Advanced patterns can sort of lead
you down a rabbit hole that is not
profitable or helpful so be aware of
these tools but they're here if you know
how to use them and you're an
experienced Trader then we have our
profit and loss tools um and some other
tools here I've I've literally never
used many of these tools I've never used
forecast or bars patterns ghost feed I
don't even know what ghost feed is I
don't use any of these I do use long and
short positions sometimes so if I were
to go long on this trade I would place a
tool here and I would set this to my
actual stop loss and my actual Target
because it's a very easy way to
visualize how my trade is playing out
and if you have a lot of markets on your
chart if I go to Forex um and here is a
list we'll get to this in a moment but
once we're finished with drawing tools
but here is a list of currencies I can
cycle through these and at a glance I
can see if I have an open trade on a on
a symbol for example you get the idea so
long and short tool is quite useful
especially in the beginning days as a
Trader um these are the tools I've never
really used next we have brush tools um
so we have highlighter I've never used
that either um or the brush tool it's
come a long way it used to be very janky
this tool those of you have used trading
view for a while you're probably not
watching this video if you've used
trading view for a while but this tool
used to look terrible uh when you used
it it used to sort of um snap to the bar
on your chart and it looked looked
horrible so that's come a long way so
you can actually draw you know you can
highlight uh this something happened
here you know this this is like a
whiteboard tool next up we have a text
tool this is quite useful we have all
different types of text tools here so we
can have a comment um which puts a label
behind what we
write um so that makes it easy to spot
certain labels uh this is useful in the
beginning of your trading if you want to
track certain things in price action
that you're learning personally I never
really use uh these labels um but I did
a lot in the beginning when I was
learning how to trade I defitely did use
these tools um mostly I just use the
text tool this is just a simple way to
to write whatever you want you can
change the colors uh color scheme up
here background next up this is a really
important tool for a Trader emeries if
you really want to be a professional
Trader you need to learn how to put the
right emeries on your chart um you can't
call yourself a professional Trader
until you have mastered the art of emoji
analysis
uh of course I'm completely joking
that's probably the first time I've ever
put an emergy on my chart to be honest
so yeah but hey it's 2024 as of
recording this and we live in a world
where entire conversations can happen in
emojis so uh of course trading view has
to include that next we have a measuring
tool this is very valuable I use this
all the time this is used for analyzing
movements in price so for example let's
say I want to see
how far prices move from this drop off
down to this low um I can click that
tool or I can hold shift and click
anywhere on this price chart and now I
can release shift and just move my mouse
to see how far price has moved so here
we have a 2% drop from the high to the
low 137 Pips over 119 bars from where I
selected this to where I um stopped it
shows the time 3 days 5 hours to get
from a to be it even shows the volume
traded over that period so a very useful
tool the measuring tool that is
something you will be using a lot as a
Trader next we have the zoom in button
let's say we want to see what happened
during this consolidation we can
highlight this and then my chart will
zoom in to match that um selection so
that's that's quite useful then we can
click the zoom out button to go back to
where we were uh the magnet tool is for
snapping I believe that's for yeah snaps
drawings placed near price bars to the
closest open high local
value so now if I select trend line you
can see my M It's probably hard for you
to see but if you look at my Crosshair
that's actually snapping to the open
high low and close so I can now hover my
mouse near the high and hover my mouse
near this high and that has now
connected the highs with the drawing
tool I have no idea what strong magnet
does let's have a look okay so strong
magnet doesn't need your Crosshair to be
in close proximity to the bar in in
order to snap next we have um lock to
drawing mode so if you turn this on when
you draw a tool you'll stay in drawing
mode so normally once you finish drawing
a um drawing object you'll go back to
the the uh Crosshair and you can drag
your chart around if you leave this on
now no matter how many times I click
it's staying in drawing mode um so that
can be useful if you're doing a lot of
analysis on a market then we have all
drawing tools so if I draw let's draw um
a trend line
here and click um lock all drawing tools
now I cannot drag or edit this drawing
tool if I click on these points nothing
happens um so once you've completed your
analysis this can be a useful thing to
turn on so that you don't accidentally
drag your drawing Tools around if I turn
that off and click on this line and move
it now it's movable and then this button
here
is also useful for hiding your drawing
tools so if you have a lot of analysis
on your chart you have a lot of lines
going on and you need those lines um see
we've got support and resistance here um
but let's say we have a lot going on on
our chart a lot of different lines and
we just want to see naked price action
uh we just want to see what the chart
looks like without anything on there but
we don't want to delete all our lines we
can just click that button and then
these last two options here we have the
bin this just deletes um objects we can
um or you can just hit the delete key on
your keyboard when you select one that
we have the sync chain icon here if I
split my chart here let's split this
into two charts this is the same Market
on two different charts let's reset my
views so we have the exact same price
chart here let's change this one to
daily and let's draw a trend line from
this high down to this low again you can
see that that hasn't drawn anything on
my daily chart here but now now if I
turn this link on drawings will now be
synced to my um different chart layouts
so now if I draw that trend line you can
see it's also drawing on the daily chart
down here so this is a really useful
analysis tool for sharing your analysis
across diff multiple time frames so if I
wanted to draw let's identify on the
daily chart let's identify a key level
of support and resistance that's where
Price is Right now you can see that
we've been tested as support and
resistance
multiple times right where price is
right now so if I click that this
drawing tool and I have this synced so
now we can watch how price unfolds down
here we can look for Price action
patterns for a Buy trade this would be
great zone between uh about here and
basically where Price is Right Now
anywhere in this Blue Zone would be a
great place to be looking for a Buy
trade in anticipation of a bounce out of
this Zone but let's go back to single
chart view remove my drawings and then
finally the last button down down here
is our favorites toolbar so you can see
this toolbar here has all of my
favorites attached to it if I turn that
off it goes away and again if I haven't
mentioned that you can favorite tools or
pretty much anything in trading view by
clicking this little star icon it's the
same on indicators it's the same on um
on pretty much any Tool uh time frames
it's this little star icon will favorite
a tool and it will show up on your bar
here if this is turned on all right
we're nearly done let's go over the far
right toolbar now where some of our
final most important tools are such as
our watch list so this is where you will
keep all of the markets that you want to
analyze regularly you can add them by
right clicking on your chart for
whatever symbol you have loaded and come
down to add to watch list or you can
just click this button here and you can
search for the symbol in the symbol list
you can cycle through these symbols by
hitting space on your keyboard and you
can highlight them by right clicking on
the side here and you can select the
color so if you need to pay attention to
particular markets let's say um you have
a list of potential bullish trades and
potential short trades you might want to
label them green and red um after you've
completed your analysis and then you can
easily spot them you can just click on
the label to remove them you can remove
symbols by clicking on the X at the end
here you can add a section which is
helpful I can rename this to Aussie
currencies for example and I could move
all my Aussie currencies under that
section and show and hide that section
that's actually pretty useful when you
have a long list like this you can add
text notes to these symbols and they'll
pop up down here so I could say Aussie
Swiss blah blah click add and now I have
a note next to the symbol if I click on
that note it'll pop up down here and I
can add multiple notes or delete them
next up we have advanced view I never
used this view but uh it's here if you
need it you you can compare the symbols
at a glance if you had stocks on this
list you could see their financials by
clicking financials and here are their
common common financials you change
everything to USD so I could change all
of these values to see what the USD
value is you can ex export the list so
that you can um share it or back it up
and you can group your uh list here um
and you can even you also share your
list so I can copy this link and share
it to a friend or whatever if I had a
list worth sharing and I can even add it
description here so I can say um FX
oanda broker list save and there we go
let's get out of Advance view if you
click on the ellipses here we have some
options we can um again share the list
we can make a copy duplicate of the list
if we wanted to make a copy to modify
slightly uh we can rename it we can
clear the entire list add a section
table view if I turn it off it includes
the symbol description um here we have
some options as well well so if I bring
this out a bit I can turn off the last
value I can turn off its change and
change percentage and now we just have
the list I'll probably leave last value
on and probably change percent on and
this change percent I believe is in on
the uh daily time frame so it's a change
from yesterday uh symbol display you can
turn the logo on or off and you can
change between the ticker symbol or the
description of the uh symbol and that's
it for the watch list let's move down to
alerts so here we have our list of
alerts as you can see I have quite a few
here I have some that go to our
community Discord uh that keep Traders
up to date with the major currencies and
cryptocurrencies and indices um I have
some automated Trading alerts for my
ultimate pullback indicator the ultimate
pullback indicator is a script I made
for auto trading the currency markets
primarily um I traded on the hourly time
frame mostly on um some of the major
Pairs and every time one of these
signals is detected my alert fires and
sends a automated command to Pine
connected to open a trade in the
direction of whatever the script has uh
detected if that's something that sounds
interesting to you you can check out my
Pine connector guide on my channel where
I explain how to set this up and you can
find the ultimate pullback indicator
script on my website at pinescript
mastery.com or the artof trading.com
both will take you there so here's our
alert list and our alert L which
includes all the information of
currently set alerts and alerts that
have fired there are multiple ways to
create alerts we can click this button
here we can click this plus button here
or we can right click the chart and
click ADD alert and if I click on this
drop down box we have some global
settings so we can stop all of my alerts
remove all my alerts um I can show only
active or inactive alerts and I can
filter alerts based on symbol time frame
and customize the list here I leave my
settings here is the default settings
and that's it if I wanted to remove a
individual alert I could just click on
the remove button here I could pause
alerts and I can edit um the alert
settings once you've added an alert you
cannot change the parameters of the
indicator you set it on so for example
with my UPI I have a ton of settings
here for this script um whatever I set
up here once I set my alert these
settings are locked in if I want to
change them on the alert I need to
remove the alert add a brand new alert
with the new settings set in this um
settings window here but if I wanted to
change um the condition for the alert or
the notification information say I don't
want it to notify me on my phone app
anymore I can turn that off and click
save that will adjust the alert settings
all right so one last thing I want to go
over before we move on when it comes to
alerts is our various conditions we have
to work with here I've already gone over
the notifications so depending on what
you select here will dictate how the
alert fires so you can have it on your
phone you can have a popup on your chart
Etc when it comes to the settings of the
alert we have a few options here so if
you leave it as the market you have
added to your chart then all of these
conditions are based on your price value
so if I set this to Crossing up and I
set this price to 655 now this alert
will only trigger if price is uh
Crossing above this number however let's
add a different indicator on here let's
add on my breakout indicator so this
indicator requires me to select a long
breakout price so let's put that above
this swing High here and a short
breakout price let's put that below this
low so now I have a green line and a red
line on my chart I'll need to close my
alert box and open it again and if I
come down to my condition I now have a
couple of extra options I have my EMA
indicator that's this indicator here I
can remove that I'm not using that
anymore um if I select my B koi
indicator my breakout indicator you can
see I have a custom alert here now this
alert is triggered by the code of this
script so if I scroll down here in the
code you can see alert condition is
fired if long alert or short alert is
true these conditions here again if you
want to learn how to make your own
scripts your own indicators for trading
view go and check out my website
pinescript mastery.com but we don't need
to understand the code for today's uh
guide in order to set an alert with this
indicator all we need to do is Select
breakout alert now this will trigger an
alert if price interacts with this green
line or this red line if price stays
where it is in between nothing will
happen now depending on what trigger
condition I select here will dictate how
the alert fires if I select only once
then as soon as price touches the green
line or the red line an alert will
trigger and it will never trigger again
until I reset the alert up here if I
select once per bar that exact same
behavior will occur except that once I
new bar Begins the alert will
automatically reset so every time this
condition is met on a new bar an alert
will trigger if I select once per bar
close then the alert will only trigger
at the close of a bar so in trading we
can quite frequently see situations like
this if we were looking to buy a
breakout of this High these highs here
at some point this big red candle here
would have been a big green candle and
it would have looked like price was
breaking out and uh we were about to go
to the Moon um but then by the end of
this uh candle session Traders pushed
this price all the way down and a close
down here at the um lower body so what
we would normally do as Traders with
most systems and most indicators is we
wait for the candle to close before we
act on the indicat condition so in that
case when we're setting up our alert we
would want to select once per bar close
and that way this alert would only have
fired if price had closed above our
highs if we'd set an alert condition and
then finally we have once per minute
this will trigger the alert every time
the condition is met but not more than
one time per minute now there are
different reasons you'd want to use
these various options but once per bar
close should be the default for the
majority of alerts that you set and then
we also have expiration depending on
your trading view plan you may not have
access to this open-ended alert option
this just leaves the alert active
indefinitely with no expiry if I turn
this off I can select a date and time
for the alert to expire or
deactivate uh but anyway that's it for
alerts let's move on to the object tree
and data window this isn't something I
really use very often but this is help
for developers trading view um scriptors
people who write pinescript code it just
displays um all of the objects added to
your chart and the tree the order
they're in what objects belong to which
indicator Etc next up we have hot lists
I have never used this this just shows
um the hottest markets in particular
watch lists I'll just leave it as a
default settings for right now we've got
us exchanges we've got the most amount
of volume traded across all US exchange
traded stocks we have percentage gainers
and percentage losers they're the three
main ones on this hot list so the most
liquid markets the biggest gainers and
the biggest losers on us exchanges you
can change the watch list here by um
selecting here so if I wanted to see the
Aussie version here I could see um let's
have a look at the largest gap gainers
on the Aussie Market click on that
market and here you can see that we had
um a gap
up and then it's gained quite a lot
since then a useful day trading metric
and for our discretionary Traders here
next we have the calendar so this shows
the global economic calendar for the top
20 economies so today in a couple hours
or in exactly 1 hour from now we have
the RBA interest rate decision and then
at 1:00 a.m. tomorrow my time we have
some Canada data some Canadian data
tomorrow morning or the next day
actually the February 8th we have uh
inflation data from China and so on you
can stay in the loop with the global
economic calendar here this is very
useful for Forex traders in particular
um but obviously some of
these sort of releases can affect stock
markets and commodities as well and then
down here we have the ear earnings
calendar so I guess this is for all
markets on trading view oh no the US
okay so you can select the country so if
I click entire world and apply now we
have the earnings calendar for every
country's exchange every Market that's
listed on trading view their um earnings
calendar will sharp so for February 6th
today this is the list of markets or
stocks that have earnings announcements
today quite a few of them actually um if
I click on this world icon I can change
it to the country that I want or I can
select multiple countries next up we
have the ideas list this is my ideas
these are from years ago this is from
2018 um so quite a while ago 15minute
chart analysis probably out of date by
now whatever happened on December 7th
2018 on a 15minute chart is long long
out of date today and not very useful
information but I can't delete old ideas
once an idea is published it's up
forever so yeah we've got a whole bunch
of junk on trading view from years and
years ago and I guess this only shows my
ideas I can't find a way to display
other people's ideas but uh I wouldn't
want to anyway as I've mentioned I don't
follow other people's analysis on
financial markets it does not have any
bearing on how I trade next up we have
chat so you can actually chat with
people on trading view like any
messaging platform this is the public
chat so this is just the public trading
view chat where people trading view
people post questions about pinescript
and there's all different types of
categories here different talks going on
so if you're a really social driven
Trader you can uh jump into the chat box
here and have a talk with fellow Traders
personally as you would know by now I
I've never used this I don't use this I
have had private chats in the past with
people regarding my scripts or students
um now we handle all of our support via
email because it's just too hard to keep
track of everything on trading view here
but yeah trading view is a social
Trading platform so if you're into that
side of things this is where you go to
meet other Traders and see what people
are talking about then we have the idea
stream this is where people's public
ideas are posted again look let's click
on the first thing that pops up here and
here we go um some pretty useless
analysis I mean I'm not picking on these
people I mean everything on this list
will be useless even if I posted it it
would be useless because as I said you
don't know how I trade you don't know
what matters to me even if I explained
everything going on in my head it's not
very helpful to you because everyone's
different everyone has different
investment goals different risk
tolerance different time Horizons
different expectations out of the
markets different beliefs about the
markets different access to different
markets different time frame preferences
different amounts of time to trade if I
post a 5 minute chart idea you might not
have time to trade that if I post a
daily chart idea you might not care to
trade the daily chart cuz you trade a
5-minute time frame you get the idea I
stay away from this but if you're a new
Trader this could be useful way to just
learn about markets and see what other
Traders do that's probably its main
advantage is just to see what the masses
are into um and a fun thing to do is see
how often people are wrong because um
99% of these ideas are wrong because
markets are unpredictable and the way we
make money as Traders is not necessarily
by being right all the time but by
making more money more profit from our
winning trades than we lose when we're
wrong that's the vast majority of
winning Traders approach and by
definition that means means that their
analysis is not particularly helpful
because most of their trades well at
least 50% in most cases will lose very
rare to have a Trader that has a greater
than 60% win rate if you believe
otherwise then there's not much I can do
to help you you'll figure that out in
your own time moving on we have streams
this is uh I guess live streams twitch
streams as you can see I don't follow
anything here so I don't have much to
say about that there's probably some
useful educational streams out there but
I don't know of any um so yeah I can't
help you guys with that side of things
and then finally we have notifications
these are social notifications and I
don't have any at the moment because I'm
not involved in any of that stuff at the
moment and that's it for our sidebar the
main thing you'll be using here is the
alerts and the watch list um maybe the
calendar but you can get better
calendars online from things like Forex
Factory and stuff like that so I tend to
just use these two the watch list and
the alerts panel some of these buttons I
haven't clicked on in years until doing
this video right now so yeah you don't
have to use everything on trading view
just because it's there especially the
social side of things uh let's move on
to the Bottom bar here first we have the
stock screener this deserves its entire
own video so I'm not going to go into
detail here but this is where you search
for stocks based on various criteria so
we can look for the best six-month
performers we're on the US market here
you could change the market if you
wanted to I'll leave it on the US for
now and it's going to show us the best
gainers over a 6mth period there's a
whole bunch of different metrics here we
can search through um and there's
different different um categories so we
can see who has the most dividend
payouts over a certain period of time
who has the best balance sheets and so
on if you're a uh investor this might be
more your thing um if you're a Trader
you're probably not looking at a lot of
these fundamentals because you probably
only care about price if you're trading
a shorttime window a lot of this stuff
is pretty irrelevant but for investors
this this can be quite useful for
analyzing the value of a company there
are videos out there on the stock
screener perhaps if there's enough
demand for that I'll take the time to
record my own video on the stock
screener but for now we'll skip over
this because there's so much to cover
just know that you can search for
markets here you can select the metrics
you want to analyze and you can select
the different categories here it's set
to daily by default but if you wanted to
see intraday how markets are performing
you'd click one of these intraday time
frames and if you wanted to see longer
term like monthly you could click one
month and all of these metrics will be
based on the monthly time frame next up
we have the pine editor this is my
domain this is where I spend a lot of my
time on trading view because I am a pin
script educational content creator and I
am a programmer and systematic Trader
the vast majority of my trading is
systematic rules-based systems that I
write in code and the um all my
decisions are made in the strategy
development process and then the script
tells me when to buy and when to sell I
like that approach it works for me it
doesn't work for everyone for me I like
it because I do all my hard work up
front and then the system tells me when
to buy and sell this morning my trading
took 5 minutes to place all my orders
and I'm done for the day with my trading
and I'm still making 30% plus per year
on good years last year was a bit bit
rough with some of the inflation stuff
going on but usually I make 20 30%
minimum on my net worth each year and
90% of that is from rules-based
systematic trading and pinescript is one
of the tools I use to do that pinescript
is a fantastic tool it's what my
ultimate pullback indicator is written
in not only can you create tools that
help you analyze price information for
example I could throw on a higher time
frame EMA here and now if I drop down to
a 50-minute chart we are looking at the
daily 50 period moving average on the
15minute chart so that's why it's
stepped each step represents one day and
that is that day's moving average and
that allows us to do things like analyze
how price action behaves on a lower time
frame around higher time frame technical
factors so um great intraday trading
opportunities here on a script like this
you can see on a daily time frame you
wouldn't know that price reacted on
these moving averages until the end of
the day when the trading opportunity is
long gone so trading view was fantastic
for analy price information is great for
both discretionary Traders and
systematic Traders this is an example of
a tool that a discretionary Trader might
use um but you could also make rules
about this um sort of system a higher
time frame moving average and if I open
up the source code to the script you can
see there's not a lot of code here if
you're if you're new to coding this will
be overwhelming and a bit hard to
understand but believe me it's very
simple pinescript is one of the most
simple scripting languages on the planet
especially for Traders
uh most charting platforms have very
convoluted scripting languages
pinescript is really simple to use and I
have a ton of content on my Channel
about pinescript if you're interested in
making your own scripts believe me even
if you've never written a line of code
in your life pinescript is a fantastic
place to start it's really easy to learn
it's really simple and very very
powerful eventually you can even create
strategy scripts that automatically back
test through the trading view back
tester system which is our next tab so
here you can see how my ultimate
pullback indicator performed on this
random stock I don't know this is just a
random sample we've got 141 trades we
did make a lot of profit because we're
only trading one contract if I change
this to percentage of equity and invest
100% of my account into each trade now
we have some more meaningful metrics a
26% return on this Market within 11%
draw down 141 trades about 49% of Trades
closed for a profit our average trade
was 18 bucks and our average number of
bars we were involved in a trade is
seven bars that we can
[Music]
good and here on the performance summary
tab we have all of our key metrics for
the system like it's sharp ratio and now
if you're not an experienced Trader you
won't know what any of this means and
that's fine you will learn this over
time you don't need to know all this
straight away to get started as a Trader
it's a bit overwhelming to learn
everything at once but for those of you
who are experienced this um strategy
tester can give you some very key
metrics some important metrics about a
potential system that you might want to
trade and this is all done very quickly
through the strategy tester now the
strategy tester is a single Market only
back testing system so it does have some
major limitations in that sense on my
channel I am starting to Branch out into
other back testing software such as real
test which can do portfolio based stock
market testing so we can test thousands
of stocks um simultaneously with trading
view we can only Trade One Market or
test one market at a time so that's a
big problem when it comes to portfolio
based systems but for single Market
systems like currencies crypto Forex
certain Commodities market indices like
the S&P 500 ETFs that sort of thing it's
perfectly fine and there are ways around
the single Market thing you can export
your um test data into Excel and merge
data together it's a little bit tricky
to do but it's not rocket science once
experienced at this stuff you can um
find templates out there to do that I
have a template on my channel somewhere
actually on how to do that how to merge
back testing data into one um test
through Excel and analyze this
information that way but again that's
outside the scope of today's video
finally we have our list of Trades this
is each trade that the system took where
it bought it what time how many
contracts or position sizes units shares
whatever this is relevant to whatever
Market you have loaded uh the profit
loss draw down Etc then we have the
properties of the system this just
explains what settings we were using
when we um tested the script but yeah I
cover a lot of this stuff in the Mastery
course the pine script Mastery course
and for free on my YouTube channel so if
this interests you make sure to go and
check out my other videos especially the
pinescript basics course I do have uh a
free course on my website and a 2-hour
long video on YouTube where I teach you
guys the basics of pinescript the
fundamentals to get you started writing
your own scripts and eventually your own
strategy scripts to run it through the
back tester here obviously a huge
Advantage as a Trader in fact I would go
so far as to say anyone who doesn't back
test is basically gambling um doesn't
mean you can't make money but it does
mean that you don't know what to expect
out of your system so that's akin to
gambling if you're a serious Trader you
should learn how to back test obviously
there are limitations to back testing
past performance is not indicative of
future performance and all of those disc
claimers but seeing how a system
performed over the past thousand trades
gives you a pretty solid idea of whether
or not it's going to be profitable on
the next 100 trades uh so I do recommend
learning how to back test if you're a
serious Trader uh this setting here is
new this allows you to back test more
data than is available on your chart
trading view does have a limitation to
how many intraday bars can be loaded in
particular the daily and weekly time
frames aren't a big deal but on these
lower time frames there is a limitation
how many bars you can load onto your
chart so I'd recommend turning that on
if you have access to it finally we have
the trading panel this is where you log
into your broker and place and manage
your trades you can also use paper
trading if you want to um simulate your
trading with fake money um on real price
data using trading view you can log into
the trading view um paper trading system
here I have a $10,800 account and I can
now Place uh if I go to a market that's
open that's actively trading I can buy
uh let's buy this at Market with a 14
pip stop loss buy there we go we are now
involved in a demo trade that quick that
easy with a stop loss and I can drag a
take profit up here and now we have our
mock trade entered and we I can bring my
stop loss down below this low bring this
up to the high and we could see how that
played out over the day on a 50-minute
time frame this would be classed as a
day trade and that's one way we can
simulate our trading using the inbuilt
trading view paper trading all right so
before we move on let's just go over the
trading Tab in a little more detail so
here I am on a paper trading account
this is simulating trading this is fake
money but uh I do have a real account
with a few Brokers oanda and pepperstone
are my two main Brokers I use for Forex
Trading um I'm not logged into them at
the moment because I want to show you
guys how to manage positions that are
open so this isn't a trading lesson I'm
not going to go into detail about all of
these different uh tabs these are things
you'll learn through experience and
through studying trading in general
hopefully you have a trading Mentor or a
coach that can show you the ropes uh but
here we have our pending orders here we
have our trade history account history
and our trading journal SO trading
journal just lists all of the um
activities we've done aut modifications
that sort of thing now this is a paper
trading setting um we can include
commission here uh I would recommend
leaving this on if you are simulating
your trading because commission drag is
a very real um Factor especially on
Lower time frames so always include
Commission in your back testing and in
your demo trading because it will impact
your profitability you might need to
change this depending on what broker you
plan on using but this is my paper
trading commission settings so I will be
paying 1% of my position size as a
commission so if we go over to positions
here if I click on this trade here it
will take me to the Chart where my trade
is open now I placed this trade on
Tuesday when I was recording the initial
parts of this guide it's now Thursday
and this trade is actually playing out
profitably you can see that our
takeprofit here was nearly hit but not
quite and so we still have an open
position here now this simulates what it
would be like to have a real trade open
so we can actually play around and learn
the controls here without risking any
money so now I can modify my order this
is my take profit I don't recommend
moving this in live trading that's a
rookie error many Traders make is um
they see that oh this trade's moving in
my favor I'm going to extend my take
profit all the way up here and then of
course PR hits where their take profit
would have been and then comes down and
stops them out stick to your trading
rules make sure you have trading rules
as a begin a Trader seek out good
mentorship good coaching make sure you
have a system that you trust and believe
in and a trading plan that suits your
personality and then stick to it don't
mess with it but if you do if you make
an error or your trading plan calls for
you to move your um take profit you can
drag this here or you can just um click
on it and adjust the numbers here so so
it's a little bit more accurate than
dragging this around same with the stop
loss you can drag this around if you
want to again do not move your stop loss
leave it where you set it according to
your trading plan at all times never
ever move your stop loss away from price
and extend your risk that goes against
everything that profitable Traders do
and stand for the whole philosophy of
trading is uh making more money than you
lose that's how most trading systems
work you can be profitable by having a
very high win rate rate and an inverse
risk reward profile so less profit than
you risk but that's a hard system to
trade anyway if you click this button
you can reverse your position uh that's
an advanced trading uh style I wouldn't
recommend doing that that will turn my
position from a long trade into a short
trade um typically you probably don't
want to do this unless you're very
experienced at trading prices very
rarely reverse Direction completely so
once you have a winning trade you might
want to take a break from Trading that
market to see what happens next before
you place your next trade um and that's
pretty much it it's a pretty
self-explanatory interface uh you can
access these tools down here if I click
this edit button I can edit my take
profit and stop loss I can close my
trade here by clicking on this button I
can partially close a position so I have
1,000 units open here if I wanted to
take partial profit let's say I wanted
to take off half my position here so I
want to take half my profit I can type
in half of my position size click
partially close and now I've taken some
profit on this mock trade and um that's
a great trading style as well because
now psychologically we've taken some
money off the table we can now bring our
stop loss up to break even and we can
let this trade run I can either remove
my take profit or move it all the way up
here and we know that we've already made
half of our risk on this trade roughly
and so that skews our risk reward
profile now we're no longer risking our
full amount of risk on this trade our
stop losses at break even we've extended
our take profit we've taken money off
the table and we can just let this trade
run now that isn't always a profitable
system or approach to trading but it can
work with some systems so just something
to keep in mind for you beginner Traders
out there you don't have to close your
trade out completely you can scale out
of positions and there are some Advanced
sophisticated ways to um make money as a
Trader which you'll learn over time from
either myself or other trading coaches
and mentors out there if you follow my
channel you'll learn a lot about my
techniques for trading um I'm a very
simple Trader very simple rules based
systems um I don't try to reinvent the
wheel I just do what works for me and
what has worked for my trading mentors
the people I've learned to trade from
the veteran traders that I follow one
last thing you can click this button to
open the trade order panel this is where
you can select a short trade or buy
trade uh it will tell you the spread
here so that's what you're paying to
open your position in terms of spread so
the difference between where price
currently is and where your order will
be filled this is in Pips on a Forex
market so if I were to buy right now I
would pay 1.6 spread uh 1.6 Pips spread
which means that my buy order would be
placed uh 1.6 Pips in the uh against me
so up here my order would be filled
slightly at a worse price than where
price currently is that's how Brokers
tend to make their money and that is a
hidden cost in trading that can make
trading lower time frames incredibly
difficult so for you scalpers out there
uh if you do want to trade time frames
you are going to need to find a
fantastic broker with very tight spreads
um in order to make that profitable
generally speaking it's a lot easier to
trade the higher time frames for all
kinds of reasons but um anyway that's
outside the scope of today's video here
you have your order types so limit order
means place my if I'm going to buy a
limit order would be placing a buy limit
order down here and I'm waiting for
price to fall to trigger that trade a
stop limit is the opposite so if I would
place a buy stop limit above price here
now I'm waiting for price to come up and
exceed that before I'm filled on my
trade it's important not to get these
mixed up because if you place a limit
order above price it will be filled
immediately because uh that's the nature
of limit order a limit order means get
me this price or better and if price is
below here that counts as better and so
you will be filled immediately I've made
that mistake plenty of times early on in
my career so make sure you get your
order types right uh stop order doesn't
necessarily mean stop loss it can mean
buy stop which as I mentioned means buy
when price Rises and exceeds so we'll be
filled at this price only if price
exceeds it so that is Handy for trading
breakouts and the market order will
place a order immediately so if I close
this trade and I click buy at market
right now will be filled immediately uh
minus the spread you can see that I've
actually been filled a few Pips above
where price is that is the spread that I
just paid and my trade immediately opens
at a loss that's normal that happens in
trading and the larger the position size
the worse that will be uh gen generally
speaking but anyway you get the idea
that's it um you can place your stop
loss and take profit here as well and
adjust your position size I recommend
basing your risk on a percentage of your
account balance that's what percent risk
will do so let's go to a slightly higher
time frame let's go to a daily chart
let's say I'm expecting this double
bottom to hold and price to bounce from
here so I would want to place a long
position where price currently is put my
stop loss below these lows this is
purely for example purposes ideally
you'd want to use something like an ATR
indicator or some sort of tool to
objectively Define how far you place
your stop loss below this low but that's
stuff you will learn from a trading
mentor and now I can even right click
this tool and say create limit order and
that will fill out this order tool here
with my take profit and my stop-loss
price and my entry price all filled out
right here and now I can say risk 1% of
my account balance on that trade and it
will automatically adjust my position
size my units so that if my trade were
to be filled right now and price were to
come all the way down and sto me out I
would only lose one% of my account
balance which means I would need to lose
well over 100 trades in a row in order
to blow my account this alone will not
keep you from being an unprofitable
Trader but it will make a significant
significant um Improvement to your
bottom line and will really help you
avoid blowing up so A good rule of thumb
is when you're beginning as a Trader
keep your risk as 1% or less and then
you know you can survive almost any
losing streak no matter how bad it gets
within reason obviously but at least it
will buy you time so that you know if
something's going wrong and your system
is not performing as expected then
you'll catch that early before you blow
your your account whereas if I would
have risked 10% on my trade now I can
only lose a couple of trades in a row
before I've going to have my account
balance and that's going to have all
kinds of psychological damage and going
to disrupt my ability to trade optimally
anyway that'll do for now my neighbors
just started mowing his lawn um it's
like they wait until I'm recording
before they start mowing their lawn it
happens all the time uh but that'll do
for the trading part of today's guide
there's a couple of things I want to go
over really quickly just before wrap it
up the first thing is if we go to the
homepage I ignore the vast majority of
this stuff but there is one thing I want
to bring to your attention and that is
the community scripts so if I click on
this tab here here is a list of all
these scripts made by the community and
you can select strategies libraries
indicators libraries are more for
scriptors if you're just trading you'd
want to stick to indicators and
strategies strategies can be run through
the back testing system indicators are
just tools for helping you analyze PR
price they don't actually place any
pretend trades through the tester but
this is the place where you'll find
really cool really valuable scripts and
tools made by the community there's also
a lot of junk out here as I mentioned so
be careful what you um add to your chart
make sure it adds value to your trading
don't just add it because it looks
really cool this looks pretty cool
actually but I don't know what it does
so I'm not going to add it to my chart
just because it looks cool but a lot of
Traders do that sort of thing so be
careful of that um if you want to see my
scripts you can go to my website the
artof trading.com and if you go to
trading view scripts you will find all
of my publish scripts here all my public
uh scripts that I published to the
training view platform there's a bunch
of useful basic tools here some not so
basic some are a little more advanced
and some are just tools to help Traders
navigate financial markets last two
things I want to mention is that I have
quite a large library of free content um
that I've made over the past several
years as a Trader just sharing things
that have worked for me
um things that I found valuable in my
own trading I do have some paid courses
but the vast majority of my content is
free so just go and check that out if
you're interested my style of trading
might not resonate with you you might
not like what I do and how I trade but
if you're into systematic trading
rules-based trading I think you'll find
a lot of what I have to say helpful and
valuable because it's helped me become a
profitable Trad over the past six seven
years it's helped me Forge a career as a
Trader and I'm really blessed and
grateful to be where I am now I I love
