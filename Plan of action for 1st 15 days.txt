- right now I'm here to explain few
important things related to your
preparation I hope you are very clear
that we are going to start things from
tomorrow that is August first few of the
people are very new to the group few of
the people are halfway through the
preparation and few people are about to
complete the preparation okay we have
all category of people but right now we
are going to deal the subject in the
most simplest form so before going in
detail you to the plan okay so this is
the blueprint if you roughly Emily is
the blueprint in the first 15 days that
is from August 1st to August 15th we are
planning to cover one that is dental
materials that is the sixth one which is
going to carry 14 marks followed by you
how conservative and endodontics which
are two subjects but are going to carry
only 14 marks and prosthodontics and
cronin bridge including this implants is
going to carry 14 marks so roughly my
plan is going to cover 14 into 3 okay
that is 42 marks in 15 days out of this
if you take dental materials that is the
sixth serial numbered dental materials
into consideration dental materials is
going to be a part of your orthodontics
so our third letter dental materials
will be covered in ortho
similarly few aspects of peda will be
covered in speedo the major aspect of
dental materials is conservatory
industry which is going to cover in and
around 40 to 50 percentage of dental
materials in it and next is prosthetics
all this impression material chip some
products casting alloys casting defense
casting procedures and everything will
be a part of your process are going to
cover 20 to 25 percentage of area of 10
to materials and coming to the perio so
there is implant related tangelo
materials that is all about the titanium
is very very very very important and
Perea is going to cover
two to five percenters artha is going to
cover two to five percenters and
according to me the left our dental
materials is only one chapter that is
physical properties that is the first
chapter is only the left or chopped
chapter of dental materials because
almost all topics of dental materials
will be covered in various other
subjects as a combination so that's the
reason why my plan of my plan in
handling the dental materials because
according to schedule it's just 14
months but dental metals is a part of
your conservation title metals is a part
of your prosthetics Tecla metals is a
part of your periodontal metal this is a
part of your pedo ortho so everywhere
Dadra materials is going to play a very
vital role so my plan is everyday okay
from everyday these 15 days or 12 to 14
days we are planning the schedule so
every 12 to 14 days you going to have
some sort of dental materials pulling
from all the sites either in the form of
a new video based discussion or in the
form of an ER what's up this discussion
so that's what the 14 days plan of this
means every day you're going to have 15
minutes dental materials support from
this the left hour is your prosthetics
that is going to carry 14 marks which
include your CD you're good at good at
this CD in your user level FPD is very
easy to handle our PD is a bit tricky
but we are there to help you out in all
the ways and max aphasia processes is
again an important area where nowadays
capacitors are really focus again asking
questions and the next important part is
implants which is damn important for
your aims as well as for your need and
PG so all the areas of prosthetics are
very important and and and coming to the
next part that is a conservative and end
of so 50% is 260 percentage of
conservative is a part of your dental
materials all your amalgam composite
diet filling gold dental cements casting
alloys so many many ceramics and
everything are a part of your comes away
too so most of the conservative stuff
exclusively conservative means it's like
cavity preparation of a mouth
composite and your instrumentations your
dental caries classifications and basics
of the dental caries are exclusive parts
of your conservator rest all are part of
your dental materials dental medals is
going to play a vital role in
conservator and coming to the indoor I
hope you're very good at indoor I mean
like understanding the things but we
will try to make indoor as simple as
possible the main intention of adding
the two plus one subject in this first
15 days making the shuttle very tight
and very comprehensive is the answer is
very simple because these subjects are
well-known subjects you are just
spending majority of your dentistry time
from the first year till now with these
subjects because you have preclinical
prosthetics you have preclinical
conservative you have done dental
materials in the first two three years
and you're being exposed to the clinics
from the third year finally and
internship and major cases what you are
doing are relevant to these two subjects
so I feel like these subjects are very
interesting and if you are ready to
spend time it is very very easy to
complete these subjects on time these
are very comfortable subjects and my
charitable people they allow these
subjects in dentistry so if you are
ready to spend your time at your best it
is very easy to finish off these
subjects and you can just trust me that
we can finish these subjects on time so
that left over time what we have saved
or what we have conserved during dealing
with this conservative can be used for
other subjects there a few tricky
subjects like your pharmacology of
microbiology biochemistry physiology
general medicine general surgery
community most of the people feel tricky
with these subjects so the time what
your conserving now can be used it so
I'm just going to reflects plain like
what what we have planned here so the
minimum time that you need to spend per
day should be 12 plus hours from now
whether it's an intern or a repeater or
odd pageant and make sure that you spend
more than 12 to 15 hours per day so
whatever Shatila how prepared is based
upon this so first day you can cover all
the three topics which are related to
complete denture followed by the second
day you can add dental caries okay the
group is going to cover dental caries on
the principles of chaotic preparation
third day you can cover the rest of the
CD followed by you can cover dental
cements and the fourth day you can plan
amalgam both and comes over to as well
as to you diet filling gold comes away
to ndm and fifth day you can add
composite composites both incomes over
20 M and you can add a note about the
instrumentation sorry and sixth and
seventh day you can go ahead with your
fixed partial denture eight and nine you
can go for your removal partial dentures
so we want to provide you in all the
ways the good nodes shortcut notices and
good discussions and many many other
aspects okay so terms you can plan your
cast registration that is related to
composite and dental materials
concentrating materials and/or to me of
diseases of pulp area picker we are
going to post a video and there is
something called as smart materials we
are going to post a video related to the
smart materials and followed by your
biomechanics disinfection operation all
these are very simple topics you need to
learn few key points which are mostly
asked has a questions in the exam you
can cover bleaching and analytic surgery
trauma so you have 13 14 and 15 half day
as a revision so the logic behind these
three subjects okay
DM we are going to cover every day we
are going to go out 15 minutes so DM is
not a big deal and conserve a2 and endo
and your prosthetics are completely
chemical oriented subjects no need of
like heavy loads of revision so you can
plan less revision and try to focus more
on the concepts understanding the stuff
and underlining the things which are
memory based there are few memory base
there few
America is a fuel memory based stuff
where you need to focus on so underline
them so give more importance to the
memory based stuff and less importance
to the concepts because most of the
concepts you're already good at hope
you're clear with the first 15 days plan
of action and the reference book you can
you can stick on to dental pulse okay
and for endo you can add dentist to
please try to cover the dentist from
Indore
- please try to cover dentist and
prosthetics you can stick on to pulse
and you can you can just follow the
groups and when you get your PP books in
your hand I think it's very good they
have a lot in in revision of few
important things like implants which was
not good in any of the basic books Oh
implants you can cover in your
power-play books and good good ample
amount of revision related to the
numericals and some memory based off of
cons endo diem and prosthetics in your
paper books so PP books going to be
something like they're going to play the
role of power play in your last phase
that is try to manage pp books once
you're done with the first reading of
the basics so once you're done with the
first reading of all the things what we
have given then you can think of about
your power blue books hope you're good
all the best have a great day guys
please stay positive and make your
dreams
