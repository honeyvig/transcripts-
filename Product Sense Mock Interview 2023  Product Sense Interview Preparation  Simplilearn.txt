so let's start with the session and
understand what is product sense
understanding a product's requirements
is known as having products since one of
the actual hard talents that good
product managers should possess is
product sense it's a key element of
product development and any product
strategy it is a crucial talent for
Designing Goods with people in mind a
product success depends on addressing
consumer demands and product sense is a
form of foresight many businesses
prioritize products since while choosing
individuals for PM positions true
product sense goes well beyond the
design and user experience of the
solution one of the components of the
product sense equation is anticipating
the downsides and trade-offs of each
product decision and knowing which ideas
to reject is also included in it
understanding why a product would or
wouldn't function is necessary and
product sense helps you identify the
issues your product resolves and how to
add new features that work similarly the
ability of PMS to understand products
has long been mysterious
now let's understand how to develop a
product sense
strong product sense is a quality that
product managers consistently exhibit
they also provide value that meets
client requirements while updating such
items
most product management use scenarios
have this goal in mind though it is
sometimes simpler said than done
improving revenue and profit margins May
mean sacrificing these objectives
product managers and leaders May improve
this ability and develop their intuitive
sense of user demands in a variety of
ways there are three components that
make up product sense number one
compassion this is the capacity to mimic
several distinct personalities who are
not like you in terms of their thought
processes having the ability to state
that in this circumstance this sort of
user will respond in this way or to
assert that our business partners would
react in a certain way or even that our
Rivals will see our move in a certain
way one crucial aspect of product sense
is the ability to honestly do that well
going above and beyond to get into user
shoes into their thinking and into their
problems helps you develop a strong
products in
talking to various people and partners
is a definitive technique to increase
your empathy don't just converse with
them and accept what they tell you as
you go about doing this the most crucial
component of developing this empathy is
to try to understand why they are saying
what they are saying although you won't
always have the user in front of you to
ask what would work you may accurately
forecast it by knowing why they feel or
act the way they do
number two originality the ability to
think creatively and generate fresh
solutions to a given circumstance or
challenge is the most elusive but
significant component of product sense
it is the responsibility of the product
manager to specify the construction
process you may develop the key Talent
of creative thinking to do this it might
be a force multiplier to be able to come
up with novel solutions to Consumer
issues in addition to providing sensible
answers the top product managers also
Inspire Innovation after all nothing has
ever been constructed before without the
use of creativity setting strategy
prioritizing new ideas and putting them
into practice all need creativity
and number three domain knowledge
when you have a deep understanding of
the industry you work in ideas for what
kind of product to create and how to
create it will automatically come to you
better and more accurately to be more
precise I'd advise putting your
attention on understanding your users
and consumers the competitors and what
they're up to and any opportunities or
constraints presented by technology
functional expertise is concerned with
the product management process whereas
domain expertise is focused on the
market I contend that this is distinct
from talents the art of influencing is
one such influencing is a crucial
ability for PMS since they have a lot of
responsibility and limited control over
other people the market consumers
industry opponents products and Etc are
all part of the domain experience yes
some technical expertise is required but
the market is still the major concern
otherwise you run the risk of becoming
technology driven missing Market
possibilities or misinterpreting client
wants now let's move on to the basic
detailing of the product since interview
product interviews not only attain
questions based on the product since but
also analytical questions and case
studies in most cases the product sense
interviews hold on to the questions like
which is the product you like the most
why do you like it and what kind of
improvements do you want to make to it
or the interviewer can ask you about a
particular product maybe just like
Google Maps the interviewer can ask
about how you would improve Google Maps
and its services
the questions about actual products are
occasionally included in the product
sense interviews a product's design and
strategy might also be the basis for
these inquiries for example what design
principles would you use to create a
YouTube clone app that runs in the
background regardless of whether a
product is digital or physical the
solutions for its design or marketing
tactics always stay the same PM
interviews evaluate three key
competencies product sense execution and
behavioral competencies every employer
has a unique interview process but they
all assess the same fundamental
competencies hard as it may be to admit
most interviewers need rapid thinking
and responses quick thinking is
facilitated by Frameworks your
interviewer for the execution is
searching for if you can quantify what
matters and apply analytics to make
data-driven judgments if you can
identify and balance various trade-offs
to make wise product selections and if
you can efficiently use your limited
time and resources to have the greatest
impact now let us understand what the
interviewer is trying to see in you or
trying to judge you on the interviewer
mostly asks you about the four things
based on a product context
prioritization creativity metrics
context the interviewer will ask you
about the context of the problem
statement do you get the context of the
problem are you able to empathize with
which context the product is going to be
used who will be the users of the
product and what will be the
difficulties the users will face with
these particular products how can we
resolve such difficulties and many more
prioritization
are you able to prioritize from all the
major points of segments and use cases
you have developed the appropriate
collection of segments and pinpoints
supporting your decisions with logic and
data such questions are asked by the
interviewer
creativity
the interviewer will always want you to
provide a creative solution for the
problem statement because this is where
your ability to think of a creative
solution to the problem and your ability
to design comes into being
metrics the interviewer may ask if you
can come up with the metrics against
which you will judge your product
intervention
well these are the four primary aspects
around which the product sense interview
will roam the interviewer is going to
check your ability to think design
strategize and create
the interviewer doesn't expect you to
come up with a solution that will change
the whole face or the product
they are typically trying to find out if
you have the structure of the product
based on the problems and their
Solutions in your mind
before moving ahead here's a question
for you all what is your favorite
product and why do let us know in the
comments below
now let's know what makes a product
manager gain a thriving product sense
designing products training good PMS are
familiar with design and an MBA is
beneficial the subjects of product
design and Innovation are two of the
favorites of usual PMS some used to
create stuff and get feedback throughout
several rounds it might be challenging
to take criticism on the job seriously
and promptly
case studies and marketing academically
speaking marketing includes products
product pricing location and promotion
are the four Ps the MBA program is a
marketing masterclass and in the case of
study simulations you compete against
other teams and in that way you pick
things up much more quickly
hard skills great PMS need to influence
without being in charge these frequently
involved knowledge of corporate
operations research techniques and best
practices in product management here
hard skills are crucial clubs happy
hours and corporate outings make up half
of the MBA your social abilities will
significantly Advance as a result
Network in the field of product
management networking generally entails
locating decision makers significant
stakeholders influencers and other
experts and forming productive
connections with them now I know people
who manage billion dollar hedge VC and
PE firms there's just no likelihood that
as a manager in technology I would know
these folks
analyzing a problem related to metrics
choosing the appropriate metrics to
track and examine results in better
informed choices being made throughout
the product development process these
metrics provide the business with
tangible proof of the components of the
product or customer experience that are
not connecting with customers this
data-driven knowledge may be used by the
product marketing and sales teams to
better understand the drivers of their
consumer profiles the corporation uses
this information to better its products
going forward
measuring impacts
the next stage is to express
specifically what you expect this
adjustment to accomplish once you have
identified the relevant measurements
goals that are smart or Mt if you prefer
and make it obvious if they were
achieved are good goals
moving on let's know what your product
sense interviewer is looking to see
can you clearly articulate who you are
building for why and how it fits into
the meta mission
can you provide thoughtful reasoning for
why meta should or should not focus on
specific aspects of the broadest
possible product opportunity at hand
can you provide a thorough vision for
your desired MVP experience to test out
your hypothesis as well as your desired
end state for this product say three
years out this comes down to concretely
defining priorities and goals
can you zoom out from your personal user
needs and think about how this product
could scale and provide maximum value to
meta's Global user base of over 3
billion people
product sense interview questions will
typically be in the form of one very
deep hypothetical what would you build
for X with a series of follow-up
questions to understand your thought
process
let's now have a look at a few sample
questions
the interviewer may ask you how would
you improve Instagram stories build a
Facebook product for travel how would
you build Facebook birthday if it
weren't there how can we improve Google
Maps
create a photo sharing app for Google
build a music app for Facebook
moving on let's have a look at the tips
that you may follow to crack the sense
interview
knowing what the interviewer can ask you
should understand what aspect the
interviewer is looking for in you
adhere to the framework the product
sense interview is all about following
the structural framework to provide an
ethical and practical solution to the
problem given to you it's not every time
about creativity the solution should be
more practical the interviewer is
majorly looking for your structural
approach to provide the solution
questioning the approach is your
interviewer's main area of emphasis you
are not required to respond as soon as
you hear the question from the
interviewer it's acceptable to take a
break and ask the interviewer a
clarifying question if you're having
trouble comprehending what is being
asked of you this will help you realize
exactly what the interviewer needs to
know
even if you think you understand the
question you should nevertheless
paraphrase it to make sure you're not
missing any important details
reiterate the structure you're going to
use after a brief pause of 10 to 20
seconds and give a layout while
responding to the question so the
interviewer can see your response more
clearly
research the firm and become acquainted
with its main offerings
it's the firm that's hiring you so at
least they are going to ask you about
their concerned product as well
being familiar with their products will
give you a vision of what exactly the
company wants from you and you will be
able to structurize your opinions so
before going for the interview you must
go through the company's background its
workings and its products
be versatile most interview discussions
don't go as expected so never impose a
framework by checking in with the
interviewer regularly and stopping you
may make the dialogue casual and
free-flowing
Define the product goal instead of using
a statistic Define the product goal in
terms of the customer problem metrics
are only a way to measure progress they
are not the driving force behind product
development people's issues are resolved
through products for instance Google
Maps objective is to assist users in
navigating the world not to boost the
volume of Route searches
what quality of a product makes it good
or bad as per your experience with the
products do let us know in the comments
