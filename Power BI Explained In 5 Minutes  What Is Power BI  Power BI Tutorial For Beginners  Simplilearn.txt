this is Ben Ben started a store that
sells automobile parts like brakes
exhausts tires lubricants and car
Interiors he made a good start with his
business and achieved profits however as
days passed by along with his growing
business he faced some business
challenges he received orders from a
variety of customers with different
needs and requirements for example the
northern states had higher demand for
performance parts than others and the
eastern states demanded truck parts and
lubricants more and apart from this a
few products weren't performing well in
the market and remained unsold with the
unbalanced requirements and economy
variations Ben had a tough time helping
his customers with products on demand he
slowly realized he needed something new
that can help him tackle the store's
problems what if Ben had a tool that
could keep track of his store's
inventory in sales a geographical map
that can recognize the demand for
various types of products from different
regions a forecast feature that could
predict the economic fluctuations in the
market and help bin visualize every
single detail visually on one single
dashboard this software could
practically solve many business problems
and also could identify new
opportunities to improvise and grow the
business such types of software tools
are called business intelligence tools
and one such tool powerbi capable of
learning the store's business patterns
and running queries against the data to
help visualize the flaws and resolve
them quickly now let us understand how
Ben used powerbi and solve the issues
related to his business Ben collected a
storees entire sales data from the
previous quarter and ingested it into
powerbi Now using Ben was able to
categorize the data based on monthly
sales it took the daily sales and
considered it as the x-axis and then
powerbi computed the sales in the store
now Ben clearly understood the products
that outperform the sales charts and the
products that did not have much demand
let us elaborate a little Ben found that
the performance parts like sports
exhaust turbochargers and engine
management systems were selling well
with the powerbi power viiew forecast
feature Ben identified the demand for
Performance Products in the next quarter
so he raised the prices on a few
products that had the peak demand and
earned higher profits in the second
forecast report B found no significant
elevation nor a drop in the demand for
the tractor parts and lubricants apart
from this Benin saw the CES graphs of
electronics encountered a drop in the
current quarter compared to the previous
quarter in the sales of electronics like
the music and infotainment systems were
low to improvise and stabilize the
fluctuating sales of electronics Ben
came up with some exciting clearance
sale offers on electronic products using
power bi's map visual feature Ben
understood the product demand at a
regional level he found the northern
regions were interested in performance
kits for their imported sports cars the
Eastern regions had good demand for
truck parts and lubricants using powerbi
then could generate various
visualizations based on his data and
come up with business-oriented decisions
