today we'll be covering antifungal drugs
for pharmacology this is not only
important from the neuropharmacology but
also important from you of oral
pathology and oral medicine men also
clinically where we prescribe antifungal
agents for various anti fungal
infections which are the potential ncq
topics for the niche preparation so here
I will be covering the brief concepts of
how antifungal drugs act and the
important points of the various
antifungal drugs so to know how the
antifungal drugs would act first of all
we need to be clarified about how the
fungal cell is made up of right so the
most potential part and the resistance
part of the fungal cells has is the cell
wall and cell membrane right so a cell
wall it is basically made up of chitin
which is nothing but a long chain amino
acid that is n acetyl glucosamine and
the carbohydrate sugar that is glucans
that is the most familiar beta chain
glucans that is so beta 1 6 and beta 1 3
type some of them also have alpha type
that is 1 for alpha glucans and they are
made up of proteins that is most
probably in the form of nano proteins
now coming up to the cell membrane the
cell membrane of fungal cell is made up
of Agua sterile unlike in human which is
made up of cholesterol right so uh and
the drug would be acting and the process
of DNA synthesis or the synthesis of
proteins and acting upon the fungal cell
and now how the fungal cell would be
attacking right so basically whenever we
are planning for our attack what we'll
do we plan right how to attack from the
entry and how to be make the
three weeks right so similarly this
Drugs Act they act on cell wall they act
on cell membrane right they act on the
component which is helping the formation
of cell membrane right and then creating
pores and inhibiting the cell division
and inhibiting the protein synthesis
right so now we have the drugs which are
acting upon the cell wall these are
basically in eco Mason's
nekoma isn't they inhibit the chitin
synthesis right then we have Aquino
Canada that is cash performed in drug
which specifically acts on one three
beta glucan and they inhibit the
component that is making up the cell
wall right so we are inhibiting the
components which are making of the cell
wall so we are inhibiting the cell wall
formation next coming up to the cell
membrane right so we have alga steroids
which is the component of cell membrane
so now we would be acting upon
inhibition of the say or go sterile
formation so now how is a busted all
formed right so we have sanguillen which
in the presence of sanguillen epoxide
would be converting into lanosterol and
lanosterol which would be in presence of
p450 14 alpha the time methylase would
be converting into a ghost air alright
so we have drugs which would be changing
the membrane permeability by inhibiting
the formation of lanosterol and alga
stable so we have turbine afine which
would be inhibiting the or bacillus
inductance by acting upon sand filling
epoxide and we have a salt group of
drugs which would be acting upon 14
alpha d mentalize and inhibiting the
conversion of lands to all - or question
all right now what a go to release form
so how we will inhibit tag and once the
cell membrane is PO on how we would be
acting upon it so we have
fortress in B what does impression B
does it binds with the ergosterol and
forms the artificial fungal pores right
the cell polls are mean so what when the
pore formation is occurred there would
be the cell content would be leaking out
of the cell and else's contents leak out
that would be reading verses that right
and importance in B is the widest
antifungal drug we have the spectrum
right now there are microtubules in our
cell as we know what - my two Liberals -
they are helpful in spindle formation
during the cell division so what we
would be doing they're mostly present in
microtubules are there in dermatophyte
so we have grease or fuel means we which
will be inhibiting this microtubule
formation so as a result what we are
inhibiting we are inhibiting the cell
division of fungal cell in this way and
inhibiting the process of cell synthesis
so from all and we now have that is
protein synthesis one of the most
important aspects in the formation of
cell wall right so how it would be
inhibiting this protein synthesis that
would be through gnosis cytosin file
that is 5 FC this pi LC in the presence
of enzyme / - can enter into the cell
this file FC would be converting into 5
fluoro uracil in the presence of enzyme
cytosine deaminase right so this a
five-floor unison 10 would be converting
into 5 Rolo deoxy you read o then mono
phosphate right and then in the presence
of time we delayed synthetase would be
converted into deoxy time' dilates mono
phosphate and help in the synthesis of
DNA which would be further leading to
the synthesis of protein synthesis so
this drug is acting on the inhibition of
time' dilation touches
us inhibiting the DNA sequence formation
and inhibiting the protein synthesis
right so what did in a brief we have the
drug which would be acting on cell wall
drugs it would be acting on altering the
membrane permeability drugs which would
be inhibiting microtubule formation and
drugs that are inhibiting nucleic acid
synthesis right so now coming up to the
classification so as we got to know how
and where they are acting upon now we
can easily classify it so inhibiting
cell wall synthesis so which drugs would
be there
remember back entry cell wall that is
aquino pendant that is tazbo found in
group and lick amide sin which inhibits
the chitin synthesis now this case for
funding is a group in also a group of
drug that is the new a group of
antifungal drugs we have that is aquino
candidates and they are mostly used
intravenously and other drugs which are
included in this group are Micah funding
and any Dula fungal right then we have
drugs which will alter membrane
permeability so which were those number
one we had terbinafine which was
inhibiting the sample information to
lannister your formation that is all
this group of drugs turban arson lootin
ofin and nasty fine this are our ghost
eros plus lanosterol inhibiting drugs
then we have and we assault inhibit the
conversion of Leno's children into our
children
there are based upon this structure we
have two types that is try as all then
which are having three nitrogen group of
structure and Amy - all right so try as
nas includes new corners wall a truck a
nozzle Waurika nozzle and pitaka nozzle
right and we have imidazoles which
include key token as also f IV p
whip right FIV P is a try as all and kcb
right it is a sceeto cañazo clotrimazole
and blue token at all which are the in
need as all group of your Mak CB and
tries v EP right this see there you can
remember then we have a poor liens group
of drugs that is invert present be in
the starting and hem Ison that is s am
bicy il-10 my sync group of drugs then
we have our drugs which would be
disrupting microtubule formation that is
the grease of whole beam and we saw
poison is one of the system in drugs
which we use for superficial skin
infections and then we have block
strug's which mill in EB nucleic sill
acid synthesis that is sluices Towson's
that is 5fc
now here we have per second as all which
is the only drug which will be acting
against mucormycosis this is an
important point to remember
further we are also going for the other
drugs and important factors of them now
coming into the important points of
various drugs that is we have number one
we have fluconazole you know one of the
most common drug we prescribe as an
antifungal so Lucan as well is a drug of
choice for candidiasis cryptococcal
meningitis and it is used for
prophylaxis prophylaxis of we brian
neutropenia right fluconazole is for
prophylaxis and what for the treatment
of fervid value 2 ponyo so drug of
choice for the treatment of supply
neutropenia is very connoisseur clear
about it now we have a track on assault
a trap on us all is a drug of choice for
blastomycosis histoplasmosis hokkaido
mycosis and Perico koi de microcells
and we have the another group that is a
ketoconazole it is also having it
inhibits the cytochrome p450 enzyme
reaction right so it is important by the
point of aspect of drug interaction
because as we inhibit there are drugs
which increase the p50 enzymes and there
are drugs we decrease the p50 enzymes
right p450 enzymes so we know that the
drug interaction would vary that would
be synergistic effect or an inhibitory
factor other drugs
so if skit of a nozzle important and
difficult drug from the point of view if
to be prescribed with other drugs right
this would be we'll be covering it in
later on now we have a newer group of
drugs as we said cash flow function
which would which where does it act 1 3
beta glucans right so this are the only
approved drug and this will be used only
in the cases where invasive
aspergillosis is not responding to the
oricon as one on amphotericin B right
clear about it now coming up to war upon
us all
Molly Connors all is used for D or C of
the brain neutropenia and also it is a
drug of choice for invasive
aspergillosis aspergillosis right clear
up till now and now we have some of the
topical drugs which are used so these
are white fields or internment
who knows you might be asked what is the
composition of miles fins or invent so
you need to remember it is basically
benzoic acid with salicylic acid which
is topical antifungal drug then we have
Pauline group nest at in which is used
for oral candidiasis and if it is a
topically for oral candidiasis and
nicotine is given orally for
gastrointestinal fungi clear so you
would
be confused if it is oral candidiasis it
is topical if it is guess kinda status
unless then statin is given orally that
is systematically systemically clear
about it keep a note on this point that
we have Tyler state and untie clinic
acid and omit as well ketoconazole zu
tokenizer all these are the L salts
which are used as a topical are now
coming up to a most important that that
is info Terrace in B it is having a
wider spectrum of antibiotic and it is
useful as a coin friction for systemic
fungal infections and it binds to
ergosterol as we see it forms artificial
pores and inhibit some create the spores
and leads to cell death right so now
what is the disadvantages of
amphotericin B and it leads to those
limiting nephrotoxicity and it can lead
to acute infusion related reactions
hypophosphatemia anemia and hepatic
dysfunction right there are lipid
formulations available for Mpho ter S&B
there are amphotericin B lipid complex
and pateros in B colloidal dispersions
complex and liposomal amphotericin B
right now what is the advantage of this
lipid formulations of n fo Terrace in me
these are that it leads to my your acute
reactions can be used in intolerance to
conversion of preparations have Lola fro
toxicity L anemia and deliverer of
amphotericin B to re s of liver spleen
is so useful in Leishmania and immuno
compromised to patients and it can be
given in the
higher doses right this is the
advantages of lipid formulations of em
Pateros in B now coming up to the
interaction as I said that we have
ketoconazole that inhibits the
cytochrome p450 enzyme right so as this
occurs cyclosporine phenytoin called
glutamine this serum concentration
increases right so ketoconazole is
basically to be contraindicated with
info Terezin B we must not give in the
combination of info terracing be as it
is inhibiting the action of amphotericin
B now coming up to a combination of M
fertilizing be with flu sisters's right
so both this plugged when given together
it occurs gives a spinner for synergism
right so how it is advantageous that is
entry of five neuro flu sisters and it
produces that oxygen there is a rapid
culture conversion reduction in duration
of therapy and decreased resistance
right so this is the advantages of flu
sisters in and in photo recent the are
leads to cynicism when given together
and verify body Kaunas all the adverse
effect of re canals all is that it
prolonged QT interval and it has it
causes a visual disturbances and that is
called blurred vision altered color
pearl perception and photophobia and as
we discussed previously posture Kaunas
all is the only as all that is active
against Nucor mycosis
so to be in brief we have a for
blastomycosis we have a track on as well
Nucor mycosis me up osaka nozzle
candidiasis cryptococcal meningitis so
we have flu kana do kana do ah as a
prophylaxis for the brand new top anemia
fluconazole
it meant for pre-planned neutropenia we
have worried Kaunas all as a drug of
choice for invasive aspergillosis we
have reconnaissance when it is not
responding to very Kaunas all the drug
of choice for invasive aspergillosis is
kasper funding and we have a most wide
spectrum of an antifungal that is info
Terezin be for systemic drugs for
superficial fungal infections we have
grease or full wean aneil our minds that
is terbinafine nasty fin and mutant ofin
which are an assault that is
ketoconazole fluconazole and
itraconazole are used
orally as systemic drugs for superficial
infections and that's it for antifungal
drug thank you thanks a lot for watching
