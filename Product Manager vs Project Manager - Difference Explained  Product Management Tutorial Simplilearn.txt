the product
a product is offered to deliver its
services to the users by putting efforts
to be produced for example google maps
for directional services
it can also be defined as a tangible
item that an alliance create to serve
the customers need for example uber for
taxi services
a product is designed to create
customers value by solving their
problems with convenient evolution and
it doesn't have any explicit life cycle
and has more permanence which means that
the product doesn't have any fixed end
date and needs continuous discovery and
development
now let's understand what is product
management
so product management is managing the
process of the product throughout the
life cycle from strategizing designing
and development to branding of the
product
the product management involves
strategizing products to enhance the
profit of the business
creating customers value
creating road maps to get a clear idea
of how to design and develop the product
specifying functional requirement and
creating blueprints
and development of the product as per
the requirement
and once the product is developed it is
necessary to take customers feedback
and then only the price of the product
is finalized
now that we have an idea of product and
product management let's take a look at
what is a project
a project is something that
results in the product as an outcome
it is a fleeting effort commenced to
construct a remarkable product or
service
it can also defined as the process of
providing services to the user by
focusing on scope resources and quality
of the output
all the products have a team to work on
a budget to complete the task under a
specific amount a schedule to follow and
some expectations to meet the need of
the customers
we can also determine a project as the
process of executing a plan which
involves taking requirements of the
customers and building the solution
projects are the temporary efforts to
meet the need of the business to
organize by providing services to the
user
now let's move further and understand
what is project management
so project management is defined as the
process of planning and organizing the
resources of the company to complete a
specific task
project management plays the same role
irrespective of the belonging industry
it is the rule that specifies
product of an organization
the main objective of project management
is to determine the goals and objective
of the
project it also creates a quality
assurance check to ensure the standards
of the project
it is approach of applying skills and
techniques to complete a project as per
customers requirement
and it helps to get a predictable
project planning and execution process
the primary constraints of project
management are
time
post scope and quality
now let's know more about product and
product managers
so let's move further and understand who
is a product manager
a product manager is a person in an
organization that is responsible for
product development as per the
customer's requirement

development team and manages the
coordination regarding the product
developed between the customers and the
developers
the product manager monitors the
product
and the market and develop the
competitive analysis
the product manager is an association
between the business developers and the
users of the product
now let's understand who is a project
manager
a project manager is an individual who
plans and organize the resources needed
for the project and looks after the
specific need of a project of an
organization
the product manager determines the goals
and objectives of the project by

now let's move further and understand
the difference between a product manager
and a project manager
the product manager deals with the
all-around needs of the product from
strategizing to branding of the product
on the other hand the project manager
deals with applying techniques to
complete a particular project
the product manager focuses on building
up the value of the product
but the project manager focuses on work
coordination
the product manager owns the what
and the project manager owns the how

marketplace
on the other hand the project manager
