networks model before the data is ready
to be transmitted our Network channel it
is important to provide the data with
the address information about the source
and the destination for the routing
process this task is handled by the
network link of the OSI model hi
everyone I'm vavo khandelwal and I
welcome you all to Simply learns YouTube
channel today we will be discussing
Network layer in the OSI model but
before we begin if you love watching the
similar Tech content then try
subscribing to our simply launch Channel
and hit the Bell icon so you are the
first to get notified
so now without any further Ado let us
begin with the plan for today's topic
first we will have a quick recap on the
OSI model
then we will dive into our core topic
the network layer moving on we will have
a detailed understanding for the major
functions of network layer
finally we will wrap up this session
with a discussion on the
responsibilities of the network layer in
the OSI model
now the OSI model stands for open system
interconnection Model A specifically
designed set of protocols and standards
governing the data's modeling and
conversion for proper transmission
the osm model is divided into seven
layers which perform specific functions
and apply protocols to maintain data
quality without any error
now let's move on to the core topic for
this session what is Network layer
the network layer is responsible for
breaking down the segment into Data
packets and resembling them on receiving
end this layer also ensures that the
packets are transmitted over the best
possible route to the destination system
governed by the internet protocols
so now moving forward let us look at the
networks layer function
but before we begin first let's
understand the data flow between the
network layer and the other layers in
the OSI model
that is to begin with the network layer
we will receive data from the transport
layer of the OSI model
the network layer handles these data
packets by integrating them with the
sources and destination address it also
add Network protocol for the proper
transmission over the networks Channel
now let's look at the functions of the
network layer
first we have Internet working
that handles the network channel as the
name suggests
then we have Network addressing followed
by packet routing and packet handling
now
let's look at the sum of the points
regarding the functions
first up internetworking it is one of
the main tasks of the network layer to
handle the network connection between
multiple devices in the channel this
task applies multiple protocols
available in the network layer of the
OSI model for stable network connection
next up Network addressing
the network layer does the tasks of
adding the source and the destination
address in the header of the network
channel
the network addressing is performed to
identify the device where the data is
being shared
next up packet routing
now the establishing and routing path
for the data packets is one of the main
functions of the network layer in the
network model
a network layer chooses the most
suitable path out of the line of the
path available in the channel next up
packet handling
in this the network function the layer
handles the data received from the upper
layers of the OSI model the network
layer converts the received data into
the packets for sharing over the
communication Channel
now let's look at the responsibilities
of network layer
the network layer is responsible for
handling the shortest routing path for a
data packet in the network channel it is
also responsible for converting the
received data into packets for
transmission this layer also handles the
network layer protocol which is
responsible for maintaining the
Network's traffic in the channel
now with this we have covered all the
important points related to network
layer of the OSI model
