I used to cook really good at my young
age initially my family and relatives
had always been praising me that someday
I would be a real good housewife it
always made me feel happy uh when they
praised me I understood there was no
career potential for me so learning
basically became my weapon to even the
challenges thrown to me in my
professional
life simply learn helped me make this
transition smooth from being a developer
at seens I switched to being a scrum
Master at FEI systems and also got 100%
hike with this
move I'm sapna Tani I'm working as a
scrum master and this is my simply learn
journey I come from nask Maharashtra
I've completed my graduation in bcom
with computer specialization back then
in my school time I wasn't a very
brilliant student but I was a very good
cook I used to bake at that point of
time and I was actually very good at
household chores and my family really
used to be appreciative about these
things in me and uh they always thought
that uh home sence would be a suitable
career with the likings I have right now
but then uh I I did hear them saying
sometimes that uh this cannot be really
a career this changed my uh opinion and
I started working really hard my studies
I I started getting good scores in my
examinations and this changed my opinion
about my likings and how I want to shape
my life in near future

completely when I completed my MCA I was
just aware of two streams into it that
was development and testing I chose to
go ahead with development because I felt
that a bit more challenging uh um I
worked as a software developer until I
grew as a senior software developer uh
there in nask
itself in the year 2016 I got married
and I moved to Bangalore at that point
of time I could not see me doing
anything else but being a software
developer so I worked really really hard
and I is the very first interview I
appeared for in uh Bangalore and I was
hired as a senior software developer in
HP then known as as DXE now I was also
introduced to many new things in it
which um as we know in Bangalore we
Embrace new technologies and new
terminologies in it so uh with that I
got introduced to scrum as well so uh
this was a new thing which I found very
interesting after working with DXE for
almost a year year and a half I started
working with Seaman technology as
associate consultant I was leading uh
two teams for internal tool development
as working as an architect at some point
of time and uh being a lead I also uh
was working as a scrum master so while I
was working with seamen Technologies um
when I conceed I was that time working
on three projects parall on different
roles I took that as a challenge and I
continued until or 2 days before my
delivery so after becoming a mother I
realized what being a mother and the
responsibility of a mother takes it is
challenging but it's still
fulfilling when I came back to work
scrum master was something which I was
doing additional to being a developer so
at that point of time I decided that
yeah this could also be shaped as a good
career and um within a day I had already
enrolled myself uh for this drum Master
certification with
simply it has been a fantastic journey
be it the platform or the executives
helping me out throughout this journey
be it right from the enrollment or um
raising any tickets for any concerns
anything has been very simple rightly
named as simply learn before the
certification I felt that uh I lacked
some confidence uh when it comes to
concepts of scrum and agile I used to
miss few things but um after the
certification it has really helped boost
my confidence now I can lead the
meetings really well I can handle the
situations very constructively and I am
also a fitness freak so I am into
calisthenics uh to do my body weight
training I also practice yoga as well as
meditation to help me have peace of mind
as no stop to learning is uh what I feel
you will fall but uh see to it that
you just stand up again and try to work
again you will succeed 100% you will but
just don't stop
