is mentioned in the description box
below so without any further delay let's
start this video with what is artificial
intelligence artificial intelligence
refers to the development of computer
systems and software that can perform
tasks that typically require human
intelligence these tasks include
reasoning problem solving learning from
experience understanding natural
language recognizing patterns and making
decisions AI aims to create machines or
softwares that can mimic human cognitive
functions enabling them to perform tasks
with worrying level of complexity AI is
surely one of the most sought after
Industries for professionals looking for
a promising career and a lucrative
salary so let's talk about the top five
AI jobs with the highest salaries at
number five we have a computer vision
engineer a computer vision engineer is a
programmer skilled in creating software
using visual input sensors and
algorithms these systems can interpret
their environment as seen in
self-driving cars and facial recognition
computer vision Engineers uses languages
like C plus plus and python they work on
tasks like object detection emit
segmentation facial and gesture
recognition and scene comprehension
consequently the compensation packages
for computer vision Engineers have
become notably attractive according to
glassdo the average salary of a computer
vision engineer is hundred and fifty
five thousand dollars in the United
States and in India it's rupees 8 lakh
per annum serving as a significant
incentive for individuals venturing into
this domain
at number 4 we have software Engineers
software Engineers handle tasks from
design to deployment but it's rare to
find experts in All Phases they usually
specializes in specific areas this
specialization applies to AI software
Engineers too they work on various
applications including machine learning
inference learning NLP and intrusion
detection
covering different aspects of AI
development consequently decompensation
packages for software Engineers have
become notably attractive according to
Glassdoor the average salary of a
software engineer is one hundred and
forty thousand dollars in the United
States and in India it's rupees 9 lakh
per you know serving as a significant
incentive for individuals venturing into
this domain
moving on to number three we have
machine learning Engineers a machine
learning engineer creates and deploys
training algorithms and models which is
the most demanding part of machine
learning most machine learning Engineers
hold Advanced degrees in computer
science mathematics or statistics due to
the need for advanced math skills many
also pursue specialized master's degrees
or certifications in machine learning
deep learning on neural networks
consequently the compensation packages
for ML Engineers as well is notably
attractive according to glasdow the
average salary of a machine learning
engineer is 150 000 in the United States
and in India it goes up to 11 lakh
rupees per annum with additional cash
benefits at number 2 we have an AI
research scientist AI research
scientists often computer scientists
focuses on innovating a algorithms and
models
their duties include creating and
evaluating new AI models collaborating
in research publishing papers and
presenting ad conferences while
programming is a part of their work it's
just a portion unlike the tech
industry's openness to self-staught
programmers AIR research scientists need
strong backgrounds in computer science
mathematics and statistics consequently
the compensation packages for AI
research scientists have become notably
attractive according to glasdow the
average salary of an AIR research
scientist is 125 000 in the United
States
and rupees 21 lakhs per annum in India
with additional cash benefits and
finally at number one we have an AI
product manager an AI product manager is
much like other program managers they
oversee teams for AI product development
handling schedules and Milestones to do
this effectively they need to understand
AI components like hardware and
programming languages which helps them
support their teams creating AI apps
differs from web applications in
structure and development processes
consequently the compensation is the
highest for AI product managers in 2024.
according to glasdow the average salary
of an AI product manager is 190 000 in
the United States and in India it goes
around 26 lakh rupees per annum with
additional cash compensations
so these are the top five job rules you
should consider entering in 2024 so
let's go through the reasons why AI
individuals are paid so much the first
reason is surging demand AI is in high
demand across Industries due to its
