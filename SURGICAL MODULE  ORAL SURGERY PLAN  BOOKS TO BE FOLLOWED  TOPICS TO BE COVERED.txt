we'll wait for one more minute so before
we start
the plan of action of
oral surgery
how many have passion towards oral
surgery passion or interest or something
like you have that passion towards water
like simple question how many want to
become oral surgeons
microfacial surgery how how many of you
want to pick max of facial surgery as an
option
in your counseling
[Music]
yes i can see decent number of
people responding
okay all of you
do you want to end up
just as an oral surgeon
or you you want you want to explore the
oral surgery like for example you have
so many fellowships that are available
in oral surgery
yes you have oncology you have trauma
you have craniofacial you have cleft lip
cleft palate you have so many things so
many fellowships
and profitable in the upcoming few years
there there will be further more
fellowships
because facial reconstruction
facial aesthetics so many so many things
are there
okay so what what my suggestion for all
of you is for example if you want to
become an oral surgeon
don't keep your limitations only for mds
oral surgery mds oral surgery is
just a part of your journey it's not the
entire journey
and if you do mds oral surgery you can
maximum
can handle a case of impaction
or an extraction
or a simple
maybe a simple trauma trauma case you
can handle
but that is the reason why exploring
oral surgery is more important rather
than picking an oral surgery as an
option in mds okay so so people who has
a thought of thought to
become an oral surgeon okay the future
requires
a fellowship okay the future requires a
fellowship means you have to select
i mean don't decide that you have to do
fellowship in this particular
wing or in this particular branch now
itself because oral surgery mds is a
three years course where you will know
which part of oral surgery and which
which
like which department of oral surgery
the sub departments of oral surgery you
are more interested to or which
department which part of oral surgery
has more demand
so basing upon the demand or basing upon
the requirement at that particular
situation you decide which branch you
are going to pick but as of now don't
keep anything in your mind okay because
your knowledge is just
as i discussed your knowledge is just 10
days around the globe of the dental
field only 10 days no you know only 10
days of dentistry now okay so don't
decide anything
whatever department you want you can
choose now
with your knowledge or through
throughout the preparation or you have
someone one minute of year of time to
get into mds because mds counselling for
you will be like one year four months or
one year five months from now so you
have this time to decide which branch
you want to go but if you want to become
an oral surgeon
the point is
the particular field the particular
fellowship has to be decided during the
process of oral surgery mds is it clear
guys
don't decide like what field you want to
go ahead now itself because three to
four years of time everything around you
will change
so you need to pick something which is
interesting for your second
something which is demanded something
which is which has more demand at that
time so you should you should you should
like you should you should see what
market wants at that particular time and
accordingly you have to plan is it clear
i hope it's clear like most of them has
this norms okay day one only you decide
you want to become something no it's not
possible you say it's something like an
upgradation like for example you see
every every three or four months you'll
get an update regarding a particular app
right why they want to get upgrade
similarly the professional life also
will get upgraded at different levels
level one okay this is what level two
this is what so during the process of
mds you learn so many things so many new
things whatever the 10 percent is
knowledge you have in dentistry that
will be drifted to a higher number
during the process of mds and during
that period you can take some good calls
like this choosing the branch or
something which is very very important
and which is very very keen
right
okay shall i jump into the
shall i jump into the main content of
today's session
i'll try to wrap up it in within half an
hour
okay right so the department you have in
front of you is oral surgery as already
said okay
now we are going to handle in the
upcoming days we are going to handle
one module called as
surgical model surgical model we are
going to handle in the upcoming days
okay so what are included in the
surgical model which i have discussed
one is oral surgery
second one is general anatomy
general anatomy will include general
histology and general embryology also
okay so be clear general embryology and
general histology are included in
general anatomy histology and embryology
are
not very specific stuff
related to this just a second
right and the next one is general
surgery right is it clear guys
surgical model
so the upcoming 40 days
40 45 days you are going to focus on the
surgical model oral surgery
general anatomy general histology
general embryology and general surgery
okay
so according to neet blueprint
this module is going to carry 14 marks
of general surgery 14 marks of
anatomy plus embryology plus histology
and 14 marks of oral surgery so totally
it's going to carry 42 marks
okay out of 260
240 marks okay 40 marks is one one sixth
so it's going to carry one sixth of the
marks in your examination is it clear
are you clear about the
number of marks or number of mc number
of
questions
that you will you can you can predict
around this module is this
area and trust me
of course we now now we read both
from the memory based point of view as
well as the
uh
concept based point of view but final
exam most of the things will move around
the concepts okay so
so don't break your heads you're going
to you need to hit somewhere around
minimum 35 plus right answers in this
area
okay but here
here we go we we try to teach both
conceptual as well as memory based
things so it's going to be tricky for
you but final exam will move around
mostly we'll move around conceptual
things and it is mandatory that you need
to hit somewhere around 35 plus score
okay in this particular 42 marks
okay done can i move
so this particular video will be
focusing more on oral surgery
and once we
start general anatomy i'll be discussing
about the general anatomy we'll take a
live session like this
so how many marks i told you how many
marks oral surgery exclusively
in your neat exam
how many marks 14 marks right perfectly
right
and the one more exam you have inicit
and inict also carries very huge number
somewhere around it will go around
ionicity will go around 12 to 15 marks
around this particular subject okay so
this this figure varies from year to
year but this is always constant is it
clear
clear about neet number of questions
from oral surgery clear about ini cet
number of questions from world's weather
right
so next important things to be like
important things what should be the most
important keen thing about this is
just recapping the things what you have
done previously
okay so for example in a oral surgery
department i don't bother like whether
you're a good student
in a final year
or in in a user level or now you're may
you might be working in a clinical
scenario but my question for all of you
is what you have done in the clinics of
oral
surgery what you have done what you have
seen just tell me what you have done
what you have seen in the
clinics of
first one yes of course priya you're
right you have done so many extractions
okay apart from extractions have you
done anything yes of course blocks
extractions plus blocks
inter maxillary fixation
anything more suturing techniques
suturing intra maxillary fixations
have you seen any cases tumor cases cyst
cases
have seen any cases
oral surgery oral medicine okay cases
are important because
case-based questions
you can predict
the combination of oral medicine
and
oral surgeon
okay right that that knowledge is
required for example you have a fracture
case orbital fracture
orbital fracture case is there in front
of you so you should be in a position to
tell what are the clinical features you
see in this particular case
okay that's what that that's that's a
good aspect like if you have if you if
you're being exposed to such cases if
you have seen such cases it is easy to
remember the things okay there is
nothing very extraordinary
it's going to be easy for you to
remember the things remember the things
i mean like you can recollect the things
you can easily
read the things that is an advantage for
you
okay that's an extra advantage for you
if not you have to see and learn okay so
my suggestion for all of you
please my suggestion for all of you is
kindly
kindly correlate everything whatever
you're going to read with the diagram
is it clear
is it clear i mean most of you i mean
for basic reading or for basic mcq books
whatever you're doing is you're doing
some mcq books and most of the mcq books
doesn't have diagrams
but what i can say is neet out of 240
you will have 40 diagram based questions
40 plus
so everything has to be correlated to
your diagram
of course uh in your smart video content
you will have
you have diagrams everywhere okay but
what my suggestion is even if you don't
have a diagram
try to
search a diagram on the google and try
to link it okay so we we we are posting
so many diagrams but you also have to do
job from your site
right
so all this whatever you have done
will be useful
how they can be useful
to retain the subject like once you see
a patient
of mandible fracture
you can easily remember the clinical
features of mandibular factor rather
than reading if you see it you can
easily remember okay
i mean seeing a case may not be possible
in every college i agree for that but
seeing a pic on a google seeing a pic on
a smart video
ski seeing a pic by your own interest is
possible is it possible or not
seeing a
searching for a diagram and learning
something from diagram imagining that as
a clinical scenario that is possible so
everyone
everyone you try to show that at most
interest so that this oral surgery is
going to be one of the easiest subject
it is vast
it is vast i agree this is vast but
thing is it can be easy only if you
imagine the situation only if you
have a clinical grasp over a particular
condition or anything
is it fine
can i jump into the next content
okay so this is how i have splitted your
subject
so what i have done
i have done i have given local
anesthesia two days
local anesthesia means enter local
anesthesia both the clinical i mean i i
i never prepared because what you do at
uc level is blocks okay you do blocks
but you what you less focus on is
the chemistry of local anesthesia so in
the video content we try to focus more
on the chemistry okay i i just ignored
uh the blocks because blocks everyone
are familiar with blocks you are
familiar every every normal individual
at a bds level are familiar because i i
ask you one tooth and i ask you what are
the blocks that you have to give this
extraction of a particular teeth i hope
most of you can handle this if not
you you have to work on this right is it
okay
so we have given two days for local
anesthesia
followed by
medical emergencies medical emergencies
and their managements
medical emergencies in dental office and
their managements okay you have a
specific test book for this that is
called as malmet local anesthesia the
reference textbook should be malmed
again
and medical emergencies the reference
textbook should be malmed again malmet
this monument medical emergencies in
dental office malmet is a different
textbook
and uh local anesthesia malmed is a
different textbook make sure
whenever you get a doubt whenever you
want to refer you have to refer these
books only whatever i am mentioning here
not any any other book there are many
books available but most of the paper
setters they follow these standard books
only so to lead the to leave that
controversy i want you to stick on to
this particular book itself okay so then
jumping into that i am focusing more on
exodus and impaction i have given two
days for you
okay so this is a lecture day i was just
added cps
so cprs you have new 2020 guidelines
which are being covered as a video so
this this is not going to take much of
your time
less time
so this day you can keep it as a
revision for your backlogs whatever
backlogs you have at this particular
time you can keep it so tempo mandible
joint you have to cover anatomy anatomy
is a part of general anatomy and
disorders are a part of oral surgery
oral surgery and oral medicine
okay maxo facial i mean maxillary sinus
anatomy and its disorders
coming to that i have given three days
for you
for max of facial trauma which includes
leaf foods which includes orbital
fractures putting which includes
zygomatic fractures which includes
mandibular fractures and their treatment
plans and everything you know how
important a fractures is to your final
year exam similarly the factors are
important next comes we have many
questions on drug interactions in
2018 and 2019 so that is the reason why
i have given a special day for drug
interactions hope you remember your
pharmacology dental drug interactions
okay so this topic is well covered in
your malmed again medical emergencies of
marmite of course
the clear-cut
contents are given in your smart notes
okay smart notes you have the drug
interactions all the drug interactions
which are important for example were
covered in your smart notes you can go
back and check then or else then
orthognathic surgery a combination of
arthroplasty surgery then pre-prosthetic
surgery a combination of prostate
surgery
cleft lift cleft palate is again a
combination of many subjects it comes in
pedo it comes in ortho it comes in
overall surgery also then comes the
cysts and tumors of orofacial reason now
we'll be focusing more on surgical
aspects okay because the basic
aspects will be covered in your oral
radiology and oral medicine now we'll be
focusing more on the surgical aspects
then comes the
facial nerve paralysis as well as your
trigeminal neurology all these are going
to come that is called as facial
neuropathy neuropathology this is again
the oral medicine and radiology part
also it will be covered in many subjects
general medicinals it will be covered
apart from that we'll talk about
malignancies and the treatments that's
what your own collagen and everything
and recent advanced advanced procedures
and everything will be covered
of course damn importance has to be
given for the diagram based content
followed by revision and followed by the
examination of oral surgery i hope this
this this division is clear very clear
okay i have allocated so many days the
reason why i have allocated so many days
is apart from covering oral surgery what
i'm doing is i'm covering medical
emergencies here
which is a part of general medicine i am
covering local anesthesia top to bottom
which is a part of pharmacology
i am covering drug interactions which is
a part of pharmacology and whatever you
do now
you no need to do the same content when
you're doing in other subject for
example orthognathic surgeries
do at the best here no need to touch
orthognathic surgeries when you're
handling ortho because if you open ortho
and see orthognathic surgeries is one
topic
similarly
pre-prosthetic surgery is a topic for
you in your prosthetic so
if you do these things at the best so
whenever you're doing that particular
subject you can save one more day one
more or two more days similarly cleft
lift cleft palate is a topic in your
pedo as well as in your ortho so now you
cover your now along with oral surgery
you're covering two topics of
ortho that is one is orthognathic
surgery second one is cleft fluid and
craft palate
similarly
what you are doing here you are covering
tempo mandible joint anatomy maxillary
sinusitis anatomy and space infections
means all anatomies of space infections
thereby you're doing
10 percenters of your general anatomy
also here is it clear
so this this sort of
doing one subject integrated with other
subject is called as integrated mode of
preparation
you cannot have this extra edge of
integrated mode of preparation with most
of the instruments because oral surgery
will be handled by a different person
over there
ortho will be handled by a different
person over there pedo will be handled
by a different person over there and the
only advantage here mds conqueror is
most of the subjects we as a team we are
going to handle the core team is going
to handle it of course oral surgeon will
come and teach you but the core team is
going to handle you
and so the core team will know what what
what an oral surgeon is teaching related
to orthognathic aspect so by which we
will ask the orthodontist to ignore that
is it clear
i hope you are clear with the schedule
you don't have any doubts related to the
schedule so local anesthesia two days
medical emergencies followed by exodus
impaction two days cpr modifications you
have to see tempo mandibular joint
maxillary sinus max of facial trauma
drug interactions orthognathic surgery
pre-prosthetic surgery cleft lift cleft
palate
cysts
facial neuropathies of course space
infections and there are many other
things okay many other things which i am
going to tell you what to be done how to
be done and everything okay done can i
move i want you to be active i want you
to
be active
i want you to respond me as active as
possible
yeah we have 180 plus strength it's a
good strength first time we are seeing
that huge strength
okay chill out
so next one what i'm going to tell you
is
i'm going to tell you the sequence of
checklist but if you just have a glance
over can you see the video content so
this is a video content available for
you on the website okay
so i'm just going to give you a glance
like what to be done at which time what
to be done at which time
so here everything will be covered no
need to hurry book references everything
will tell once the session is done you
can ask me what what extra things you
you have doubt and everything everything
will be covered no need conquer is
something that everything will come
in an organized way don't no need to
worry no need to worry right okay
so you can see the video content so
first is exudancia
i hope you are familiar your impactions
classifications of your impactions
uh your difficulty index and all these
will be covered so local anesthesia you
have three parts out of which
apart from the chemistry of law of
anesthesia i tried to cover the
calculations related to the local
anesthesia hope in your oral surgery
department you you i mean i hope you
remember that what is the maximum dosage
of l.a given to your particular
individual with vasoconstrictor with
visor constructor without
vasoconstrictor so all those things will
be covered in this local anesthesia part
one part two and part three
then i told you to focus on tempo
mandibular joint
maxillary sinus you have four parts of
videos
okay cleft lift cleft palate okay all
these are covered in your schedule
whatever i'm ticking with blue color all
these are covered in the schedule
orthognathic you have two parts three
prosthetics you have one part whatever
that is not covered in the schedule i'm
just marking it okay clear anatomical
spaces of orofacial reason this is
called a space infection
okay hope guys you remember your space
infection
questions most commonly asked question
did go mandibular
mandible
space infection
right
okay so this is not covered in the smart
video
schedule and but you have to allocate in
the
in the in the schedule accordingly right
this is one right next one
so all these dental considerations will
be coming uh under uh
medical emergency so i have to i told
you i have given one day for you for
medical emergencies
where you need to cover dental
considerations for pregnancy pregnancy
is a medical emergency in your
department what to be done for a
pregnant woman chair position for a
pregnant woman okay everything similarly
there is something called as emergency
drug kit which comes under medical
emergency okay then after
you need to focus on the medical
emergencies of adrenal insufficiency
medical emergencies of bronchial asthma
copd medical emergencies of hepatitis
medical emergencies of hypertension
myocardial infarction and infective
endocarditis and all these are going to
come under medical emergencies
then as of now i want you guys to ignore
this particular thing
general anesthesia part one and part two
this we will be doing in general surgery
so we'll be doing in this particular
surgical model only but i'll be i'll be
teaching you
the general anesthesia part in your
general surgery is it clear
is it clear guys
general anesthesia will be doing in
general surgery don't touch general
anesthesia now
so then we'll be jumping into infections
of secondary spaces which is a
continuation of space infection space
infection one chapter we have already
done
right so anatomical of the order of
spatial spaces this is a
second part of space infection then i
told you some diagram based questions so
most of the diagram based questions are
covered along with the contents along
with the contents for example mandibler
fractures you have mandibular spacing
mandible diagrams and everything so
apart from that
in your
for example in your in your final year
exam practical vaiwar so they'll ask you
instrument based questions right so they
keep an instrument ask you what is the
use of this instrument identify the name
of this instrument so all those diagram
based questions were covered in the
instruments part one
part two part three and part four okay
this is diagram based content so then
jumping into the maxo facial maxo facial
trauma so all these contents left or are
max of facial that is mandibular
fractures mcqs on fractures
mid facial fractures nasal bone
fractures
orbital fractures and naso ethymoidal
fractures
your primary care in factors okay so
this is a space infections again the
third the third area of the third part
of space infections
okay syncope is a medical emergency
syncope is a medical emergency
followed by treatment of oral cancer i
was talking about malignancies malignant
is the last topic
so malignancies and the treatment of
course zygomatic factors comes under the
fractures is it clear
about the content
clear clear about the about the smart
videos as of now present maybe smart
videos view of the smart videos if
required they'll be updated in
while while the pro while while you're
preparing for this oral surgery or when
we are taking the oral surgery for the
second round this is the smart video
content available as of now in oral
surgery
so apart from that there is something
called as smart notes okay smart notes
i'm going to tell you
smart notes is
i told you drug interactions from malmed
has to be covered this is the smart
nodes
i told you right drug interactions
drug interactions is completely and
and memory based aspect so what i have
done i have added drug interactions
direct direct stuff from your malmet
which you have to do for this drug
interactions this is the one pdf this is
the one notes you have to do
then comes the instruments instruments
are already covered in your videos
instruments part one part two part three
part four okay so once you're done with
that if you want you can have a glance
quick glance
once you are done with that if you want
you can have a
quick glance
or the instrumentation is it clear
is it
clear okay
uh then comes
oral surgery overall smart notes okay so
this is
166 pages of notes of oral surgery okay
i'll tell you what to be done okay so
all the topics of oral surgery which are
important were covered in this
particular smart notes it's not
mandatory that you have to do this notes
but if you feel if you feel
you're weak in understanding the
concepts you're weak in understanding
finishing the things then you have to
think over of this particular notes is
it clear the smart nodes content so all
the chapters of smart nodes are covered
in this apart from the instrument
diagrams as well as the drug
interactions
okay now coming to the reference books
okay books that you have to refer okay
one is you can keep neelama malik as a
book of reference
okay i don't know whether you have uh
the hard copy of neelima malik i don't
know what
what book you have done during your uc
level but this is a book that you can
refer if you have any doubts because
our content is very huge that you don't
need to go back and refer a particular
book but this is a book that you have to
refer
and a common book for reference for most
of the general surgery
as well as the oral surgery content
because cleft lift and craft palette you
have to do from b and l
so b and l you can keep as a reference
book
and followed by i told you local
anesthesia it is malmed medical
emergencies
okay so these are the books that you
have to refer but reference is not very
specific or not required for mds concur
students because everything is well
refined and well referred from standard
textbooks and it is provided to you so
no need to break your heads to go back
to these books very frequently very
rarely if you want to be strong in a
particular zone or if you if you feel
that there is some confusion in a
particular zone then you can think of
about these particular books to go back
and refer is it clear
not required basically not required for
students of mds conquer not required
because we tried our best to cover every
content from a standard textbook not
required but you can keep them as a
reference books so
so many of the students were asking what
is a reference book okay reference book
is something
something you can you go back
at a particular pace
read that pace
underline the important points in that
page
underline the important points in that
page
convert that to the nodes
add that to your nodes add add convert
that and add that to your nodes because
you cannot go back to these reference
books again and again during the
revision time searching the same page
going back reading it's not going to be
possible so you have to prepare a notes
if you're reading some particular
content for example now drug
interactions you have to do from
this book which i have provided as an a
which i have provided as a notes for you
so this you have to do from the textbook
and similarly there are few things
called as uh
facial neuropathies
facial neuropathies your trisomy
neurology your facial nerve palaces and
everything you have to do from you have
to do from neelamalik so that part you
have to go do
write a proper notes and come back
and similarly
i am going to tell you a few topics
which you have to do from the textbook
if you feel like these topics has also
be to be done that is your wish that is
completely obvious because preparation
cannot be at all the levels controlled
by the mentor mentor is going to guide
you in the preparation but
at some areas to overtake your
competitors you have to modify your
preparation but always under the
supervision of men direct or indirect
supervision is it clear
clear about the reference books
yes
next important aspect that we need to
think over is mcqs so once you read the
base core okay then you need to solve
mcqs please don't write on my screen
okay please
okay so once you're done with the uh
once you're done with the core concepts
what i strongly believe is for example
if you are planning
to construct a building
construct a building of 25 floors
a 25 floors building
so what is most important
most important
aspect to construct a 25 floors building
is come on guys answer me
what is the most important thing for a
25 floors of building
bricks
yes strong basement
strong foundation okay so you have a
hidden foundation no one will see the
foundation of a 25 floor building
okay
so you have you should have a strong
pillar strong foundation should be there
so that
so 25 floors according to me is mcqs
this is going to give you pride
but how an mcq can be so strong how you
can be more accurate is if you have a
strong base that is your core concepts
so core concepts what are the important
things in the core concepts is your
knowledge in dentistry
whatever hard work you have done in
dentistry second one is your smart
videos here
third one is your smart notes and how
you organize everything
once you start foundation foundation
will be done as as priya's advent
foundation done by bricks you will have
bricks you have cement you have many
ingredients all these ingredients so but
all these ingredients together to form
foundation
that is called as core concepts once you
have a strong core concepts you can
build any number of mcqs
m number of floors is it clear with this
so don't miss this logic everything in
the life has a logic
everything around you moves moves with
the logics moves with the common sense
once you hit the common sense
you're going to master in that area that
can be dentistry that can be life or
that can be anything
but most of us what we do is we ignore
the basic common sense we ignore the
basic logics and what happens is if you
don't have a proper foundation what
happens building so many
floors
the building will collapse
the building will
[Music]
is it clear can i move to the next part
okay now coming to the mcq source you
can keep dental pulse as a first source
of mcqs
it's not mandatory that you are done
with the smart nodes that you are done
with the smart videos that you have to
hit 100 mcqs of dental pulse with
hundred right answers no
it's always a process of learning
then you can keep the second book people
who are able to finish the second book
that's the first book of choice
people who are able to finish the second
book for example you are a repeater
sitting at home and reading for 24 to 7
you have to keep second book because
this is the second book which is going
to give a tough competition to your
junior who is an intern
so this is the second book of choice and
once you're done with entire syllabus if
you want to do more mcqs you can start
solving the dental decks i'll be
providing them don't worry don't break
your heads okay so dental decks you you
will have a decent number of 100 or 150
questions not more than that related to
oral surgery you have time you can solve
them of course i want you to add tp
books also it's not mandatory uh for pp
books because i regularly include pp
books in the round two but if you are a
repeater
if you are repeated intense will not
have time if you are a repeater i want
you to solve the oral surgery part of
the pp books also apart from that the
biggest source of mcqs is your website
so in website you have topic specific
you have subject specific everything
okay so this this time i'm going to
provide you huge number of mcqs because
your pride in oral surgery can be proven
by the number of floors the number of
floors i'm talking about this
and with the strong core concepts the
foundation okay right so clear with the
source of mcqs that you have to do from
and
first i want you to start with
the dental pulse source as well as the
website source but once you are able to
finish the things fast because we have
so much time for your examination
so i want you to add the second book
it's better for clinical subjects you
have to do minimum two or three books
two to three books keep one book as a
primary primary thing the others are
accessory things clear
clear can i move to the next part
clear with the mcqs
of mcqs
okay right so now before closing the
session
uh
i want to give the sequence okay so for
for the sequence
sequence of checklist
first of all all of you now go back
and open the smart notes
the smart notes of
oral surgery
you have 166 pages notes is there right
so in this 166 pages notes you take your
you take your notes or you take i mean
better take your running running nodes
okay so first open your running nodes
and
write the topics
topics
covered in the notes
is it clear
first go
first go
first go right write the topics covered
in the notes notes is already there
don't rewrite the notes again and again
that is foolishness
first write down the topics how many
topics are there what are the topics are
covered in this 166 pages of notes you
prepare a list
so first thing you have to do after the
after this session is
prepare the list of topics
covered in the smart notes of 166
pages of smart notes clear
first thing is clear sequence first
sequence is clear
first sequence is clear right okay
now
according to the schedule now according
to the schedule every day
go with a combination of smart nodes
plus your smart video
combination of smart nodes plus your
smart video preferably to make your
concepts more strong smart video is more
useful than smart nodes
so my suggestion is
every day you can start your day with
the smart video
smart video has to be given the first
importance
then you can jump into the smart notes
this 166 pages if this topic is
available do it in the smart notes
along with the
pulse synopsis you have synopsis in
dental pulse also
not for all the topics very few topics
dental pulse after completing interoral
surgery you have few pages of synopsis
whenever you have a synopsis
around the dental pulse for the topic
you are going to read on the day do it
means
so along with the
list of topics of this 166 pages smart
notes you have to do the list of topics
covered in dental pulse synopsis
so every day you open the topic you see
whether this this is covered in the
smart notes or this is covered in the
dental synopsis if it is covered you
have to do that if it is not covered
illegally
is it clear this is more important
you'll get so much confused because
things around you are not organized
pulse is not organized open secret pulse
is not organized it cannot be organized
it's a huge thing so cannot be organized
so what a student has to do is student
has to organize the things so what you
have to do the first step first step
open your smart notes in your website
write all the topics list of topics
where the list of topics then jumping
into the dental synopsis write out the
list of topics that is being covered in
the synopsis is it clear the first step
the first thing that you have to do
immediately after this video
first step immediately you have to do
after the video you can you can check it
in the recorded version here it's
already late i don't want to drag this
session for a longer time is it clear i
want response from all 180 students
please try to be active
first prepare
the list of contents in the smart videos
smart notes the list of contents in the
dental pulse synopsis
then accordingly i want you to cover
first smart video of every topic second
one smart notes associated with that
right
this is the first level
by which your core concepts will be
good
then what you have to do then you have
to
solve mcqs
so mcqs i told you i have given
different source first solve mcq
for example
you're doing dental pulse most of the
students what they do is they read
question they read answer no that's not
the purpose solving is different reading
is different
so take a white sheet
take a take a white sheet
for example you consider this as a white
sheet so what i i'm going to do is i'm
going to keep one two three four five
six for example 50 questions are there
in a particular topic i'm going to keep
numbers and i'm going to solve the
questions first of all
a b c d now i'm going to correct i'm
going to see how many marks
for example i got 20 marks out of 15
then what i do is then i read the mcqs
then i read i read the question
what answer i kept i'll see what is the
right answer i'll see then i'll go back
to the explanation and read the
explanation is it clear
solving mcq is a different thing reading
in mcq is a different thing first you
have to solve understand
and answer then you have to move to the
reading version
yes yes right next one again you prepare
the same 50 pages 50 mcqs
keep number one two three four now i can
answer the questions
you can you can do this on the same day
or you can do this after two or three
days it's better you do after two or
three days
exodus you do today after three days
again you resolve the question now out
of 50 you will get 45 plus can you try
this is it possible to get 45 plus
once you're doing the same content for
second time after four or five days
is it possible to hit 45 plus
yes it's possible
right it's possible
so once you're done with mcqs evening
come back and attend the discussion
discussion in discussion here the mentor
is going to discuss
uh
40 to 50 minutes or 30 to 40 minutes of
time an activity will run on the group
that includes the group discussion that
includes the
motivation for you that includes the
textbook reading for you and everything
will be covered along with some mcqs
and whatever you learn something new
which is not being covered in your smart
videos which is not being covered in
your smart notes which is not being
covered in your dental pulse add only
that content to the notices
don't write everything that is being
discussed in the activity that's going
to be huge content so what you have to
do is
which is new which is unknown at that
and people who are very new to this
probably going to start the preparation
from tomorrow it's going to take five
days for you to get adapted to this
system
is it clear what to be added to the
notes
in the activity is what is new what is
unknown only has to be act only has to
be added it's already known it's already
covered in the smart notes just answer
the question leave it and move on
and huge content of diagram based
questions will be transferred from your
activity so diagram based questions
textbook pixel what i have to what you
have to do is it's going to be difficult
for you to write right so what i what my
suggestion i was talking to
i was interacting i had an interaction
of two hours with
the gopal students recently so what my
suggestion is you can copy all these
things to a word document and you can
take that as a printout and you can file
it
don't write for example i'm posting a
textbook pic
on my evening activity okay don't write
it it's waste of time
i want you to i want you to take it as a
printout and i want you to save it
clear
clear guys can you try this it's going
to be easy
but you have to try it
it's going to be easy
but the thing is you have to try it
