the most important thing to remember
during the interview at KPMG is that

don't already know the answer to
if you are asked a question and you
don't know then it's better to admit
that upfront and tell them why you want
to work here the job search process with
KPMG can take between three to four
months for most candidates
now
you will see the skills that KPMG looks
for when hiring new graduates

the last one is the ability to provide
basic answers to technical questions
kvmg selection process includes the
following stages

process of creating a list of the
candidates the organization is
interested in once the CV shortlisting
procedure is done there will be an
online coding round at Adobe once a

interested in working at KPMG and tell
us about yourself be ready to tell your
story you don't have to lose points
during a phone interview just because

experience the goal of these initial
interviews is to find candidate who best

confident and knowledgeable the
candidate is among other personal traits
kbmg interviewers try to determine the
applicant's motives to join their
organization in this round

is imperative that the candidate

the role and excitement about the
opportunity for KPMG interviews this is

let's discuss KPMG technical interview
questions
first one is where do you want to work
in order
sample answer would be I am honest and
skill individual I am extremely focused
and have a Keen Eye on for detail My
overall goal is to always better an
organization with my capabilities
I want to be a part of KPMG because it's
a firm that strives for excellence in
all areas of business from Financial to
it it's also a firm that values its
employees and these are the attributes
that I value greatly
now the second question would be what
are the objectives of an internal audit
the central objective of an internal
audit is to supply objective information
to the managers government
Etc
objective information typically includes
detail about control over the
organizational environment risk Etc
any person coming for the internal audit
is called an internal auditor they work
with a close association with management
because he or she wants to understand
how well they have managed their
resources
auditor ensures that companies are
maintaining their accounting standards
and laws
a cross-functional audit means the
participants of different professions in
the audit process to improve the
organizational practices
the main goal is to achieve better
results for the company through more
thorough audits
what are audit control procedures
there are one approach that Universe for
understanding internal controls business
processes and control efficiency instead
it depends on the specific need of each
audit
editor must know every component of the
client's financial reporting controls
including their environment assessment
process systems the activities related
to their audit
and how they monitor their internal
controls
they also need to be aware of any
changes that could impact their ability
to effectively perform an audit in order
for Auditors to properly evaluate a
company's internal control structure
they must have a complete understanding
of its business processes and how
information flows through them
but how many heads are there under total
income
under the income tax act there are five
heads known as the heads of the income
first one is income for salary second
one is income for house property third
one is income for profit and gain of
business or professions
and then its income for capital gains
after that there is income for other
resources
what is capital gain explain long-term
capital gains and how it is different
from short-term capital gains
capital gain for income tax purposes is
again released from the sale of capital
assets the difference between the
original purchase price and the sale
price is the gain released profits you
make from selling acid you have held for
a less than a year or a year is a
short-term capital gain alternatively
gains from Acid you have held for a
longer than a year are known as
long-term gains
now we will see what is an object
oriented model
build model is an approach to moduling
an application that is used at the
beginning of the software life cycle
when using an object-oriented approach
to software development
then
what is cloud computing
simply put cloud computing is a delivery
of computing services including services
like storing databases networking
software analytics and intelligency
in cloud computing you typically pays
only for the cloud services you use
helping lower your operational cost run
your infrastructure more efficiently and
scale as your business need change
then let's differentiate between rdbms
and dbms
dbms stands for database management
system and rdbms is an asynchronous for
the relational database management
system in dbms the data is stored as a
file whereas in rdbms data is stored in
the form of tables
then
what is a circular linked list
circular linked list is a variable of a
linked list in which the last node
points to the first node completing a
full circle of nodes in other words this
variation of the linked list doesn't
have a null element at the end
Define lifo and fifo
lifo is last in first out and fifo is
first in first out
first in first out is a method that
value of inventory and calculate the
cost of goods sold
first in first out items are the oldest
purchased in an inventory because they
have the first stock to be added after
purchase or production
fifo uses the principle that when it
seems and acquired first
they are also sold first
the first and first out process is a
straightforward way to track the flow of
inventory
sales profits and the cost of producing
and storing Goods
last in first out is another way to
manage inventory and calculate profits
from Goods in this approach the
businesses assumes that the most recent
inventory is the first sold and here are
