hey guys welcome back to another video
by simply learn and in this session we
will learn how to make a game in c plus
of tic tac toe
so this game tic tac toe is actually a
paper pencil game for two players
in which both the players one by one
mark the cross and zeros in the spaces
in a three cross three grid
the player who succeeds in making a pair
of 3 is declared as the winner
so in this session we will learn how to
make this game in c plus
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
so first of all
we have to make the structure of tic tac
toe game
and the structure of tic tac toe is like
this
these are the empty spaces and we have
to mark these empty spaces with crosses
and zeros
and now these are
column numbers and row numbers which
will help us in adding alphabets to
these empty spaces
so first of all we have to create this
structure
so let's go ahead to our visual studio
code
so first of all let's name this
game dot cpp
we'll save it
so now let's start with hash include
iostream
now we'll write using namespace standard
now before making the structure we have
to create an array a multi-dimensional
array or we can say a two-dimension
array so we'll write into main and
inside int main first of all we'll
declare that array and initialize
some elements
all right
let's say the name of the array is space
three rows and three columns we want
okay so let's say the elements are
zero zero
zero one
zero two
okay now
the second row the elements are
1 0
1 1
1 2
in the third row the elements are
2 0
to 1
2 2.
so these are the elements i have added
these elements because these are
collectively the rows and column numbers
of the spaces
as you can see
0 0 zero one zero two one zero one one
one two two zero two one two two so
these are those elements i have added
these are actually the positions of the
empty spaces
now
we will take
the input of the number of players
as their name
for example enter the name of first
player and enter the name of second
player so for that we have to create a
string first of all
let's say string n1 and string n2
because there are two players
now we'll display a message that enter
the name of the first player let's say
enter the name
we missed writing e
okay enter the name
of the
first player
okay
let's add slash in
all right
now let's take the input we'll write
get line
c in comma
n1
which is the name of the string
now we'll do same for the other one
enter
the name of the
second
player
now again we'll write get line
c in comma
and two
now just in order to make it look good
we'll write
n1 that is the name of the first string
or the name of the first player
is
player 1
so he
or she
will play first
okay
now we'll write slash n
now we'll do same for the player two
we'll simply copy this
and paste it
and now
all right
let's change this player 2 and
we'll play second
okay
now we have to make the structure of the
tic-tac-toe game
that is this kind of a structure we have
to make
so let's go ahead and create this
okay
we have to create two straight lines so
we can do like this
and make sure to write slash n
in the end
now we can do same for the second line
because the two lines are pretty long
enough so we can copy and paste
it will save our time and we can do
again
now we have to create a horizontal line
as well
for that let's say
c out
and we can create this horizontal line
by using underscore
we'll give it a shot
and
we can do it like this
so
that it matches with the upper line
all right
now
we can
write slash n
and we can do
copy these two
and we can again paste
and then this horizontal line
we can copy basically we have to create
a structure
so
it is good if you can do it in a fast
way
or an easy way
all right but the
18 and 19 line seems to be extra so yeah
we can remove that
so that
let's make it more symmetrical
let's add some more underscores
here as well
make it like this
all right now it is looking pretty much
symmetrical
let's remove this line
yeah it is looking good now
now all we need to do is to add the
elements of the multi-dimensional array
that is space array
to these empty spaces like we have to
add element on each and every empty
space
so as you can see this is the zero zero
that is zero throw and zero column this
is zero throw and first column this is
zero through and second column and
similarly all of these
so that is why we have created these
kind of elements so yeah we can also
change these elements let's create them
one
two let's make it simple
seven
eight
and nine
so yeah all we need to do is to add
these elements to these empty spaces
our main intent behind adding these
elements to these empty spaces is
whenever we click a particular element
or digit like let's say 2 or 3 then the
mark of 0 or x should be placed at that
particular position
so let's do it
and for that we have to do it like this
write c out
and
inside c out
we'll write the name of the array
with the position of it
of a particular element
so this is the position of the first
element that is one
and after that
we'll do it like this
okay so this is the vertical line
and
then again we have to
write
the position for the second element
that is 0
1
this element is 2
and once we have
rode this then
we can enclose it
in the bracket
all right
now
the second vertical line
and we'll do same for the third one
right space
0
2 that is the third element that is 3
now let's enclose it
in double quotes
all right
yeah
slash n
semicolon
now let's fix it
now it's fine
now we have to do
the same for the second row and the
third row
so
all we need to do is to copy this
and we'll add over here
and
over here as well
instead of writing this whole code we
can simply copy paste and now all we
need to do is to just change the row
number and the column number so as you
can see this is the first this is the
second and this is the third element so
we'll do same for the other elements so
this is the fourth element so this
position is
1 0
and this position is 1 1
this position is 1
2
and this is a
second zero position
this is 2 1 position
and this is
this is position 2 2
that is the last position
so this is the thing
so we can check if it is looking good or
not
i'm pretty sure that is not fully ready
yet but yeah we can check
so we'll save it by pressing ctrl and s
now we'll try to run this
so as we can see enter the name of the
first player so let's say the name of
the first player is sam
and this name of second player is
mario
and yeah so this is
our output
but it is not looking good as its
alignment is not good
which i was sure
so we have to make some changes
we have to adjust a bit
this was the vertical line and this was
the second vertical line
so let's make some changes and
let's see if it is looking good or not
sam
and mario again
it is better than earlier but as you can
see this
one is not underneath this one
that is the vertical line
is not underneath the previous vertical
line and same for the sixth same for the
ninth
so we'll have to adjust this
and it's pretty easy we can do that
yeah now let's save it again
and let's hope it runs this time
enter the first name we have to enter
let's add mario first this time
same the second time
yeah it is looking good now as you can
see
it is symmetrical and
positions are also filled one two three
four five six seven eight nine these are
those elements
now all we need to do is to
make this structure as if a person that
is the player
will click a particular digit that is
one two three four five six or seven
eight nine then that mark that is
zero or cross will be added to that
particular position
and also we haven't noticed that this
mario is player 1 mario's play 2 is
wrong
that is we have we have to write n2 over
here so by mistake
we have wrote n1 and
and we can add one space over here as
well so yeah the rest is good
now all we need to do is to create some
functions
but before that
let's make it right
yeah
now let's make this all code inside a
function so let's say
let's move this into main we'll do that
later
let's create this code inside a function
let's say the name of the function is
function1
okay
all right
so this is our function and let's create
all these variables outside the function
so that it can be
global variables
and we also take this array
we'll
copy it
and paste it over here
all right
and we can remove it from here
yeah so we have declared it globally and
we'll do the same for
the variables that is row
and another variable that is column
because we know that
in a two dimensional array there must be
rows and columns
so we'll
write column
all right so these are the global
variables
so now let's go ahead and create
function two
for that
let's say we'll write void
function
two
now inside this function
we will check for any invalid value and
will make sure that it is not there
but before that we will
create a variable digit
so that we can take the input from the
user
so we'll write
and digit this is the variable
now after that
we'll write
so here we will write if the value of
token that is the variable that we will
now create is equal to x then we will
take the input from the first player and
then we'll take the input from the
second player
so
before that we have to create a variable
token
so we'll write here
this variable is of corrected type
character
token
let's
initialize it with cross
or x
all right
now
here we will write
if
value of token
equals equals
cross
then we'll
write n1
that is the variable name
enter please enter we'll write please
enter
after that
we'll take the input
that is the variable digit
now we will do same for player 2 that is
n2
so
we can copy this
and we can paste it
all we need to change is
we can make it
zero and
make it n2 so it will display
n2 that is player 2 please enter
and then the player 2 will enter the
digit
now we have to check these digits for
each and every column and rows one by
one
and also we have to make sure that there
is not any invalid value
so for that
we'll write
if
digit value is
one
that is the number entered by the player
is one
that is the first place or the first
space
then
it would be
row
equals 0
and
column
equals 0
that is the first place
just to clarify here we are talking
about this position that is 0th row and
0th column
after that we will do it for zero throw
in first column then zeroth row and
second column and similarly we'll do for
all of these positions
okay now we have to repeat this code
we have to just change this digit value
to two three four five six up to nine
because there are nine spaces
and we have to change the rows and
columns value so instead of writing it
again and again we can just copy and
paste it
we'll copy
and
i will paste
and we'll do it for
nine times three
all right now all we need to do is to
change these values
if the value of the digit is 2 that is
entered by the user for the player
then
the value will go to
zero throw
and first column
if the value is three
then zero throw second column
or third column because we are starting
from zero so that is why we are talking
like this
now if the value of digit is four
then zero throw and
then first row sorry
first row
and
zeroth column
then
if the value of five
then first row
and
first column
if the value is six
first row
[Music]
and second column
if the value is seven
then
second
row
zeroth column that is right
the value of digit
eight
we'll write eight
and
the value would be
row 0
row 2
and column 1
here digit is 9.
so row would be 2
and column would be 2
after that in else we can write
if the case is invalid
we will print
invalid
all right
we can write endl after that
now this condition else means
if the value entered by the player is
any other value then the values at the
empty spaces that is from 1 to 9 then
that case would be an invalid case so
that is why here we have written invalid
now after that
we have to write an if condition
so first of all i'll write the if
condition because it's pretty long and
after that i'll explain it to you
so we'll start with if
the value of token
is
[Music]
cross
and
space eddy
that is row
and here we'll write
column
not equal to
x that means
that means if x is not there at a
particular position
and
similarly we'll write for
the
zero
you will write
column
i will write row
if i take particular position
there is no 0 as well
so
that means
that is a unused place
so inside this we'll write
space
row
column
x
or cross
token
equals
zero
okay so we have wrote this and now i'll
explain you this part so here we are
checking if there is any unused space
which is left in the structure to fill
so what we are doing is if the value of
token is x that means player 1 turn is
there and at a particular place there is
not x and not 0 as well so player 1's
value x would be assigned there as we
can see in line 96 after that player 2
turn is there so we have assigned the
value 0 to the token that is player 2's
value
after this we have to use
else if statement and do the same for
player 2 as well
all right
now we'll write else if
and we'll do
the same we can copy it and paste it
over here
we need to do minor changes
we have to change it to 0
and this one would be same this means if
player 2 turn is there
then if the value is not x at a
particular place and neither it is 0 at
a particular place then that particular
place is empty or unused
so
we will assign 0 at that place
because now the turn is of player 2.
okay we can copy paste it as well
because the code is same
here would be 0
and the token would be x or cross
after this we have to write the else
block
and inside that block we have to call
the function again so that we can play
it again
so
all we need to do is we will print
there is no
empty space
all right
we can use
handle
we have to call this function the name
of the function is function2
you write function2
so now let's have a look at what we have
done
so first of all
once the player enters the digit the
value will go to the suitable if
condition
as you can see here the player will
enter the digit then the value will go
to this particular
suitable if condition
once the particular condition matches
then it goes to the below if condition
that is over here
here it is checked whether the space is
already filled or not if it is filled
then we will get the message that there
is no empty space
but if it is empty then the player can
fill the space with zero or cross
depending on the player
so now let's go ahead and create a
function and we'll name this function
as
function 3 which is of boolean type
all right
here we have created this function of
boolean type because we have to return
true and false only in this function we
will set the condition for players to
win and check whether the game is still
going on or it is a draw
so let's start
first of all we'll create a for loop
which i trades from
zero that is end i equals zero
i less than
three
till three and i plus plus
now
inside the for loop we will set the
conditions for a player to win the match
so as we know that in the game of tic
tac toe if the pair of three matches
whether it is horizontal vertical or
diagonal then that particular player
wins the match
so here we will set the conditions for
horizontal and vertical pairs and after
this we will set the condition for
diagonal pairs so let's start
so we'll write f
array space
space
i
will making
we are making
row a variable
i zero
equals equals
space
i
one
space i1
and
space
i zero again
equals to space
i
two
there's a mistake again
all right
so this condition is for first row as we
can see
so in the condition we are checking if
this element that means the element at
this position is equal to this position
and the element at this position is
equal to this position
then the particular player wins
and that's what we are doing in the
condition the loop starts from zero so
first zero zero
equal to zero one that is first and the
second element then first and the third
element
so it is checking that whether these
three elements are equal so if they are
equal then it is true and otherwise it
is false
so here we have checked horizontally and
now we have to check vertically so we'll
write
or
and we'll write
space
0i
0
i
equals
space 1i
and
zero i again
equals to
space
to
i
here we are making
rows fixed and column variable
so if these conditions are true the
player wins so we'll return
true
so now similarly we'll do for the
diagonal elements
for diagonal elements we have to check
diagonally so we don't have to use the
for loop we'll write space
zero
zero
equals
space
one one
and
space
1
1
equals space
2 2
now here are
space
0
2
equals space
1 1
and space
space
one one
equals
space
2 0
okay
so if these diagonal conditions also met
then
it is true that is it's a win
all right
okay so after
this
so these were the conditions for winning
the game so now we have to
make the conditions to check whether the
game is still going on or is it finished
so we'll do that
so we'll write for and
i equal 0 i less than 3 because it is a
3 cross 3 matrix
and i plus plus
after that we'll write
for
end j or k whatsoever you want in j
equal 0 j less than
3
j
plus plus
all right
now inside this both of these for loop
we will write the condition of if
space
i
j
not equal to
the symbol that is
cross
and it is also not equal to
this i
j
[Music]
also not equal to the other symbol that
is zero
then
we will return
false
so here what we are doing is
in the if condition one by one every
position is being checked we have
written if the value at the position is
not cross and is also not 0
that means the game isn't finished yet
or it is still going on because the game
is played till every position is filled
totally so if any position is not filled
that means the game is still going on
that is why we have returned false
so we have used these conditions
if the player wins the game
these were the conditions to check
whether the game is still going on now
only condition left is to check if the
game is draw
so
after this
if this condition is not met and this
condition is not met and this condition
is also not met then there is only one
possibility that the game is draw so
after this for loop the control will go
to outside the loop so we have to create
a variable let's say tie
and make it true
so we also have to declare this variable
and the data type of this variable must
be boolean
so we can
write bool
die
all right
now let's come back now after
it is time we will return
false
all right
now we have created these three
functions that is function three
function
two
and function one
so now one by one we have to call each
and every function
starting from one two and three
systematically we'll do it so
write int main
right int main inside into main first of
all we have to call these three
functions one by one so how can we do it
so we'll write
while
and inside the while loop we'll write
the condition
not
function
three
here it means this loop
will keep on iterating till this
function
will return false and this function that
is function 3 will keep on returning
false until
any player that is player 1 or player 2
wins the game
so
if the game is not won by any of the
player then again these functions will
execute one by one
so this cycle will keep on repeating so
we'll write function one first of all
after
that function
2
and then function 3
right so
after this while loop
will write if condition
if
token
equals symbol
x
tie
is false
i'll explain this part
now we'll write n1
that is the name of the player 1
and after that we'll write
wins
then we'll write endl
similarly we'll do it for
the player 2
but we have to write in lsf
token equals
symbol
0
and
tie is not there that is the game is not
tie
then
player 2 wins that is n2
wins
now in the last
there is else block
so this block else block will execute if
the game is draw
so
it's
a draw
all right
we we have done a mistake over here
if the token value is x then
n2 wins
that is player 2.
if the token value is 0
then n1 wins
so yes here if the value of tie is false
that is there is no tie between both the
players and the value of token is x that
means player 2 wins here the token equal
to x that is cross means that the last
turn was of player 2 and the game was
not a tie and is ended so it means the
game is won by player 2 and vice versa
for the player 1
and if both the conditions are not met
then it is a tie
so now let's try to run this
let's save it first
now let's try to run this
hope it works
there are some errors
let's have a look at them
okay so we haven't used the brackets
plus there are some more errors
so let's fix them all
function two and function 3
as you can see there are no brackets we
forgot to
mention the brackets
here as well
and for the strings
we have to do like this
all right
there are some more errors
so let's do some changes
and we also forgot
to make it a character array
let's make all the elements as character
and also we have to assign tie
to something like
let's say
false
we have to initialize it
and
let's see if there are some more errors
there must be some more errors let's
save and run it we forgot to save it
now we'll run it
okay
there are some more errors
we forgot
to put bracket over here and call the
function one
and let's just copy and paste
this whole enter the name thing into the
main function that's where it will look
nice and
it will minimize the errors so we can
copy this or we can cut this
and
we can paste it in the main function
all right now
now let's save this and let's try to run
all right there are some more errors i
think
single quotes we have to make it double
quotes
all right plus i think
now let's try again
this is showing the error
all right this is 112.
all right
after this we have to make some changes
in this
if and
else statements
so so let's change this so we'll write
else if statement
and
write the condition
that
if digit is
less than one
and
or
digit is greater than
9
then this message that is invalid should
be displayed
all right now let's try to run this
save it
and run this
function one
now our only error is function one so
function one spelling is wrong
let's correct it save it
and now let's try to run this
okay
enter the name of the first player let's
say sam
enter the name of the second player
that's ron
here it is so
sam we forgot to
mention the space so that is why it is
coming along sam please enter
so let's say sam wants to enter at third
position
so here we can see
at third position
this is the third position and here it
is
the cross now ron please enter
we forgot to add the space so that is
why it is
looking weird but yeah
now
ron will enter let's say one
as you can see
zero is at place one
now
sam
will enter
six
as you can see
sam is going to make a pair on the other
side ron will now click on five
all right now
sam again will click on 9 to make his
pair
as you can see sam has made his pair and
sam wins
so this is the game of tic tac toe and i
know the code is pretty long but it is
worth trying and if you want to do it in
a better way then you must practice it
for like two to three times
so this is how you can create a game of
tic-tac-toe in c plus
