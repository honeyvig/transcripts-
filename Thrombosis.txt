since dr. Mann 3 from Team M Lea's
concur now I'm going to discuss about
the thrombosis in this video so if you
see you know in her body there is an
inbuild system so this in bill system
will help us to help help the blood in
our body to remain in the fluid state or
me otherwise the blood if you take
outside from our body it will clot okay
but inside the body there is an inbuilt
system to make the blood to stay in the
fluid state it is a normal mechanism in
our body and there is a there is a
process called as thrombosis and this
thrombosis means the formation of a
solid mass in the circulation and this
solid mass in the circulation fly which
is formed from the constant of fluid
flowing blood is Corliss a thrombus
solid mass is called as a thrombus where
this process an entire process is called
as a thrombosis so to prevent or to I
mean to prevent this thrombosis there
are few inbuilt mechanisms in our body
and we'll see few factors which are
responsible for the thrombosis so if you
see here the endothelial injury
platelets altered blood flow
hypercoagulability state and coagulation
system all these factors will have an
ecological role in the formation of the
thrombus and there are two primary
events three primary events which was
given by the virtue and the three
primary events which predisposed the
thrombus formation these are the three
events which predispose the thrombus
formation which is called as a virtual
stride and this includes hyper Kollek
cog lability state stresses of the blood
and the vessel wall injury so these
three muscle wall array and ethereal
injury altered blood flow or stasis of
blood or a hyper causal ability of blood
all these three includes the but just
right now we will see the each
predisposing factor in detail first we
see with the endothelial injury okay
actually
in fact endothelium has many functions
if then in the game is intact so this
intact endothelium will protect the
flowing blood from the formation of the
thrombus and it has the antithrombotic
factors antithrombotic factors that
which inhibit the thrombosis like
heparin like substances which will
accelerate the antithrombin 3
thrombomodulin which will convert
thrombin into activator of protein c and
anticoagulants so this proteins is a
Anti Copeland so this thrombomodulin
will convert the thrombin into the
activator of proteins and inhibitors of
platelet aggregation such as a BPA's and
PGA Tour cross society and the tissue
plasminogen activator which accelerates
the fibrin all I take that means it will
have a clot lysis activity so these are
the important protective mechanisms
which prevent the thrombus formation
which is seen in the intact endothelium
and and there are new few prothrombin
factors are also which is released by
the pro Coughlin pub properties okay
they are thromboplastin one Willebrand
factor and platelet activating factor so
this thromboplastin will be released
from the endothelial cells and one
Willebrand factor will cause the
apperance of the platelets and platelet
activating factor which is activator and
aggregator of platelets these are the
prothrombin thrombotic factors and in
the previous slide we have seen the
antithrombotic factors so this diagram
defect depicts this thing so usually if
the induct end of intact endothelial is
there it will prevent the thrombosis
formation but if there is any
endothelial injury you can see here
endothelial injury will expose this sub
endothelial matrix to the circulating
blood and this an exposure of the sub
endothelial matrix to the circulating
blood will initiate the three steps that
is addition
and release an aggregation of platelets
and this addition release an aggregation
of the platelets okay this is the second
step and in the third step
there is the activation of the
coagulation cascade which results in the
fibrin strands and the thrombus
formation so these are the steps or the
events which occurs if there is an a
endothelial injury so that is the first
predisposing factor the second thing is
your platelet role so we have told you
there are three steps in this thing that
is platelet addition platelet release
action and the platelet aggregation so
if you see this platelet addition the
important two things are there here to
remember one is glycoprotein one P
receptor i'm the von Willebrand factor
okay this glycoprotein 1b receptor on
the platelets it is present on the
platelets and it will recognize the site
of endothelial injury remember this
point this receptor will recognize the
site of endothelial injury whereas one
Billy Miliband
very synthesized by the endothelial
cells will bind to this GP 1b receptor
and forms the from addition of the
platelets these two will leads to the
form addition of the platelet so that's
why if there is any deficiency of one
Willebrand factor which occurs in the
von Willebrand disease and or absence of
this GP 1b receptor which is seen in but
not Sawyer disease remember this thing
CP one be receptor is absent in but not
solely a disease so if these two things
are there it results in the abnormal
platelet addition which finally leads to
the abnormal bleeding so this is
regarding the platelet addition and the
second step is will be of your platelet
release action so this activated
platelets will undergo release reaction
there are two types of platelet granules
release year dense bodies there and this
dense bodies liberate the ADP that is
adenosine diphosphate
calcium i'm the serotonin and histamine
this dense bodies will liberate whereas
this alpha granules will releases the
fibrinogen fibronectin and
platelet-derived platelet derived growth
factor and the finally the platelet
aggregation it is follow it will I mean
like it follows the release of ADP and
this is because of this which and
platelet aggregation takes place so this
is the role of platelets in the thrombus
formation that is plated addition
release action and the platelet
aggregation is finally dissolved in the
formation of a temporary hemostatic plug
then the regulation of the coagulation
system so this third predisposing factor
will be of your coagulation system here
there the protein you can see here the
protease inhibitors these will act on
the coagulation factor so that they will
oppose the formation this isn't be in
the normal state okay in the normal
state this in the coagulation system
protease inhibitors are present and this
protease inhibitors will oppose the
formation of thrombi and the example of
this protease inhibitors include
antithrombin 3 i'm thus even in
activator and alpha 1-antitrypsin
antithrombin 3 c 1 in activator and
alpha 1-antitrypsin are the examples of
this protease inhibitors and if you take
the fibrinolytic system here the plasma
is a potent classman is a potent
fibrinolytic enzyme that means it will
realize this it will make the lysis of a
clot and here there are two type of
plasma notion activators tissue type PA
plasminogen activator which are derived
from the endothelial cells and the uro
kinase like plasma plasminogen activator
which is present in the plasma so this
is the regulation of correlation system
so because of this protease inhibitors
and fibrin light exists a thrombus is
not formed in the in the blood normally
then
you can see here in this diagram so in
the normally the this is the blood flow
you can see the central stream consists
of leukocytes and red cells and the
platelets whereas the peripheral stream
will be of a plus cell free plasma zone
that is cells are absent in the
peripheral stream and if you take when
there is a turbulence or estas is flow
this is the normal flow this is
turbulence or a staches flow all the
Bloods leukocytes that cells and the
platelets will be margin ating and pea
binding to the peripheries okay margin
aiding and preventing the peripheries
which will leads to the formation of a
thrombus this is in the normal axial
flow and this is the turbulence orestes
is blood flow then this is the state
colons the hypercar Goble state which is
very important and this hypercoagulable
state is also called as a thrombophilia
and there are many reasons for this a
hyper coral state and because of this
hypercoagulable state there is an
increased risk of venous thrombosis okay
and this causes includes like an
inheritor inherited or hereditary causes
and acquired or a secondary causes if
you take the inherited causes is
deficiency of antithrombin 3 and usually
mostly this condition is associated with
the venous recurrent episodes of venous
thrombosis then deficiency of protein C
and the deficiency of protein s okay
these are the autosomal dominant
disorders and can be mostly associated
with the thrombosis of leg veins and the
mutation in the factor Phi Laden this is
also an autosomal dominant race or
disorder here the mutation will replace
the original adenine is replaced by
glycine at the position 5 0 6 it is very
important in the mutation of factor 5
our name is replaced by the glycine at
the final 6 position and the most common
cause of thrombophilia mutation mutation
in the factor v leiden is the most
common cause of trauma
and the defects in the fibrinolysis like
this fibrinogen india and clasp nosing
disorders and increased levels of
coagulation factors like 2.8 this is due
to because of them and genetic mutation
and predispose to the thrombosis then
coming to the IDE while the secondary
factors which leads to the thrombophilia
include advanced age prolonged bed rest
to long immobilization cigarette smoking
and obesity and other predisposing
clinical conditions like heart diseases
vascular diseases hyper Covell
conditions like polycythemia and
myeloproliferative disorders dehydration
shock tissue damage late pregnancy and
certain drugs like anise anesthetic
drugs and oral contraceptives and
hormonal replacement the replacement
area predisposing clinical conditions
and if you take this is a
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome which
is consist of a lupus anticoagulant
antibody an anti cardiolipin antibody
then these are the examples of their
Amalek types of thrombi there is one
more thrombi called as a cardio thrombi
which can be seen mostly I mean like it
can be seen as a vegetative growth on
the cardiac and which result in the
blood flow mechanical obstruction of the
blood flow cardiac thrombi and here
comes the arterial thrombosis I original
origin iota there may be of aneurysms
and arthritis if the origin is in
coronary arteries you can see
atherosclerosis misandric artery
arteries of the limbs which includes a
kilo sclerosis Bugis disease rain or
diseases which are discussed and renal
artery will also cause and cerebral or
origin of the arterial thrombosis the
origin of the venous thrombi the lower
leg popliteal and iliac veins pulmonary
veins hepatic and portal veins
superior vena cava inferior vena cava
misandric lines and renal veins all
these are the origin of the venous
and there are also called as capillary
thrombi me there this is the very minut
thrombi which composed mainly of a pack
the red cells and these are formed in
the capillaries in acute inflammatory
lesions vasculitis and the disseminated
intravascular coagulation and this
vasculitis mostly feeling there are
German disorders so those are the origin
of the thrombi and here you can see the
differences between the arterial and
venous throw me in for tintin arterial
thrombosis venous drama
sites is more common in iota in the
cerebral iliac femur renal and
mesenteric arteries if you see the
venous thrombosis or common in
superficial varicose veins or a deep leg
veins or a popliteal means and the
thrombo genesis formed following the
endothelial injury example of this
arterial thrombosis three doses and
please relate all these things here
arterial and venous disorders are in the
general surgery okay and this formed in
the venous testing after following the
venous tasks and example include
abdominal operations and the childbirth
and development usually mural and not
excluding the human completely whereas
this will be of usually occlusive in
microscopy
it will have a white frea bill with
lines of John and surface this is very
important whereas this is red blue with
fibrin strands and John lines of Jan and
this in microscopy also there is a
distinct lines of Jan and here also
lines of John with more abundant red
blood cells are seen whereas here this
distinct lines of xan consist of
platelets fibrin and entangled with red
and white blood cell so the difference
you can see here the composition of this
lines okay this is very important and
finally it leads to the ischemia effect
where it leads to thromboembolism edema
ulcers and poor own healing
this is the difference between
ante-mortem trauma and the post-mortem
thrombi in the grass picture you this
anti Mottram bottom trauma will be of
dry granular whereas this postmortem
clots will be of gelatinous soft if it
is other end to the vessel wall and this
post-mortem clots are weakly attached to
the vessel wall shape may or may not fit
their vascular contours but here this
postmortem clots will take the shape of
the vessel and the microscope it
contains apparent lines of zein whereas
this is very very important the
post-mortem clots will have will surface
is a chicken fat alone covering the
underlying red currant jelly okay the
second fat alone and kuren jelly two
words are very important these are seen
on the microscopic picture and it is
related to the postmortem clots then
finally fate of thrombus want promise
will defeat the outcome of thrombi can
be like it will be like resolution
resolution that means thrombus activates
the thrombus will activate the
fibrinolytic system by itself and which
it releases the plasma
okay the thrombus after activating the
fibrinolytic system then a plasma is
released so that this plasma will
resolve the complete thrombus so this is
the resolution one feet and the other
fate is organization that means the
thrombus will exclude from the vascular
lumen and it becomes the part of the
vessel wall the thrombus will become the
part of the vessel wall and it will
develop the new blood vessels and new
recanalization blood flow it will
develops the new things
okay that is call as an organization
that means it will organize its own
blood flow and recanalization example
includes the phlebology
here in organization then the
propagation that means that thrombus
will enlarge in the size due to more and
more deposition of the constant and
finally it caused the obstruction of the
important muscle and finally the
thromboembolism thromboembolism means
the thrombin
early stage and the infected thrombi or
quite I mean like they are very fragile
and they will get int attached from the
original site and they'll go in detached
from the vessel one and result in the
partial or a complete obstruction of
blood stream such as Mbali in ends it is
called as a thromboembolism okay in this
the thrombus thrombus will get detached
okay so this is the fate of thrombus
that is resolution organization
propagation and a thromboembolism so
that's is that is the thrombus formation
and here you have to remember about the
differences between the post-mortem lot
and antemortem thrombus and the the path
I mean like predisposing factors of the
thrombus formation okay remember one
thing there is no elevator to success
for every anything okay you have to take
the stage that means you have to go hard
for anything and along with your hard
working just add a smart work also so
that you'll succeed
