any update from Simply done so without
any further Ado let's get started
imagine you're working at Facebook where
millions of people are constantly
posting updates liking photos and
commenting on your post and to keep
running everything smoothly Facebook
uses SQL when you post a status update
SQL saves it to the database when your
friends like or comment on your post SQL
quickly finds and shows you this
information SQL links all these action
together making sure everything works
seamlessly by learning SQL you can
manage and organize large amount of data
efficiently just like Facebook does to
keep its users connected and engaged
that is why SQL is the one of the best
language for database management which
is stand for structured query language
SQL is a programming language made for
managing and working with relational
databases it lets user to easily
retrieve insert update and delete from
databases so this video will guide
beginners through the key steps and
concept needed to become skilled in
SQL craving a career upgrade subscribe

description box below and the pin
comment to become a SQL Developer you
should follow a structured plan so here
is a stepbystep guide to help you to
learn SQL and start your career in this
field so without any further Ado let's
get started so the number one is start
understanding rdbms the first step in
learning SQL is to get to know the most
popular relational database management
system rdbms these systems are the the
base for using SQL the four most common
rdbms are Oracle
MySQL Microsoft SQL Server post grid SQL
so the first one is Oracle Oracle
database created by Oracle Corporation
is a top RMS known for being scalable
reliable secure and high performing the
second one is MySQL MySQL is a popular
free and open source rdbms known for its
EAS to use reliability security and
scalability the third one is Microsoft
SQL Server developed by Microsoft
Corporation SQL Server is a flexible
rdbms trusted for secure and efficient
data storage the last one is postgre SQL
postgre SQL is a free and open source
rdbms known for its Advanced feature and
robustness the next step is pick an ID
after you understand rdbms the next step
is to choose and install integrated
development environment IDE so some
popular ID for SQL development are PG
admin an open source platform for
managing and quering post SQL databases
it has many tools for database
management the second one is my SQL
workbench a visual tool for Designing
developing and managing my SQL databases
it integrates SQL development and
administration the third one is aure
data Studio a modern open source and
crossplatform Tool by Microsoft that
supports multiple databases system like
SQL Server both G SQL and MySQL the
fourth one is Oracle SQL Developer a
free ID from Oracle that helps in
developing and managing Oracle databases
the third step is learning the basic SQL
commands the main goal of learning SQL
is to the master the basic command so
these commands are grouped into four
main categories first one is data
manipulation language the second one is
data definition language ddl the third
one is DCL and the fourth one is TCL so
manipulation language DML these commands
are used to work with the data in the
databases the main DML commands are
insert update delete and many move the
second one is data definition language
ddl these commands are used to set up
and change the structure of database
like creating altering or deleting
tables indexes and Views the main ddl
commands are create alter drop and trunk
it the third one is DCL data control
language these commands are managed user
permissions and access to the database
the main DCL commands are Grant and roke
the fourth one is TCL transaction
control language these commands control
transaction in the databases the main
TCL commands are commit soback and save
point the fourth step is understand SQL
keywords SQL keywords are important for
performing task in a database like
retrieving and managing data some
commonly used SQL keywords include the
first one is Select
used to retrieve data from a database
the second one is from specifies the
table from which to retrieve or delete
data the third one is where filter
results to include only records that
meet certain criteria fourth one is
order bu sorts the retrieve data in
ascending or descending order the next
is insert into adds new rows to a table
the next is update modifies existing
data in a table the next is delete
removes data from a table the another
one is create table creates a new table
in the databases the another one is drop
table deletes an existing table in the
databases the last one is Alter table
modifies adds or deletes columns in an
existing table and the fifth step is
Master SQL data types so understanding
SQL data types is crucial for storing
and handling data in a database the most
common SQL data types are the first one
is string data types used for text names
and addresses the second one is numeric
data types used for numbers like
integers and
decimals the third one is date and time
data types used for storing dates and
times so these three are the common data
types in SQL so the next step is know
the types of SQL operators SQL operators
are symbol used for perform different
operation on database the main types of
SQL operations are the first one is
arithmetic operators used for addition
subtraction multiplication division
exponential and modulus operation the
second one is logical operators used to
combine two or more relational
statements like all and any some like
the third one is comparison operator
used to compare the contents of a field
with another field or a constant so
after learning SQL operators let's jump
into the seventh Point learn about SQL
data
constants so constants are the rules
that limits the type of data allowed in
a table ensuring accuracy and
reliability if a constant is violated
the action will be stopped the most
common SQL data constant are the first
one is n n ensures a column cannot have
a null value the second one is unique
ensures all the values in a column or a
group of columns are unique the third
one is primary key uniquely identifies
each row in a table combines not null
and unique and the next one is check
ensure all the values in a column meet a
specific condition and the next step is
learn about SQL normalization forms
normalization is organizing data in a
database to reduce redundancy and
improve Integrity so there are several
levels of normalization each with a
specific rules so the first one is one
andf first normal form and the second
one is second normal form 2 NF the third
one is third normal form 3nf and the
fourth one is boys scor normal form bcnf
and the next step is explore Advanced
SQL concept as you advance in SQL
explore more complex topics to enhance
your skills so the first one is joints
learn to merge data from different
tables based on common conditions using
various types of joints like inner joint
left joint right joint or full joint the
second thing is indexes improve query
performance by creating and managing
indexes which is speed up data retrieval
especially for large data sets the third
is subqueries use queries within other
queries to retrieve data from the
multiple table at once allowing for more
complex data operation the fourth one is
recursive queries right queries that
call themselves until a condition is met
useful for working with haral or self
referencing data the last one is Pivot
and unpivot use pivot to aggregate
multiple rows into one and unpivot to
transform column into rows helping to
reformat analyze data so becoming good
at SQL takes time effort and a love for
learning new things by following this
step-by-step plan you can learn SQL well
you will build solid understanding and
gain the skills to handle data in
databases efficiently so with this we
