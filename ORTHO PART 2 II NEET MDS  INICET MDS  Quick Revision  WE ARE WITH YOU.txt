kant from team mds conquer now we'll be
going through the second part of
orthodontics that is the quick retention
so coming to this airplanes it is a
binary appliance
which is given by the scientist name and
the thickness of
the y that is labeled above it is 0.9
millimeters and parallel board is 1.2
millimeters
so important things to be added and
please do make a note about the
different types of
bionites which are already discussed on
the group that is very very important
the next comes is the twin block
appliance most of you are well familiar
with this diagram that is twin block
appliance
basically the angle between the two twin
blocks
initially is going to be 45 degrees when
it is activated
it's going to convert into for example
if they're asking the question the
question is activated
for example if they clearly mention what
is the initial angle then you go for 45
degrees
okay so it is inter maxillary extraoral
traction
upper and lower byte planes are
interlocked at 45 degrees initially
and whenever they are activated they are
going to be 70
okay so these are the important points
to be added it is given by clark
it consisting of a delta class this is a
question that is given in the
knee 2020 okay and
it is less fitting decreases the lower
anterior
proclamation so the next comes is
ff okay most of you are familiar with
this
diagram based question and this with
this appliance
okay so please do please do make a note
of all these important things
uh about this particular appliance okay
so please do okay you have all these
diagrams which are clearly given in your
power playbooks make a note just go back
just have a glance of diagrams most
commonly asked different types of pliers
okay so this is the distillate cutter
what are these elastics
which helps in closing the spaces
correcting the open bytes please do go
go with the classification of elastics
what is type one class one class two and
class three
okay please do make a note about the
three classes which is most commonly
asked question and confusing
the next comes these are separators
so please do make a note okay make a
note of this
appliance okay so again this this is
very very important
grades okay so grade five grade four
nowadays they're asking questions three
two and one please to learn all these
grades and what is the difference
between the slow expansion and the rapid
expansion
so please do make a note of the values
okay so
question given is uh
the the amount of activation that is
required so this is a question given
so rapid has is more dangerous okay
so it is less dangerous okay it is
relapse
is more relaxes less
okay so this is this is again this is
again a question that is
given in one of your mock exams it is a
band removing player this is the
question given in the aims examination
of course this classification is very
very important and of course one of the
confusing
so question asked is type b what is type
b
type b is prognathic maxilla and
orthognathic mandible you have the same
classification in your power play books
so please do make a note okay this is
one more classification that is
bennett's classification basing upon the
theology
every class one is abnormal position of
one or two molars
and the class two is abnormal position
of part or whole of the arch
and part battery is the both arches
either just in the facial contour
and one more important classification
that is simon's classification most of
you are familiar with this
so you have three planes and uh the
disparities in these three planes the pl
this is one plane is two plane this is
three plane what happens in the
contraction what happens in the
distraction what happens in the
attraction
what happens happens in the abstraction
protraction retraction so please do
learn all these terms and terminologies
high chances they can ask questions on
this area the next comes is the downs
analysis i'm just going to give a brief
idea of
what's going to happen in towns analysis
and everything most of you are familiar
with this we have a good discussions
during the
flow metric analysis part and of course
we have a videos on the website you can
watch them
so downs analysis is most frequently
used analysis
okay so it has 10 parameters in it okay
so
please do make a note of all these 10
parameters that is the skeletal and the
dental 5 skeletal and 5 dental
and coming to those things that is the
first one is the
the facial angle the second one is the
angle of convexity the third one is the
a b plane angle fourth one is the
mandibular plane angle fifth one is the
y axis
the next goes uh is uh
about about your dental dental
parameters that is scant of occlusal
plane
lower incisor to that of the occlusal
plane
lower incisor to mandibular plane
inter incisal angle
upper incisor to a pogonia
okay so these are the values that you
have to make a note okay so
i'm just going to give the average
values uh so that is 87.8 degrees
the next close is zero degrees it is
minus
4.6 degrees it is 21.9 degrees
59.4 degrees so coming to the dental
parameters
9.3 14.5
1.4 135.4
and 27 millimeters okay so what happens
if this value is more
what happens if this value is less so
basing upon which we will be diagnosing
the case and basing upon which we will
be planning the treatment so regularly
i mean such question a simple question
was given in the
uh neet examination 2020 and 1920 also
90 i mean the need 19 also so please do
make a note of these values go back if
you're not
if you're not very clear about these
these angles
so what are the two references which are
taken to draw this particular angle
this is the normal value what happens if
it is above what happens if it is below
for example
uh if this value like this value is
above 87.8
in this in this facial angle if it is
above increasing in the facial angle
gives an information it is in a class
three skeletal class
if it is below below this value then
it is considered as in a class such that
you have to learn for all the things
because
they are asking directly or indirectly
questions over the particular area
the next comes is the one more analysis
that is called as an stenos analysis
so in the stereo analysis you have a
parameter similarly
like that of your downs analysis okay
you have a parameter similarly like that
of your downs analysis
that is your skeletal parameters dental
parameters
and your soft tissue parameters
so what are the skeletal parameters the
skeletal parameters
in this are you can make a note about s
and a because this is the question that
is given in the need sna
s and b
a and b a and b okay the next comes is
the
occlusal plane angle then comes is the
mandibular plane angle the next comes
the dental parameters the rental
parameters which includes are the
the dental parameters which includes are
the
upper incisor to
na angle the next one is upper incisor
to any linear
so this is an angle and this is a linear
dimension
then the lower incisor 2
can be angle then enter incisal angle
value similarly like you will have
inter incisal value in the case of your
downs analysis
also okay then comes the last one is the
we are talking about something called as
a soft tissue
analysis that is an s line so these are
the parameters that you have to make a
note so i'm just going to give the rough
values
this is 82 this is 80. so this is the
difference between these two values and
a minus s and b is called as a a and b
okay so that is the minus means it is 2
then it is 14.5 degrees it is 32 degrees
then comes this value this value is 22
degrees
this diamete this dimension is 4
millimeters
this is 25 degrees and this is 131
degrees
and coming to the word of word word
about your soft tissue analysis
uh i mean like when when the lips are
well balanced
and when the when the patient when the
patient is
like well well balanced and the when the
patient is making
uh if the patient's uh if the patient
lips are located beyond this line
when you draw a line the line
that is making contact from the soft
tissue contour
of the chin to that of the middle
surface of the s
that is formed by the lower border of
the nose okay so when you draw a line
if this lips are beyond this line okay
then you can consider as protrusive and
if these lips
if they are within the line then they
are considered as retrospec okay so that
is just an inference
so please do make a note about the
reference line which is considered about
the
positioning of the lips in the case of
your s line that is used in the stenos
analysis
okay regularly ask question theorems so
please do make a note of all these 10
theorems
they're asking the number i think six
was asked in the
last year neat seven was asked in the
recent
inict examination okay so please do make
a note about the 10 the 10th was
recently added
added by the scientist called as moyas
so they're gonna ask you what is the
theorem which is added by the moyes to
this
okay so again this is the question that
is given in your inicet okay what is
group one group to group three group one
is only lip
group t is only parrot group three is
all of this
they can use like group one r means
right side left side
midline it is involving yellow does like
group one
a means group one means clef flipped
plus alice p means partial
submucosal again this is a diagram based
question hope
hope you remember this diagram this
question which which we have discussed
one of the mock examination the band
which is formed
like like i mean an extension of band
that is formed on the
ah cleft lift area lift band pallet area
okay please do make a note of all the
classifications of cleft lift and cleft
palate
which are easy but may be confused when
options are given okay so
these are three different
classifications which are mostly asked
in the examination
and then for now signing off dr srikanth
