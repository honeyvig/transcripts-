setbacks are a natural part of life's
journey they don't Define us it's our
comebacks that truly reveal our strength
and resilience for me after succumbing
to the mass layoff in my organization I
thought that it was the worst possible
start to my career I'm glad that I took
caltech's Ai and machine learning course
offered by simply bir my career
trajectory looks good and promising with
a new job and the opportunity to do some
interesting work in the AI domain hi I'm
aesia St
in the past few years I've immersed
myself in the dynamic world of software
engineering with internships at Amazon
and Intel and later joining zoom
straight out of college I graduated in
the spring of 2022 with a BS degree in
computer science earning a spot on the
Deans List every single semester however
the journey took an unexpected turn when
Zoom underwent Mass layoffs affecting me
and many other recent graduates with
only 6 months of postgrad experience I
knew that I had to p to remain a
valuable asset to companies that's when
I discovered caltech's Ai and machine
learning program offered by S this
course turned out to be a game changer
for me it not only equipped me with the
necessary skills but also gave me the
confidence to interview with different
companies eventually I landed a position
at service now as a software engineer in
fact I became the first among my fellow
grads who are laid off to secure a job
and I'm truly grateful my learnings
experence has been fantastic the
one-on-one learning with knowledgeable
instructors coupled with the 24/7
support made the journey smooth the
organized modules breaking down complex
problems into digestible pieces allowed
me to grasp some cuttingedge AI
Technologies with support from cohort
managers and flexible learning success
felt inevitable right from the start I
highly recommend this course my
long-term career goal is to become a
knowledgeable AI engineer outside inside
of the digital realm I have a diverse
range of interests from coding and AI
exploration to activities like hiking
lifting playing tennis and even
indulging in video games it's not about
avoiding setbacks but about learning and
growing from them your comeback is
always stronger than your setback so
