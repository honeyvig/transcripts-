hello and welcome to this session of
python
today we are going to talk about the
concept of object oriented programming
in python
so we will talk about certain concepts
and terminologies which you will learn
in today's session on oops in python
now what's in it for you today
let's glance at the topics
object-oriented programming in python
some major principles of object-oriented
programming and then we will touch upon
topics like class in python objects
methods
inheritance
the concepts of inheritance the
different type of inheritance then the
definition and examples of polymorphism
encapsulation and abstraction
so all these topics will be
supported with examples
and the relevant
terminologies and definitions
now what is object oriented programming
python is an object-oriented language
like any other programming language like
java c
and the object-oriented programming
language concept is not new
and each and every mature programming
language
has these concepts imbibed in it
now the concept of object oriented
programming in python focuses primarily
on creating project objects and making
reusable codes so whenever we start
programming at a large scale or for a
big project it is very important to
identify the objects within that
particular project which you want to
define
now for example in this
in this
presentation what you are seeing is that
we are covered with full of objects like
car
dog tiger tree or a balloon so these are
typical examples of objects which you
encounter in day-to-day life
now what are the major principles of
object-oriented programming so these are
the different kind of uh you know
terminologies
classes are there there are objects
there are methods
then on these classes and objects you
apply inheritance polymorphism
encapsulation and abstraction
now what is a class
class is nothing but a collection of
objects or we can say a user defined
data type right so basically it's a
complex data type which has a collection
of objects and within the objects you
have primitive data types like in string
float etc
so a class also holds the methods
the functions
which basically perform operations on
these objects
right and also it also holds on to the
attributes of the objects so let's see
with an example right
so if you have an employee class
then it would contain attributes and
methods such as email id name age salary
these are the attributes and on the
methods like you know perform tasks give
presentation
increase salary
etc etc these are will be the methods
now let's talk about what are objects in
python
now object is known as instantiation of
a class right an object is a group of
interrelated variables and methods
so when a class is defined only the
description for the object is defined
therefore no memory or storage is
allocated at that point
so for example if you see in this
motorbike is a class
but the different objects of the class
are different kind of bikes by different
brands like bmw suzuki royal enfield so
they all have inherited the attributes
of the class motorbike and then on top
of it define certain variables
additional variables and methods
on top of it to enhance the motorbike
and make it look different or function
differently
now what are methods in python methods
are functions defined inside the body of
a class right so basically methods are
something which like which you which you
perform on a
attributes of a class right method is a
function that is that is associated with
an object
so you create an object of a class and
on that object then you can execute
those functions
in python a method is not unique to
classed instances
any object type can have methods
and the methods define the behavior of
an object so that's why a bmw motorbike
will be different from royal enfield
because the behavior is different the
methods are different
so if you see the example over here you
have a class bike and in that there is a
init function which will get invoked
when you initialize the object of class
bike and then you can set the brand name
and the year of manufacturing for that
particular object
now inheritance
what is inheritance inheritance is
something which you derive
from a
parent so inheritance is like creating a
new class that uses all the properties
and behavior of another class
now the new class is called the derived
class or the child class and the
existing class whose properties are
inherited is known as a base class or
parent class
it provides and the basic view
functionality the usage of inheritance
is that reusability of code so if
anything is defined in the parent class
then you don't need to rewrite that
particular code in the child you can
just inherit it
so as i mentioned let's take a look at
the different types of inheritance which
are available
you have single level in which only one
child is narrating
the properties and the attributes from
the parent
then you have multi-level in which
first child has inherited
from the class a class b has inherited
and then you have another class c which
is inheriting from class b so this is an
example of multi-level and we will be
supporting all these concepts with an
example in our python notebook
then there is hierarchical then there
are two different classes which are
inheriting from a single class
and then multiple inheritance that
single class is inheriting from two
different parents so these are different
set varieties of inheritance basis what
is the demand what is the business
requirement you can define
now what is polymorphism polymorphism in
python
what does it means
polymorphism consists of two words poly
and morphs
poly means many and morph means shape so
basically it means
many shapes
so it is
it means using a familiar interface for
multiple forms right so you can use
a single name of the method and which
can perform different behavior
based on the object in which it is
invoked so in simple terms we understand
that a task can be performed in various
ways
let's support it with an example
like you have a plus operator now the
plus operator can be used for integer
data types to perform arithmetic
operations
whereas when you use plus operator to in
string data types it can be used for
concatenation
so it's a very typical example very
good example in terms of
how an uh
same operator
can behave differently bases what data
types are being used
now let's talk about encapsulation
using oops in python we can restrict
access to methods and variable
so basically in
in python you can you can create
something like as private
variables but of course you can't use a
private keyword unlike java so in in
python we use underscore or double
underscore in order to define private
attributes so basically
these attributes can be only used within
the class and cannot be exposed outside
a particular class
so we will see this with an example
now what is abstraction data abstraction
and capsule encapsulation are often used
as synonyms abstraction is used to hide
internal details and show only
functionalities
for example
you know how to turn on or offer light
using a switch but you don't know what
is happening behind socket
similarly an abstract class can not be
instantiated
which means you cannot create objects
for this class you can only
define
the methods
which have to be implemented by the
classes which are inheriting the
abstract class
so basically abstract class provide only
the method signatures
and rest the other functionalities and
the implementation has to be done by the
child classes
so let's now move to the
our
jupiter notebook and we will
start performing certain examples
now as we are saying
like python has objects so let's create
object
we will create a class
bikes over here
and within the class
we will define the init method
and
in the init
we will
instantiate two variables brand name and
here
now
we will create an object
of
bike
which we will we are calling as bmw and
another we will create an object called
ducati so what we are doing in this
two scenarios is
that we are just instantiating the byte
of bike object with
variable
bmw and ducati we are instantiating
now let's
print
the
year in manufacturing here the brand
name and the ear
for bmw and for ducati and let's see
right so what we have done is we have
created an object for bikes one we are
calling bmw and one we are calling
ducati and how we are differentiating
between these two bytes is basis the
brand name and the year of manufacturing
now
let's take a look at the example of
methods
i'm going to
rewrite my init method
and now i am
creating an
function
a method of top speed
and
a function of type
now
i'm gonna
create an object of bike
now this
method this object bike
can invoke methods top speed and type
because they belong to the same class
bytes
so initially when i created my object
bytes i'm instantiating it with bmw and
the ear
and
then i am
making a call to the
method top speed
and then i am making a call to the
method type
and printing
so basically i am printing the output of
the function top speed and output of the
function bmw
form the object bmw which is of class
bikes
now let's take a look
at an example of single level
inheritance
let's
create a parent class called animal
and
create a
method called sound
and let's create a child class
cat which inherits animal
and let me just put a method over here
okay
so now i have
object parent class animal child class
cat which has an edited animal
and the parent class method is sound and
the child class method is meow
so now i'll create an object called cat
and with this object
i'll be able to invoke both child class
method
and the parent class method
and as you can see
the child class
has inherited both
parent and child class
functions methods
now let's take a look at
multi-level inheritance example i'll
start off
with creating exactly the same
parent class called animal
then
i'm i'm already created another class
i'll create
same child class cat
and
now i'll and create another
class which will inherit cat class
so cat has inherited animal and cat
child has inherited cat
let's validate its syntax
and similarly now i'll create an object
for cat child
and this cat child now
can
invoke the same methods
which are in child
parent and the
super parent
so this is an example of multi-level
this is an example of
single level inheritance
now
let's take an example of polymorphism
we are going to click create a class
parrot
and define the function fly
and
swim
now we are gonna create another class
mind you there is no inheritance here we
are just creating an independent class
called penguin
and same methods now the same name
fly
and
swim
okay
now let's make a
function
in which we will pass
an object
and bases
that what is the instance of the
particular object bird it the
corresponding method will get invoked
so let's see
in the method flying test
whatever instance of the bird object
will be the corresponding of method will
be called
so now let's create a
object of parrot class and then
let's create a object of penguin class
now in my flying test
method
first i'll send a object of instance
parrot
and then
i'll
send the object of instance penguin
so now base is the instance type
when this bird dot fly
method will be called it will be called
basis the instance so in the first case
the parrot it will call this method
and in case of penguin it will call this
method fly
so please note what is the output the
output is a parrot can fly but a penguin
cannot fly
and it has been decided
by the python
at the time that which particular method
to be invoked bases the instance
so it's a very important concept
now let's take an example of
encapsulation
i'll make a class cars
define its init method
now within that init method i have
created a
private variable with underscore
underscore max price and given a value
of
9 lakh
now i am creating another
function called sell
and in that i am printing the
max price
and then
i am creating another function in which
i am modifying the private variable set
max price
so i will pass any value in the set max
price and it will replace
the max price which i have set during
the initialization at this point
now let's create an object of class cars
and
see if i sell this then the selling
price is
9 lakh what i had in it at the set at
the time of initialization
now what i'm trying to do is i'm trying
to modify a private variable
directly
c underscore underscore max price
and i i i want to check
if i'm trying to create a modify a
private variable
will it still show me 9 lakh or 10 lakh
value
and it's still showing me the 9 lakh
value it means that i can't
directly
approach or access the
private variable
i can only modify it
if i access it through a
method which is set max price in this
now i am setting the max price to
thousand
and now if i print what is my max price
it will print as
thousand
so this is the concept of encapsulation
you have a private variable which is
accessible within only the methods
of the
class you can't access it directly
now let's take a look at hierarchical
inheritance
i'll create a class employee
and
create a init method
within that you have
three variables name agent salary so an
employee with has name agent salary
now
i'm going to create a class
child class called child employee 1
which is inherited from employee
and child employee 2
which is also inherited from
employee
so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna create
a
object
per child class
and
print
so this is a typical example in which
you have two child
classes which have inherited from the
single parent
arkl in narratives
now let's take a look at
our last concept which is abstraction
so now
i'll create a class car
and define a method
mileage but i am not
giving any definition to it i am just
giving a signature mileage
the child
classes which will inherit abstract
class
will be giving the definition
so i am giving
creating a class
bmw which will again
which has inherited the car abc car but
given the definition now
similarly
i am creating another class
jaguar which has inherited the class car
but now it is giving a different
definition
it's printing mileage 25 kilometer per
hour
and
another class
range rover
and another class
renault
okay
so four
classes
which have implemented the abstract
class method mileage in a different way
now i'll create an object of first
bmw
and
invoke method
mileage
so it has method invoke the method
mileage and bmw car and printed mileage
is 30 kilometer
similarly
i'll do for renault
jaguar
and
range rover
so if you see
the
parent class
abstract parent class has not
implemented the method but just given
the signature of the method and all
other classes have implemented it and
that's the concept of abstraction
so i believe with all these concepts and
points you had a great learning session
and i look forward to connect with you
in my next session
