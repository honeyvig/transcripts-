my main aim was to be in the research
field belonging to the economical weaker
section of the society I decided to
start teaching part-time to support my
family I always wanted to learn new
things during my tenure at KK College of
Engineering the branch of artificial
intelligence and machine learning was
introduced and I become very curious
about it I research about that and I
made up my mind to pursue that Fe I
discovered simply learns generative AI
ml course in association with IIT can I
am where today I am because of Simply
learning they Place me in the field of
study that I wanted currently I'm
working as a machine learning engineer
at climate connect
technology hi my name is yogesh D I am
from henat Maharashtra I have done my
BSC and I have completed my MC in
physics in 2019 up to the class 7 I was
studying in my Village I was a naughty
kid and aiming to achieve a grade three
I always wanted to learn new things
whatever the sector physics chemistry
whatever the subject I naturally get
curious about the things my favorite
thing was to learn geography my parents
were very supportive they always pushing
me to do whatever I desire to achieve I
moved to the city when I was in class
eight my family helped me to move in the
city independently and from then on it
was completely hustle and bustle
currently I'm pursuing my PhD
during my PhD I got an opportunity to
work for the KDK College of Engineering
to teach Advanced engineering physics
simultaneously I'm teaching and taking
tutions for Class 12 students during my
tenure at KDK College of Engineering the
branch of artificial intelligence and
machine learning would introduce and I
become very curious about it so I
started researching on YouTube and
Google I realized I wanted to pursue my
career in this fit domain due to the
good pay and and great opportunity
available in the
field during my research I discover
simply L and other online platforms most
of other platforms have expensive fee
structures which I couldn't afford
because of my background when I checked
simply learn I found their fees to be
affordable I choose simply learn because
of badas sir he understood my situation
afford me a scholarship reducing my fee
structure additionally in association
with IIT kanur increase my trust
in this course even more I am wherever I
am because of Simply learn team itself
whenever I had doubt they were quick to
help and resolve my questions during the
lecture basically I used to take week to
understand the stuff and the next week I
used to ask all the question of last
week classes and yet they used to
patiently answer all the questions this
course I wanted to mention a name n m
after I submitted my assignment and
interview there was no updates for a
while there was no reply for a while and
I was really frustrated so she really
handled it with a great patience because
of her I understood how to be a patient
in hard times and finally after a while
I was placed by simply learn team at
climate connect Technologies as a
machine learning
intern I was
because my hope and the best part is I
was working in the field which I like
related to the geography and weather
prediction datas once I completed my PhD
I want to do Post doctorate in machine
learning field I like playing cricket
and I love swimming in my free time and
also streaming as
well my parents have not studied much
but they have always been my lighting
guides they always had that level of
trust and support on me they always
saido it's a hard work and regular study
you must have a lot of patience
