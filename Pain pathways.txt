hi everyone so the important topic from
your physiology is a pain pathway so
they can ask the questions related to
pain pathway like define pain describe
the pain pathway and would ask River
description of the orofacial pain okay
it's a very important topic related to
the physiology in your basics paper okay
so let's discuss myself dr. society team
MDS conquer so coming to the definition
so it is given by International
Association of the study of pain as an
unpleasant sensory and emotional
experience which is associated with
action or potential tissue damage or
describes in terms of such damage
so the definition according to IRS P has
to fall in exactly the way it is been
given okay so next is the various
sensory receptors so these are the
radius sensory receptors so for the free
nerve endings for C fibers carry the
slope pain where as a delta fibers are
for the fast pain and the Merkel
receptors for other tactile receptors in
the submucosa of the tongue and the oral
mucosa machiners receptors of the
tactile receptors of the skin and
ruffini's receptors are for the pressure
and whomped receptors Croesus receptors
are cold so KK you can remember like
that so cold and K and P is for pressure
so pacinian receptor is for the pressure
receptors as well as Ruffini is like a
rough so it is like warmth and pressure
again so and the last is a muscle
spindles
or the mechanoreceptors in the skeletal
muscle so these are the various sensory
receptors that you need to mention
before entering to the main answer so
coming to the characteristics of pain
for every pain it should be noted the
onset and the location the duration the
intensity of the pain and the type of
the pain so throbbing pain is like the
pulsating feeling lancinating is like
the cutting or a stabbing type of
feeling whereas gnawing pain is a
persistent dull pain and should also
know the aggravating factors the
relieving factors associated symptoms
and any previous treatment that is being
done so these are the various
characteristics of the pain so coming to
the components of the pain pathway so
the
characteristics actually you can write
at the last so first you need to write
the definition followed by the sensory
receptors followed by the components of
the paint the characteristics you can
write at the end so coming to the
components of the pain pathway these are
the components you can write this
flowchart as given here the receptors to
the spinal cord to the medulla thalamus
in the cortex which are the higher
centers so how is the exact pain pathway
is described in this particular picture
so you have to draw this diagram so it
is an important question for almost all
the departments so you have to put in
this diagram for sure okay so if it is a
tooth related pain like for example if
an impulse is from the molar then threw
gasoline ganglion it reaches the
trigeminal spinal tract nucleus where in
it synapses with the second order
neurons and then it goes to the higher
centers for the evaluation okay ayuh
centers like the medulla calamus and all
that it goes there for the evaluation
okay so this diagram you have to draw so
you can put forward like this
cross-section of the brain as well as
this diagram if you draw it in a neat
manner that will be very useful so
without diagram you can't explain and
you'll not score any mark so diagram has
to fall in ok later you can give this
description or you can draw and you can
write the flowchart and later if you
have time you can even describe it ok so
the pain pathway first you have to write
the components of the pain pathway
followed by the exact pathway ok so
there are actually two types of main
pain pathways so that is neo
spinothalamic tract and Paulo
spinothalamic tract ok so as I said the
a delta fibers carries the fast pain and
the C fibers carries the slow pain so if
it is intense pain or acute condition
then it carries by the a delta fibers
violate via neo spinothalamic tract it
directly reaches the higher center so
that is for the quick fast pain okay so
as you can see the one on the lateral
side is a neo spinal telemetric that is
NS t tract as you can see in the picture
the NS t tract which is a
when it is direct so directly from the
tooth it goes directly to the higher
center okay whereas next coming to the
next coming to the slow pain okay it is
carried by the so if the pain is being
carried by the C fibers then it is
called as a slow pain okay so it
synapses with the it synapses with the
non non Z acceptive specific neurons and
it is carried by a paleo spinothalamic
tract which passes through the reticular
formation which is influencing or
influenced by the modulating inter
neurons as you can see in the picture
the lateral one is in a neo
spinothalamic tract as you can see where
as immediately it is a paleo
spinothalamic tract this one this one is
a paleo spinothalamic tract where you
can see the inter neurons and you see
there every it at each and every place
there are inter neurons which are there
that is the reason it is not carry it
doesn't carry the fast pain it is slow
it is interrupted by these inter neurons
ads the reason it is slow pain very
simple so you have to keep these words
in your answer sheet that is paleo
spinothalamic tract for the slow pain
which is carried by the C fibers to the
higher center and it has a modulating
inter neurons whereas the neuro
spinothalamic tract the newest the Neo
spinothalamic tract carries a quick and
the fast pain which is carried by the a
delta fibers so that's it so from
impulse from the a molar or any tooth
it's carried to the gazillion ganglion
from there to the trigeminal spinal
tract nucleus and again to the higher
centers where it is evaluated so this is
how we have to describe the pain pathway
so initially after I the definition
followed by the sensory receptors
followed by the main components of the
pain pathway and then you have to
describe the pain pathway after draw
this diagram and you have to describe
how it has been carried what are the
main components that is a paleo
spinothalamic tract and the newest by no
telemetric so this is how you have to
describe with the new
full diagram okay so the same flowchart
you can draw along with your description
you can give next coming to the gate
control theory that you have to put
forward there so it has been
hypothesized that so it is given by
these scientists later it has been
hypothesized that the pain perception
was not slowly solely due to the
activation of the nausea receptors but
also interaction between the pain
conducting and non pain conducting
neurons so non pain conductive nerve
fibers actually interfere with the pain
condition conduction and they alternate
or they alter the perception of the pain
okay if there is improper of function of
this non pain conducting fibers then the
gate opens because of which the pain
conduction occurs and the pain is more
perceptive if the function of the non
pain conducting fibers is well and good
then the gate will be closed and the
pain alteration altering the pain
perception will be there okay this is
how the gate control theory you need to
explain so if you put these words in
your answer that's enough okay so now
coming to the various types of pain that
includes acute and chronic inflammatory
and non inflammatory somatic pains which
is again as superficial and deep deep
pains include the Musco skeleton and
visceral neuropathic and the neurologic
pain and the functional pain so these
are the various types of pain so coming
to the inflammatory pain so inflammatory
pain is a condition where there is a
inflammation cause of the pain is
inflammation so it could be the
inflammation action by the macrophages
mast cells or any of the main mediators
of inflammation so how does it is its in
the sensory neurons will carry to the
higher centers where the spontaneous
pain and the pain hypersensitivity is
being seen so that's the simple thing
you can draw this diagram if you want
the non inflammatory pain actually
includes the neuropathic pain so this is
there is no prior inflammation there so
here there is a peripheral nerve damage
because of which there causes a
spontaneous pain or pain
hypersensitivity in the higher centers
so you can simply dot his diagram you
can show a diagram
the peripheral nerve damage so that's
enough sokka pain is response in damage
to the nervous system or abnormal
operation of the nervous system so this
pain is expression of the abnormal
sensory first processing and usually it
is persistent or recurrent okay so what
is the main difference between the
neuropathic and the neuralgic pain is
neuropathic is continuous whereas
neurologic is episodic or paroxysmal in
nature okay
there's no no longer periods of they
have long periods without any pain so
coming to the neuropathic again this is
dull with sharp exacerbation whereas
neuralgia is it is sharp shooting and
moderate to very severe neuropathic pain
sensory loss vasodilatation and swelling
may occur in urology pain we know they
are discrete trigger zones so if you
write in this tabular form showing the
differences between the neuropathic and
neurologic it will be definitely scoring
coming to the functional pain so
actually here there are normal
peripheral tissue and the nerves as
normal in inflammatory pain we know
because of inflammation mediators there
is tissue damage that is being carried
by the sensory nerves to the higher
centers in the neuralgic pain there is
peripheral nerve damage right whereas in
functional pain then there is normal
peripheral tissue where and the
peripheral nerves are also normal
the main processing is there the
abnormal central processing as you can
see in this diagram so there is abnormal
central processing because of which the
pain occurs so this is called as a
functional pain simple so if you can
draw this diagram it will be very useful
because pain pathways actually adds as
an essay question so you can put
forwards these diagrams which they're
easy to draw actually paint pathway
diagram you have to draw components of
pain pack we have to describe in a
flowchart and the paint pathway also you
have to just adjacent to the diagram you
can clearly give the flowchart okay of
neuro spinothalamic tract and the paleo
spinothalamic tract followed by which
you can describe these types of pain as
the inflammatory neuropathic and
functional okay in inflammatory because
of inflammation tissue damage and
sensory nerve or the pain is carried to
sensory nerves to the higher center in
urologic pain peripheral nerve damage
and in functional pain
it is normal peripheral tissue as well
as the nerves but abnormal function in
the higher center that causes the
functional pain so that's it very simple
next coming to the classification of the
orofacial pain this classification you
have to write irrespective of your
departments so it is very important so
just have a look there's nothing that to
describe or explain in it so you can
have this classification you can write
in detail okay
next coming to the pain of dental origin
so for endo point of view it is very
important so acute pal pal pain it is of
sudden onset shorter duration and it's
severe and throbbing chronic pain is
like gradual in onset in C or insidious
and onset mild to moderate dull pain
will be there and pain will be there for
longer duration pair until pains
patients usually complain of dull of
knowing type of pain and again an acute
pad on Titus dull throbbing pain will be
there but as chronic pad on Titus is
usually painless or dull pain so this is
how you have to write for the pain of
dental origin next the cutaneous or
mucous gingival pains the pain will be
bright and stimulating in quality so
there will be a localization of the pain
will be excellent and anatomically it
will be accurate so application of any
topal and a topical anesthetic gel will
temporarily erase the pain so this is
how we have to describe the new coach
enjoyable or the cutaneous pain so
coming to the new algiers so you have to
write you have to describe as classifier
like this that is paroxysmal and
continuous paris exuse mel or episodic
of the trigeminal the gloss of ferren's
and thus plano palatine the continuous
include the post herpetic and the
burning mouth syndrome so if it is a
medicine student or pathologist student
it's better you describe these neuralgia
as that will add to ASCO so that is the
suddens unilateral stabbing or a
throbbing type of pain lancinating type
of pain which is extremely or exactly
unilateral along the course of the nerve
so like that you can explain and the
trigger Jones you can explain so this is
how it is important so next coming to
the one more important for oral surgery
point of view is the cause algea so it
is a sudden constant burning pain that
usually occurs or injury to the
peripheral nerve and it's often
considered as a type of a complex
pain syndrome it is dull persistent
variable diffuse burning sensation will
be there which is usually followed by a
dramatic or a difficult extraction of a
multi routed teeth okay so this is cause
algae's followed by a dramatic
extraction of a multi routed T there
will be dull persistent burning type of
pain at that area or at that location so
that is called as Casal gia okay that is
due to the peripheral injury to the
peripheral nerve fibers it occurs so you
have to write this next the headaches
just you can name it all these types of
headaches the migraine the cluster
headache all these are all again related
to pain you can just classify and write
the names coming to the referred pain so
you have to write the referred pain is
nothing but the reflective pain so the
pain will be there in a location other
than the site of the stimulus okay so
for example maxillary sinusitis is a
pain usually elicited in the upper
molars routes of the upper molars and
also the cardiac pain or the spondylitis
pain is referred to the lower jaw so
referred pain is that where it is
reflective the pain is perceived at a
location other than the site okay when
you can write this and the last is a
typical facial pain so it is psychogenic
in origin so there is no laboratory test
which is showing positivity or the
toothache will be there for overs like
for months and years together and also
repeated dental surgeries or dental
therapies also failed to resolve the
pain so it's completely psychogenic okay
so this is how you have to write so we
have done wet the main definition of the
pain followed by the sensory receptors
followed by the components of the pain
and the pain pathway okay
later we have discussed the types of
pain whether it could be inflammatory or
non inflammatory like the neurologic and
the functional then you can write the
characteristics of the pain and then you
can write the classification so later
you can describe the dental pains and
the mucosa enjoyable pains or the
cutaneous pain okay and then if possible
you can describe the neuralgia and also
the headaches if you can
so all this after that you have how to
assess the pain is this vast core a
visual analog score so we will ask the
patient to rate so if
for example in the first visitor if we
give the rating off from between zero to
ten he begins the rating of 9 then after
the treatment he can I can give a rating
of four three or four and later after a
week or so he can give like it is almost
negligible so it is like how you have to
take the visual analog scale and also
there is a questionnaire which you can
write so this is important so again you
have to take the detail history for the
diagnosis of the pain detail history
taking have to be there what is the
chief company in the characteristics as
we have discussed they associated
symptoms instead of presenting illness
and precipitating or aggravating or
relieving factors then physical
examination you have to completely
examine the oral mucosa the teeth as
well as edges and structures as the eyes
ears and nose and that require
investigations can be taken whether it
could be radiographs or lab tests or any
others okay then the last if you can
write write the management of pain so
this is how we have to write the
management so it is very important to
write in fact you have to write the
management how you do so if it is a
dental pain and ij6 will solve the
problem whether it could be any size or
ibuprofen if it is inflammatory you have
to give antibiotics as well so the
dosage of antibiotics is given here amok
says andrey and for an aerobic organisms
it is metronidazole which is 400 then
mucosal pains you can give topical
anesthetic gels at benzocaine and oleg
no pain and topical steroid gels at 0.1%
times known is tonight and then the
muzzle pains a muscle relaxants like the
flex on mr or - akima nowadays flex on
mr is not there it is - akima that is
being used mostly which has a muscle
relaxant in it along with the Innosight
so the mozilla accent is clorox a zone
which is around 250 mg and again
paracetamol and ibuprofen are also there
next is a neurologic pains which is
anticonvulsants so you can give
carbamazepine or ox carbamazepine and
the vascular pains like migraine is
treated with beta blockers or L got
amide or any other fire history blockers
so these are how you have to write the
management of pain and if it is a
psychogenic pain enough to go with
tricyclic antidepressants like
amitriptyline and all that and behavior
modification has to be done so this is
how we have to start and
the answer so we have to write the pain
pathway the components and all that
definition pain pathway the receptors
and the you have to describe the types
of pain then you have to give the
classification and if you can describe
the classification what all comes under
those classification and lastly have to
write the assessment of pain of how you
do the vas Kor then the diagnosis based
on the chief complaint based on the
history of presenting illness based on
your examination and also based on the
radiographs in the lab investigations
and finally how to manage the pain so
the answer should go exactly in this
order after this you can write the
contents contents for essay question is
very important because the examiner will
have an idea of what all have covered
okay so you have to write the contents
which I have discussed now and you can
end up with the conclusion of whatever
you feel and the references the
references you can give your physiology
textbook Dighton you can give you can
give that extra cash and Lingam and any
few articles on trigeminal neuralgia
