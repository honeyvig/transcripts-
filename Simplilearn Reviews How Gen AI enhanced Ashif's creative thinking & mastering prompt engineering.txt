hi I'm Asif I a software engineer I work
at all state it's an insurance company
in us uh I come from madha Pradesh I
have done Masters in computer
application uh I come from a middle
class family my father is a was a
government servant my mother is a
housewi back when I was in High School
my father taught me something and it was
very basic and I have kept it by heart I
I always follow this uh it goes like
this to be to be successful in your life
you have to think like a farmer what
farmer does they they SW the seed first
they dig the ground they SW the seed
first then they work really hard they
give the water they provide all kind of
protection to their crops then they
expect the rewards they also pray to God
that their crops will be protected uh by
bad weather or anything so in life
similarly you have to give first before
you think of taking it something earlier
I used to believe there is no need for
any certification or any third third
party approval for what you know but
later later on you know at this point in
time I feel uh I want to change to you
know change my career in machine
learning in AI currently I a mobile
application developer now for that I
only only the practice only the
knowledge will not be suffice I need an
approval from third party also so that I
can s a certificate to whoever is
interviewing me for for that particular
role we keep on changing things in in
our house we have a 10-year old FL it
needs replacement we have to replace it
otherwise it will create problem
similarly in life similarly in your
career you are selling something you are
the product at times and you have to be
adapting to the new needs of the world
or new technologies
uh my learning experience has been good
so far uh I particularly like teacher
SWAT Mandel he he taught us the subject
of generative AI prompt engineering I
was very calm very polite very
professional I'd say I was Zero before I
started I only heard the word generative
a it generates TXS it generates images I
I had no idea how it does act or how to
interact with it and when I get into the
class I realized very simple it's very
easy to use that especially with the way
teacher taught us it was it was
extremely simple I'd say uh anybody can
learn
that prompt engineering is like I can
speak my own language I I'm sure in near
future we'll have Hindi prompts coming
up or Canada prompts coming up we'll be
speaking in Canada computer will
understand it immediately and do the
task which we wanted to do I have
started thinking about products which I
can make make ever since I got
introduced to generative a earlier I
used to think okay if I do this how much
effort it will take I need this this
resources but then if I talk about
generative AI the way I can use it I
believe if I get an idea to implement it
I don't have to think about so many Mye
details because a lot of these things
are already taken care of a generative
AI so uh it is enabling you to use your
brain to create not think about how you
are going to you know create things you
know not get stuck in the Min details of
the creation whenever I get time I take
my family out my son is a fan of parks
playgrounds uh recently we went to mesur
uh he really enjoyed the the zoo over
there my son uh he likes to play puzzles
he likes to play blocks he likes to play
with cars and he's always pulling me to
play with with him uh at times I am not
that energetic but he would be you know
always behind me to play with him if you
are willing to learn something new you
are on a right path uh even if you are
not there may be situations in which you
can't afford to not learn uh when when
we recently faced lockdown people in
their 70s they learn to use PTM phone
pay right because the situation
demanding them to learn it similarly for
our case people who are working in
technology they want to they want to or
they need to upskill them do not stop
doing that it is very important you are
yourself a product and the product needs
to be updated products need to be uh a
state-ofthe-art if you stop learning you
are just a
burden and in any business if you're not
producing results or anything you're not
useful it's it's wise them for them to
you out
