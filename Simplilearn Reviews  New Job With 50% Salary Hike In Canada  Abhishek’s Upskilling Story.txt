as a working professional your
experience matters a lot but at times
that is not enough you require a bit of
push to excel in your career this
Certification did that for me right
after I completed my certification I got
a 50 hike in my new job as a senior
business analyst hi my name is Abhishek
Sani and I came to Canada in 2015 to
pursue a course in 2015 itself I got a
job at a company called ifds
International financial data services as
a business analyst in 2020 I decided to
move on with my career and I joined a
company called ssnc as an application
analyst it was going great but I wanted
to explore more I wanted to grow both
professionally and financially therefore
I decided to pursue a course from Simply
learn which was post graduate program
business analysis from Purdue University
that course really helped me it taught
me the basics of business analysts the
foundations of business analyst and also
the tools that Bas use in their

were great I had a great time
interacting with them and understanding
the real world experiences and not only
that but the overall missing thing that
I was having in my career
simply learn was able to plug that and I
was able to excel in my career as I said
