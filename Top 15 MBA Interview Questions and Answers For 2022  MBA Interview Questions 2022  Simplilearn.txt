interview questions i'll take you
through some very important interview
questions to help you with how to treat

asked is

two to three minute response at most and

thought out approach to the task the
candidate is willing to take on in order
to
best demonstrate your intent to enroll
in this course please respond
holistically
now the next question in the queue is
why do you want to join this business
school
so the interviewer may ask this mba
interview question directly or why
you're interested in this program or
area you must now list all the factors
that make the school or program the best
fit for you there are many factors to
take into account including difficulty
culture curriculum relationships in the
business and job placements so state
down the features and distinguish the
school or program and why you are
interested in them
your response will aid the interviewer
in visualizing you as a future college
student
next question is
why should we take you in
now interviewers try to put you on the
spot by directly asking why the
university should choose you for the
program
use this
mba interview question to highlight your
ability to manage topics with evidence
to support it
mention your accomplishments draw
attention to the skills you have honed
so far in your career and describe how
your background in academia and the
workplace will be useful
to other participants in the program
now next question which is a frequently
asked question is discuss your
achievements as leader
now business school
interviewers seek out potentially strong
leaders so try to give many instances
from your professional volunteer or
community roles where you have
demonstrated leadership
also talk about the initiatives you
manage and the results you got and what
path do your skills play in this
situation
and what leadership lessons did you gain
along the way next question is the
trickiest question of an interview
what are your strengths
and weaknesses
now you may be asked two different
questions regarding your strengths and
weaknesses or one combined question
in any case the interviewer looks for
evidence of your
humility and self-awareness
start by by outlining your weaknesses
and telling a tale about how you
overcome one of them it's relatively
simple to handle strengths from there
pick one or two qualities that in your
opinion set you apart from the
competition and support them with solid
examples
stating with one personal characteristic
and how it influenced
this verifiable positive results to get
started
next question that we are going to
analyze is
what aspects of your current job do you
enjoy
now use this opportunity to discuss your
present job and interest mention how the
experience you gained from this work
will help you in the future
describe how accomplishment
accomplishing specific jobs help you
discover your interests or how working
with you workers might have influenced
your decision to pursue an mba
now then comes the question related to
your planned goals that is
what are your short-term and long-term
objectives
your short-term objectives should
include things you can do right away and
how you plan to do them
and your long-term goals are influenced
by your passions and interest and how an
mba can help you grow in your job
now the next question coming in the list
is
how would an mba help you advance your
in career
now this crucial mba interview question
requires a
thorough response because it decides why
you want to get an mba
you should now elaborate on why an mba
is essential to you at this time in your
life and why a different degree in your
area of interest would not be able to
produce the same outcomes as an mba to
give a more thorough response you may
also outline your long-term goals
now the next upcoming question examines
your ability to work in a team which is
are you a team player describe
now equally important to leadership
qualities are teamwork and supportive
talents you should come across as
flexible but firm additionally keep in
mind to provide specific examples to
support your answers
the next question in the line is
what would your co-workers supervisor or
friends say about you
here you should emphasize both your
professional and personal traits also
it's most likely the person who wrote
your letter of recommendation if they
say so supervisor
the most important thing to keep in mind
is to avoid creating up information
because any errors could raise
suspicions try to present an honest
portrait of yourself
now next question is how do you make the
most of your resources
well this question may appear redundant
yet the answer is much different from
why the school this is because providing
an answer to this question will require
a far more thorough assessment of the
department and the resources it offers
if you haven't done your research the
interviewer or admissions committee will
immediately write you off as not being
very interested in the program
now when you clear out this previous
question
then follows the question of have you
applied to any other schools
now this is a tricky mba interview
question it may appear obnoxious or
forthcoming but do not take it that way
instead respond to the query list a
couple of the college you're considering
applying to and explain your decision do
your best to avoid making it clear which
school you prefer over
others
the next question in the list is
describe a period when you had an inept
manager and how you dealt with the
situation
now it's another difficult question
it would be beneficial if you treated
the situation without portraying your
managers inept or without denying that
they were the source of such behavior
and that you handle it in a
non-aggressive manner this will
demonstrate your personal and
professional development and maturity
now comes the last question in our list
that is do you have any concerns or
inquiries about school or program
now if you're permitted to ask the
interviewer questions regarding the
course or the application process have
at least one or two thoughtful responses
ready
genuine inquiring ensure your curiosity
and background knowledge
ask in-depth questions about topics as
you converse if you can to show that you
are paying attention to what is being
said
also am i asking questions that can be
found on the school's website or in its
marketing materials because doing so
will make you appear unprepared in your
interviews and decrease your prospects
well these were all the important
questions that you might come across
while giving your mba interview
though these mba interview questions
might seem a bit bit intimidating yet
analyzing them and thoroughly going
through these questions can help you
reach your dream b school
