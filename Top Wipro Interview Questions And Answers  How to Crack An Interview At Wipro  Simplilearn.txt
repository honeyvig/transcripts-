you can prepare for a job interview by
studying weeks in advance but still
there's no guarantee that you won't be
asked the question you have no idea how
to answer the trickiest and most
important questions are designed to help
employers gain a deeper understanding of
details beyond what's listed on your
resume
a potential sales candidate for example
might be asked to talk through how
they'd approach a short sale cycle
differently than a long sales cycle
a candidate interviewing for a
management role might be asked how
they'd handle customer objections or a
team conflict
these questions aren't always easy and
they often cause most people to stress
and freeze up so we bought you this
video to get a better understanding of
web pro interview questions
hey everyone welcome to another exciting
video from simply learn in this session
we will be discussing wipro interview
questions but before we begin let me
tell you guys that we have daily updates
on multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological friends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started with the first question in
today's session
wipro
if a question asked like this come up
with an answer like wipro is india's top
id company it provides a fantastic
environment to work for
here your qualities will be valued the
organization has worked in a range of
fields and countries once you're inside
you'll have a variety of options based
on your professional skills wipro also
provides a good team to work with and
work life balance is excellent at web
pro
next question mention the differences
between string buffer and string builder
in java the string builder was developed
as a drop in replacement for the string
buffer so it is not synchronized it is
not thread safe
so that you can only use it when the
string buffer is used by string thread
and it is faster in most cases
string buffer was developed before the
string builder string buffer is
synchronized so that the programs that
use it take more memory and use the time
to run the programs
now the third question
why do you want to work at a web pro
the answer for this question will be i
want to work at the pro for a great
record of innovation and success
whenever i think of how much the
technology has changed since the 1940s i
know wipro would not have been able to
thrive unless it embraced change
i'm impressed with wipro which has been
in business since 1940. now the fourth
question state the functionalities of an
operating system the answer for this
question is
the functionalities of an operating
system are an operating system provides
a user interface graphical user
interface and command line
an operating system also includes a
functionality for booting the computer
it also performs some operations for
managing and peripheral devices now the
fifth question
what do you understand about java
virtual machine
the answer for this question is jvm is a
virtual machine that enables the
computer to run the programs jvm acts
like a runtime engine that calls the
main method present in the java code jvm
is the specification that must be
implemented in the computer system
now we have the sixth question list a
few features of javascript
the few features of javascript are
it is open source lightweight
interpreted programming language
complementary to java complementary to
html and cross platform
now the next question
what is the use of window objects the
answer for this question is the window
object is not an object of javascript it
is a browser object created
automatically by the browser that
represents a window of browser the
window object is used to display the
pop-up dialog box
now we have the eighth question what is
c sharp c sharp is a simple and general
purpose programming language which is
developed by microsoft it is a safe and
managed language that is compiled by
dotnet framework to generate microsoft
intermediate language
the ninth question in the list is why do
you want to work at web pro
the answer for this question is i want
to work at wipro for the great record of
innovation and success
i know bipro would not have been able to
thrive unless it is embrace the change i
am impressed with the pro that it has
been in business since 1940.
now the next question
now the next question what is the
difference between public static and
void the difference between public
static and void are
you can access public declared variables
anywhere static declared variables are
globally accessible without creating an
instance of the class
void is a type modifier that specifies
the method that does not written any
value
next question what is sql sql stands for
structured query language it is used to
maintain the relational database and
perform
many different data manipulation
operations on the data next question
what is a class the class is a user
defined data type that contains the data
members and member functions both access
is defined by the three modifiers public
private and protected now we have the
next question
what is polymorphism
polymorphism means having more than one
function with the same name but with
different functionalities polymorphism
is divided into two categories static
polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism
what is abstraction abstraction is a
technique of showing essential details
without representing the implementation
if the members are defined with a
keyword public then the members are
accessible outside also if the members
are defined with a keyword private then
the members are not accessible by the
outside methods
what is data binding data binding is a
process of binding the application's
user interface and business logic if any
changes made in the business logic that
will be reflected directly in the
application ui
what is an object object is an instance
of a class so that you can create an
object from a class the objects of a
class are declared with the same sort of
declaration that we declare variables of
basic types
next we have what is a destructor a
destructor is used to delete any extra
resources allocated by the object a
destructor function is called
automatically once the object goes out
of the scope
next question
what are checkpoints in dbms a
checkpoint is a type of mechanism where
all the previous locks are removed from
the system and are permanently stored in
the storage disk these are checkpoints
and dbms now we have the 19th question
what is normalization
normalization is a process of analyzing
the given relationship scheme up
according to their functional
dependencies it is also used to minimize
the redundancy and also to minimize
insertion deletion and update
distractions
now we have the 20th question
what is a stack
stack is an ordered list in which
insertion and deletion can be performed
only at one end that called the top it
is a recursive data structure having a
pointer to its top element sometimes
stack is also called last in first out
early 4 list
the element which is inserted first in
the stack will be deleted last from the
stack
now we have the 21st question
what do you mean by static variable
the static variable is used to refer to
the common property of all the objects
like name of the company
college name students etc static
variable gets memory only once in the
class area at the time of class loading
next we have what is inheritance
inheritance is a mechanism in which one
object acquires all the properties and
behavior of another object of another
class it is used for code reusability
and method overriding
the idea behind the inheritance in java
is that you can create a new class that
are built on top of existing classes
what is method overloading method
overloading is a polymorphism technique
that allows us to create multiple
methods with the same name but different
parameters
is it possible to override the private
method no it is not possible to override
the private method because the scope of
private method is limited to the class
and we cannot access them outside the
class
what is the use of bcl language dcl
allows users to control access and
permission management to the database it
is a subset of database which decides
that what part of the database should be
accessed by which user at what point of
time it includes the common commands
like grant and revoke
what is a primary key
a primary key is a field or the
combination of fields that uniquely
identify each record in the table it is
one of the special kind of unique key if
the column contains a primary key it
cannot be null or empty
the table can have duplicate columns but
it cannot have more than one primary key
now the next question what is an
inconsistent dependency
an inconsistent dependency refers to the
difficulty of getting relevant data due
to the missing or broken path in the
data
now we have our next question what is
tree data structure
tree data structure is a recursive data
structure containing set of one or more
data nodes where one node is designated
as the root node of the tree while the
remaining nodes are called as the child
nodes
now what does success mean to you in my
point of view i define success as
fulfilling my role in my team and the
company i trust that my employer has
placed me in a position where i'm
capable of achieving the goals of
company and my team so i work towards
completing my individual duties as
effectively as possible
now in the next question what is street
traversal tree traversal repeat tree
traversal is a process of visiting all
the nodes of a tree all nodes are
connected via edges links we always
start from the root node head node
there are three types of tree traversal
which are in order traversal
pre-order traversal and post order
traversal
now the 31st question
how does depth first traversal work
the answer for this question is
depth first search algorithm traverses a
graph in a depth word motion and uses a
stack to remember to get the next vertex
to start search when a dead end occurs
in any iteration
now the 32nd question what is a
selection sort selection sort is in
place sorting technique it divides the
data set into two subless known as
sorted and unsorted then it selects the
minimum element from the unsorted sub
list and places it into sorted list
this iterates unless all the elements
from the unsorted sub-list are consumed
into sorted sub-list
now we have the 33rd question what are
the advantages of selection sort
the advantages of selection sort are
selection sort is a simple and easy to
implement selection sort can be used for
small data sets selection sort is more
efficient than bubble sort now we have
our next question
what is an attribute an attribute refers
to a database component
it can be defined as the characteristics
of entity and can be uniquely identified
using the attributes attributes
represents the
instances in the row of a database now
we have our 35th question
what is synchronization synchronization
is the capability to control the access
of multiple threads to shared resources
synchronized keyword in java provides
locking that ensures mutual exclusive
access of shared resources and prevents
data race
now we have our next question list some
application of tree data structure
the answer for this question is the
applications of tree data structure are
symbol table construction the
manipulation of arithmetic expression
hierarchical data model syntax analysis
and much more
now we have the 37th question which data
structure is used in bfs and dfs
algorithms the data structures used in
bfs and dfs algorithms are queue data
structure and stack data structure
respectively
now we have our next question now we
have a next question can we overload the
main method the answer for this question
is yes we can have any number of main
methods in java program by using method
overloading now the 39th question what
is a search operation the answer for
this question is whenever an element is
to be searched start searching from root
node then if the data is less than the k
value search for the element in the left
subtree or in simple term we can say
that searching for the element is in the
right subtree
now we have the next question what is
linear data structure a linear data
structure has data elements arranged in
sequential manner and each member
element is connected to its previous and
next element such data structures are
easy to implement as computer memory is
also sequential example list queue stack
array etc
now the next question write a program to
check palindromes the answer for this
question is displayed right on my screen
you can take a quick screenshot for
future reference
now we have another simple question
based on code
how to split string in java the answer
with this question is really simple the
answer is right on my screen you can use
the following code to split a string
using java programming language
here we have given simply learn as a
string and you can use the split
function in java to split it
now we have our next question what is
object loading the object cloning is
used to create the exact copy of an
object
java.lang.clonableinterface must be
implemented by the class was object
clone we want to create
now we have our 44th question list a few
advantages of dbms the few advantages of
dbms are it provides multiple user
interfaces redundancy control ensures
data consistency restriction for
unauthorized access easy accessibility
provides backup and recovery and forces
integrity constraints
now we have 45th question
what is the purpose of default
constructor in java the purpose of
default construction in java is to
assign the default value to the objects
java compiler creates a default
constructor implicitly if there is no
constructor present in the class
now we have our next question what are
functions in python a function is a
block of code that is executed only when
the function is called to define a
function in python the def keyword is
used
next we have another simple coding
question
write a program to check if the number
is prime or not
the answer for this question is right on
my screen you can make a quick note of
it or feel free to take a screenshot for
future reference the program is written
using c programming language
now the next question
explain about
docstring in python
so the answer for this question is
docstring is a string literal that
occurs as the first statement in
function class module or method
definition it also provides a better way
to associate the documentation
now we have 49th question
mention sql comments
the answer for this question is sql
commands are two types they are single
line commence multi-line comments
and the final question for today's
session is
what are the uses of super keyboard the
answer for this question is the users of
super keyword are it is used to invoke
the immediate parent class method it is
also used to refer the immediate parent
class instance variable it can also be
used to invoke immediate parent class
constructor
and this was all for today's session i
hope now you guys have an idea of how to
answer the questions asked in vipro
interview if you have any questions
