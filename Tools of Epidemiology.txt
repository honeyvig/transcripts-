yeah happiness here was we going to
discuss about the tools of Epidemiology
and I hope most of you are well aware of
this because this is the most common
aspect or question in your final year
the three main important tools okay one
is a rate the second one is the ratio
and the third one is the proportion okay
so I hope you remember this so they can
simply ask which are the following or
tools okay all of the above that is rate
ratio and and the proportion okay so
next one if we go in detail into the
each aspect okay the first important
thing is rate the important things that
you have to make a note about the rate
rate a few times they call it as
frequency or rate is simply the measure
of occurrence of a disease during a
given period of time
okay rate is a measure of occurrence of
a disease during a given time so there
are two important requirements for the
rate okay there are two important
requirements for the rate the first
requirement is the time frame okay the
time frame is the first important
requirement and the second important
requirement is the unit of the
population the unit of the population is
the second important requirement so in
this particular area the other important
things that you have to make a note
about the rate is numerator the
numerator I hope you remember that okay
for example if it is 12 by 18 this is a
numerator and this is a denominator so
when you're talking about a rate okay
the numerator is a part of denominator
okay the numerator is a part of the
denominator and it is multiplied by
thousand okay it is multiplied by
thousand in most of the cases or it is
multiplied by 10,000 or it is multiplied
by it is multiplied by one line okay so
it is numerator is a part of denominator
and it is multiplied by thousand or
10,000
that is about the rate okay so rate you
need to have the time frame you need to
have the unit of population numerator is
not a part of genome numerator is a part
of denominator and it is multiplied by
thousand or 10,000 okay these are the
important things that you have to make a
note about the rate so coming to the
different types of rate okay so in rate
you have to discuss about the types what
are the types of rate there are three
types of red one is the queued rate the
second one is specific rate and the
third one is the standardized rate okay
so there are three types of rate one is
crude rate second one is specific rate
third one is standardized rate so you
need to learn about the meanings of each
and every one
the cured rate is the actual observed
rate okay the cure rate is the actual
observed rate and the examples are the
death rate and the birth rate death rate
and birth rate examples of cure rate the
second one is as the word specific
clearly gives an idea that this is a
rate which deals with a specific group
in a specific time in sp the specific
cost or with the specific disease so all
specifics comes under the specific rate
the third one is has already discussed
that is a standardized rate so
standardized rate is obtained either by
direct or indirect method of
standardization for example if you take
standardization of phase that is is
related standardization or if you take
standardization of six the gender of the
patient then it is gender related
standardization so these examples they
comes under the standardization rate
okay clear I rate is of three types one
is cure rate specific rate and
standardized rate I hope you're very
clear with this rate so the next
important aspect is all as already
mentioned the second rule the second
tool is the the second tool is ratio
okay so I am going to talk about that
the second tool the second tool is the
ratio we we we remember that the sex
ratio there is something called as the
sex ratio so
in this ratio the ratio is also called
as odds it is also called as odds few
people call it as odds ratio is is a
relation the case a relation or it's a
companion something like a comparison
which may or may not be time specific in
most of situations it is not time
specific it is just like the comparison
of male and female ratio of male and
female is called a sex ratio right so in
this particular content the numerator is
not a part of denominator it's not a
part of the room for example if we're
taking the ratio of males to females
males are not a part of females that is
then it is called as a ratio ratio is a
condition where the numerator is not a
part of denominator okay it's just a
comparison of numbers when two numbers
are separated like for example taking
the number of males or number of females
in two country consideration you you are
not going to count the males and females
and females in males so it is clear that
the numerator is not a part of
denominator the numerator is not a part
of denominator that is simply a sex
ratio okay you can talk about the sex
ratio sex ratio is the ratio between the
number of females by the number of males
so this is the ratio so if you want to
talk about any other ratios you can talk
about the comparison the the males are
not are going to be a part of females
and everything okay so this is all about
the ratio the second one and the third
important aspect is the proportion has
already discussed the third important
factor is the the proportion so coming
to the proportion the definition of the
proportion says that it is a fraction of
population it is a fraction of
population who has a characteristic
feature of our interest okay so you are
just identifying the amount of the
fraction of population in which you are
able to identify your particular
character for example if you want if you
want to identify the people like who has
passed in a particular exam so you
catching that factor fraction of
population which are having this
particular characteristic feature okay
so here in which the numerator is going
to be part of denominator okay because
the numerator is a part of denominator
part of denominator and when you when
you talk about the calculations like in
the red we calculated things which are
which are like which are multiplied by
thousand or ten thousand but in the case
of proportion you are going to multiply
it by 100 lucky you're going to multiply
it by 100 and the best example for the
proportion is the you can remember this
I I hope you remember this case fatality
rate so case fatality rate says that the
number of deaths of a particular case by
the number of cases so total number of
cases are going to contain the death
cases also so the numerator is a part of
denominator and you are going to
multiply it by 100 the numerator is a
part of denominator and it's
multiplication by hundred and this is
going to give si chef okay where the
numerator is part of a denominator so
these are the three tools of the ratio
and if you want one more example of
ratio you can add the relay to the
relative risk I hope you remember that
relative risk which we are going to talk
about in the studies right the relative
risk is nothing but incidence among the
exposure by incidence among the non
exposure because exposure non exposure
are two different groups so me over it
is not going to be part of denominator
and this relative risk is a is a ratio
okay I hope you're very clear I'm just
going to give a quick recap quick glance
of things okay the tools of this are
rate ratio and proportion so coming to
the rate is already discussed rate is a
frequency in which you have two
important requirements one is time frame
and unit of population
right so that's all I put that and
numerator is a part of denominator and
it is multiplied by thousand or ten
thousand or one lakh and we have three
types of rates crude rate specific rate
and standardized rate coming to the
ratio ratio is also called as odds okay
numerator is not a part of denominator
the best examples are sex ratio and
relative risk coming to the proportion
proportion numerator is a part of
denominator okay you're going to
identify the fraction of case and the
difference is just you're going to
multiply it by 100 and the best example
is C F okay done for now we'll be coming
with a few more important aspects on
your group thank you signing off from
