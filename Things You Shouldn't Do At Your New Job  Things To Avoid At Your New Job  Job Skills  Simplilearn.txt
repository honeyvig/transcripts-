be feeling pretty excited and rightly so
but this isn't the end it would be best
if you buckled up as most employers are
looking out for the best interests of

before you know it you will have a
slight vision of the competitiveness of
reality to have a happy work life we
have provided eight tips and tricks to
help you understand the do's and don'ts
at your new job
our first tip is don't show up late to
the office
being on time is very important on a new
job not showing up on time is likely to
make a negative impression so make sure
that you are never late to your office
our second tip is to take inductions and
orientation seriously
many companies have training and
induction sessions for new employees
while it may not seem like a loss of
time to you it will definitely help you
get the most out of your new position
the third tip is to never overload
yourself with too much work one of the
most basic blunders people make is they
try to squeeze as much work as they can
into every waking moment while this may
seem like it has its benefits there are
also negative consequences to it
it leads to an individual missing out on
a lot of social and personal life
the fourth tip is to never take too much
leave
no doubt the company has allotted you
several leaves but you shouldn't misuse
this privilege
for one you'll need to give your boss
why you're taking days off and secondly
taking leaves very often will sound like
an excuse or an escape from work this
will give a negative impression about
you on that note please comment in the
comment section below the critical
skills you must showcase to be good in
your manager's eyes

the fifth tip is to never ignore the
help you get from your co-workers and
never hesitate to ask for it
do accept support from your co-workers
as many people like to help newcomers
it builds a foundation between the
newcomer and the old one honesty is
essential so our sixth tip is in a new
job there will always be a learning
curve
be honest and never hesitate to learn
new technologies
performing tasks and exploring ways of
doing it yourself will make the job more
accessible and more satisfying our seven
tip is to never complain about your
former boss or colleagues
even if you don't have a good working
relationship complaining about your
previous company allows current
co-workers to formulate a story about
what they think would have happened
hence never talk ill of your last peers
in front of your new ones
our eighth step is to always be ready to
learn new skills
even if your previous job duties are
different from those at your new job
treat this transition as an opportunity
to change things
be open to learning new techniques

also save you from monotony and make you
better at your job
