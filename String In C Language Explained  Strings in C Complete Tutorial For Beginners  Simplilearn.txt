hey guys welcome back to another video
by simply learn in today's video we're
gonna be learning all about strings in c
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make
sure to hit the subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update
so now without any further delay let's
begin
this session will help you to understand
what a string in c is
next string declaration and
initialization and finally let's
understand string operations and the
important functions of reading and
writing a string
let's get started with what is a string
in c
a string is a sequence of characters
represented within double quotes string
examples are as given below
every time we initialize a string it
must be within double quotes so for
example if a string is simply learn then
it must be within double quotes only
then it will be considered a string
strings are not just alphabets but even
if numbers or whitespace characters are
enclosed within double quotes even that
is considered a string
now let's look at the syntax to declare
a string
we have the data type followed by string
name and the size
always a string must be declared of data
type character for example we have cad
as data type string name as str it can
be any name and followed by the size of
a string
if the string size is 5 the last
character would be a null character
represented as a terminating character
in the c programming language
now that we know how to declare a string
in c moving ahead let us understand
string initialization
first let's see the ways to initialize a
string
we can initialize a string within double
quotes by mentioning the string size and
another way is that it can be
initialized without mentioning a string
size in the subscript
and it can also be initialized inside
the curly bracket character by character
separated with the comma operator
just by initializing character by
character the compiler will identify the
number of characters in a string then it
will store character in the memory and
the terminating character the null
character
look at the diagram below and understand
how a string is stored in memory
first memories are located at some
address
that holds the string a
b c d and null character at the end
and then the index starts from 0 to n
minus 1 so in this example the string
elements are 5 and the index will start
from 0 to 4.
i hope it's clear
okay so let us move on to the operations
on strings
we all know that we have many c
programming language operations
similarly we can perform different
operations on string and a few such
operations are finding the length of the
string concatenating two strings copying
a string to another string and finally
comparing two strings
so for all these operations we have
functions associated with it
we use string handling functions defined
in the header file string dot heads to
perform such operations in c language
a function like strlen is to find the
length of a string
it will count the number of characters
in a string and prints the output
then strc80 is used to concat two
strings which means adding up two
strings
suppose our first string is simply and
the second string is learn then it will
add both the strings and give us the
output as a single string called simply
learn
the following function is strcpy to copy
a string to another and finally strcmp
to compare two strings
now that we have some idea about the
strings handling functions in c language
let's look at the functions to read and
write a string
first let's understand the functions of
reading a string
using scanf getcat and gets we can take
string input
scanf is used to read string and
percentage s is the format specification
so when we use percentage s format
specification to read a string from the
terminal then ampersand is not required
next
the get cap function reads a single
character by character from the terminal
once the whole string is read it is
stored as an array in the memory
following we have the gets function
defined in the stdio.h header file that
reads character until it finds the new
line character and add a null character
to the string
up next we have functions of writing a
string
and the functions are printf putcad and
puts
printed function is used to print the
string on the console
we use the percentage as format
specification to print the string on the
console
next bootcamp is used to print a single
character so using a look we can use
putcad repeatedly in our programs and
print all the string characters
finally we have puts function
from which the whole string is printed
which is defined in the header file
stdio.hedge
let's run a simple program to understand
strings in a better way
choose from over 300 in-demand skills
and get access to 1 000 plus hours of
video content for free visit scale up by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more as you all can
see the program we are trying to print
the string called simply learn using
printf function
so let's give string size less than a
string
so let's give 5
and see the output
so here we got an warning saying that
string for array of care is too long
that means
it just prints the starting five
characters of a string
s-i-m-p-l so this is the starting five
characters of a string called simply
learn
now let's remove the size and run the
program
so as you can see the whole string is
printed that means the compiler will
identify the number of characters in a
string and prints the output
in our next program let's perform an
operation using the string functions
so in this program we are using puts and
printf function to print the output
then we have initialized two strings and
the first string is simply and second
string is learn in order to add both the
strings we are using strc80 function
now let's run the program and look at
the output
as you can see strings are concatenated
successfully so this was our first
string called simply and second string
learn and both the strings are added up
and given a single string called simply
learn
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the string sensing i
hope this session was informative and
interesting until next time thank you
stay safe and keep learning
