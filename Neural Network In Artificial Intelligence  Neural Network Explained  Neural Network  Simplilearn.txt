foreign
the brain controls and coordinates
everything we do what if I say we can
create an artificial brain that works
like a human the technology behind all
this is neural networks and deep
learning I guarantee you after watching
this video you will better understand
the critical fundamentals of neural
networks hey everyone welcome to Simply
learn before moving forward please make
sure you subscribe to Simply learns
YouTube channel and press the Bell icon
to never miss any updates what's in it
for you
first we will understand what is neural
network further types of neural network
and finally applications of neural
networks now before we get started I'd
like to ask a simple question to all the
artificial intelligence and neural
network as parents which is the first
and patented robot in the world
you can let us know in the comments here
is an Hint it is not Francine without
further Ado let's begin
what is neural network in simple terms
an artificial neural network can be
called as a system of hardware and
software that is framed after how
neurons in the human brain function
artificial neural networks are the other
name for neural networks our brain has
billions of neurons they are all
interconnected neural networks contains
three major layers they are an input
layer and output layer and a hidden
layer let us define neural networks
first and artificial intelligence
technique called a neural network
instructs computers to analyze data in a
manner model after the human brain deep
learning is a sort of machine learning
that employs interconnected neurons or
nodes in a layered framework to mimic
the human brain functions like that of
the human brain in a neural network a
neuron is a mathematical function that
gathers and categorizes data following a
particular architecture the network is
similar to statistical techniques like
regression analysis and curve fitting so
far we have a comfortable understanding
of artificial neural network
let's take step further and understand
the various types of neural network
firstly we will understand feed forward
Network up next convolution neural
network
and finally multi-layer
perception first we will understand feed
forward Network
the feed forward networks are made up of
hidden layers and several neurons
connected by hidden connections since
there is no backward propagation and the
data only travels in One Direction these
are referred to as feed forward systems
convolution neural network it is a
neural network for deep learning which
learns directly from given data it is
used to recognize the given patterns
objects and faces convolution neural
networks are the most popular for image
classification multiple convolutional
layers of CNN are in charge of
extracting significant features from the
image
next we will understand recurrent neural
network
when predictions based on sequential
data are required recurrent neural
networks comes into play a series of
words images or other data types might
be considered sequential
multi-layer perception
it is a complex architecture of neural
networks like the human brain a
multi-layered perceptron is made up of
linked neurons communicating with a
value is assigned to every neuron three
basic layers make up the network
perceptrons with numerous hidden layers
and activation mechanisms are known as
multi-layer perceptrons gradient descent
is used to update the weights during the
relearning process which is conducted
under supervision
these are all the important types of
neural networks now we will see real
world application of neural network
first we will cover about medical care
then comes sales and marketing
up next we will understand role of
neural networks in personal assistance
and last but important application is
social media
role of neural network in medical care
oncology uses artificial neural networks
to train algorithms that can detect
malignant tissues at the microscopic
level with the same accuracy as skilled
medical professionals using facial
analysis on the images of the patients
certain rare diseases that can appear
physically can be detected in their
earlier stages therefore the widespread
adoption of artificial neural networks
in healthcare can only increase the
diagnostic skills of healthcare
professionals and in the long run the
standard of healthcare globally
coming to sales and marketing based on
your previous browsing history
e-commerce sites like Amazon and
Flipkart suggest that when you log in
similar to how zomato Squiggy Etc will
present restaurants suggestions based on
your preferences and previous order
history if you love pasta it is done
using individualized marketing which is
true across all new marketing categories
including book sites movie Services
hospitability sites Etc
so the technology behind all this is
artificial neural networks
up next we will understand
social media
the Facebook people you may know tone
advises users to make friend requests
based on potential acquaintances
the individuals you could know are
determined by employing artificial
neural networks which examine your
profile interest existing friends their
friends and several other
characteristics to determine who you
might know facial recognition is a
typical use of machine learning in
social media convolution neural networks
locate approximately 100 reference
points on the subject space and then
compare them to points already present
in the database
next is personal assistant you all have
probably heard of Siri Alexa Cortana and
other virtual assistants thanks to your
smartphones these personal assistants
employ speech recognition and natural
language processing two converse with
their users and create responses in line
with their needs artificial neural
networks are used in natural language
processing to manage many of these
personal assistant functions including
language syntax semantics accurate
pronunciation ongoing conversation Etc
with this we have reached the end I hope
the session was interesting and
informative should you find any queries
regarding any of the topics covered then
do let us know in the comment section
below our team of experts will be happy
resolve all your queries at the earliest
until next time thank you stay safe and
keep on
