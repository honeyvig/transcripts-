check out the link mentioned in the
description box below for more details
now we'll move ahead from beginners to
advanced level Java projects so let's
start with the first Java Project online
banking online banking has changed the
way Banks usually function it brought
the most of time consuming procedures
like money transfer rtgs and nef to
account holders fingertips most of the
national and Multinational Banks use
internet banking these days experience
details in one such project added to
your resume would give a positive impact
to your profile an online banking system
is a Model A banking site that helps
customers to perform Bank transactions
through a phone or laptop the project
would be performing The Following
operations homepage of the online
banking site creation of new accounts
login log out manage profile and
password view the balance of the account
deposit the amount withdraw the amount
transfer the amount and close account
tools you prefer while working in online
bank our Java JavaScript and or so let's
move on to our second project which is
currency converter this Java project
serves as a fundamental tool for
currency conversion allowing users to
seamlessly switch between different
currencies through a web- based
interface an example scenario involves
converting US dollars to Indian Rupees
showcasing its practical applications
this project resembling a calculator
utilizes Java seret Ajax and applet to
create an interactive web application it
updates currency value fluctuations and
conversion rates regularly ensuring
users are always in the loop this
applications offer a convenient solution
primary employed in business stock
markets and financial sectors where
daily currency exchange and Money
Transfer occurs Technologies is utilized
Java programming language and agents the
next project on the list is an online
examination system both schools colleges
universities and even government and
private offices have switched from
traditional paper based examinations to
online examination due to the widespread
applications the project should be
capable of some functionalities
including login update profile and
password selecting answers for mcqs
writing answers to the questions and
closing sessions and log out tools you
prefer to work on online examination
project is Javascript next on the list
is an Airline reservation system this
Java project is developed to facilitate
customers in the seamless online booking
of tickets offering features such as
checking seat availability accessing
flight arrival details selecting
preferred classes and reserving seat
seats for both National and
international flight this Java project
efficiently filters flight details
include timings and available seats by
consolidating data from various Airlines
through globally distributed systems
once customer details are entered the
system prompts the user to choose a
flight with a preferred time slot
proceed with the payment and complete
the ticket booking technology is
utilized code Java HTML JavaScript and
SQL database moving forward let's
discuss some of the intermediate level
Java project number five on the list is
a Flappy Bird game the Flappy Bird game
stands out as a straightforward Java
based gaming application where the
primary character of bird Endeavors to
reach its destination by navigating
through various obstacles the
utilization of the spring component in
Java proves to be an ideal choice for
this gaming scenario the game increments
to count by one each time the bird
successfully passes a hle while also
tracking the elapse time a collision
with any obstacle results in the
termination of technology is used Java
Javas swing Java awt and objectoriented
programming Concepts next on the list is
a snake game recall those nostalgic
moments when the snake game on Nokia
mobile phones was a popular past time
this snake game can be entirely realized
through Java incorporating a mySQL
database and boasting a comprehensive
graphical user interface the game
commences with a snake whose length
increases with every food consumed
navigation involves the snake turning
left or right at 90° angles the snake's
Journey concludes upon Collision with a
wall or any obstacle encountered along
it Technologies utiliz are Java mySQL
database jdbc and JavaScript now moving
on to number seven we have an exam
seting Arrangement system the exam
seting Arrangement system an application
implemented through GSP Java and my SQL
streamlines the task of organizing seat
allocations for all students under
examination supervision this application
captures comprehensive student details
including name role number section
Branch a year and securely store post
this information in databases
Administration duties such as managing
these details are automated through the
application technology is utilized Java
HTML CSS JavaScript MySQL and Tomcat
server moving forward let's discuss some
of the advanced level Java projects
speech recognition the exponential rise
in artificial intelligence and machine
learning PVE the way for speech
recognition it is widely used for many
purposes like Alexa cotana Google
translate security Etc in Java the
speech recognizer converts audio to text
java. speech. recognition package
defines the recognizer interface to
support speech recognition plus a set of
supporting classes and interfaces the
project should be capable of certain
tasks including create a speech
recognizer allocate resources load and
enable grammar attach result listener
commit changes and process results tool
you might prefer to work on the speech
recognition project are Java and openc
next up we have face recognition face
recognition is one of the most popular
tools used in various domains like
phones law enforcement departments Etc
working upon one such type of project
will help you improve your skills by
using multiple libraries for example
open CP face recognition with open CP is
an open source computer vision library
with tons of modules like object
detection face recognition and augmented
reality the project should be capable of
certain tasks including managing users
faces facilitate face identification
easy login and log out store face IDs
identify Suspect with just images
enhanced way to find cyber criminals
tools you might prefer to work on facial
recognition project are Java open sa
Apache an and mw60 moving on to the last
project of this video we have a vehicle
recognition system similar to face
recognition Java vehicle recognition
also has a wide range of application in
real time the Java vehicle recognition
application is used to identify Vehicles
by reading the license plate on a
machine learning algorithm captures the
image reads the alpha numeric value on
it and fetches the vehicle Dy Java anpr
is a number plate recognition software
that implements algorithmic and
mathematical principles from artificial
intelligence Machine Vision and nle
network the project should be capable of
multiple tasks including capture the
image image pre-processing license
character set segmentation feature
extraction training neural network
evaluation and result tools you might
prefer to work on the vehicle
recognition project are open CV job Jaa
and neural network so these were the top
10 Java projects you can look for to
accelerate your career in software
development with this we have come to
