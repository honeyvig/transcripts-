yeah hi everyone as I promised you that
we are going to provide a video on smart
materials the basic intention of this
video is if you analyze 2017-18 Nate
sessions or need i'm Secours there's so
many questions related to this
particular topic called as in a smart
materials in the industry and if you go
over the basic books what we regularly
read for the preparation I don't find
much stuff and synopsis related to this
so as a team we have decided to provide
some topics relevant to the stuff which
are latest modifications but not they're
in your books so today I'll be dealing
about these smart materials so going in
detail into the smart materials what is
actually the word smart means smart is
always like reacting to the situations
reacting to the surroundings if anything
react to a situation well or react to
your surroundings well that can be
called as in a smart material record
that person can be called as a nice part
person so according to that I can simply
analyze the situation of an aspirin
because need was pre pointed 21 days and
now how well the aspirants reacted to
the change is called as in a smart so
such aspirins can be called as in a
smart as parents and of course these
smart aspirants can definitely end up
with a decent rank and success for the
future so going in detail into the
materials my prospect or my my point is
very clear that I will be focusing more
on am secure point rather than making
you to learn some concepts so this
session is very clear and open I want to
finish it as fast as possible such that
you will learn something probably you
may you may answer one or two tough
questions in your final exam so
basically before going into this si ACP
ok ACP is nothing but amorphous calcium
phosphate they can ask you a full form
of ACP ACP is something called as an
amorphous calcium phosphate so be before
learning that there is some concept
called as in a critical pH so what is
this critical pH the critical pH value
is five point two to five point five for
a normal
right so whenever the pH drops this
critical pH whenever the pH is less than
this critical pH means of course if it
is hitting five which is below five
point two to five point five then the
demineralization in the tooth starts the
demonization process starts when our the
ph of the saliva hits the critical ph so
this is called as an demineralization
and whenever it goes above the critical
ph the process of remineralization
starts where the calcium and the
phosphorus that are present in the
saliva will be remineralized into the
two stitches this is called as an array
mineralization and demineralization
cycle and the point where it turns to be
mineralization and it turns to
demineralization is called as an a
critical pH that is five point two to
five point five so this is a basic thing
that you have to learn before going in
detail into the smart material
particularly related to the registrate
or dentistry so ACP something like in a
biological form of hydroxyapatite please
make a note it is related to
hydroxyapatite and it can be used both
in the prevent too as well as
registrated properties and it is most
commonly used nowadays in the dental
cements adhesives pit and fissure
sealants and composites I hope you I
hope you are clear with this initial
point so the neck second important
aspect whenever it hits the critical pH
okay
its causes the demineralization and
whenever the demineralization process is
occurring this ACP CPP can be converted
into a gel like form which surrounds the
tooth structure and prevents it from the
demineralization and enhances the
remineralization that's what the basical
property of this and there are many many
modifications related to this one is
called as in a CPP ACP that is the most
commonly asked question what is the full
form of CPP ACP and you can directly go
over this is a kissing phosphor peptide
amorphous calcium phosphide and trade
name for this is called as an airy
calledand
okay so this is a milk product the
Kissin is a milk product making out it
is a milk product and that is CPP ACP
which is nothing but kissing phosphor
kissing phosphor peptide amorphous
calcium phosphate is also called as a
nori calledand and make a note the the
first patent rights were taken by the
school of the general Sciences at the
Melbourne in Austria
I hope you're clear and low now the
second important aspect what does this
recover and condense it recalde and it
contains a calcium and phosphorus which
helps in remineralizing the enamel okay
you know that demineralization is a
process where the calcium and phosphorus
are removed off and remineralisation is
just related to this before the calcium
and phosphorus are provided from the
saliva saliva acts as an a medium so how
this is this happened okay so you know
this is in I think this is a tooth
structure so whenever you apply this
recalde and it's going to form it the
thin cover over which it provides a
higher amount of calcium and phosphorus
by which the remineralization can be
aggravated so the peptide part of
recalde and that is casein phosphor
peptide may contain calcium and
phosphorus in amorphous and soluble form
there is more important they are present
in the soluble form
okay this CP p acp binds to the tooth
structure I have explained clearly and
to the bacterial plaque and thus provide
a soluble calcium phosphorus at a higher
concentration of the tooth surface
regularly calcium phosphorus are
provided by the saliva to the truth but
when this is applied the concentration
of the calcium and saliva on the tooth
surface will be very high will be many
times more when compared with the normal
saliva phosphate and calcium
concentration this amorphous soluble
form will enhance more remineralization
okay so I hope you know that there is
something called as in 2000 you know
tooth mousse okay so there's something
called isn't a tooth mousy and tooth
mousy plus so this is this is the other
trade name for the retardant retardant
is one of the trade name for the CPP acp
other trade name is tooth mousy and
tooth mousy please the basic difference
of the tooth Mouse and tooth mousy place
is very simple plus we'll have more
class will have extra fluoride whereas
tooth mousy is something like CPP acp
tooth mousy plus is CPP ACP plus extra
Florida okay and we are done with CPP
acp they can ask the base equations like
what is full form of ACP what is the
full form of CBP ACP what are the
mentalizing agents available in the
market that is recalde entry Catalan
tour - Tomasi what is the basic
difference between tooth mouth people
and tooth mercy place how this
discrimination treeman relation takes
place what is the product where it come
from and I mean they can ask you the
melbourne australia school these are the
max questions they can ask related to
this and this is of course a very
important thing where now the dentistry
particularly the registered industry is
moving to the remineralization process
right so they can ask questions the
second important aspect is the fluoride
releasing release of the fluoride can
also be considered as a smart behavior
of the registered material and they can
be considered a smart material so I hope
you know the basic restorative material
which releases the fluoride and what are
the benefits of this fluoride fluoride
has antimicrobial effect so the
accumulation of the plaque on the
register to material or the tooth
surface can be reduced they convert the
hydroxyapatite to Flora hydroxyapatite
and known thing and whenever initially
they have in a less release of the
fluorides initially the fluoride release
effect and substantial release of the
fluoride or a period of time and please
try to learn or all of these because the
release of the fluoride can depend upon
the external ornament because when the
external or mind changes the Florida
least changes so that's what this mod
behavior of this registrated material
clear I hope it's clear so next is about
the classification of this so this smart
material can be categorized into passive
smart material and active smart material
means passive smart material the release
of the fluoride in the oral cavities
continuous it's continuous and it does
not depends upon the an ornamental
situations it does not react whatever
may be the situation they release a
continuous flow rate supplies the
examples are the CIC comp immerse
resin-modified GAC but as the active
smart material or something like they
react to the situations when the
situation's are drastic outside there is
more flow around when their worst
outside there is less fluid and this
what happens and the examples of the
smart composite and ACP composites ACP
sir nothing but CP bacb composite with
calcium amorphous phosphate
them are called as an ACP composite so
smart composites and ACP composites are
active smart material there is passive
smart material or regular things what we
have that GIC compromise and
resin-modified G Isis so the next one is
what is not composite they can ask a
question the trade name of this smart
composite make a note smart composites
the relays fluoride Hydrox hydroxyl ions
and calcium ions whenever the pH drops
means by now the pH drops they are
reacting to the surrounding and they're
giving fluoride and this calcium and XY
jet so they are reacting according to
the surroundings so they are called as
net smart material and of course their
corners may act too smart materials and
thus they counteract the decalcification
process of enamel and dentin please
learn about the ingredients that are
present in this and this is the
comparison of the fluoride list with the
GaN component please learn about that
statement ok next one is something
called a self-healing composites a
common term nowadays we find so many
MCQs related to this self-healing
composition and what is this and what
happens in this so you know that the
composites they have and Mike they they
have an imaginal failure or they may
they may undergo impact failure so
whenever this happens like the new
innovative technique called SNA
bio-inspired
approach that helps in enhancing the
self-healing process means whenever
there is a break something is going to
release inside and it heals by itself
that's called as an a self-healing
composites make a no don't get confused
there two terms called as named
self-sealing and self-healing okay don't
get confused self-healing is amalgam
that self-sealing is a type of composite
self-healing is a type of composite
where a self-sealing material is is a
term that is given to amalgam algum is
called a self-sealing material seals by
itself because of the corrosion of the
termination products that are outcomes
of the amalgam registration where a
self-healing is a type of composite so
this self-healing type of composites the
most common questions they can ask is
about the resin matrix
it contains a catalyst they can ask you
the name of the catalyst
one it contained a microcapsules which
content be CP they can ask you the full
form of DCP they can ask you what is the
ingredient that is present in the micro
capsule they can ask the what is the
catalyst that is present in this
self-healing composites okay whenever
there is a break whenever there is a
break there will be activation of this
catalyst which is going to react with
this micro capsule and this crack is
going to resolve so this what the basic
mechanism that takes place make a node
self sealing material our amalgam
self-healing material our type of
composites they can ask you what is the
type of catalyst present in self-healing
composites they can ask you what is the
material that is present in the micro
capsule okay these are the basic
questions they can ask you and of course
when you have the self-healing property
they have a long duty cycle the clinical
performance will be definitely good so
but the basic you need to learn about
the disadvantage of this material this
is disadvantages as it has something
like micro capsule material and it has a
catalyst which has some sort of toxic
effects on the human cells but these
toxic effects are below the threshold
levels so these are the two extra points
that you need to add related to the
self-healing composites I am done next
is SDR we find many questions related to
SDR and recent papers and what is this
SDR full form of SDR is smart dentin
replacement and is the first posterior
composite material that replaces the
taint in and it was given by the dense
play so this is the basics regularly the
increments of the composite cell two
millimeters right but first self SDR you
can go for up to four millimeters okay
this call isn't it smart dentin
replacement and can be used as a base in
case of your class one class two
registrations that can ID headboard to
the enamel as well as gentle so it's
chemically compatible it is a methyl
acrylic based Universal posterior that
is used to replace the occlusal enamel
layer and completes the and completely
acts as an aid has so material it has a
high quality aesthetics and good I mean
good it it is very similar to the dentin
and it can be used for the replacement
of the Tenjin so the basic important
things are full form of SDR up to what
thickness
can be and why what if you go in detail
into the composition why it is happening
so that is more important this the it
happens because of this particular
ingredient colors in a polymerization
modulator it has a polymerization
modulator in it and which is very
comprehensive in managing the stress
distribution so that's what is this the
peculiar feature of FDR is because of
its polymerization modulator which is
going to control the polymerization and
acts as in a backbone while the
polymerization takes place okay so these
are the basic important things just go
through the slide
everything is self-explanatory so it
helps in controlling the polymerization
apart from that it helps in reducing the
stress buildup in the composite thereby
it decreases the polymerization with
this polymerization model the unique
property of this is a polymerization
modular modulator is present in this SDR
so going to the nice I feel like you
have seen the smart bears the one type
one time use and they are made of puffin
a polymer okay they are made up of a
polymer bus and the basic mechanism is I
hope you know this that the hardness
value of enamel I hope you learn this
the mcq and you know there are two types
of dentin whenever if it is it is
infected with the bacteria so they
partially demineralized that is
effective Renton and completely
demineralized or computer lady coli I
mean loss of collagen that is person
infected entity so it's very important
while you are removing the rest while
you are removing the dental care is in
the dentin I mean there few statements
like regularly we found the remove the
infected dentin leave the affected until
how it happens with that a regular perv
what we use it's difficult right so
using the smart bird because this in
fact identity and affected and then they
have a different hardness value if you
see an affected dentin affected dentin
hardness value is 70 to 90 KH whereas
infected 19 it is 0 to 30 KH and if you
go in detail and see the hardness value
of this smart but the hardness value is
50 KH clear so this
but is very simple that it's going to
remove only the infected dentin because
it's hardness value is only greater than
the infected and in what not greater
than the effective date and so it's
leave that affected dentin I need to
remove the infected dentin so thereby it
acts as an a smart behavior of the bar
so this is a smart bird made up often in
polymers the concept is basing upon the
hardness value what is the infected
engine hardness affected engine hardness
what is the hardness value of this smart
bar so these are the basic questions
that I hope you understand with which it
is made up of how it is called is in a
smart but what does it do everything so
the next is something called as in a
smart way just yeah you know regular
wedges what you do wooden wedges are
triangular wedges the basic disadvantage
of this wooden wedges and triangular I
just like whenever you keep or insert
these wedges into the embrasures while
we're going for the class to is you
frequently complained there is a fuse
bleeding in it of course
and you your patient frequently compares
there is a pain but by pressure or by
force you are going to insert that's
what you do regularly so so that is what
the disadvantage though they they they
cause some sort of gingival inflammation
or some sort of disturbance of this is
enjoyable embrasure and of course you
guys need to find something better which
is more comfortable to the patient as
well as comfortable to the biological
and ornamental just present around the
tooth structure right so very clear that
is a bio clear diamond shape which
designed to resolve the difficulties
which encounter with the traditional
wedges and of course it is inspired by
the nature and the material is a
flexible material that is that is made
into a diamond shaped cutout with the
top and this this helps in inserting
with a minimal pressure by collapsing
during the insertion means whenever you
keep a pressure it collapses inserts
--is and once it fits into the embrasure
space it relaxes and it comes its
personal form but it's called a zone of
flexibility of the material okay so if
you go into the diagram this is what the
smart diamond register it has in a flex
finger okay learn about this
not much important but they can ask a
diagram based question in your aims exam
they have an a drift handle which for
better handling and placement okay so
these these are like this flare is
generally used whenever you're planning
for a deep registration a frontal lay is
used to adapt and everything you still
try to learn the slide just have a look
there's an informative slide so they are
available in fly size okay just just
learn about it you may encounter
questions related to smart materials
they allow to ask such things new things
to the suitor students in the need as
well as in the aims and DJ so very
simple while still maintaining a strong
separation between the two tee the
flexibility of this material makes them
adapt excellently to the marginal
adaptation thereby not affecting the
gingival area are not affecting the
embrasure around the tooth structure
okay so this is what about the smart
diamond wedges so the next important
aspect is something called as an active
point we find few questions in your
recent examination in the last week and
examination you find something what is
an active parts there is some sort of
controversy regarding this active points
but please learn the term and just more
that's what I say
because there are two active points a
few people they call it an active points
or chlorhexidine points there is
something what does an act - GP okay
that comes in your monoblock whenever a
GP that is coated with the GIC around GP
coated with the CSE it's called as an
act - GP and something called as an
active points which are chlorides didn't
quoted okay
I mean of course if you could calorics
into your data par points there will be
more active bacterial and make a note
the chlorides in person that is used
here it's 5% is that simple mechanism it
acts as regular mechanism of claw
accident which is an advantage whenever
it is quoted with GP just learn about
the slide that's more than enough
next is about the smart ceramics the two
questions related to this smart ceramics
directly or indirectly in 2018 questions
according to the collection word I made
and apart from this they are one or two
more questions in 2017 so now of course
you need to give some damn importance
while we are talking about ceramics and
in specific about the smart ceramics and
aesthetics is one of the major concerns
by this ceramics came into existence of
course and you need to be more
esthetical so if you want to go for an
aesthetic registration you need to go
for all ceramic and the disadvantage of
all ceramic previously is like it
fractures so to enhance the properties
in the all ceramics the new thing that
came into existence is regularly you
found like a high-tech ceramic G
chromium is now available in the market
that's what this this high-tech ceramic
G chromium is nothing but Collison a
smart ceramic why it becomes smart
ceramic is the neat question which is
called as smart ceramic is the neat
question of course direct question smart
ceramic is the chromium and why it
happens we'll learn right now so G
craniums are nothing but a poly
crystalline ceramics that does not
contain glass you need to at this point
because they can ask mcq on this all the
atoms are packed in a regular
crystalline array okay which is more
difficult to determine the crack that is
going through and the atoms are in less
and less dense and irregular Network
found in the glasses so that's the basic
difference between the glass and the G
chromium and however these are more
tougher than stronger than the glass
beaded because they have an organized
network without any glass interface
between them okay
the next is at firing temperature there
are two phases in the G chromium
regularly at a room temperature is
monoclinic and and at the at the firing
temperature is set or agonal
so whenever the transformation occurs
from this phase to this phase there will
be increasing in the volume how much
increase that is 4.4% is the common
questions they can ask is how the phase
transformation occurs from the in the g
chronium there that's going from the
tetragonal to monoclinic and when this
happens what is the amount of volumetric
change that is four point four
percentage so these are the basic
questions they can ask about this
whenever there is a phase transformation
change of course there is a change in
the transformation phase whenever it is
stressed or whenever it is fried at
higher temperatures
so that's cause that causes an
increasing in the volume in the end
items and which prevents the crack
propagation it prevents the crack
propagation or redirects the crack
propagation by which it inhibits the
crack propagation the ceramic
registration okay
so apart from this in 1980s ceramic
engineers leads to stabilizing this
straight organelle form at room
temperature by addition of some amount
of masses of calcium and atrium cerium
okay so lower number this this slide not
that important but make a note so how
this how the process can be prevented
simple whenever there is a crack
initiation so early crack propagation
starts so about the crack propagation
starts there will be increasing the
stresses and the transformation of the
monoclinic triclinic and increasing in
the volume so whenever this volume
increases it become benefits and it's
going to shield the crack it's going to
shield the crack or prevent the crack or
redirect the crack this is the smart
behavior of the ceramics type of
ceramics which are called as energy
chronium so this resulting in the crack
closure and that's the reason by the
craniums are called in a smart material
I hope points are very clear and precise
so next is something like an S smart
coating for the dental implants there
are many questions related to this
should prevent previously in your comedy
and many other exams and of course now
they can ask ok I hope you know this so
I add on points the basically the smart
coatings are regularly not initially
used in the dental point of view they're
used in the new surgeries and now it is
preferred or more to the dental implants
ok so it's very simple that the coating
creates the crystalline layer which is
very close to the implant surface and
next is going to create create em
amorphous outer layer that touches the
surrounding bone and this amorphous
outer layer which is touching the
surrounding bone it has more calcium
more phosphorus whenever you have more
more phosphorus the bone louse it and
the bone and grazes its growth it's very
simple so the main indentation the main
indication why we are planning to go for
this smart coding is to enhance the
amorphous outer layer that touches the
bone so this amorphous outer layer is
going to provide more calcium and
phosphorus where the bone can grow so
the bone can grow into these coatings as
an amorphous layer dissolving resulting
in improved bond between the bone and
the tooth structure of the bone and the
implant that is called as Nicastro
integration and a known thing again
austria integration basic definition is
a neat 2018 I'm secure okay so please
learn about that this bond also makes
the implant more functional because
bonding and chews and enables the bone
and the impact to do a better job while
sharing the load okay
I hope it's very clear at the points are
self-explanatory just go through the
slides so what I've tried what a tried
is recently I mean they have tried
different aspects on this particularly
the most commonly used
plasma sprays they can try it they're
the most commonly used hydroxyapatite
crystals they have tried and now the
recent is moving towards something
better than this that is nothing but
Collison a silver nanoparticles okay so
they have tried the silver nanoparticles
coating onto the onto the implant
surface and the silver particles will
act as an anti microbial and in and
around this amorphous layer banaba it
amorphous layer dissolves
so you have something like in a
bacterial infection peri-implantitis
chances of getting so this silver act as
an anti microbial silver nanoparticles
not only tried here they can be tried in
the registrate of material so I hope you
know the basic advantage of the silver
nanoparticles is it has its
antimicrobial nature they're tried in
several aspects silver nanoparticles has
been tried in and around the registrate
of materials because they provide
antibacterial resistance to the
registrations and they have tried on the
implant surface to okay how the silver
reacts and how this advantageous and
everything this is a smart this can be
called a smart coating self-explanatory
please try to read it the next one is
something called a smart sutures
okay we are done with smart implants now
moving to the Smart Switches these
suture material are thermoplastic
polymers means which react to the
temperature so apart from these they
have special properties like shape
memory and biodegradable properties so
they are applied loosely in a temp in a
temporary shape and they're sutured off
whenever the temperature raises above
the thermal translation temperature I
hope you know that majority of these
surgical techniques they lead to
inflammation one or two days after right
this is simple known thing so the
temperature will hit above above the
transition temperature and then no and
are not what we generally go for a loose
knot for this smart suture middle they
shrinks and times applying an optimum
force which the blood vessels or the
suture the sutured area can withstand so
this thermal transformation temperature
is very close to the human body
temperature and that is a clinical
significance in tying a knot prior I
mean like providing less stress to the
surgical side hope it's very clear you
can see clearly at 20 degrees
temperature you can see the
differentiating line whereas at 37 and
above 41 the knot is becoming tight and
approximating the incision area or
sutured area hope hope it is very clear
right I'm moving ahead so these these
sutures they sense the surrounding and
the modifier according to the situation
well now there is inflammation the
Titans whenever the inflammation is
going off going off after after few days
it looses off and provides the
relaxation for the switching area so
that's what it tools so these suture
materials are mindless threads no more
okay they're not mindless threads they
react according to the situation because
they are provided with sums and so on
they can the sensor is added this is
something called as a smart smart so
this is the other type of smart suturing
material you have temperature sensors
and micro heaters they modify according
to the situation whenever there is the
detects the infection and
they have an infection the modify and
provide extra ingredients that are
necessary for the growth or prevention
of infection around the suturing
material around the suturing site hope
clear so the suturing material can
measure the temperature whenever there
is an increasing in the temperature the
deliver heat to the wound and which
which is known as an a which helps in
aiding the heat aiding the healing and
and a few suture material that they have
drugs on it
okay polymer coated with a drug so
whenever there is and increasing the
temperature due to the inflammation due
to the infection the drug is released
and that helps in the process of healing
or in prevention of infection so
something called as an F called as a one
more ad that is called as a smart
antimicrobial peptides okay this is this
is prepared by killing this step locust
mutant which is a principal organism
that is causing the dental caries and
the concept of the tissue regeneration
which is in the tissues can regrow in
the world cavity it's still in the
research they're still still trying to
develop
I mean dentin was tried was not not in
the not in the clinicals in order right
now but anything was tried but still
there's some researchers that are going
to develop enamel also hope hope hope
hopefully it may be the latest trend
okay if animal regenerates of course the
dentistry will end particularly
departments of endo and cons will be
closed probably it may not come into
existence so this is related to
something called a smart antimicrobial
peptides okay which applies the
advantage of this tissue engineering and
biotechnology to grow the cells that
produce the enamel dentin and the pulp
and I hope you know this particular
bre-x
gene one that is isolated along the
growth plates and which helps in
controlling the growth of the enamel
okay oh I hope you understand this basic
information related to the smart
materials which is important aspect my
focus is mainly on the have covered
