foreign
we are all aware of Python's widespread
dominance and the fact that it is easier
to learn for beginners than other
languages
automating stuff is one of the most
bizarre things you can do with python
Python's wide range of reliable
libraries usable packages and ready to
use techniques for automation makes
testing substantially simpler python is
the greatest choice for your project
because it lets you automate different
apps hey everyone and welcome to Simply

great I think we can get started so in
today's session we will go through what
is Excel after that we will see what is
Python and moving forward we will see
what is Automation and where it is used
at the end we will see a Hands-On lab
demo like how you can automate Excel
with python in detail
we already have data set with us we will
perform different function and automate
Excel data set using python before we
move on to the programming part let's
discuss what is Excel first and
importance of the same
so Microsoft developed Microsoft Excel a
spreadsheet for Windows Mac OS Android
and iOS it has calculating or Computing
capabilities graphing tools pivot table
and the Visual Basic for applications
the Microsoft Office program package
includes Excel users of Microsoft Excel
May format arrange and compute data in a
spreadsheet data analysts and other
analysts can make information easier to
examine as data is added or altered by
organizing data using tools like Excel
the boxes and excels are referred to as
cell and they are arranged in a row and
column the key features of excels are
they spreadsheet document in Ms Excel
can have headers and Footers and user
can protect their data by giving it
password protection
and the second one is filtering is
supported allowing you to locate the
necessary data in your spreadsheet and
replace it with the appropriate value
after discussing what is Excel let's go
through and see what is python so python
is the one of the most popular
programming language available today it
is widely used in various sector of
business such as programming web
development machine learning and data
science given its spreadsheet use it is
not surprising that python has surpassed
Java as a top programming language
python frequently used to create
software website and to perform data
analysis and many more because python is
a journal purple language it may use to
develop a wide range of programs and
isn't alert for any particular issues
so the key features of python are it is
open source and free
python can be downloaded from the
company official website it is simple to
download and install
python is open source because allowing
users with solid technical background to
modify the code to suit certain business
use case and product requirements since
python is a language for beginners most
anyone with the understanding of
programming can quick pick it up and
begin coding
so after seeing what is python let's
move forward and see what is automating
Excel with python
we all know python is dominant
everywhere and we also know that
compared to other language python is
beginner friendly and simpler to use
automation is the one of the coolest
thing you can do with python so how to
automate an Excel sheet in Python
imagine that you are asked to create
accounts for 30 000 employees on a
website what would you think you will
undoubtedly become frustrated carrying
out this talks manually and repeatedly
additionally it will take too much time
which is not the wise choice
so just try to picture that what it is
like for employees who work in data
entry
the responsibility is to extract the
data from tables like Excel or Google
sheet and insert it in the another
location they read various magazines and
website get the data there and they are
entered it into the database
additionally they must perform the
calculation for the entries in general
this job performance determines how much
money is made greater entry volume more
pay of course everyone wants a higher
salary in their job so however don't you
find doing the same things over and over
boring
the question is now how can I accomplish
it quickly
and how to automate my work spend an r
in coding and automating these kind of
course to make your life simpler rather
than performing these kinds of things by
hand by just writing fewer lines of
python code you can automate your
laborious activity in simpler
so overall python Excel automation is a
creative method that allows you to build
visual reports on python in a smoother
manner similar to how you would on Excel
businesses can use Python Excel
automation to streamline their operation
in accordance with their requirements
so here is one question for you guys I
will give you one minute for this you
can comment or you can give answer in
chat section so I can see the answers
are given by you are correct or not
I'm repeating again here is one question
for you guys I will give you one minute
for this you can comment or you can give
your answer in chat section so I can see
if the answers given by you are right or
wrong
so the question is which type of
programming does python support
object oriented programming structured
programming functional programming and
all of the mentioned
so I'm repeating again which type of
programming does python support
option a object oriented programming
option b structured programming
functional programming and all of the
mention
so I am starting the timer of one minute
just type your answers in comment
section or in chat section do let me
know your answers guys so like please I
want that everyone should participate in
this so I am starting the timer
so
so your time starts now
so I want that everyone should
participate in this guys please do let
me know your answer in chat section or
in comment section
so I can see if the answers given by you
are right or wrong so
like 36 seconds or more
is guys I want that everyone should
participate in this so
let me know your answers in chat section
or comment section
so you can just type the answers or a b
c d
your wish totally your wish so
10 seconds are left guys hurry up please
I want that everyone should participate
in this five second more
okay the time is over we will give reply
those who gave correct answers and those
who didn't give correct answer we will
give you a reply with the correct answer
okay so no worries
so now let's move to our programming
part to perform Excel automation using
python so first we will open command
prompt to write command to open Jupiter
notebook feature notebook
yeah
so this is the landing page of Jupiter
notebook and select open
select here new open new file
so this is how the Jupiter notebook UI
looks like so at first we will import
some major libraries of python which
will help us in importing our workbook
or worksheet so the first one is let me
first rename this
we will write Auto meeting
cell
using python
yeah sounds good
okay
so the first one is Open PI Excel open
py
Excel okay I have to write import yeah
perfect
so a python package called open pyxl can
read and write Excel 2010 xlx format
Excel SM format xltx and xltm files
it was created since there was no
library that could read and write office
open XML files natively from python
since open py Excel was initially based
on PHP Excel all praised to the PHP
Excel team so open py Excel does not by
default provide protection from your
quadratic blow up or billion laughter
XML assault install diffused XML to
protect yourself from these assaults so
we will write open py Excel and then
like
yeah
so
then we will write uh for important our
workbook so we can write here from open
p y Excel
report
workbook
code
underscore workbook
is capital here
so and this is for code for the
importing our workbook so let me write
in command like you can import workbook
like this so I can write you can import
workbook
this
okay perfect
yeah
so
here
let me import workbook then
so I have to write WB for Workbook
question
load
underscore workbook
a destination of the workbook so uh the
destination is in like desktop so I have
to write C
users
lp09
375
stop
Dash automation
that
we learn
Dot
cell SX format
okay cool
users SLP this one desktop automation
simply learn DOT xlx fine
so our workbook is loaded to Jupiter
notebook
we can see yeah perfect no error so
let's activate this workbook for the use
so we have to write WS for worksheet so
worksheet equals to WB DOT active
active
like import from openmpi Excel our
workbook there must be always been one
worksheet in a workbook it is accessible
through the workbook dot property active
so that's why we have write WB DOT
active so after making workbook active
so we will print our workbook like
we can print
so print
WS
so here
so here you can see the sheet one so it
is showing worksheet sheet1 why sheet1
because if you open your workbook and
see here is your worksheet name like
so this is my automation
file
this is simply learn
so here you can see
the shade one
that is why it is showing sheet1 there
so uh okay so let me just
finish it
so moving forward
let's change the worksheet name so
I will write here import
open
pyxl
so like it's your wish that you want to
write this import file or like this
thing this is not necessary at all so
now I will import the workbook so I will
write here
WB equals to open py Excel
dot load underscore
workbook
when pyx L it is
my bad sorry guys
so
you have to give the path so I can copy
path from here
yeah perfect
okay sounds good
yeah yeah WB underscore sheet
equals to
WB and square brackets then you have to
write the sheet name so there we have
sheet 1.
sheet 1.
so sheet1 okay correct
so I can change with WB underscore sheet
dot title
sheet
dot title
equals to
code with
simply learn
perfect
yeah seems good
let me save this
WD dot save
and the same
copy
here paste
yeah
so when a sheet is generated it
immediately receives a name like they
have sequential numbers of names like
sheet sheet1 sheet 2 and so on with the
worksheet you can modify this name
whenever you want to like using the
title property so
here let me save this
and yeah where are so again go to Simply
learn
yeah you can see code base simply learn
first it was sheet1 and now it is
changed to code base simply learn
so let me cut this again
okay
so if you want to change the color of
your sheet name tab whereas written code
will simply learn so you can write like
here
you can write
WD
or okay let me make this new one
okay right I will write here so
underscore sheet
dot sheet
underscore properties
app
color
was to
here you have to give hex
values so four zeros okay
so let me save this okay it is saying
sheet1 why sheet1 because we already
changed sheet1 to code which simply
learn so what you have to do is
here we have to write code with
simply learn
okay same same simply learn simply learn
same code code yeah so what I will do
here I will just
make W Capital so yeah
now it will work fine yeah
so
if you save or run your code like like
this let me
let me show you one thing uh like
color is already changed wait for one
minute guys I will show you something
crazy so it will see like this w
ok
so here I will small
so
if you save or run your code not
actually save but run your code while
your Excel sheet is open so my Excel
sheet is open code will simply learn
yeah
so my Excel sheet is open so it will
give you error like vital
repeat like whatever
this okay let me do one thing this is
one okay
it will give you
the brilliant one does not exist let me
check this is simply learn code will
simply learn
one
code with okw's capital there
okay see this is a
permission denied
then the location it is showing
permission denied
so this is something important to
remember that Excel file should be
closed while running the code and
repeating again so like this is
something important to remember that
Excel file should be closed while
running the code
so first what I have to do is close the
Excel file
then I have to run it again so no error
now so here you can see
what we simply learn that red color came
yeah perfect
so moving forward let's create new
workbook till we were working on the
same worksheet which was present me in
my like desktop so let's create new
workbook so for that I have to write
import
cell as X writer
so I will write here in command to
create
new notebook
WB equals to xlsx
writer
Dot
workbook
and where you want to
save the workbook so I will give
the same
path
but with different name
so this time I will give only like
coders simply
okay simply coders
then I will write WD class close
okay I will run it yeah
so the primary class export by the XLS
writer module in the workbook class and
that is only class you will need to
instantiate directly so the workbook
class represents both the whole
spreadsheet as it appears in the Excel
and the Excel file as it is stored on
the disk internally
so you can see now
yeah you can see now
the workbook which is created in the
desktop with the same name is like
simply coders
so this is done
let's move forward and let's retrieve
cell values so right now we are not
having any data inside the workbook so
let's put some random values like names
and all so uh
I will put some random values
we'll put here
names
okay
mayank
kaushal
okay
well
like jelly
Chloe
so let's save it
let's save it
and let's move to our coding part so
here what I have to write to retrieve
cells here I just write a equals to A is
variable here
so I am assigning is WS
that
A1 value the value which is presented at
A1
so here I will write in comments
like
two
retrieve cells
okay
so here I will print
print
a
okay okay
what I have to do is like we have
created this one file so it's it is not
giving
the uh this is giving sheet1 dot A1 why
because it is taking from the simply
coders one so what I can do is I can
import this file because we have saved
data in this file
so that base is here and make it active
detective yeah so yeah you know I
haven't write here value
so that is why it is giving the cell
name and that A1 name cell name A1 only
so now it will print
names why why names
because at the A1
at the A1 position we have names so if
you want to like print Anjali so what
you have to do is okay let me check this
B3 okay
if you want to print Anjali you have to
just write here just copy paste this
code
okay just right here the location
B3
so you can see Angel is printed
so this is how you can retrieve cells
and we can do the same for the others as
to
so there is one thing like retrieving
we can change the sales values too
so just we have to write here so let me
give first enter internet for the better
visual
yeah
so here what we can write is WS
like I want to change the name of uh
name of name of
uh
I will take this A4 Smith
let me close this
okay
I will give here A4
dot value
equals to here you can give the value so
here you can write Smith you can write
John
here as a replaced value
so I will write here in as a command
change
cell
value
okay
so what you have to do is just save it
WB dot save
you have to give the path for the same
yeah
fine
so let me save this and
let me save this first and run this
first okay no error and let's open our
workbooks to see the changes
so here you can see
the changes has been implemented in our
workout
first there it was like Smith and now
John so like this you can change the
cell values and let's move forward and
see how we can merge the cells in a
worksheet
so like just close this and yeah
so
we are doing for the merging cells so
here I will write from
open py Excel
dot styles
both
alignment
so here I will write
much cells
for your better understanding
okay
so here I have to write WB equals to
workbook
okay let me active this workbook
WB DOT active
merge
the cell
set which one uh let's take for a while
A1
and B2
okay A and B should be in capital
letters
so after that we have to save this
we will save in this only
so I can copy I can paste it here
okay
fine
like using merge underscore cells and
after giving cell position you can
easily merge the cell so let's see the
output so let me open this simply learn
file
you can see
Nima they are merged together and like
but what if you want the values at the
same times
so you can write here I have to cut this
so you can write here like
from open py Excel
dot styles
port
alignments
alignment a should be capital
alignment
okay
so the same thing you have to write wdb
equals to
workbook
WS equals to
WB DOT active
you don't have to give parenthesis
WS dot merge
underscore cells
cells
A1
B2
so here I have to give the cell value
equals to WS dot cell
which row which column so I can write
row equals to 1
column
equals to 1.
so cell
dot value
equals to
here you can give the value which you
want to print at the cell so here I will
write code with simply learn
okay fine so what we can do this we can
give the alignment
alignment equals to
alignment
horizontal horizontal
equals to Center
and from vertical
and from vertical the same
Center
yeah let me save this file WB dot save
at the same location so I can copy the
path from here
copy here and paste here so I will
yeah seems good let me save this
white is giving error cell object has no
attribute alignment okay alignment
spelling is wrong
sorry my bad
g and m e and t
eight seems good now
oh good to go
so
so here you can see
like by giving rho equals to one column
equals to one basically position and
after giving the value to what to print
on that cell and one more thing is
alignment like it is not necessary to
give alignments like I just wrote it to
cover it uh like in video so you can
give alignments like uh right left this
time I gave the center to print in the
center
so let's
move and see the results
so you can see the value has been
printed exactly at the center of the
cell
I will make it like this you can see
the value is printed exactly at the
center of the cell because I gave the
alignment center so let's do one more
for like
to see what is the default place if you
don't give the alignments okay if you
don't give the center alignments what is
the default value so let me first remove
this okay save no issues
okay yeah
so
we have a line
alignments
or here what we can do is like
from
when UI Excel dot styles
import
alignment
is not necessary to light import
alignments
okay this is without
okay I can write this default
leave
seems good
okay everything we have to cover from
here so I can just copy from here and
paste it here
so what we will do here we will change
the cell value we will use like C
six and B
it
sorry guys so
uh here I have to give row
equals to 6
and column must be
eight so let's make it be CS6 B6
okay let's column should be six
so code will simply learn coders of
Simply learn
orders of Simply learn like we are
giving the value so at the same time we
have to just save it WB dot save
copy
paste here
okay
so this time we are not giving the
alignments you can see here we have gave
alignments not now
so let's run this and after that we will
open our workbook
so this is saying merge cells
okay 2 must be greater than 3.
okay so here what is happening
okay I can write here D6
right
so now it will run properly I guess yeah
it's working
so
let me open this
so you can see
this is the default value of like
so here you can see the value is printed
at its default location
not in centered or not in right not in
left it is default location
so till now we know how to merge cell so
I repeat I hope you guys understand till
here if you have any questions or any
query regarding any code or question
just put as in comments our team will
shortly provide you the correct solution
so
moving forward
until now we know how to merge cells so
let's learn how to earn muscle okay so
let me open the code
yeah
let me open the code and write for you
so let me quickly write the code how we
can merge cell so we can write open
from
open
y
Excel
dot styles
you just I can copy this from here
I have to write here import alignments
alignment only
so what we are doing here we will not
give any value or any this
so here I will remove like B6
actually we can give
like a
six
P6 as a value
so let's see the cells are merged or Not
by running it
okay see permission denied because
our Excel was opened so let me save this
and close it
and turn it again no error
so
here you can see
let me Zoom if I can yeah so as you can
see A6 and B6 are merged so what should
I do to unmerge I have to write
as you can write here like
where you can write WS Dot unmerge
underscore cells
okay cells
got it
and just give this same value
A6 underscore B6
okay colon B6
let me save this again no error let me
open the file
so you can see here
A6 and B6 now unmerged
so by just using unmerged cells you can
easily unmerge the cells in your
workbook so let's move forward and see
how can you set dimensions for a
particular cell or column
so
let me close this and go to the workbook
again
this is something frustrating by like by
regularly doing the same thing going
next next next
so like you need a particular column
height should be something and which
should should be something so that is
what I'm like meant to be Dimensions so
let's write code for it you will see and
understand by seeing so
import
open p y Excel
#to set
dimensions
of a particular
cell
okay
WB equals to
open p y Excel
dot workbook
worksheet equals to
workbook DOT active
ws.row underscore dimensions
okay
one I will explain you don't worry
height
equals to
let me give 70 for a while
okay
WS dot column
underscore
dimension
wait I will explain you don't worry
don't worry
it
so let me save the file WB dot save
and let me copy the path from here
okay
everything seems
good
okay
y column okay column name is like
functional column Dimension okay
dimensions
so like one height 70 and B which is
eight
color one let me open the workbook
so here you can see
by giving row Dimension and column
Dimension and by adding height and width
then we can set the dimension for a
particular cell y1 and B for this
you can see here 1 for the column like 2
for the column three for the column let
me Zoom it
you can see now one for the all the one
column Row 2 for the two Row 3 or the
three row like this
for you can say I use one for the
particular row or you can say one for
denoting row particular Row one two
three four five six like this
chicken I repeat
and particular alphabet to denote the
column see a for this column B for this
column C for this column D for this
column like this okay
so here you can see every cell of Row
one has the same height this this this
this this this this this this
and every cell of
bit and every cell of column B has same
width
BS same width
so
like we can do one more thing we can
print
value though in a particular cells like
okay let me
close this
and open do this one
so what can I do is I can write
here
like we can write at wd's cell
rho equals to 1
comma column
equals to 1.
okay
dot value
equals to
hello
okay and WS dot cell
here I will write rho equals to 2
comma column
equals to 2
dot value
dot value
equals to
coders
so I have to write it here not below
this yeah
okay cool let me give this space line
okay so let me save this
and
let me check
so here you can see
hello is for the row one and coder at
the column B
okay fine
so let me close this and
okay next I repeat next let's see how we
can move data to a particular row or
column or you can say a particular cell
here we need data to make it move so
let's fill some random data
on it so what I can do is
I can put some random data
of like
fruit
vegetables
and some names like Maya
jelly
above
social
oh no
and we can give like
anything is Smith
John
and Chloe
Sarah
and all right Sachin
okay
I think this much is enough so let me
save this
and yeah
so data part is done and let's move to
the this one and write import
open pyxl
so let me write here move
cell
you can say move or jump whatever you
want to say so from open p y Excel
import
workbook
command load
underscore workbook
will be equals to
load
can give the path like this yeah
C and we
okay let's make it active WS equals to
WB DOT active
of X seems good okay
so I have to move WS
dot move
score range
this is I can give okay let me see
the data first
okay I will make
unverb here
and
blank here
or here
okay
so let's see again I forgot it is B
5 and A4
B5 A4
okay
so what we can do it uh like
oh
e
five
comma like rho
plus two two
and call
V rows equals to 2 and calls equals to
so let me save this w dot save
and let me
so here what I'm doing is changing the
position of the value which is present
in the location
A4 and B5 so and moving them by you can
say the value will jump by two rows and
two columns because I gave here two rows
rows equals to 12 columns equals to 2.
so let me save this run this okay
and
so here you can see
so let me run this
and what you have to do is open this
file
yeah
so you can see A2 means one two
it comes fruit comes here and coders
come here so this is how you can move
your
coding part
I repeat so this is how you can move
these cell values so let's move forward
and
see moving forward let's see how we can
insert a row in our workbook okay so
first what I will do is
I will add some data like
name here like fruits
and something like car
and here I can like bike
okay
something here coding
okay all the data is filled and all rows
are filled by some values so here we
have no like no empty row present here
till now so what we will do is
we will insert a row
okay so what we have to write is import
open p y Excel
hashtag
insert
goes
okay
from open p
ixel
report
book
command load
underscore
load
all right
let me copy the path
see
so let me make it active
so I want to insert row
deposition to
one more row
at the position 5.
so let me save this I will copy from
here
okay
I will make like this so let me save
this no error
let's move to the workbook
you can see here Row 2 is created and
Row 5 is created with no values
so
as you can see rows are added to the
particular position or you can say the
indexes
so we have seen how we can insert the
rows let's see the deletion of the rows
so what we can write is let me open the
code
so what we can write is let me copy to
save our time
okay just delete this
so we can write
WS
dot delete
underscore
rows and which row
2 5 uh I will delete row number two
for a while
so let me save this
and run this
so you now you can see empty Row 2 is
deleted
so by using insert rows and giving them
index you can insert the row at the
index position you give and meanwhile
you can use delete underscore rows
function to delete the particular row so
moving forward let's quickly write code
for the insert column
so for inserting column
I will copy from here
yeah insert row
column
and this one is for
relating
row
okay
so I have to write here
WS
Dot
active not active sorry insert
calls add the position second
okay at the position one and
okay I will make it
insert
calls at the position three
okay
let me save this file by copying this
part
okay saving let me do one thing
yeah perfect
so let me open the workbook
so here what I've done is insert call at
second position here we can't give
alphabet we have to give a number for
denoting a position so
as you can see the column is added at
the position one and three
so by using insert underscore calls and
by giving index you can insert column in
your workbook
so let's do one thing guys
okay first let me close this and yeah
so what I was saying that let's do one
thing guys
you will tell me how can I delete a
particular column
okay let me write here
the question
comments like
how
can
you
delete a
particular
particular
column
okay
I'm giving you one minute for this just
comment the code for this column
deletion or else you can reply on chat
it will suggest you to write a comment
because after this session our team can
easily check who gave the correct answer
and who didn't give the correct answer
don't worry I will provide you the
answers at the end of the session or our
team will reply at your comment at the
same time
so uh like for those who are watching
this video like we watch normal video
means you are not watching the live
session so what you can do is just pause
the video right now and put the comment
how you can delete the column
I am repeating again I will suggest you
to write a comment because after this
session our team can easily check who
gave the correct answer and who didn't
give the correct answer
don't worry I will provide you the
answer at the same time
or our team will reply at your comment
at the same time
and those who are watching the video
like we watch normal video
so that you can do is just you can pause
this video and put the comment how you
can delete the column
so I guess time is up guys I hope most
of you gave the correct answers by
putting comments we will verify your
comments and we will back to you soon so
okay moving forward let's see how we can
style the font in Excel
okay this is something crazy and
interesting
so you will not get bored and writing
from open py Excel
dot styles
import
font
so here I will write for your styling
okay
so what I can do is like WB is equals to
open
p y Excel dot workbook
blue s dot
equals to WB DOT active
I will don't worry I will explain you
rho equals to 1
comma column
equals to 1 equals to
um relearn
yeah
and I will set the size of the cell
so WS equals to
sell
row equals to
1
comma
column
equals to one
Dot
value
okay here I have to write font
equals to
font
equals to
font and you have to write size
equals to 24.
okay here I have to give
dot value
now we can do it for the many others
but we will do it
we will
change
hello
not world again we will write coder
hello coders and
we will add code with
simply learn
and here we will write
hello YouTube
yeah
so
what I will do is like it will
two column two row two
two here
what I will do is font size equals to
24 and and I will make it italic
question
Pro
okay fine and I will make it
old
only question true
and here I will give
three
three
okay and at the end what I can do is
okay bye
Thanks new
come on
so let me save it quickly
WB dot save
with a fart
so let's run this and see the results
so let's run this again one more time
so here what I did is just gave the
particular row and column value where we
want to print the value like simply
learn hello coders hello YouTube code
which simply learn
okay and by using font I am giving the
font size and phone like italic board
and so on like this is italic this is
bold
okay and here you can see at the End by
using name here you can see
at the End by using name
we are assigning the styles of the
particular text like Times New Roman and
you can give the name of your choice
so why it is not because
I have gave the it is collapsing
so here I have write 444 okay now it
will it is collapsing now hello YouTubes
and simply learn
so what I will do is now I will run
now you can see
yeah perfect
so this is simple one this is it in
italic this is in bold and this hello
YouTube is in Times New Roman Style
okay
so okay let's move forward and do
something with cells
um like what we can do it let's do color
them okay
let's add code for this
how we can like color a particular cell
we know how to color the particular tab
of sheet
and now let's color it so we can write
as import
open py Excel
here I will write coloring
particular
cell
okay
so I will first copy this thing here
from here
okay I don't think I want this I have to
write from open
UI Excel
port
and fill
I want something like this
okay so WD dot open py Excel workbook
here I can write open pyxl
dot load workbook
okay
workbook
and here I will give the path
yeah it seems good
so what I will do is
make it active and I can write here WS
equals to
WB
square brackets then I can write a name
of working sheet
I don't remember
only sheet
sheet
so we can write a fill underscore cell
equals to pattern
will
ATT pattern
type should be I will prefer solid
okay
and
comma
FG color
foreground color equals to
I will write here f
c 2 C
0 3 okay
fine we can make four cells
four cells
four cells are enough I guess
so we can write here cell one
paste copy paste copy paste so we'll
four
three
two
solid solid solid yeah
so let's change color we can give zero
three
FC
F4
here I will give
uh three five FC 0 3.
perfect
here I can give
o f c
a 0 3.
so now let me assign
let me assign the cells to them WS
like
you can assign a
a one
sign A2
dot fill
equals to
fill
let's go cell
KR
ill
underscore cell one
foreign
let me save this so I will copy from
here
why error permission denied because it
was open so let me cut this
so let me see
so here I'm using the pattern field to
fill the color and solid style and
giving the FG color like foreground
color
and at the below you can see I'm like
assigning these cells to a particular
pattern field cells so
let's see the output yeah it's working
here you can see the results we colored
these for the particular cell like A2 A3
A4 A5
so this is something you can style the
color so let's move forward and see how
we can import the image in our workbook
like something here something here
something here let's see
so let me first cut this okay
let me do one more thing yeah perfect
coloring particular cell
so how we can import
our file or image you can say
so I will write
from
open p y Excel
oath
load underscore workbook
okay load underscore workbook load
underscore workbook
and
I have to write half from
open p by Excel
dot drawing
dot image
import image
okay fine
workbook
write w d equals to
load underscore
workbook
okay
let me copy this and this hole
so logo is for
variable used for the match image
okay so I don't have an image for right
now
let me do one thing
uh let me import one image
any kind of image for a while so I can
do like
so this is my image
what can I do is
what can I do is I can give the path
like
uh
path would be same
path would be same
we will change here something don't
worry don't worry
next stop
don't remember name of the file this is
picture two
yeah
piece is smaller capital
p is capital so I have to write
picture
2 dot PNG
so
I will give logo
dot height equals to 150
logo
dot width
equals to
150 a bit of resizing to not fill the
whole spreadsheet with the logo
so that's why just for that so WS dot at
image
to logo
comma
cell in which cell you want to print I
will M two
fine
so here we will
save it
by using this one
okay perfect
cannot image import name image from
mobile file doing this one
so might be there is problem
open p y Excel Dot
drawing
dot image
okay
import image
I think I is capital here
James
logo image okay ice Capital here
yeah it seems good
yeah here is the picture so what I do is
what can I do is
so here we need one more Library drawing
image a variable logo this one
is for the location of the image and
giving and height and weight because a
bit of resizing to not fill the whole
spreadsheet with a logo like with the
whole spreadsheet with the logo so just
a bit of resizing
and add image function is used to append
image on it and M2 is for like this M2
M2 is for position m
2 like that it's for in which cell you
want to append it so
image is is coming to the particular
index M2
okay
so this is how you can import image and
Excel using python okay let's move
forward and see how we can import date
and time so let's add code for that
quickly
okay
so what I will do is I will write here
import
date time
travel right
date
time
from
open py Excel
import
workbook
both
name
so what can I do is
make it WP equals to
workbook
low should be Capital here
and WS equals to WB
DOT active
so what can I write is Ws dot cell
row 1
comma column
goes to 1
dot value
equals to
date
and time
it's something
so I can copy it
paste it
what I can do is
let me first change the
three
oh
equals to 3.
okay
value
so here I can assign date and time
date
time dot date time dot now
Dot string
format strf
time
what you have to write it percent y
percent M for month
percent D for days
percent h
then percent
I am for minutes and percent
against
so this should be
in between this
okay
yeah but
so let me save this
close it
import date time not date time it's date
time
okay row equals to one
data time not date time
again
date time dot now
a Time Dot date time
so daytime objects has no attribute strf
time okay time it is yeah
okay yeah
finally it's working no errors
so air like okay
so here I have imported some libraries
like date time and so on strf time used
for string formatter and date time now
used for the current date time this date
time now is used for the current date
time
and so let's run this and see
so here you can see the correct time and
date is coming it can be different from
your from which country you are watching
this live session
so what if you want to print the time
after like two seconds late
so for that we can write here
quickly
so I will copy this whole
p
so like
we have to copy this and just what you
have to do is
let me make for to see the difference
v v okay three are enough
so what I will do is
go four
five
okay fine what I will add here is time
dot sleep
how much second you want like two
for this one and
something for this one like
five seconds for this one
okay
so what we can do is let's save it
and let's see the results
so here I've used the time dot slave
function given parameter as two or four
I guess five operating the seconds
difference
so here you can see the difference in
seconds okay the time is not coming wait
wait let me check
sorry guys
now I have to run it open it
and it is not coming why so
shouldn't denied
okay
let me run it again
okay okay because I am giving seconds
difference not that way that is why is
giving permission denied so let us wait
for two five five seconds
okay I think five seconds are over
now we can open it
yeah you can see 47 seconds and 49s two
second difference and 49 54 5 Second
difference
so here I've used the time slip function
given parameter as 25 for printing the
second different
so let's move to the workbook
repeat here you can see the difference
in seconds so I hope you understand till
here if you have any questions or any
query regarding any code or question
just put as in comment our team will
shortly provide you the correct solution
I'm repeating again I hope you
understand till here if you have any
questions or any doubt
or any query regarding any code or
whatever it is so just put as in
comments or our team will shortly
provide you the correct solution
so moving forward
moving forward let's see how we can add
values as an array
okay
so what I will write import
xlsx
writer
WB
equals to xlsx
writer Dot
workbook
okay I will give the path
from here
okay WS equals to
WB dot at
worksheet
W should not be Capital here
okay so what I will do is rho equals to
0
and column equals to zero
okay so I will write here uh
data
equals to
and take us the names just names
we
just random names they are
above let's take
one more
so for
atom
and data
and WS
dot right
I will explain you line by line don't
worry
rho comma
column
comma item
perfect so here what I will do is rho
plus equals to 1 or you can write rho
equals to rho plus 1
w b Dot
close
okay
let's save this
let's see our data is appended or not
okay first I will explain this code to
you
so here I have created one new workbook
like name
no I haven't created so let me create
two
okay
example
okay
so I will run this yeah perfect so yeah
I repeat so here I have created one new
workbook name example
so at row 0 column 0 I am printing my
content values
like for data values using for loop I am
moving to the next iteration of the
values like from undue to core shoe and
then mayank then so on
so let's see the results
okay
yeah
so here you can see all the values are
printed so using these chords of line
you can do things like this easily
so as we know how to write multiple
values at the same time what if if you
want to retrieve values of a particular
row or column so for that we need
so we need data for that so let me add
the full data
of let me
copy some data from somewhere
so just give me a minute
okay
it's the blank worksheet
let me give me one minute guys
okay what I will take is
this one
I can take this
some values we can copy like 50 values
okay
50 is high enough
see
yeah
yeah
we have data now
yeah
you have data in the simply learn okay
now we can write code for that like how
to retrieve multiple column
so the same
font
see
let's do WB
DOT active
okay
WS
a question
WB
spreadsheet
column
in worksheet
a
okay
so what I have to do is just print
column values
column dot value
I hope it will work uh
WB DOT active
workbook object has no attribute active
okay let me see
okay sorry
import open p y Excel
XLS writer is used for
to create new workbook okay open p y
Excel
dot load
underscore workbook
now it will work I guess
still it is not working
out
it should work I guess
open pyxl
open by Excel dot load okay okay sorry
my bad here Dot
now it will work okay sheet
too much this is sheet one
you never know
when the sheet will create
sheet one
yeah
you can see all the list of column A is
printed here
all the 50 values and you can match from
here to
all the 50s values okay Trail Travis
Scott
so let me match this
got okay
so
I hope you understand till here if you
have any questions or any query
regarding any code so just put as in
comment or our team will shortly provide
you the correct solution after doing
importing exporting the values and all
let's perform some basic operation like
addition average and all okay
so first we will start with the addition
so I will write here so we need data in
workbook for the addition
so let's take some data from
from which set
the same install data set
so I will take this
this
values are enough
okay
copy it
and let me paste here
so what data we have let's code for it
we have to write here import
open p y Excel
we are doing sum of columns
not column column values values
yeah
like from open
p y Excel import
book
comma load underscore workbook
so WB equals to load
underscore
a note workbook
workbook
copy the path
a
so I will make it active
so here what I'm doing is
I will tell you shortly
so it is in C I guess CRP
which column
of P
oh B 50
one I guess yeah
P51
B should be capital
equals to
see carefully what I'm doing like sum
B one
one
till
B I guess 50 values we have 50.
okay B should be Capital my bad sorry
okay this is what I'm doing and
WDS dot save
the same one
so here I have added all the values
which are between in the range of B1 to
B 50.
and what I'm doing is the result will be
displayed on the b51 cell okay so let's
run this code
okay
let's go to the b51
yeah result is coming for verifying the
result is correct or not I won't use
calculator
for this so we can use
this code for the same for average
product and count so let's
do it quickly
okay so let me just copy paste this
stuff
c v this is will be for
average
a spelling mistake average
okay what I will do is just write
Capital heavy
Bridge here okay and I will print it to
50
2.
okay code is almost same just one chain
like you have to write instead of sum
you have to write average
there
and just okay
let's see then
so now you can see this is the 137 point
something something is the average of
these all values
everything look good
let's see the count
quickly let's
be
what is almost same just we have to
okay capital
fifty three
visible okay
this count will give you how many values
are there between the range till 1 to
50. so let's check let's run it again
and check
if it's working or not yeah 49 values
okay
so
what I'm planning is let's do one thing
now guys uh you will tell me how I can
find the product of a particular range
I'm writing question as a command as I
did before
so
how to
okay
okay
how to find
product
of numbers
like where
yeah
at the range is between
a A2 to a 98
okay
so I'm
giving you one minute for this just
comment the code for this like
multiplication or else you can reply on
chat you can write just syntax only for
the product
I will suggest you to write a comment
because after this session our team can
easily check who gave the correct answer
and who didn't give the correct answer
don't worry I will provide the answers
at the end of this session or our team
will reply at your comment at the same
time
and those who are watching the video
like we watch normal video or you are
not attending the live session so you
can just pause this video and comment on
how we can find the product in Excel
using python
I am repeating again I will suggest you
to write a comment because after this
session our team can easily check who
gave the correct answer and who didn't
give the correct answer don't worry I
will provide you the answers at the end
of this session or our team will reply
at your comment at the same time
those who are watching this video like
we used to watch normal videos uh so
what you can do is just pause this video
and comment on how we can find the
product in Excel using python
so I guess time is up guys I hope most
of you gave the correct answer by
putting comments we will verify your
comments and we will back to you soon
so moving at the last
of this session let's do something with
charts so what I will do is first I will
move it bit up
yeah
so let me write code for that for the
chart
so I will write from open
p y Excel
import
workbook
um
open p y Excel
dot chart
import
reference
comma
line chart
okay we will create line chart WB equals
to workbook
WS it equals to
workbook DOT active
so after this I will set the chart title
title equals chart
okay
let me create these rows so rows equals
to
uh what I will do is
I will create something like
um
X
okay comma
uh
sale
comma
veggiesel
yes
Oma
not here
mama
and I have to give the values weeks are
Monday
okay let me keep this same
what cell should be like 100
comma 200
Tuesday
comma 300
Wednesday
300
comma 400
but
the Thursday
I'm a 400
or 20 30.
a
untie
comma
at the day
60 comma 30.
okay it seems good
let me do
like four
s
okay Row in rows
blue s dot append
Pro
values
equals to
reference
WS comma min
call
s to 2 comma Main
rho equals to 1
comma Max
column equals to 3
comma Max
underscore row equals to 7.
okay it seems good okay x dot values
equals to
reference
the score string
equals to
chart
A2
A7
so chart equals to line chart we are
making
so let's add the data to line chart
object
chart
dot add underscore data
values
command titles
t i t
t i t l e s titles
underscore from underscore data
construct row
okay
it should be capital
so let's set x axis
chart dot set
categories
X underscore values
okay let's set chart
Dot
let's go
tails
chart Dot
access
l equals to
weeks
and chart
dot y
axis
dot title
equals to
put
and
veggies
sales
chart dot Legend
dot position
equals to B
okay
so WS dot add
underscore chart
comma
H1 cell
so WB okay let me copy this code from
here
so here I am importing reference and
charts Library like this reference and
charts Library
and just giving title as charts you can
see here chart
so rows are the data from which we will
make chart
and for Loop is to append the data on
the workbook
chart add data chart add data
values titles from data equals to true
this is for adding data to the line
chart object just giving the title X
action and y axis
and all so let's save this and see
whether chart is visible or not
let's save this
okay what is going cannot import name
reference from open file
reference okay let me see
error in line two error in line two
okay sorry my bad okay
now it will workbook
forward number okay W should be capital
should be Capital now it will work I
guess
again that's reference
okay
stored values
dot my bad
h a r t
c h a r t
dot save okay WB Dot
okay finally no errors
so let's save this and see whether chart
is visible or not
let me go to this simply learn
yeah you can see chart is coming and it
is it's looks so good I hope you guys
must have understood the concept of
automating excel with python if you have
any queries or doubt you can ask them in
comment section hello everyone and
welcome to this session
on python projects and today we are
going to discuss about how to send
emails using python
so we will see the piece of code in our
jupyter notebook that how can we
leverage python as a programming
language to connect
with SMTP server email servers and send
emails
to the desired recipient simple emails
emails with attachment Etc so we will
see with certain examples
now before we move ahead just make sure
that whatever email ID we are going to
use for sending emails so we are going
to use our Gmail so make sure in your
Gmail
you have allowed less secure app access
and that's after this
if you have enabled this after that only
you will be able to send email using
python so please make sure that you have
enabled this less secure app access
okay
so we are going to use our Gmail account
as an example so that's why we are doing
this
now let's
start
so first of all you have to import
the relevant python Library which is the
SMTP lib and SSA Library okay
and then you need to mention the sender
email and the password
of your email ID
then provide the details of the
receivers whom all you want to send the
email okay
then we will
enter the details of the email body the
data which we want to send in an email
to the receiver now coming to
connectivity with the email server now
at this point we are utilizing this
utility SSL to create a context and
after this we will make connection with
the Gmail server and by default the SSL
Gmail server is running on Port 465
then we will login
and then send an email
okay so we need to connect to the
Gmail's SMTP outgoing mail server then
we need to provide the login information
and then send email so now when I will
execute this point
now I will try to check
my inbox and if you can see there is an
email which I have received just now
that and which has this is the content
this email is sent using Python and
subject is mail from Simply learn so
this is the
it's very simple piece of code which
allows you to send email from your
python code now let's take a look at
another example where we will try to
send email in an HTML body right
okay so similarly we will start by
importing SMTP lab and SSL
but also we will add two new libraries
which is mine text and multi-part now
because we are trying to send uh email
in a HTML body part so I'm going to
provide the email addresses of the
sender and the receiver so I'm going to
send email to myself
I'll take my password as an input
now I have to provide the multi my
multi-part which I'm going to provide as
alternative subject as anything which
you can put multipart test sender email
in the receiver email
now I am creating a text and an HTML
body part
so this is an HTML body which will go in
my email
now I am creating two variables one in
which I'm defining my text part which is
text plane and another part I am adding
my HTML which is I am tagging as HTML
now you attach both part one
and part two
in the message
okay so now your message has both text
and the HTML
now thereafter
you have to create the same connectivity
with your SMTP Gmail
login
and then you have provided the details
of the sender and the receiver now you
have to apply message dot as underscore
string so now this is the sub this is
the difference from a previous example
where now you have encapsulated the HTML
in the text part encapsulated in a
message and then you are converting into
a string and sending
now now I have received an email
multi-part test if you see this is an
HTML body
where I have kept this as a header and
this as a plain text we are sending
email using python so if you see this
has come in bold as a header and this
has come as a plain text
okay
now another important aspect any email
generally you also need flexibility to
add an attachment to it okay so right
now what we have done is we have just
created the email body in a different
style earlier we had a plain text now
here we uh created the body in HTML now
we want to attachment
so what we'll do is we'll say import
email SMTP lab SSL
now you have to import packages of
encoders mime base my multi-part and
mime text
foreign
attachment from python this is my
subject
this is an email with attachment sent
from python this is the body sender and
receivable in email and password
now I'll put all these variables
encapsulate in a message which is my
multi-part okay the from details the two
details subject and the receiver email
now I'm gonna attach the body
and now I'm going to define the name of
the file which I want to attach now make
sure like I'm running this python script
from my
folder
you see Drive
users parijay and in this folder I have
a document called document.pdf which I
have kept it already so you make sure
that the document is lying in the same
folder from where you're running the
script
and then you have to
open the file attach the file to the
payload in octet stream
then you need to encode it in the base64
okay and then add header content
description with the file attachment and
the file name this is essential
then at this part now your part is ready
you have encapsulated the entire
attachment in the part and you've
attached that part to the message
convert the message as string
now you are at a point of creating
connection with the SMTP server
sender email receiver email and the text
part
and you need to send it
now if you go to your email this is the
document PDF which has come as an
attachment and you received it
so we have seen three variations of how
you can send email from python one
same plain simple vanilla email with
simple text
second you are sending email with HTML
body where you can use the HTML tags
third sending email with attachment
the common part between all the three
parts is that you need to create a
connectivity with the SMTP server
okay
and uh provide your credentials of the
sender email
and the data which you want to send in
the attachment
in other two cases where you were
sending HTML body we used mind text and
mind multipart and in the attachment
part we use my base as an extra Library
which we are supposed to use in order to
send an attachment hello everyone today
we are here to discuss a project on
Python and how python can be used to
invoke and send messages in WhatsApp
so what we are going to today do is
we're gonna demonstrate you how to use
Pi watt kit it's a python utility which
is available in order for you to
interact directly with the pi Python and
WhatsApp
so we will show you certain examples
using which you can directly interface
with your WhatsApp now in order to
perform this activity first you need to
go to your python installation folder
now in my case I have my python
installed in my app data local programs
python python310
so your first task is to go and open a
command prompt from this folder
and then you need to install pip install
by what kit so under python310 there is
a folder script
and you paste this command
and you should get this particular
message if you have already installed
piwotkit if not then python will install
the relevant
library in your computer
after you have done this then
go back to your python root folder
go to the python terminal
and then run the command import Pi what
kit
okay so after you have installed the
pivotkit library then you need to import
the pivot kit and this message should be
successfully imported
now I want to send a WhatsApp message
to a phone number
and I want to send it at a particular
time so right now I'll just set the time
as 20 38.
and please make sure that you are
already logged in to your
web.whatsapp.com and so that you know uh
the when python tries to send a message
you are already pre-logged in okay
foreign
so now if you see with this message with
this API I'm going to send the message
at 8 39 so this will go and open the
WhatsApp window in next 46 seconds and
after 20 seconds the message will be
delivered so 8 39 so when the timer in
my system clock will reach to this
particular time
python will open a WhatsApp window log
into that reach to this phone number
which is there in my WhatsApp contacts
and then after 20 seconds this message
will be delivered so let's just wait for
a few seconds and wait for python to
perform that activity
yes now python has opened the
web.whatsapp.com in which I'm already
logged in it has reached out to that
number and type the message welcome to
Simply learn world and I can send this
message
now let's move on to the another example
if I want to send a message to a
WhatsApp group then you need a WhatsApp
group chat ID and the message you want
to send so now in order to send a
message to the WhatsApp group you can
pick any
WhatsApp group in which you are
administrator
go to the group info
and
click invite to group via a link
and in this link copy
copy this part copy link go to notepad
just copy this part this is the group ID
okay and paste it over here
okay
so now you can
send message to a group
copy paste this
in your command prompt
set the timing
in 16 seconds WhatsApp will open a
window and after 30 seconds the message
will be delivered
okay so WhatsApp window is open
it will reach out to that particular
group
it will type the message
and submit it
and even it will close the window
automatically now okay so this
particular
command has typed the message submitted
it and closed the window
now if you want to send the WhatsApp
message instantly
you just
use the API send what's message
instantly
and it will send it instantly to the
user
now another utility is that if you want
to
find a keyword
on YouTube
so we'll just play
on YouTube Simply learn on YouTube so
it will automatically play the YouTube
channel which you have put in that
particular keyword on the YouTube so
python can also directly open a YouTube
url
or if you want to do a Google search
here you go so as soon as you put that
command on the python console it will
open google.com and search it
so with that we have come to the end of
this session I hope you guys must have
understood what makes python the best
language for automation
