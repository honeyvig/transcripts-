did you know that the plastic toys our
children play with could have over 400
different chemicals in them even
something as simple as this could be
very harmful to their health to combat
this I started an NGO called little wise
where wise stands for warriors inspiring
sustainable
Earth I've been working on this cause
for close to 3 years and the more I
worked the more it became clear to me
that I had to become financially
independent to run my NGO the way I want
the cspo certification gave me the
confidence to go out there and look for
the job that I truly deserve now that I
have a job I don't have to depend on
anybody
elsea I'm the last one in my parents'
household out of three daughters I
believe my dad had a fever when he
realized that the third one is also a
daughter as you can imagine back then in
the 1980s it was always expected that
there has to be a boy in the family my
dad and my mom embraced the new change
in their life and they moved to
Bangalore I'm so glad they did because
that kind of set a very good pace for us
to get
educated say the education of the girls
know is uh a must in our mother they
say that means there is no okay any
course or education that the girls
cannot learn if they are properly okay
given the
training when it comes to the way my mom
handled the entire uh childhood of ours
it kind of makes me feel very proud and
a lot more determin she couldn't get
access to education Beyond 8th standard
and she always used to mention that you
you should not miss out on what I am
missing

out we always think and blame that our
environment is what is stopping us from
from achieving things but it's more the
environment you create inside here
that's actually stopping you from
achieving what you
deserve doing certifications has always
been part of my professional Journey I'd
done business analysis certification i'
done scrum Master certification all this
was during my experience in UK I
returned back to India in 2020 just
before the p pmic hit I tried various
things in these 3 years and after 3
years I realized I want to get back to
my original profession when I decided to
do that I realized that my CV can look
very blank despite the number of years
of experiences and that's when I decided
to take a cspo with simply learn during
the course the instructor was very clear
on what to expect and uh how to navigate
ourselves thankfully I still had a lot
of knowledge that uh i' I'd gained over
the years I'm glad I picked it up and
that did add a lot of weightage to my
saving I taken a break of like 3 years
which uh kind of put me at a back foot
and a self-doubt if I will be able to
make it into the corporate world back
again certifications are a way of giving
you that confidence that you can and I
think uh the product owner certification
actually helped me and it is still
helping me in my new job now I'm working
as a project manager with absolute Labs
within 2 months I was promoted to a
project
manager my mom is a really powerful
person and considering the course she's
been taking lately um she managed to
dugle family life and her professional
life without them interfering with
anothers so I'm really proud of her for
doing
this as women we tend to have a lot of
self-doubt and that keeps us back there
are these thoughts that yeah I want to
get back I want to use my previous uh uh
skills to get back into the corporate
job I don't know if I will be accepted
into a corporate job am I too old to
take up any
certifications I think my answer to all
of these questions is you can if you
decide you have to
