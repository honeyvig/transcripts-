cognition Labs introduces Devon the
world's first AI software engineer Devon
isn't just your average AI tool it's a
GameChanger equally adapt at working
independently or collaborating
seamlessly with human Engineers with de
by your side engineering teams can focus
on the big picture solving complex
problems and striving for ambitious
goals deon's capabilities are nothing
short of extraordinary Deon can
independently develop a systematic plan
for software implementation manage its
own command line code editor and web
browser and even debug it code by
inserting and resolving print statements
D can recall relevant context learn from
experience and rectify mistakes it's
everything a human engineer needs to do
their best work and here's a quick info
for you guys if you want to switch
careers with a ml then try giving simply
Lars postgraduate program in a ml from
per University in collaboration with IBM
this course teaches in demand skills
such as machine learning deep learning
NLP computer vision reinforcement
learning generative AI prto engineering
chat JP and many more so don't forget to
check out the course link from the
description box and pin comments but
here's the kicker Deon actively
collaborates with you it reports on its
progress in real time accepts feedback
basey and even work through design
choices alongside you when needed now
let's bounce back to the core idea of
today's discussion let's let's hear it
from the creators of Devon and listen to
what he has to share about his latest
Innovation along with the live
demonstration hey I'm Scott from
cognition Ai and today I'm really
excited to introduce you to Devon the
first AI software engineer let me show
you an example of Devon in
action I'm going to ask Devon to
Benchmark the performance of llama and a
couple different API
providers from now on Devon is in the
driver's
seat first Devon makes a step-by-step
plan of how to tackle the
problem after that it builds a whole
project using all the same tools that a
human software engineer would use Devon
has its own command
line its own code
editor and even its own
browser in this case Devon decides to
use the browser to pull up API
documentation so that it can read up and
learn how to plug into each of these
apis here Devon runs into an unex
expected
error Deon actually decides to add a
debugging print
statement reruns the code with the
debugging print statement and then uses
the error in the logs to figure out how
to fix the
bug finally Devon decides to build and
deploy a website with full styling as
the
visualization you can see the website
here
all of this is possible today because of
the advancements that we've made in both
reasoning and long-term planning it's a
really hard problem and we've only just
started but we're super excited about
the progress that we've made so
far in the meantime if you'd like to try
out Devon on your own real world tasks
send us a request below and we'd be
happy to forward it to
Devon so after seeing the demo of Devon
does this mean software engenious jobs
are at risk well not at all Deon isn't
here to replace you it's here to help
you become even better at what you do
with de handling the nitty-gritty stuff
you can focus on the creative and
strategic aspects of coding that truly
make a difference but why is Deon such a
big deal comment down your thoughts we
