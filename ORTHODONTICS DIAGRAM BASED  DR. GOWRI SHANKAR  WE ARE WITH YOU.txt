so still are joining better to join all
of them before we start this class on
Orthodontics
so you know that the number of questions
in Orthodontics
maybe around 16 percents
these questions in Orthodontics are very
straightforward
one of the scoring subjects
in need
all right to say in any type of entrance
examination is Orthodontics right
forward questions very easy
and they are all fact-based questions
that means if you know the answer you
can answer it directly you cannot make a
guess but you cannot take a chance to
guess but it's a do and die so I always
say don't lose the marks in uh
orthodontic subject it is a very
straight subject of course and it is a
mix of I always say what is careless
cumulative reading cumulative reading or
incremental reading that means each
each clinical subject if you see in our
Dentistry is associated with some
pre-clinical subjects so likewise in
Orthodontics ours is related to
wire will study about the sequence the
eruption of the tooth and viral
pathology the number size deception of
the mechanism that cause changes in the
dentition which which is nothing but the
local etiological factors likewise the
periodontic part the interceptive
orthodontics
and these are combined together makes
the orthodontics subject orthodontic
subject we have the questions
after 16 questions four questions will
be from the diagnosis part
and four questions will be
from the appliances or mechanics part
and of this nowadays if we see for the
last six years there are nearly
20 Questions 16 to 20 questions in
between coming from in each entrance
that means almost uh five to seven
percent which carry about 80 80 percent
or 80 marks in an entrance of 720 are
from Orthodontics
so one of the things is uh some way we
take very light during our
the BDS curriculum the orthodontic
subject and of course it is very easy to
pass in Orthodontics only
and it is very easy to understand if you
know the concepts in Orthodontics
so I am not going into details on that
now
we are going to discuss the image based
questions that are given in
different entrances what can be expected
from these questions which are given
which were given already and which can
be given in future entrances that is in
2020 think the nearest examination which
you are going to
take
I think most of them have come a very
good number around 250 members and
picture based questions in Orthodontics
still
sending messages to admit
foreign
is the queen visible to you
I started sharing the screen again is it
visible
yes
thank you
and we'll start from uh basic things
that can be asked in examination
so this is the one of the questions uh I
don't know why the deducting stage is
very font for examinants
now this any question regarding the ugly
detecting stage is given showing midline
diastema and the primary canines and
asking them at what age it is a sealed
and what is the treatment of this kind
of mole occlusion that is found around
nine years and of course how do you
treat this condition how do you close
the midline diastema in a nine year old
child these are some of the questions
that are given in previous entrances so
it is very easy to recognize the
so why this is uh occurs
and this is occurs during eruption of
the canines
the permanent canines that question is
also given that
somebody is mutual please mute yourself
once yes this
this is due to the eruption of the
canine the permanent canine during the
permanent canine eruption when it is in
the alveolar bone it exits its force on
the roots roots of the lateral Engineers
so what happens this lateral is regards
the crowns becomes flared as the canines
get down they start touching the lateral
inches or strong portion now again the
lateral results were gets mutualized
this is one of the very powerful
question for examiners so don't lose and
some of the times you will absorb the
Deep bite deep bite width is a
transitional during mixed dentition
speed during the ugly duckling stage
foreign
this is called many of you may be
knowing this what is this mechanism you
can chart no problem
yes it's no treatment there is no
treatment for Ugly Duckling stage you
have to wait and watch till the yes this
is vaccinator mechanism very easy
question uh this and in examination
they have been students who have went
wrong to understand what is being given
here this is vaccinated mechanism
nothing but and the bucillator mechanism
is made up of how many muscles this is
also one of the question previously
given
yes
yes it is three models the labor overall
is and the bachelor Museum the last one
but there you go mind blur mechanism and
super reconsider of course it won't come
foreign
if you take all India PG entrants around
18 to 20 some of the questions are
particularly given on the type of forces
being examinated which force is more
either labial Force if labial force is
it upper or is it the lower how will be
the tongue pressure on the outward
thrust of the tongue pressure compared
to the upper part that is in the maxilla
and in the mandible also you can see few
questions given on that also
so can you identify you
so they have given this this question
they have asked they can ask at any
point of time they will show and you ask
you what are the pressures accepted by
the tongue on the
upper lip and what is the lip pressure
upper lip pressure and the lower lip
pressure what is the tongue pressure
exerted on the
the upper dentition and the lower
orientation also this is the one that is
given in a 2018
sorry I may be taking little bit of
chance in between admitting the students
still they are joining uh
so this is a direct pickup from uh
Profit book if we see that the forces
exerted by the both the upper lip and
lower lip are the same
or the same but the pressure exerted by
the Tongue
is more on the lower dentition remember
this point it is more on the lower point
it is less on the upper dentition
so this question was once given of
course they are given this below 5 grams
of force and they given where the forces
are less they are given a b c d of
course if we can see that the tongue
pressure on the upper dentition is very
less
and a few questions
which we can see nowadays from the
you know this what is this
this is your
Ackerman profit classification nothing
but your uh what is called as Venn
diagram and they can ask you a question
there are nine you know this is a nine
rounds or
in ackerman's profit classification
usually it is five parameters but one is
universal among all of them there are
what is called as one two three four
five and six and nine this is the ninth
one
what are these one and nine represents
where is the universal in ackerman's
profit classification what is that
Universal to all the mall occlusions
yes where it will be it is alignment
it will be one or nine
yes one alignment this this work so it
is the
this is the Ackerman profit
classification the intraorch alignment
whether it's Universal whether all the
model occlusions they exist whether a
crowding or spacing so you have to mark
this as one and Ninth is the worst of
all the conditions so it has what is
called it as transfer sagittal vertical
all mole occlusions will be there so
next we will moving to another question
which is closely related to this Venn
diagram or Ackerman profit
classification which was recently
Modified by The Profit uh this is
nothing but
so you can see that
so you know what is a cant of occlusion
if you see the previous two three years
papers they are asking about
decant of occlusion in different
directions different dimensions we have
what is called as the sagittal direction
or anterior posterior and the vertical
direction of course we have what is
called as transverse Direction in this
transfer Direction what is the cant that
relates the transverse and sagittal
plane called or you can find a cushion
like this any of these portions they can
give a question what is that that is
related to transverse and vertical what
is that that is related to the sagittal
and vertical you know what is tenth of
occlusion we are going to discuss what
is yeah what is Rule and what is pick
you should know it so
you have one what is two and three there
are so many options here what is two and
what is three
what is three
yes
very nice so you are very well prepared
for a new Tech Zone
yes yes yes exactly correct the one is
yeah
another is
the role and the trees
the pitch
so I asked my students to remember like
this
the first word of uh yeah is yawning
yarning that means widely opening the
mouth when you yawn
you open the mouth
so I asked them to remember you see the
yeah
when the mouth is opening whether there
is shift in the transverse
can you see
plus due to this shift there is
disturbance in the transfers
one side caused by dirt develops another
side there is disturbance in the
anterior posterior relation also one
side the mandible comes forward
this is called Ya that's why I have to
remember yeah how the second one is role
I ask them to remember right and left or
for R the vertical relationship the
change in the vertical relationship
between the right and left so one side
down one side up so vertical
relationship the rule
so what happens is it is vertical Mall
relationship it causes a transverse
disturbance also one side the teeth goes
inside and the teeth comes outside at
the same time roll is what is nothing
but one side up and down right and left
disturbances remember that the right and
left disturbances in the height is
called as roll and Pitch how I remember
is Cricket pitch you start bowling from
this end to that end from anterior to
posterior or posterior to end that's why
I remember P or posterior anterior
posterior or sagittal Direction it is
the pitch the occlusion can till the
pitch in anterior posterior Direction
what happens this is nothing but either
the anterior teeth come down or the
posterior teeth come down this is called
as pitch and this is called as your role
the left and right up and down and yeah
this is called as ya Yani and ya is a
dynamic whereas whether the other tool
the role in Pitch you can see in a
static relationship this is one of the
very important questions almost all from
2016 to 2000 reason 2021 every paper is
having one question on this concept
and many of you answered as it is uh
yeah Roland pitch answers
yeah Roland pitch so I'll put in another
way how the question this question may
be asked so they can point out at any
point of time and they will give you not
only picture based uh the question they
may ask what is that uh that is seen in
vertical relation when there is
disturbance in transfers and the
sagittal along the transverse and
sagittal
guidelines or place
so this is so this question also you may
get now you can clearly understand this
is what is called as your
can you identify now one two three
instead of me telling you see here the
patient is vertical axis there is
anterior posterior disturbance here the
patient is trying to two
this side and that side and three this
side along the transverse axis front and
back
of course what is one here
one one is yeah it won't it won't change
yeah of course this side it is moving to
the patients
left side this side patient is moving so
this is yeah what is this this is moving
your
this is your transverse plane it is
moving this side and that side so it is
nothing but your role so you can see
this this is an sagittal axis around
sagittal axis you are moving either
front or back this is nothing but your
pitch okay good many of you are able to
I know oh yeah why I'm stressing all
these kind of questions is most of the
times they are given from uh Profit book
or Grabber and this book
foreign
one minute
yes
so this is nothing but what we have uh
discussed so remember just what I told
right and left deviations front and back
deviations yeah when opening whether it
is deflected to this side or that side
foreign
now can you tell identify the cant of
occlusions in this diagram
what is a here
a
B
B
yes yes
yeah he is definitely
pitch you are correct what is B here
what is happening in b
B can you see that
this is called as aesthetic line what is
this static line and his static line is
the line joining the
integral surfaces and the cusp tips of
all anterior and posterior teeth
so this is called as your lip line lip
Line This is called as lip line and this
is called as your histatic line what
happening into the figure a
you can see there is pitch
so what what type of pitch is there is
the anterior more seen or posterior
motion
they won't go that much deep but there
is definite pitch because you can see
the amount of exposure there is
difference between the posteriorated
teeth and anterior teeth if anterior
teeth is more seen anterior gums are
more seen you call it as a anteriorly
anteriorly downwards picture anterior
pitch
anterior pitch likewise what is here if
you can see that
the right and left side
what is happening to the left of the
patient
the right side has come down the
left side has gone up this is called as
the roll down towards right side
this is called as roll down to
that's right so what is happening here
here patient is trying to open the mouth
patient is trying to open the mouth the
c c part time mask now we have moved to
the C part I am able to see your charts
no problem interact you are very well
interacting it is called as yeah it is
called as yeah the patient is
you can see it is deviating the jaw
towards the left the right side of the
patient so what happens when here we
have the crossbite here we have
a
buccal cross bite here you have
developed the parallel crossbite at the
same time this side mandible moves
forward that's why ya is seen in
vertical Direction along a transverse
axis and it results in anterior
posterior disturbance also
I am a minute
I should download again
so we'll move to the next
so this is what we have
discuss so remember if the decline
and the line lip line and you can easily
differentiate between a pitch roll and
yeah what are the two directions what
are the two planes that it is seen and
in which direction it is seen you can
remember this very easily
foreign
if you can clearly see this this patient
is also having role besides role this
patient is clearly having the role also
because here you can see the more amount
of gum seal in the posterior region and
less in the anterior region so he is
having pitch apart from the pitch you
can see there is disturbance between the
left and right side so they don't go
they want to ask both either they will
ask picture role for your clarification
I have put what is called as aesthetic
line in what is called as lip line
so next comes uh this is also seems to
be one of the favorite questions of all
orthodontist uh right from your
undergraduate days uh you remember what
is this I am speaking to
what is this
yes
scam and skills
hmm
so they may give you a question they may
point out somewhere and ask you which
tissue completes growth first
and of course I'll come from that what
is this tissue that shows the regression
or negative growth yes it is lymphoid
tissue and you can see a flat thing
occurs here what is the tissue that
shows the flat the flat if they put in
other way you will answer what is the
tissue that completes the growth first
if they point out this and us they will
usually you
you can answer yes it is neural tissue
but they won't ask you that much right
what is the tissue that shows a plateau
right from the five years of age five
years of age that means around 95
percent of the growth is completed by
six years of uh age and only
and only
you can see
90 99 by the age of 9 to 10 years then
only one percent of
growth attackers after this
and
the tissue which is showing is the
regression is the lymphoid tissue it
grows 202 percent of its side and of
course after puberty decreases less than
the 100 percent of it what is it having
original before this peak growth and
they may put you another what is that
this shows s-shaped growth s-shaped
growth
yes general or somatic tissue
yeah
okay
one meter I'm admitting again please
mute your phone sir the mistake if I am
not activating some of your phones are
active
okay
so this is nothing but your uh you can
expect question is there a picture based
question or you can expect a direct
question
up to 10 years of age this is very
direct question you can answer
don't go wrong here
and recently I have found in one of the
state entrances not now before neet was
introduced in
2013 or 17.
so which of the following determines the
maxillomandibular relations in predicted
period we know that our molar dictates
the maxillomandibular relationship in
likewise they ask
what is that that besides
yes
many of you are very active and correct
so
in transverse Direction I will put it in
another way you can answer it what is
the transfer small relationship seen
during predicted period
transverse Direction
I will check
anterior open bite is an anterior
direction anterior weapon right
definitely there will be anterior open
bite
what type of cross bite
no it is not cross bike it is somewhat
like cross bike
but it is complete by complete by just
like a scene similar to your Cedar's
bite so whole of the mandible or
dentition is overlapped by the maxillary
arch in all the dimensions in all the
dimensions whether it's in anterior
posterior or in transverse Direction so
normally what we have is only one cusp
of overlap in permanent Edition whereas
what happens in predated period is the
entire mandible or arch in transverse
direction is overlapped by the approach
of course you have told it correct there
will be over yet there will be open bite
and it is the lateral sulky between the
upper and lower gum pads that decides a
relationship usually no classic
condition will be seen in
what is the common malocclusion in
sagittal direction that is seen is class
1 Class 2 or class 3 that is seen in a
predated period
yes yes yes it is class two it is class
two why a Class 2 relationship is still
why a Class 2 relationship we still
why why why why why it is class two
relation yes it is the recruited
mandible it is not actually retroagnetic
mandible it has not become retroagnetic
it is small size or mandible again you
go to your basic cephalo chordal
gradient of growth so during
the active phase of growth ketchups and
the mandible gets corrected by itself
you will not do any treatment for this
this is a self-correcting anomaly very
good this also question once asked why a
child looks a Class 2 relationship in a
actively growing children so up to the
puberty you cannot correct up to the the
pubertal growth choice you should not
correct a Class 2 condition if the
patient is actively growing
now this also a favorite topic for your
examiners 2018 19 and 20 one way the
other they have put it
can you identify
a different class 2 relationship occurs
from which of these conditions ABC
no no no question
so what is the question was one minute
one minute
I'm able to not see myself so
so which of the following gives rise to
definite Class 2 relationship in
permanent indentition which of that
yes digital step okay we know this this
but what is it where is distance here
you should be able to identify the
digital step so here the fresh terminal
plane at a medial depth yes all of you
are correct it is c c digital step here
the digital step refers to the step that
is created by
foreign
so
what has gone here
compared to the upper e the lower e is
little bit distal that means clearly
indicating that maxilla dentition is
ahead we know that the Maxwell life
dentition is the head it is a Class 2
condition here
we can tease
the lawyer
is a head of
the upper e towards visual side that is
called as Mutual step here we have
called it as the plush terminal plane
somebody are talking please please
shall come again
yes
please please mute your phone sir
[Music]
please mute your phones I'm trying to
mute you all okay foreign
which of the following usually does not
lead to a Class 1 relationship I have
put it in another way
which molar relationship is seen in
mixed dentition period for diagnosis I'm
not able to get it
question what what do you mean actually
can you please again type it
foreign
so we know what is called as flash
terminal plane
most of the times it results in
a Class 1 relationship the plus terminal
shape and on relationship in the
permanent engine which later gets
connected to a Class 1 relationship due
to what is called as our forward growth
of the mandible with Checkers at an most
active phase compared to the maxilla due
to called as a cephalocodal gradient of
growth and next thing is the leeway
space the difference in the leeway space
between the upper and lower teeth where
will be the more Lewis space is it in
upper or lower
yes mandible mandibility is around 3.4
millimeter in the entire rock or 1.7
millimeters for the
same quartering likewise we have only
1.8 mm of the leeway space in the
macular area so this provides a linear
space for any of the molar adjustments
that doesn't occur due to the early
shift early shift is nothing but then
there are spaces in the dentition
if it does not occur what happens is
this lever space is utilized this is
called as late Mission chip so utilizing
the late Michelle shape is your leave a
space due to the utilization of leeway
space The Flash terminal plane also
lands up in a Class 1 relationship but
the first terminal plane initially lines
up in end-to-end relationship then it
may land up a Class 1 relationship based
on upon your leave space and the amount
of the forward growth of the mandible
and the difference in the size of the
good and the decision is digital step
digital step always gives rise to a
class 2 relationship that is a sign
impending of a Class 2 skeletal
relationship remember that whenever you
see a Class 2 relationship in mixed
dentition you should be very careful
that means you should try to
see the restrict the growth impending if
at all anything happening if the maxilla
and mandible if the Maxwell is growing
more or if the mandible is not growing
properly you should care to see what is
called as a growth
changes you have to bring about your
orthopedic and functional appliances
growth stimulation or growth restriction
this is one of your interceptive
Orthodontics so meet your step most of
the times it is utilized a class 3. at
the same time it uses to class one if it
is more BC accept you should be very
careful whether it is the skeletal class
3 or it is a just a dental cluster which
is adjusting so out of all this the
digital step definitely gives rise to
class too these may or may not give
flash terminal or Mutual step and of
course we should do not give a Class 2
relationship with plus terminal and
visuals I think the concept is clear
okay
angle's classification should not be
used in mixed dentition this is one of
the drawbacks of angles classification
angles classification you cannot apply
you cannot apply for a vixen dentition
or if the first molar is itself missing
in cases first to me first molar is
missing you apply what is called as CAD
classification k a t z remember this is
also given once so you see the
relationship in primolar area this is
called as cad's relationship just like
how you assess the canines you see what
is called as premolar always if you see
our dentition it is a peculiar phenomena
that all the posterior teeth in the
mandible or are one cusp ahead of your
the maxillary tradition but if it comes
to the anterior teeth there is
surprisingly overlap of the macularity
on the mandible or teeth this is due to
the difference in the size of the
maxillary and mandibular dentition yes
premolar classification or cats
classification you have to check
so this is one of the questions this you
should not go wrong then ask what is
this what is the space difference to
what is the difference in the upper art
what is the difference in the lower Arch
and what is the difference how much is
the difference between the uh permanent
teeth and the primary teeth in the part
they have asked how much difference in
the
polarity between the permanent and
primary teeth this may this is the one
of the questions about leave a space you
can get a direct question and direct uh
answer you can answer this
one minute admitting
am I going little bit speed is it okay
this much speed
yes yes it is 3.4 mm in mandible not
maxilla Dr Monica please correct it
no no
upper less lower more that's why more of
missile movement of mandible or molar
maxillary it is less it is 1.8 mm for
all Arch mandibility is 3.4 millimeters
yes
so this is uh desktop put the prince and
uh
one more question is about diagnosis
what is the Mal occlusion you are seeing
in this diagram
yes
yes it is strength Mission between
canine and
a premolar you can easily identify it
what transportation is most common is it
between lateral and canine or canine
entry molar
yes yes can I end
primolar
yes very good very good very good very
good
so you know what is this it's a simple
just very direct questions you will get
now coming to this uh I am not going to
the very Basics uh which you already
read in your BDS curriculum they may ask
about the ratios they may put a diagram
of the length of the face width of the
face they mask what type of face is it
and uh this question in well balanced
phase
this is one of the question uh given in
Public Service Commission of one of the
states
then well balanced with what is the
ratio of a is to B
no that is the not faces they are
masking okay you might have confused
that that's why that's why I'm putting
that question also they're asking about
the soft tissue here
if not 45 is to 55 they have given some
money to one e to three one each of four
like two is to one what will be your
ratio
they're asking about your uh yes yes yes
that's why I ask you to be careful it is
not one is to three it is one is to two
be careful this is what happens this is
what happened they are asking about the
ratio they are not asking about this is
138 B is two third that means total is
three there there we will go wrong in
hurry up so see what they have asked
whether they have asked the ratio or the
total proportion this is
so one third and two third if you take
ratio it comes to the one is to 2 ratio
okay understand I'm just trying to
correct you know the every every one of
us knows in a hurry we'll put almost a
10 percent uh questions wrong I want to
see that you know that should not go not
only in Oppo and uh
all the subjects you should not go wrong
so this is
what uh same question what we are asking
about uh the upper half of the face and
lower half of the weight what is the
ratio between the upper half and lower
half of the face
yes yes yes it is 45 to 55 to say put it
in one inch to one ratio upper half the
lower half lower half will be little bit
more yes
so this this type of questions also you
can expect
and this is a very controversial
question asked so many times what is the
ratio between the
artistic poster and anatomical portion
so we have seen many textbooks and
whatever it may be controversies uh it
is the basal art portion is one third
and this is two third portion
the anatomical portion should be two
third and the basal portion should be
one third
uh
one is to truth okay
I told it is a controversial question
next comes your very favorite topic for
uh
the paper Setters you can take it
grantedly definitely you can have two
questions from cephalometrics and most
of the times uh it is very much known to
you very very very easy questions they
will put and what are the landmarks that
are unilateral what are the landmarks
that are in maxilla what are the
landmarks that are in mandible where are
the bilateral landmarks in what are the
different bilateral landmarks and they
can give you any question like this and
asking you to point out uh
the point out
what are these different landmarks or so
what is this you should be able to know
and most of the favorable question is
they will be giving this PTM what is
called as a dancing girl in
encephalometrics we call it as the
dancing girl in ciplomatics this point
and this you know what is this
this is nothing but your orbital and
this is your Salah of course and this is
you know
point
yes try to identify as minus points
possible what is this
yes
yes no no no point a it is not the
anterior nostril Point anterior nasal
spine is the tip pointed tip of the
palette here it comes this is in the
curvature between the anterior natal
point netany
Superior Intel it is the
the point a here this is point B R Supra
mental and again where you go wrong is
in identifying the
points around the chin
what is the anterior most point of the
chin anterior most point of the chin
yes yes
what is the lower most point of the chin
yes Mentone is the lower most point of
the chin so again that's what I have
been seeing many of you put it is going
on
one is the pogonian the anterior most
point and the two the lower most point
of the chin the Benton and in between
what you call it as the gnatian which is
the bisector of a
tangent line towards your pagodian and
Menton very good yes it is
some problem with the server there it is
not allowing me to
push up my slides some problem with the
server there it's not problem here we'll
do it slowly no problem
so these are the various points you can
see in a lateral step
so I put pns this is a and S this
palette no from palette DNS the
curvature point is called as point a
so this is point B this is what pagonian
nation and lowest mind point is
the point tangent bisectingly
you are the ramus and the body of the
mandible the 11 o'clock position of the
tergo macular point is called as PTM so
I want to repeat again some requests are
there the anterior most point is
pogonian of the chin the anterior most
point is
the lowest most points the lowest most
tangent to the point of the chin is your
moment on so in between your anterior
most point and the inferior most point
anterior inferiorly is located your
nation as such the nation does not exist
is a constructed Point am I clear enough
yes yes
Korean foreign
to avoid this we started taking the
machine purion the highest point can you
see here a ring where the ear pieces are
inserted into the cephalometrics this
year Rings above the point that color
clock position of this year rinse is
called as the porion
the 11 o'clock point is taken as the PTM
point is it is it clear now
any doubts regarding this
cell uh
based on bolt-on point Nation they won't
go much deep previously they used to go
very deep in ionizet examinations
that are too much for pgs also now we
cannot expect you to learn in this one
and half month and all that but remember
the basics
PTM is nothing but peregroma auxiliary
figure there you go maxillary figure PTM
Point
PRP silent
dancing girl yes it is called as dancing
gold
can you see here
it stands on one one leg and it touches
the BNS point
so that's why it is called as a dancing
girl
okay shall I move on to the next topic
so you can clearly see this is a PTM
premium activity figure that is it's
called as a PDM and uh recently in one
of the entrances 2019 r18 what is this
point called
what is this point marked X called
yes it is registration point or R point
it is called as R pointer registration
point so when connecting the Bolton
Nation plane when you drop a
perpendicular from the cell law the
midpoint of it is called as the r point
I put at X it is called as our Point
registration Point why it is called As
registration point is in successive
cephalograms will project at our Point
parallel to this registration Point all
the successive radiograph this bolt-on
and Nation Point are projected parallel
this is also a question given in uh neet
2020 all the successive the radio graphs
or keflagrams should be made parallel to
this plane on the registration point so
this is called As registration point
so this is your registration point now
understand
yes why it is stable point because again
go back to basics it is the cranial base
which completes the growth first we have
already called as the nation to The
Cellar to Nation anterior cranial base
which is related to growth of your
maxilla and of course in the middle
cranial Forza we have what is called as
the mandible or glenoid for the attached
to the posterior cleaner fossa so this
point if you can see it is combining the
lithium and the bolt on the whole length
of the cranial base so that's why it is
a stable point
yes very good since it is present
towards the steps or towards the skull
it is the one which completes the growth
first again going back to the another
way since it contains the neural tissue
which is first to complete the growth
again it is related to cement structures
yes very good
and sometimes they ask about any
important lines which were found in
normal cephalometric analysis like this
what is the line x y
both goneyan and gratian are constructed
points according to sasam going on angle
they will take actually gonian point
doesn't take the colonial angle will be
there so what they do is they draw a
line Tang into the ramus and Tang into
the mandible and the bisector they take
it as in roughly so so there are a line
like this they draw a line like this the
bisector Point Let's Take begonian Point
as such gunian point doesn't exist the
goonian angle exists in mandible yes it
is y-axis and where the y-axis measured
is the anterior inferior angle be
careful about this also this angle where
you measure which channel CCD scene
where you will get yes it is seen in
Downs analysis
very good very good okay
if the angle is more what it indicates
what is the normal angle
no it is not Class 2 it indicates
vertical growth or the mandible is
rotating backwards around 54 to 59
degrees if it rotates back this angle
increases it indicates the downward and
backward rotating mandible at the same
time if this angle closes it indicates a
forward or anti-clockwise growing or a
horizontal growing mandible yes yes yes
yes yes exactly correct
so this is your y-axis
so what this analysis is
and who has given that analysis
yes
the lines down from perpendicular to
occlusial plane from point A to point B
is called as a bit surprisal or bits
analysis why it is called bits sometimes
you may not expect to get this quotient
because these are given
why it is called bits and who has given
it
so which appraisal is given by Jacobson
right uh due to the university name
design University it is called as wits
appraisal it is given by Jacobson
so according to the research
to sagittal analysis of maxilla and
mandible the least prone variation is by
which analysis what are the other
methods of seeing the surgical
relationship between maxilla and
mandible we have very common sna and SNB
A and B angle so it is subjected to
change yes Stillness sna and SNB it is
subjected to change why because in many
of the patients true horizontal that
means this is called as true horizontal
the line joining the poreon and the
orbital or Frankfurt horizontal plane
close to or foreign true horizontal
plane sometimes we know that b principle
of growth from the seller the nation
grows more reports more reports and the
maxilla grows more downwards a creating
a more recent plane compared to the
Frankfurt horizontal plane so when the
nation is not consistent they may give
different readings that's why according
to the reset research the wheat
surprisal is taken at the standard is
the least variable that measures this
actual relationship between maxilla and
mandible
and you may expect from hand restrict
x-rays
s you should be careful at SMI they
won't give SMI but they will ask about
what is this A and B
what is that given in a and b
so the presence of that in a indicate
definitely pubertal growth but has
started
yes yes yes that question is also given
it is Sesame bone can you see a small
ring like thing here it is called as
sesamoid bone what is this this
indicates almost at the verge of
completion of
growth
it is represented by the letter H
exactly not Hammett it is hook of Hemet
so Hamlet is present always can you see
a hook like thing present here closely
so this is also question one fast this
indicates the arrival of the pubertal
groups but this marks or it is reaching
the
okay so one more question you can find
out
about the
menarch the arrival of menar indicates
in females
the onset of growth the peak pivotal
growth or the accelerating growth first
are pro closure of active growth but
what it indicates
no no no it is not onset once there is
means the girl has already crossed the
peak pubertal growth but pH wheat is
plus phv so she will be in the diction
rating growth fact why we have to see
this in accelerating growth phase you
will give what is called as removable
functional appliances in the
accelerating growth phase you call fixed
functional
appliances that's why if Monarch
indicates that the girl has definitely
crowded the Peak at a velocity she may
be in that accelerating Force works but
not reach the closure or end of the
active growth but it is still happening
after one and after two years after men
are the closure of active pubertal
growth phase occurs after one end of one
and half one and a half years after men
are one and after two years in Indian
cities more it is very close that being
the Monarch and the closure of the
active grocer it is the time where the
active growth but searching and they
grow rapidly
okay
so remember this point also so this is
nothing but your hookah from it
and this is what is called as a seismide
bone these two indicates
slowly moving to the mechanic spot am I
going speed or should I slow down
okay thank you then thank you
so this question they give you like this
and try to identify the fourth system
in this what is what kind of force
system it is
yes
it is interrupted for system
how do you differentiate between a
continuous interrupted and intermittent
Force system
so in a right continuous Force which
give it fictional appliances the rate of
DK is very slow very slow but never it
reaches the zero before it reaches the
zero we will activate the appliance
so the rate of DK is only one third
maximum of the initial Force what we
have applied because in interrupted uh
Force where we give heavy forces
sometimes with the closer Loop mechanics
or Springs
the
porcellus abruptly Falls to zero again
we have to activate it there it
shouldn't fall to zero that means after
giving the appliance there will be no
movement at all sometimes you can
activate and uh rme Appliance there will
be initial shutter movement after that
there will be no movement at all so this
sudden fall of movement is seen in
interrupted forces an intermediate
forces is usually seen with the
appliances that are removed by the
patient when the mouth they apply Force
at an high level like your headgear once
there is removed there will be no fourth
abruptly there will be zero
yes separately zero intermittent
yes
can you see this slide I put
okay
this also question you can expect
and what is the fourth system seen in
this case
yes no no no it is couple of force it is
couple of pores what is a couple in
Orthodontics a couple is a fourth system
it should contain
two forces
two forces number one
if to produce an rotation they should be
equal in magnitude
and of course they should produce the
moments in opposite direction
opposite direction usually
they are used for a rotation correction
why I am going it slowly I am showing
this around vertical axis for rotation
correction of the tooth I am going to
see in the anterior posterior Direction
now we'll slowly move to it that
question was recently asked in need 2021
examination
so it is nothing but yes couple of
forces which is what is coupled I am
trying to okay it rotates the tooth
around a vertical axis
so can you answer this question
2021 they have given this
approach
okay
okay whatever moves from right to left
is clockwise Direction
everything
from here you can see
so this is moving like a clock
so it is here also you can see clock it
is moving like a clock
so this is clockwise Direction this is
your anti-clockwise direction so
yesterday I have got uh
a question from few of the students that
you've given wrong in some book I don't
want to comment that but whatever it may
be be strong in your Basics don't worry
about what we have given in our books
the basic remain as it is if any case we
refer to a standard textbook so why why
this is called as the point is called as
first you have to know about the basic
concept A few questions two three
questions you may expect on this topic
so first one is when we want to move
something we would apply a force a force
is that Vector which has a direction and
which has a quantity that moves the body
how this body moves so this body moves
by different phase we are not going deep
so all of us what is called as anybody
living or non-inning we have what is
called as Center of resistance Center of
resistance wherever mass is concentrated
so in human beings we have a naval
region in the stomach at the naval
region you can see in the circus being
done on Street side people they will
just on the navel they will support like
this on a bamboo stick they are able to
balance it this is because whole Force
whole mass is concentrated at the naval
in a level point in US likewise
in the structures in non-animate
structures
there are that's a point where the mass
is concentrated that point is called as
the center of mass
but for the tooth if you see the tooth
is
situated half of its portion embedded in
the
root root is embedded in the bone that
only upper part is mobile lower part is
not Mobile in such case we give the name
Center of resistance this Center of
resistance is a pixel Point remember
this the center of resistance is a fixed
point
so can I apply force on the center of
resistance
so why I should apply and center of
distance if any Force applied through
the center of resistance will bring
about a bodily movement why bodily
movement means the teeth should move
bodily within the allevolence between
the two cortical bones for a good
movement of course there are situations
where you require torque and tipping but
for a good tooth movement it should have
a bodily movement it should have a
bodily movement this bodily movement is
possible when only the force is sent
through the center of presence if it is
not acting Center of resistance we
cannot apply to the center of resistance
for a tooth which is the situated
which is the situated inside the root in
such a case we apply to the ground
surface
where a force is applied to a bracket
bracket or the attachment where we apply
the force so what happens
this force is applied at a distance l or
D from the center of a fence so when I
apply this force it tries to create a
moment the couple of moment of a couple
are tendency to rotate moment of a force
or the Tendencies to rotate instead of
rotation zipping is also kind of
rotation it tries to rotate the teeth I
want to move the tooth like this but it
is trying to rotate and move like this
which I don't want this is called as the
moment of force now you remember that
you remember this important point of now
I cannot apply the fourth center of the
tense but what I have applied is causing
a moment of force to cancel this moment
of force I have to apply what is called
as counter moment of force in the
reverse Direction This decides whether
your tooth movement is going to a body
or translatory movement or whether it is
going to a rotatory movement or its
control tipping or uncontrolled tipping
rotatory and whether it is going to
torque what is torque torque is nothing
but the movement of the root without the
root of the crown it is just opposite
your tipping we are going to discuss all
this point now Apple yes it is now can
you see her when this force is applying
it is trying to rotate the crown
at a moment equal into F into D that
1200 grams per mm moment of force in
clockwise direction to put it it is
trying to move the
direction if you go on putting this what
happens after some time this Roots comes
and such as the labial cortical plate
and it undergoes the resorption which we
want we always want the tooth to be
within the
alibiolas
cortical on both sides with cortical
plates in the alveolar housing we should
move the tooth
so this question is given in 2021 up to
here it is correct now the another point
is uh which I would like to discuss
is
are you able to follow up me up to here
yes if you can see here another X point
is there
can you see here x
X
here x here okay this is called as
Center of rotation what is that called
Center of rotation so this Center of
rotation is nothing but
a point where the initial and final
lines drawn through the center of the
long axis of the tooth meat
this is called as Center of rotation can
you see all these points marked X in the
round are constant they have not changed
this constant position as we have
discussed is called as Center of
crystals whereas this x point which is
not in the round is constantly changing
from here to here from here to here here
to here it is called as Center of
rotation
so
why is Center of
resistance for a single rooted tooth it
is
from half of the distance from textbook
say it is around in the one third from
the tip whatever it may be so when I
apply an
shipping force that means a force here
without giving a counter moment Force so
what happens is there is zero that is
uncontrolled keeping so the MCA by mm
pressure becomes zero and my center of
rotation is just is just applicable to
the center of resistance
so next comes if I am able to give the
counter moment little bit little bit
counter moment so that there won't be
much moments created by the original
Force then this becomes an controlled
tipping so for controlled tipping the
center of rotation is that the point the
apical third is exactly at the epical
third both are tipping this is
uncontrolled tipping this is controlled
keeping and you can see that the center
of rotation chips
from uncontrolled tipping to control
repeating the vehicle region but you can
still deal the moments are there moments
created by the virginal Force MF are not
controlled but coming to the next can
you see here there are no moments this
is called as translatory movement or
bodily movement if I draw a line
connecting the initial and final
position of the teeth they will meet
somewhere infinity infinity they will
meet somewhere at Infinity this point
where they meet at Infinity is seen in
the translatory movement translatory
movement the another where it is seen
outside the tooth outside the tooth it
is in intrusion and Extrusion also you
can see that the point of rotation the
center of rotation is outside the tooth
it is not within the tooth what is
Center of rotation Center of rotation is
nothing but where the long axis of the
tooth before and after the tooth
movement means so now I want only the
roots to move roots to move just
opposite of this just opposite of the
Sun control tipping this is star now
what happens I want to park and hold the
teeth to move this side so there is
tendency to move whenever there is
moment this causes the roots to tip back
into the palate and The Roots then the
crown to tip back legally but I don't
want to be
this is held by some means and only in
such cases start I have to apply more
counter moments than what is produced by
the original Moment by force then what
happens in such a case
the center of rotation shifts to the
incisal area then this produces what is
called as torque or the movement of the
roots without the movement of the crown
which is just opposite to that of
uncontrolled tipping
is the concept clear up to here any
doubts
these questions are given
you will get definite one question on
this
Center of resistance and center of
rotation should never coincide in bodily
movement it is infinity the farther it
is the center of rotation further from
the center of resistance so when it is
close to the center of resistance you
can see it is an uncontrolled TP the
more it moves the center of rotation
away from the center of the extent we
are able to control the tooth movement
from an uncontrolled tooth movement to a
control tooth movement and if you are
able to control 100 that means the
moment created by the forces original
forces Is counterbalanced by The Moments
which we have given there are many ways
of giving this counter parents it is up
to the pg level but just remember now we
are able to counteract by The Moments
created so we usually we create this
moments within the bracket area within
the bracket area that is it that is it's
called as edgewise we'll keep the
bracket in edgewise so that within the
bracket area these moments are applied
that is one of the difference between
beg and uh
in third phase of treatment
now we understand
so if we go on increasing the counter
moment MC you can see from uncontrolled
tipping to the control tipping control
tipping to the bodily movement and to
the torque
and what is that portion that is
constant it is Center of resistance
Center of resistance is always constant
it won't change so this Center of
distance is constant to make constant
for a particular type of movement
helps we're going to discuss in magazine
live what we see now
so far single rooted truth it is located
between midway or towards the apical
one-third around 40 to 50 distance for a
center of resistance for a multi rooted
tooth is located at one meter somebody
wants to admit some
yeah sorry Center of resistance is
located at the percation area one to two
millimeters above the percussion area
for multi rooted tooth so when it comes
for the whole body
when it comes to the maxillary basal
bone it is situated somewhere in the
maxillary spinal
and for intrusion it is between the
lateral and the canine for intrusion for
the anterior posterior movement it is in
the
finite region if you take whole of the
magdalery dentition see how the center
of resistance depending upon the body
body means here a single body when I
take a single tooth it is single body
when I take a set of tooth it becomes a
single body compromising of all the
maxillary teeth it is called as
maxillary dentition body for that it is
situated between the premolars these
questions are being asked so many times
so remember that what they are asking
you the center of resistance for a
single rooted tooth single observations
for a
for
[Music]
the anterior posterior Direction
depending upon this Center of resistance
of the magdala you are the cervical
headgear or you are the occipital
headgear so what is cervical headgear we
gives a point of attachment below the
center of friction so the maxilla tries
to rotate down so what happens it
rotates down the
vertical bike decreases a vertical bite
increases sorry that we are going to in
some other class Pub
up to this point you remember what is
Center of resistance
so this question is also after so many
times what happens to the center of
Christians when there is bone loss when
there is solvular bone loss
what happened series
no no when there is bone loss you keep
to the apical
it depends upon the amount of the bone
remaining bone remaining it depends to
be bone remaining the more the bone at
same time it depends when there is
apical eruption of the tooth there is
shift towards the coronal area when
there is
[Music]
there is shift towards the apical area
okay these two things remember
any doubts up here
so now it becomes very clear to you
this point is very very important that's
why I'm much stressing on this so now
just imagine I have drawn a line through
the long axis of my tooth this is my
initial position of the tooth this is
the final position so I have drawn from
a to this point now if I draw the points
like this and like this where they are
meeting
they are meeting at the apical area in
such a case what do you call this
identify the type of tooth moment
it is control tipping now we understand
what I mean to say the initial position
and final position so for the dipping
always the center of resistance is
applicable to the center of resistance
Center of rotation is applied to the
center of resistance the more the
Center of rotation moves away from the
center of distance the more controlled
will be the tipping in most of the cases
it is not possible to bring a exact
translatory moment or bodily Movement we
cannot move exactly bodily we cannot
it's a biological tissue how can we
predict how much of moment of forces are
created that's so for a structure which
is situated inside the bone or bone and
it is guided art which is influenced by
many factors like your presence of
alveolar bone your width of the
periodontal augment in such cases always
try to see that you are MF
should be battery counterparenter by MC
so closely bring your MC to M map so
that your uncontrolled tipping becomes a
control tipping now it is clear from the
diagram what type of truth moment is it
yes it is a controlled tipping
so these are you can expect a questions
on this also okay for the tooth movement
m c by MF ratios so what happens if we
is zero so
if m c zero a pure if m f is more than m
c there is
it is the let's just the derivative
equal into zero then it is pure tipping
uncontrolled tipping if it is more than
zero or less than one if you are going
increasing the MC there is control
dipping if the mlmc if mfp is one you
will add bodily moment or MC to MF is
greater than one we have called it as
very well
in torque
Empire shows
and by m by a pressure I'm asking yes
yes yes yes 12 is to one for for bodily
movement
it is 10 is to one below 10 it is
it is below 10 it is tipping
the ratio becomes less it becomes an
uncontrolled tipping now you understand
the point what is Sun control tipping
what is control tipping what is bodily
movement and body strong
so now you see here
this is your initial position
this is your final position
or the lying axis of the initial and the
final positions of the teeth meeting
are they meeting
are they intersecting
no
if they are running parallel they beat
at a point where nowhere exists that is
at Infinity in such a case
the movement is said to be
yes exactly correct it is bodily
movement now we understand the concept
why it is called as bodily movement so
whenever when MF is trying to create a
bodily movement I have applied an mc
equal into MF so that the initial point
and the final point in my body your body
means in my tooth remain the same height
or same distance in the root portion in
the crown portion they have moved this
produces what is called as translatory
movement in such cases we have what is
called as MF is equal to m v MC or your
M by of ratio is equal to 10 and an exam
don't expect that they will ask them by
apprecios they will ask about MF is
equal to m c if you they ask about M by
approaches you are very lucky it is a
direct question and you can answer
what if somebody has put canine entry
more
yes 10 is to one so controlled tipping
same we have discussed already now see
decide what happens is so when I join my
initial and final position
so what is happening to your center of
rotation it is very close to your center
of resistance
but it is ethical
it is applicable to your center of
resistance what happens if Center of
rotation shifts towards the its
knowledge or towards inches outside of
the center of friction what happens
yes all his produced If It Moves towards
the inside leg it produces star If It
Moves ethically the more epically from
the uncontrolled tipping to the control
tipping to the bodily movement the more
it moves the more incisely it produces
what is called as star in uncontrolled
tipping we have M by a pressure is equal
to 5 and
and by a pressure in control tipping is
uh seven I think I put a sorry five it
is seven for uncontrolled tipping it is
less than five
no no not control tipping control
tipping and uncontrolled tipping are
applicable to the center of resistance
only
yes all tippings
are applicable to the center of reasons
all talks are
towards the bracket or towards the
inside like this
yes for uncontrolled it is 5 is to one
for control seven is to one for the
bodily movement 10 is to one and for
torque for least one yes good good
you're all correct
so this is your
start what happened see no talk if I
join my initial and final position it is
coming at
the tip of the brackets or near the
bracket or it is
all to the bracket area in such case M
by a pressure is 12 and in fact I
applied more common more counter moment
than the original forces produced this
is used right M by of ratio of 12 or the
MC by m by ratio is greater than one so
these are the sum of the points I would
like to discuss regarding the mechanics
hi any doubts up to here we are going
into the next part next phase
how are your levels
how much time can you hear patiently
no no how much can how much more time
can I take for you
okay until then sure
up to nine o'clock
then we'll come to the appliances
this is also one of the favorable topic
of examiners
okay
if you are waiting in the hall admitting
them
so
functional appliances seems to be a very
favorite topic for examiners
can you identify these Appliance
yes basically the triangle Appliance but
you see here
there are two types of Appliance here
Frank l2n Frank L3
we are going to discuss uh this question
is given in our India PG 2019 meet 2019.
when I say all India PG it is the need
okay and of all the appliances this is
only the Frankl Appliance is the only
appliance which is purely a tissue burn
of course one and only and the other
appliances is your oral screen if it is
not permitted to touch the teeth why it
is called acute tissue bonus in making
this it won't touch any part of your
dentition so only the buccal modules the
labial modules act on this it works all
the functional models works on the
principles of functional Matrix Theory
functional Matrix Theory why it is
called viral gymnastic appliances
patients do patients should do the
exercises with these lips and muscles
always try to close tightly giving the
exercises to the label and buccal
modules and
a day act by shielding away the forces
we have seen vaccinator and tongue
muscles the tongue acts from inside and
the vaccinator Max from outside so when
there is narrow arches it is due to the
vaccinator muscle more acting so what
this Franco do when I say functional
appliances most of the times uh the
functional class tooth and Class 2
appliances only that means they are
trying to correct the mandible detergent
so here these are called as lip pads
these lip pads they Shield away the lip
forces on the dentition it allows the
alveolar grown all the basal grown of
the mandible to grow forward and these
buccal Shields they Shield away the
buccal musculature falling on the
dentition so they freely permit the
expansion of the maxillary skeletal bone
so these are called as buccal Shields
and labial seeds if they are present on
the lower Arch it is called as f r 2
Frankel 2 that means it is trying to
correct a Class 2 growth modulation
growth modification it is trying to
correct a growth modulation please
always remember all the functional
appliances work in a class 2 situation
where there is skeletal abnormality due
to the mandible or recognition and not
due to the neither reprogrammatism if
Maxwell reprogrammatism is there in a
classical condition what are plans you
have to give
what do you have to do
yes Orthopedic Appliance Orthopedic
Appliance the common Orthopedic
appliance which you give is
your
head Gates all types of head gears you
should give
yes yes head gives we have different
headgears the combination that gears
High pool headgear the occipital
headgear the cervical headgear sometimes
they show the diagram and ask you to
identify it is also very easy
what is this
yes yes yes yes it is binator don't go
deep it is a bionator bionator is also a
monoblock that means it is an adverb an
activator like thing
except
on the parital side
there is no plate
there are buccal wires
same like but it is a tooth burner plant
similar to the activator
if there is any abnormality in the
tongue position
this is given
so the activator is a simple function
Appliance is a simple toothbrone
appliance which is given in early phases
of mixed dentition or not early phases
of the late phase of mixing dentition or
early part of the growth modulation
and the pinbox appliance is one which is
given in early permanent dentition this
is the difference between
the activator and pin block timing
what difference you have in finding the
myofunctional appliances do you have any
difference here
so what difference let let me post let's
start no problem you are allowed to talk
what differences you are finding
timing
the activator is the simplest appliances
whenever the pubertal growth phase
starts it's in the late mixed dentition
as soon as you noticed that a Class 2
skeletal condition is growing to
appear in the patient you give a
late late that means still the teeth are
remaining your primary teeth are
remaining then you give a simple
activator because at that phase the
patient is in the accelerating phase of
growth Peak height velocity before
reaching the Pre-K velocity once the
patient some of the teeth are gone and
early permanent dentition that means
usually the functional appliances are
not given when second molar is erupted
second molar is adapted but still around
11 to 12 years if in some patients there
is class 2 tendency
and if you check about your hand is sex
race and cervical vertebrae still if it
is showing growth you can go for a fixed
functional Appliance or you can go for a
robust Appliance like a thin block yes
around 11 to 13 years a twin block can
be given remember that a twin block is a
pixel in a removable type whereas an
activator is in a purely a removable
type of it's the simplest
type of punctual Appliance and what
problem you have in uh identifying these
appliances may I know it some of you are
posted if you can come out I can answer
so there is Frankel Appliance is very
easy to
identify am I correct there is no
problem in identifying the triangle
Appliance
so where the problem comes in activator
and
activator and bionator for activator the
whole palette is covered it is monoblock
both the bionator and activators are
monoblock
I'll have some cup of tea
both are called as the monoblocks I'll
shoot
so this is also an activator this is
activator typical activator mono block
combining the blocks the byte blocks of
your
just like how the appliance of upper and
lower the bite plane combining these two
you have called it as the mono block or
activator or Norway in the simplest
tooth burn Appliance activator you can
give an uh headgear cubes this is
particularly given headgear tubes when
you have a class 2 condition due to a
pragmatic magnoliant electronic mandible
you have only electronic mandible you
give a functional Appliance if you have
only pragmatic maxilla you give a
headgear up to here no problem no these
all the questions that are being given
that analyze what is being given so
don't blindly put all the class 2 cases
growing cases needs functional
appliances functional appliances or
giving in actively growing patents where
the mandible is problematic not the
maxilla if the problem is in the maxill
law only you have to give for head care
now you can see monoblock in early
places you grill so this is a purely
a tooth burn Appliance
now you can see the bionator it's cut in
the parital area why this tongue guide
is given is so in order to make the
Arches wide so this makes the tongue
sittingly valid region so when the trunk
is guided thanks starts exerting the
pressure on the earth just stands for
Direction so it makes the Arches to grow
that's why it's given in uh with little
bit of muzzle functional inactivity or
muscle aberrant activity biometry is
given whereas activator is not given in
any of the muscle aberrant activities it
is purely a tissue Bond Appliance of
course at a toothbrone applying of
course biometer is also a purely tooth
bone Appliance take support from the
tooth burn passive Appliance here
passive and active means active means
any form of tooth movements are given
such as your screws or some Springs like
that most of the times functional
appliances are meant to bring the
changes in the skeleton basal skeleton
so no active component should be given
unless it is required
so up to here no different no problem in
identifying these three important
appliances I think any problem in
identifying activator in bionator and
Frankl appliances
only thing is remember the Frankel
Appliance 2 and 3 for bankruplines two
the labial Fields will be in the
because to permit the
forward growth of the mandible in a
class three Frankel the labial Shields
will be in the upper to permit the
growth of the maxilla and to restrict
the mandible in plastic conditions very
good
so this is your activator so this is
nothing but your
what is this
from the diagram you can make it out
yes is there any point in identifying
this
yes what is the angle between the blocks
to a close your plane
yes it is a Delta class
Delta class is the identification marker
identifying this
so it is 70 degrees not 45 if more
horizontal is required then you go for
90 degrees or 45 degrees 45 degrees you
output
yes up to here
no no no 70 only now we are not giving
45 degrees is robust initially it used
to be 90 degrees
so why labial Shields are given is you
should go to the bachelor mechanism
is the mechanism that keeps the
dentition in a neutral position
that means
from one side
your boxer vaccinator mechanism that
means your vaccinator
you are
lip muscles are falling these prevent
from growing the
from improving the transverse direction
of the maxilla and mandible when
vaccinator is great great force than the
tongue or due to some other conditions
in the tongue is not able to exert the
pressure on the
the dental Arch due to some other
condition due to upper respiratory tract
infections or from other problems then
in such cases you try to Shield the
buccal muscles falling on the dentition
these are nothing but your buccal chills
so when these buccal Shields are given
they try to pull the
tissues
towards the muscle that means they try
to from the periosteum they try to pull
the periosteum on the bone of the
magazine on the lateral sides so when
once
that the tiger fire ended the time comes
into the play and it starts exerting
Force now so it is very easy for tank to
know exact forces because there are no
neutral forces being ejected from the
buccal side or radial side so that makes
the transverse growth of the Jaws are
that gross
the correct form of arch form in
transfer Direction at the same time we
give what is called as labial paths in
the lower rod for a class two condition
though in anterior posterior Direction
when the labial muscle you can see lip
tab sometimes lip trap falling on the
lower dentition though this prevents lip
trap from falling on the lower allular
bone so the mandible is free to move
that's why we give the labial pads and
so these are the labial packs given on
the
crankled two Appliance of
correction of retroagnetic mandible so
once the labial muscles and the buccal
muscles are not falling now
it is very easy for
your tongue to correctly
what is that forces inherent process all
of them utilize inherent forces within
the system they won't take any external
forces
now yes uh pin block given in early
permanent indentation and
pin block can be given in late mix
indentation no problem but activator
won't work if it is given in a permanent
indentation once if it is related to
your what is called a skeletal
activation or SMI indices it is not hard
and fast rule it all takes if it is an
axial rating stage of growth part you
can go for simple activator if it is
around your Peak height velocity you go
for pin block if it is on the sloping
down of the accelerating slope of growth
but you go for a fixer functional
Appliance
understand up to here
still some are joining
so next slowly we try to
to identify the
fixed function of prime trip these are
also being given in a recent Examination
for those who are specially appearing
for ionizing
so usually there are four types of pixel
functional appliances the first and
foremost is the herbs the piston and
Tube mechanism this is called
the next
we have rigid rigid means that means
they won't permit the mandible to move
descent and that side
why we give a class to to push the
mandible forward they effectively put
the mandible forward
so next comes your uh very commonly used
this is the most commonly used versatile
Appliance
it can see a spring
it is what is called somewhat hybrid
applying it is a piston inside it over
which you have a spring but if you can
see here it is totally a spring
again
if you can see here
this is also a pixel functional
Appliance but if you can see that it is
not attached to the any parts of the
tooth directly it is attached to wire to
wire wire wire to wire these are the
four appliances normally
frequently given in examination
so first this is helps appliances this
is given by punches though hapsters
given in 1920
the benches has advocated this Appliance
so these Appliance can be given as a
fixer and removal most of the times it
is given in fixed either it can be given
or bonded or banded it is directly
attached to the molar
molar by Crown by Band any form can you
give it is a very sturdy mechanism rigid
mechanism the first and foremost the
pixel functional Appliance is your the
Herbst Appliance can you identify here
in the canine region they are given to
the banks here and it is piston and Tube
mechanism no spring is present in the
herbs Appliance
I think you can easily identify this
first Appliance
okay
shall I move to the next one
so this is helps there are many ways of
giving herbs all these are helps you can
see here banded Appliance and uh
and you can see
the crowns
with clasps and crowns clasps they have
taken their acrylic plate is being faced
sometimes crowns may be placed directly
these are various forms of the Herbst
Appliance
so what is this Appliance now
what is this Appliance
I've seen many of you giving answers now
come out
is it having rod
is it having any rod
first first try to answer it is it
having any rod
see it see it carefully
is it flexible
it is not flexible
it is not flexible it is very straight
can you see it like herbs it is very
flexible
despite of its rigidity there is spring
on it yes can you see the spring over
here
so it is a way in between helps and you
are Jasper jumper so it is not a Jasper
jumper it is not your helps then what it
can be yes
it is forces applied
nonstick is normally given for
digitalization
so please please mute please mute
somebody or talking
all right
foreign
this is the commonest pixel functional
appliance that is given worldwide forces
Appliance
so remember this
so it produces
more of the changes compared to the
Herbst the skeletal changes in macdilla
it is nothing but your can you see it is
then
a Class III Baker's Anchorage that means
is trying to move the maxilla back any
class two functional appliances will try
to restrict the maxilla
they try to push the magdala back and
try to pull the push the mandible
forward and hold the magdala back they
allow the mandible in a forward
Direction so this is directly attached
at the
maxillary region remember this why I am
telling this this is directly attached
at the
molar band of the
maxillary molar it helps the plants
piston and Tube mechanism no spring will
be there and both sides at posterior and
anterior in maxilla and mandible if you
can see it is directly attached to the
tooth
foreign
[Music]
attached to the tooth here
and there is no spring piston and Tube
mechanism this is here you have spring
though there is Rod somewhat hybrid
mechanism disease and in the posterior
end it is attached to the upper molar
but anterior end a hook is attached to
the wire it is not attached to the any
part of the
dentition but it exacts its force on the
canine bracket so this is nothing but
your forces the forces is the hybrid of
what we call it as an herbs and a Jasper
jumper okay
shall I move to the next one are you
clear up to here the difference between
helps and forces
so this is your forces
so this is your Power Scope recently
used these are the two most commonly
used one is the forces Appliance and one
is the Power Scope Power Scope very easy
to install but there are difficulties of
dissolvement of the appliance very very
easy to apply can you clearly see no
part of the appliance is later directly
attached at the posterior into the molar
or to anterior ended the canine region
in the
mandible they are attached to the wires
with the help of a screw this is the
only the functional appliance that gets
attached to the wire component not any
part of the main component of the
dentition it is one of the advantages
this is how this is called as Power
Scope this is called as Power Scope
these two are of course first is forces
next is your Power Scope these are the
two commonly used appliances this is
also piston and Tube mechanism similar
to herbs but is not attached directly to
the tooth is it clear
all of you become silent
feeling hungry
yes yes yes yes yes
thank you
now
[Music]
after telling all this you can easily
identify what is this
yes
yes
the spring very flexible it won't be
straight it is more flexible one of the
advantages it is more flexible it allows
the mandible to grow different and
decide but since it is flexible it is
not rigid in correcting the
the mandible forwards so that is why it
has not become much success but it is
very patient friendly
now you got all the four
if at all any question is asked
so these are all the means of Jasper
jumper it gets distorted
it is more flexible
so what is this looking like which
appliance it is looking like to all of
the things which I have discussed so far
which appliance it is looking like
yes it is looking close to the first it
is the recent modification of Webster
plans
the pistol and Tube mechanism instead of
attaching at the canine region by the
crown portion it is attaching to the
lower molar whatever it may be the the
principle is to propel the mandible
forward it is called as advancing if at
all there is a chance you make question
on this what is the most modified
version of the herbs it is advancing
okay
so this is one of the another Appliance
with you the elastics simple Appliance
it is called as carrier motion Appliance
you see the attachment of elastics Class
2 elastics pulling the mandible extra
overall appliances just on cookies there
this is given in profit that's why I got
doubt and uh I created this slide
so remaining all they pushes the
mandible forward whereas this is pulls
the mandible from anterior to backward
others will push the mandible from back
to forward this is called as carrier
motion Appliance there is no direct
attachment between the upper and lower
except by the way of elastics
and we have same thing small rod and
hook mandible or protraction appliances
these are only the maximum things in
functional appliances that are being
used of course there are around 120
modifications of functional appliances
that are used tested all around the
world but that is not important to you
remember this the removable
functional appliances
at gear not covered it is not
that much important headgear you can
easily identify that's the problem they
won't go deep into if permits will see
next class what do you want in headgear
actually
so now we see
get in motion Appliance
so career motion Appliance
is not directly attached between the
so it is not directly attached by any
one of the attachments so what we do is
so in all these appliances we are trying
to push the mandible from Back to Front
the force is generated at backwards and
pushing the mandible forward forward but
if you can observe the carrier we are
pulling the mandible forward from a
Anchor Point situated in the anterior
region okay
is it clear
with only the difference and there is no
direct attachment between the upper and
lower
just accept and
elastic world
so this is a simple mandible or
protraction Appliance no piston and Tube
mechanism just a simple Rod will be
there in the tube it is mandibular
protraction Appliance
so chats nowadays the tats are also
given
what type of Anchorage is it
so it is a very direct location
and uh
yes yes yes
that's my output question so actually
the question is wrong
so all tabs are stationary and courage
that means
they are the anchor units they remain
stationary
if it all permitted they will be moodly
but the word if we have the choice
between two things it is absolute
Anchorage that means not a single
millimeter of movement occurs in the
chats that is why it is called as
absolute Anchorage
so no doubt it is stationary one a
question of this type is given you have
to take a choice because it is a
multiple choice then best of the worst
you have to take a choice so it is an
absolute the meaning absolute means the
anchor unit absolutely won't move not
intended Direction it intends to move
the reactive units only
so another important uh question is this
is also given in one's
how do you identify different types of
expansion appliances
yes first thing is you have to see
whether their tooth bone or tissue burn
or both
so if if at all if anything is given
like this it is meant to put
an acrylic
so
banded
first banded taking only support from
the tooth next is a tissue Bond whether
they are taking the
support from the tissue so banded tutu
and tissue bone both
they take from the tissue and leave
bands they are very stellar and S-Type
if you have only the Bandit taking from
the tooth then it is
what is call it as
I can or hyrax
so the difference between hyrax and
Isaac is the type of beat screw or the
expansion mechanism
here it is called as mini mini expander
so just they're turning the nut it will
be
compressing the coil when the compresses
the coil starts expanding the arch due
to its Force so it is a purely tooth
bone fixed six
so it is an Isaac and type of appliance
so now you can see here the difference
is icon is
tooth bone so this is Batman banded
dude there is no tissue given here
tissue supported here also it is not
touching the palate if it touches the
palette these things it becomes a see
here the hierarch can be made as a
tissue bone also if acrylic touches if
it is not touching and simply it is
using a screw in the middle and taking
the support is either it is can be a
better man screw or it is an hyrax screw
if a tissue component is present on the
parietal side
foreign
ER or
it may be a harsh type of parital
expander
is it clear
shall I move to the next topic
any doubts
so what is this Appliance
first identify the appliance sometimes
they may ask you to identify the
appliance
yes and what type of Anchorage it
provides
what is the lip Bumper in Upper arch
called
yes it is called less than all the
plants in Upper art it is lip bumper it
takes support
from your lower lip it provides muscular
Anchorage
we are discussing about the lip packs
this is where the lip pads uh work
next same vaccinator mechanism and
functional Matrix Theory they try to
Shield up the lip muscles they allow the
tooth to dentition to grow are mandible
to grow forward at the same time
in the case of flip pads is restricted
here but in lip packs
the force is debated distally to the
molar area and Molar gets digitalization
so we have Dan hulls Appliance this can
be used the lip bumper can be used as
removable and fix most of the times it
is used as a fixed Appliance
and next uh
nowadays slowly they have gone deep into
the giving this type of headgear this
headgear I'm going to discuss so when is
this given what is this
what is this Appliance
what is this Appliance basically
this is a face mask
this is face mask when it is given what
are the conditions in which a phase must
be given
a first mask is given when there is a
retuded maxilla combined with maxillary
prognatism or not mandibular prognitive
or not then there is maxillary recognize
them combined with mandible or
prognatism or not you will go for what
is called as face mask or reversible
headgear
reversible headgear
are ventrally acting at gear all the
headgear will pass to the dorsal side
except this which exact Force to the
ventral side the front of our body is
ventral if you remember the anatomical
position this is our dorsal side
so mid face is nothing but your
magnolite is called as reversible
headgear where it takes Anchorage from
it takes Anchorage from the your the
frontal bone and the chin region frontal
bone and the chin region it takes
support so it restricts the growth of
the mandible and it pulls the growth of
the maxilla out so it is given in class
three conditions where there is
initially there is retro magnetic
maxilla
so
now they are going little bit deep and
they are asking about
the type of
appliances type of face masks so
remember all face masks have this
component and a connecting metal
framework
and intraoral Appliance
and these elastics is wearing elastics
to pull the
maxel out these elastics usually in
normal direction of maxilla they are
given it at 20 degrees to the occlusal
plane so that Maxwell grows normally to
the
downwards and forwards
so remember this framework
why I am telling is we are going to
discuss
so it is pretty small off face mask
so we have other types of delay type of
face mask
and another is the terbinger or bottle
you can see the bottle shaped bottle
shaped framework here
it is called as
turbinger the other is delays face mask
which has a wide face metallic frame
so these are the three types
and the turbanger face mask
it is below the below the closure plane
20 degrees below the occlusial plane
20 degrees below
to the occlusion plane
okay
and elastics
these are very easy to identify
I have seen one question what is the
distance between two holes in a small
and uh
larger teaching
recent one of the exams
so usually this is e chain in each end
for small it is between uh the Gap the
distance between is 2.5 millimeters and
for large it is 4.4 millimeter and of
course it depends upon many factors I
don't know why they have been questioned
it depends upon the diameter of the Ring
so when elastic rings are continuous it
is called as itching remember that for
small it is 2.5 millimeters between the
two
centers of the Rings for large it is 4.4
millimeter of course for small it is 0.1
inch diameter for large it is 0.16
0.16 diameter
okay ready Dot
so what is the distance in small between
the holes
it is
2.5 millimeters and
yes yes point one inch diameter 0.1 inch
diameter
so for a large it is 4.4 and 0.16 inch
diameter
for large 0.16 diameter yes
0.16 inch diameter for large yes yes
exactly correct
and these are the different types of
elastics elastic modules
elastic languages elastic separators
any question you can get most of the
times
they'll give the how the elastics are
where what type of elastic these are
patients are using if it is worn like
this it is called as the class one
elastics horizontal if it is wearing
in diagonal connecting the two arches it
is nothing but your Bakers
class two elastics from upper molar to
lower canine it is class three elastics
of course it is correction for posterior
Cross by this question is given many
times why this elastics are worn here so
it is given for it is for correction of
it is for correction of the posterior
cross bites of single tooth these are
box elastics for open bite and these are
WR M or any shape what it may be these
are called as settling elastics why
these are given these are called as
diagonal elastics diagonal elastics are
worn from canine of upper Arch from
right side to the left side lower Canon
they are used for midline correction
they are used for midline correction
these are the various uses of our uh
elastics
so these are given what are this they
are given once they ask it's very simple
question and uh separator they mask
about uh separator this is one of the
common non-elastic separator that is
being used it is called as kessling
separator or canceling spring
it is called as gasoline separator or
gasoline spring
and uh recently I've seen with a little
DMR
foreign
deflection will be in a straight line
from there
proportional limit or there is percent
deflection and
the difference between range up to the
yield point is called range so spring
point after deflection or clinical
loading actors you call it as spring
back
this and the most common question is
asking the areas between the load end
reflection curve what is the area up to
the whole failure point is called what
is that
up to the point of
the yield point or proportional limit
area is called one is resilience and the
another is formability these things
they are given in a DMR sometimes if
they want to check you in relation to
the arch wires they will give you this
question
so another favorite question
where you read in the pedo or ortho
you should be able to identify this uh
what is this
yes what are the other names of it
intro or Appliance yes yes
and you should be able to know where
they are given this is given many times
and all the appliances filled in tube
and they are given uh vessel is an
interceptive or preventive procedure
okay good 20 procedures
space maintainers are all preventive
space regainers are all interceptive
procedures remember this simple
space maintenance all preventive space
regainers are
intercept two
another favorite question quad helix
this Appliance what is the appliance
that is given
during mixed dentition speed
that helps in skeletal expansion
Squad helix
quad Helix it may be by Helix if two
times if only two Helix are given
it is given as
by Helix it may be fixed or removable it
comes with
your tongue spikes
no no no rapid macular no it is not a
kind of Rapid Nicole extension it is a
slow maxillary expansion that too
limited to only to the mixed dentition
period slow macular expansion limited to
mixed dentition period
what is this Appliance
this also once you've got s night I what
is the full name of it
yes
parallel expander it is called as
knightai parietal expander good
so sometimes this is given with uh
visualization as well as expansion also
we can slightly modify it and given for
digitalization but most of the times we
give it for
the expansion of the arch
what is this Appliance
pendulum Appliance why it is given
why it is it is not pinned X I will come
to the pendex pendulum Appliance is
purely a digitalizing appliance where
you have the Nancy parietal button this
is your Nancy parietal button for
Anchorage which takes support from the
palette and the premolar and digitalizes
the molar
how much force it exits it is also given
specialization of molars maxillary
molars
he has 250 grams of course what wire it
is made up of
notes grants TMA wire 0.36 TMA wire good
you can easily identify this Appliance
yes yes the stainless steel usually not
given it is made with PMA wire only if
TMA wire is not available you can go for
the stainless steel but it is usually
made with a TMA where what is this what
what are the things you can see here you
can see a Nancy palatal button
you can see an expansion screw
you can see a
Appliance so our friends are waiting
many of the months I did it is appendix
can you name what is another name for it
another name for it
so it is one of the appliances that is
used for expansion as well as the
digitalization
so it is called as healer spindleism
Appliance yes
it is called as highlights pendulum
Appliance
what is this another
so why it is used it is a Bluegrass
Appliance
who has given this
I put the answer also there if you
notice it
it is called as Haskell Appliance
is that this shrinks with balls for
tongue
tongue thrusting habit is an exercise
for tongue trusting habit
either in the anterior end or the
posterior and
so it is called less Haskell Appliance
you can easily identify this Appliance
if the Rings are present
what is this
why is this useful first of all
this is called as W Appliance as the
name says white is used for
yes but he has not given expansion of
the arch
it is used only to treat the
posterior crossbite the two in
early permanent indentation or late
mixed dentition
it is a pixel type of one yes very good
once they are given what is the purpose
of this before that in 2017 or after the
2019 they ask you to identify the
appliance
so this is your WR chop lines this is
directly taken from profit
so some of the appliances which are
closed the problem lines
uh I'm searching for profit and get it
this project Appliance if you can see
that
instead of it is standing towards
palatal area it is projecting towards
the
tongue surface it is also user for
expansion just like your cup in Spring
instead of facing the parietal parallel
to parallel it is lying it is trying to
control the tongue and when it expands
the spring expands it expands the
parital then this gets corrected can I
this is Crozet Appliance where you can
see in apparent lower Earth
while you have it has a molar uses some
finger spring like things if you can see
the difference between
so there are no finger Springs in
the
clear W shape Parts only it is given in
maxillary Arch whereas your Crosshair
touch in the help of finger Springs
and
this transverse connector
is perpendicular to the parity instead
of parallel of course any type of slow
maxillary expansion whether it's given
in maxillary or mandible or Earth is
called as far as plate don't confuse
your simple holiday appliance which you
use a slow magnetic expansion and a
removable one is called as your swords
plate your Swatch plate
a split plate first plate anything
okay you try to remember between project
Appliance and the WR clients because
once W Appliance is there there are
chances of giving the closet Appliance
a little bit
points will go little bit of Deep
shall I stop or can I take it takes half
an hour of time shall we have another
session or
can I complete this
are you okay for me it's no problem
I'm still energetic
yes yes yes then okay okay
and a little bit going to the
questions which are given
fixed functional apply pixel appliances
so what is the key the ligature this is
given here
so this is nothing but sliding mechanism
in pixel appliances we try to retract
the two
either by Springs or by sliding the wire
along the brackets or moving the teeth
with the wire if we move with the wire
with loops it is called as non-sliding
mechanics or frictionless mechanics or
Loop mechanics if we Slide the wire it
is called as sliding mechanics since we
are sliding it there will be friction it
is called as frictional methods so here
they are given what is this is active
french fry lace back to active tie back
or passive tie back
so first we go to small
so this also once they are given this is
a metallic like a tire just I'm trying
to cover small few my points this is
called as preformed metallic like a
chapter usually made with uh all
ligature wires are made with 0.09 to
0.12 most each most commonly used point
zero nine the preformed metal 0.09 is
called as Kobayashi twice they're called
remember that this is called as
Kobayashi ties and you have elastomeric
like it just here
so the Type X if they are not having any
module they are called as passive less
bags instead of type X we call it as
less bags usually to prevent the Tipping
of the anterior teeth they do not
actually drive the teeth posteriorly the
whole anterior teeth in such cases you
call it as lace back you call it as
simply less back or passive tie back and
if a module is given if the module is
given it actively pushes pulls the push
of the teeth if the module is given in
the molar region it is called as type 1
active type act it tries to pull the
anterior teeth towards the molar region
hey
that
active module is given in the canine
region it tries to protract the molars
forward this is type 2 so a missile
module is Type 2 and the digital module
is a
type 1 the digital module type 1 tries
to move the canine back a BCL module
given in the anterior end of the current
tries to protract the molar okay
okay
but this is what it is given in the
molar area it is nothing but
since module is given it is an active
type Act so it is given in the molar
region it is a type 1
active tie back trying to retract the
anterior teeth
yes kind distally good
so if you can see these Styles this is
figure of eight type
it is called Figure of eight means it
looks like eight in between figure of
eight pipe the wire is Twisted it is
called as the French type French diet is
called if it is Twisted
okay
and remember uh instruments uh you have
to remember
this is
instrument for forming the ligature
types and the spin and ligature cutter
it appears as a small cutter but not
that much size of pigs it is my nature
form of your wire cutter what we use in
our daily practice this is called as pin
and ligature cutter
so this is how it looks like
instruments also for every alternate
exam from 2000 uh
19 9 much earlier than 2017 each exam is
having for identification of one
Appliance
uh this means instrument
so this is what is called as friction
mechanics so the wire is sliding on the
brackets later you use a closer coil
spring you can use an elastics with a
removable or fixed elastics or e-chain
all this comes under the friction
mechanics or sliding mechanics remember
this just and when you use a loop
what is this Loop
what is that Loop shown in the diagram
foreign
this is normal tear drop Loop yes peer
Looper teardrop Loop why I am asking
this question is this is repeated
that are called as frictionless
mechanics so what is the spring given
here
what is it looking like yes yes
foreign
if I type from canine to Canine whole
anterior segment is made to slide on the
wire or it remains stable the teeth
moves the bracket moves on The Wire so
that is why it is called as sliding
mechanics since it is sliding Whenever
two bodies slide over there there is
friction in volatility that is why it is
called as friction mechanics you
understand this now another one is it is
moving along the wire and loop mechanics
it moves with the wire you have done
removable appliances Some Loops
this is nothing but your closer coil
spring so you make it a closed spoiled
spring you pull the wire back and you
make it to open what this does it tries
to close back so in closing back it is
bringing the tooth along with the wire
not the tooth moves on The Wire the
tooth moves along with the wire so this
is called as frictionless mechanics or
Loop mechanics am I clear now
foreign
yes okay thank you
so again there are two things in
friction or like if I use from molar to
molar it is called
complete Hardware if I use only in parts
of segments it is called as segmental if
it is from molar to molar either it may
be in sliding or this thing it is called
as continuous mechanics if I use only
one part of mechanics one part if I
segregate my posterior in anterior and
try to pull it it is called as sectional
methods
so this is a k Loop mechanics why it is
called K Loop
so this is also an uh open coil spring
so a open coil spring made is like that
and it is placed in closing position it
tries to push the teeth then left it
outside so what it functions what it
helps to do it is called as kalra
Springer okay it is given by yes for
separation
to put it in other words it is given to
digitalize the molar so why we want we
want space there are different methods
of gaining space so this case spring
tries to move the molar backwards
so it is made up of TMA wire
so another spring given by karasar is
ksr Loop so remember this shape
it is like teardrop but class forward is
there
so kesar means
simultaneous intrusion and retrovision
these are the common Springs which we
use
is it clear
I wonder some of your friends are still
joining
in some of remaining
feeling hungry and living anyhow it is
just 15 to 30 minutes now this is what
is I am talking about sectional
sectional mechanics so what type of
sectional mechanism is it frictional or
sliding mechanics
what is that here used for
no I am using spring
when I'm using spring means non-sliding
non-frictional non-fictional uh you
didn't get the concept should I repeat
again
so here
I close with the coil and make it to
open so when the coil closes it brings
the teeth along with it itself so it is
called as frictionless or non-sliding
now friction non-sliding or Loop
mechanics Loop mechanic since I am using
a part of the arch see if you can see
that my wire is not running from this
molar to that molar it is running up to
the canine it is called as segmental
segmental mechanics if it runs from this
side to that side as a continuous wire
it is called as continuous mechanics
now this is when I give a loop
it is a loop mechanics or non-sliding
mechanics this also given once what is
this Loop they have given it is very
easy to identify now we can clearly see
what I am talking about sectional here I
have made it a sectional wire from
canine to Canine one wire and if I move
canine to one can I into canine I
retract it is called as nmos retraction
and most retraction of anteriority if I
retract only canines it is canine
detraction followed by retraction of
your incisors so anyhow if I use a loop
simply remember if I use a loop it is a
frictionless mechanics or
it is a non-sliding mechanics
no no no no no non-sliding and
frictionless and loop or fail sliding
and frictional mechanics are same
non-sliding yes when there is no sliding
no friction I am trying to close by
Loops it is a loop mechanic
Loop mechanics non-sliding non-fiction
are one and the same on the other hand
the friction mechanics and sliding
mechanics
okay depending upon
how many segments I made use of my
entire art it may be a continuous so
both in sliding and non-flighting
mechanics it may be a continuous wire or
it may be a
non-continuous and depending upon the
type of the space closure either I can
retract can I only followed by
the Inc is or I can retract n Mass from
canine to Canine back
yes you can use any method frictionless
method or what is the difference between
a
first of all it is a removable or
a fixed one
yes it is a removable one there is a
tongue cripper it is a spike
okay
or somebody are asking about uh
so these are the two appliances which
are used for
patients
so one is with screw managed with nasal
stents so the Latham Appliance is used
for popular for expanding and learning
day make the resistance if the pin
retained devices it is difficult to
adjust for the patient but
we can manipulate the Magnolia segments
easily but if in the cases in the middle
of the heart and this is less alvular
molding pnme is called as Grace on
natural lawn molding it has nicer
strength it has no what I call it as a
screw it is written with the help of
tapes okay
and it is called as uh Appliance what we
are talking about it is called as a
so this is why I am calling it as
whether you call it as a tank creeper
Spike spikes are a little bit aggressive
they cause injury to the patient
so spikes
they hurt you also
so remember this is called as Herrick
device
no nothing is punishable like this all
these are called as reminder appliances
how severe is your tongue trust you give
these appliances so what is called what
is the function of all these appliances
to make an engram in the brain so that
the patient uh
won't get the tongue outside when it
gets it should hurt it is a reminder
Appliance
and
the more aggressive the remainder will
be the more the patient will remember
so he tries to stop this habit whether
it may be in
a uh this thing contrasting or it may be
a habit breaking Appliance like you are
a thumb sucking usually this is given
for thumb sucking
so it is like a punishing Appliance we
may or may not use financial problems
okay
but remember that it causes bleeding so
if maximum you should avoid giving this
uh
Appliance rakes these are called as
rakes
so this we have discussed blue Grace
Appliance it can be even from sucking
Contracting anything you can give which
creates an exercise for your tongue
models
those again uh one more Appliance
so it is removable or fixed it's very
clear
is it uh
removal or it is a
removable or it is fixed so you can you
see bands here tongue thrusting habit
breaking Appliance
both options seems to the same material
okay
again it is a not it then
like
so this you can easily identify
this also given yes cheek retractor
yes yes yes yes no problem
oh these are the questions uh you got
so two things which are used for
measuring the force
one is the corrects which is uh I think
this is don't trick blocks or
dynamometer dental dynamometer these are
used for causing the amount of force
either with springs or elastics what we
apply these questions both are given in
previous entrances remembering done Trex
gauze is a piston like mechanism whereas
correct is a dial-like mechanism
so this which we have already discussed
so since
the labial paths are present
on the upper Arch this is used for
expansion of the upper Archer fluid of
the approach we need growth of the
approach when there is restricted
magnetic growth and maxillary growth is
restricted in a class 3 condition and of
course your triangle 3 is given in a
class 3 condition
so another question which we are
expecting I have put it in other words
what is the wire that exhibits the
difference between the loading and
unloading curves
first of all what is this called
difference between loading and unloading
what is the name given to it
if there is difference between loading
yes
it is called a hysteresis remember this
very important point it is exhibited by
the nitinol wire retinol wire
or night eye wire it is called as
hysteresis the difference between the
what is this
also given once
yes Boon Scotch why it is used in Boon
scotch
a Boon's cause is used for you can see
the measurements so it is used how far
from the inside tip the brackets are
kept in a slight wire technique they are
used bracket position measurement so
this is this is also called one of uh it
is used particularly in MBT technique
so both sides you have marking 3.54 4.55
like that this is used for MBT technique
MBT is a form of uh straight wire
technique recently used whereas this can
be used for your advice or any type of
try twice both these two are bracket
placement measuring not they are they
are not bracket placement instruments
they are measuring the height of bracket
placement bracket position measurement
instruments be careful why I am telling
this sometimes you may give an option of
bracket placement they are not used for
placement of brackets they are useful
for placement measuring after placement
they are measuring for measuring so what
is this you can expect this definitely
will get this time this question
what is this
yes
up to the knowledge yes intramoximal
slipper so already you have been trained
yes
nice dude
yes it is a proximal stripper and each
blades represents the amount of
thickness and the clearance can be
detected by leaves here
this is your orthodontic interproximal
Tripper very good
that's why I'm questioning what is this
instrument now you got the point why I
am telling
the placement of brackets for placement
of bands for removing bands for removing
brackets
yes it is a bracket place in instrument
it accelerated apparent after placing
the brackets with these instruments you
measure with a bracket measurement like
device or bull skulls and you adjust
accordingly and cure with like Theory
so another questions you may get uh
so band seater and band Six sorry it has
come here
oh I'll change it what is this
instrument
instrument here instrument shown here
yes it is a tweets instrument so these
things were if you had to get familiar
to its instrument it has two bigs which
are flat the tweets big instrument beats
player you use it for applying torque
they have to use it in the two not one
they have to use Rin to a set a pair of
instruments to be used to produce the
torque
so this is called as feed stalking
player exact name is feet stalking
player
you know some of your friends are still
joining after their dinner
so you know thanks player and uh address
player
you can easily identify them
so de-bonding player and the
banding player for deep ending player
you can see a round rubber tip is there
to remove the banks for the Deep bonding
to remove the brackets a sharp edges
that the tips may be present and
pointing towards each other this is
bracket removing player or the bonding
player whereas this is band removing
player or your
removal of bands you can see the round
safety thick there
and the whole player or band seating
players these are called
band cheating player
you can see serrated appearances they
are called as ho players the geographer
seating the player they have curved and
straight straight is used for upper and
the curve is used for lower Arch
and this is band Pusher sorry this has
come there this is by cheater a
toothbrush like thing for seedingly
bands this also once you got this
portion by sticker bite Pusher this is
band Pusher which is your like your
elevator usually not oral surgery
Department
accelerated
to push the bands in between the contact
points whereas a bite seater if not gone
inside properly we ask the patient to
bite on the this band bite this is
called as band Bitter or band seater
this is called as band pusher
so distal and cutter you can expect this
also this is 90 degrees can you see here
The Bigs are 90 degrees to the chunk and
a cutting tippet there this is used for
cutting the distal ends of the wire I
have to replace the wire it can be used
for both and rectangle wires
and of course what are these appliances
who may be better knowing nowadays
yes
they can be sxr they can be invisaligned
or they can be
aligner therapy clear anything anything
you can easily identify so for
Invisalign the Forerunner is the SX
retainer
yes or the aesthetic retainers they are
called
so another thing gone deep for some
entrances
and PJ those who are preparing for
ancient PJs you may expect this to go
through this in the profit the given
hierarchy that means which is more
stable predictable and Which is less
stable
they have given in uh
things see this
from short to HUB so the mandible
bringing forward is easier than pushing
it back
so this is called as hierarchy of oral
surgery
he was given in World entrances also
they have not given a
picture-based question but there are
chances they may ask ABCD which one is
first which one is the last so more
stable is the maxilla can be brought up
mandible can be far when can we
corrected any direction but bringing the
mandible backward because it interferes
with the function of the tongue and also
the muscles of mastication and Maxwell
are down also it closes the viral space
so what all that why does the World
cavity space are easy to retain remember
simply this it may be Max the lab or
mandible forward
so just simply mug up this thing
and uh
this also you can find in the recent
account so you know about three
discrepancies of envelope three
envelopes of discrepancy see can you see
here a green one what is that envelope
of discrepancy one two three four but we
know only three what is the fourth one
one is by orthodontic treatment one is
by Orthopedic orthodontic carb by
functional appliances one is by your
orthogonic surgery what is this green
one what is the green one of envelope
disturbancy
can you guess
we have discussed it already
no it is not pilcodontics
so it is stats your skeletal Anchorage
or temporary Anchorage devices remember
this this question you may expected or
skeletal Anchorage
so this one has recently added this is a
roughing so because there is no proper
literature support but all the cases
have shown that
there is a range where we cannot be
treated just by orthodontic treatment or
which do not exactly require a surgery
can be treated by the skeletal Anchorage
or stats
what is this Appliance
what is the procedure shown below
foreign
feeling hungry
yes
yes yes yes it is marping it is Mark pay
you can see here
the mini implants mini implant assisted
rapid palatal expansion it is not
hierexoramic just it is not a simple it
is rme of course it is assisted by the
micro mini implants are micro implants
it's more pain you can expect this
question also it can be again purely
uh tissue bone or bone burn
now here clean is hybrid it is burn burn
by micro implants and it is supported on
the tooth also it is bone tooth
supported and the bone burn for some
things it will be only bone burn
so what are these brackets called SL
bracket skipped brackets standard
brackets and back brackets so it's the
you should be expect question from on
this since this has a shutter like thing
it doesn't require any
ligation process so this is called a
self ligator only just pushing the lid
or flip it
it's called as self-regation brackets
you may expect this question
okay I think it is a
time for our dinner any questions
it's always some of the questions which
I try to cover
and not gone much deep which is not at
all required
what you want actually Naveen theory of
retention means
yes Loops are used in frictionless
method
Loop method or frictionless method or
non-sliding method it is called
so Matic rotation is a complex subject
we will discuss it another point of time
as there is no fixed terminology using
it
rotations rotations of the mandible to
the maximum one is the direct rotation
of if we measure
the lower border of the
mandible to the skull it is called as
total Matrix or intra Matrix depending
upon the examiner sometimes what happens
is when this mandible is rotating their
records changes within the mandible
itself
so example this is called as poor this
is called a symphysis this is called as
gorion and this is base of the mandible
there is option in absorption occurs
within this mandibular bone May produce
relative changes of the line the
mandible or line to the line of cranial
line these changes are called within the
mandible occurring changes that is
called as sometimes intra Matrix within
the Matrix or depending upon the
uh terminology what the author uses so
one thing is the rotation sector in
between the mandible that appears to
outside and one is the real one that
actors in The Core related to the
cranium
the terminology difference interrupted
headgear
so Hector is both interrupted and uh
intermittent if anything you remove it
becomes intermittent
but if you keep
and apply the force
if it goes on decreasing
and reaches the zero it is interrupted
how you use dependency so you take a
removable Appliance
to take a removable Appliance and
just put
one mm of expansion and put in the mouth
so it expands
from highest Force to the
shut up all of fish and after expansion
is created there will be zero Force
so same thing
if you remove the
if you use it as a removable type and
remove it there will be no Force at all
the same one if you fix it and start
then it becomes an interactive Force
interactive and intermittent is nothing
but depending upon how you are going to
use the appliance not based on the force
system based on the force system you
have to continuous and interrupt you a
continuous force is one only their
partial decay of the initial force and
before the initial Force becomes zero
you will activate it whereas in
interactive forces you wait till it
becomes zero and activate it that's the
difference
the elastics how you use it depends
elastics also will come from a high
level two that's what I am discussing
high level to zero it comes when it
comes to zero
how you are using elasticity doesn't
mean elastic simply you cannot put it as
an interrupted forces
our intermediate or continuous forces
usually elastics they won't Decay to the
zero they won't Decay to the zero
because and they become zero you will
