in the pin comment this is Ben Ben
started a store that sells automobile
parts like brakes exhausts tires
lubricants and car Interiors he made a
good start with his business and
achieved profits however as days passed
by along with his growing business he
face some business challenges he
received orders from a variety of
customers with different needs and
requirements for example the northern
states had higher demand for performance
parts than others and the eastern states
demanded farm truck parts and lubricants
more and apart from this a few products
weren't performing well in the market
and remained unsold so what is
T So before we understand what exactly
is Tabu let us imagine a simple
situation imagine that you're an F
worker and you get some loads of data uh
maybe like millions of rows or billions
of rows and you are supposed to extract
the insights of that particular data so
what do you do you basically load that
data into a database and try to write
the SQL commands and then try to extract
the insights of that particular data so
this kind of approach is basically timec
consuming and you get exhausted now what
if you had a tool which could write all
the the SQL commands for you in the
background and all you had to do is just
to drag and drop the data sounds
interesting right so table is just the
same all you have to do is just drag and
drop the data and it will automatically
write all the SQL commands you ever
wanted to write on that particular data
and it will give you live data
interactions and advices for the future
now with this let us understand the
definition of table so basically tableu
is a business an analytical software
tool developed in America W helps people
to understand visualize and make
datadriven decisions in real time with
extreme agility and
accuracy now with this let us continue
with the next topic which will be about
the various versions of tableu so at
first we have the tableu desktop so tab
desktop is a data visualization
application to facilitate you to examine
virtually any kind of structured data
and generate High interactive beautiful
graphs dashboards and reports within
minutes once a quick installation you
can tie to virtually any data source
from spreadsheets to data warehouses and
display information in several graphic
perspectives designed to be easy to
utilize you'll be working more rapidly
than ever before next we have the T
server it is a business intelligence
application that offers browser based
analytics anyone can utilize it is a
rapid fire alternative to the slow pace
of traditional business intelligence
software it is an online solution meant
for sharing Distributing and
collaborating on content created in
table what makes table different it is
proposed to everyone there is no
scripting required so everyone can grow
to be an analytics expert you can grow
your deployment as you require it train
online for free find answers in minutes
and not in months that's the speciality
of
tableu now followed by the tableu server
we have tab
online so tab online is a business
intelligence application that offers
browser based analytics anyone can
utilize as discussed before it is a
rapid fire alternative to slow based
traditional business intelligence
software so Tabu online is a secure
cloud-based solution for sharing and
collaborating on Tabu views and
dashboards next up we have the Tabu
public so now I want to give you guys a
serious heads up if you're a beginner in
Tabu Tabu public is like an open source
whatever the data you choose to work on
using tab public it goes to public so
kind of like tab public is not
preferable if you want to work on your
company's sensitive and confidential
data tab public is a free software to
facilitate anyone to get connected to a
spreadsheet or a file and create
interactive data visualizations for the
web it is delivered as a service that
permits the user to be up to and running
overnight with tab public users can
construct amazing interactive visuals
and publish them quickly without the
help of programmers or ID it is designed
for organizations to facilitate their
websites with interactive data
visualizations there are higher limits
on the size of data you can work with
and among other features you can keep
your underlying data hidden and lastly
we have tab reader tab reader is a free
desktop application that you can use
used to open and interact with data
visualizations built in tab desktop with
tab reader you can filter drill down and
discover humongous lch of data now
moving ahead we have the features of w
so these are the few important features
that you might want to
consider those are the first one robust
security T takes special care of data
and user security it has a foolproof
Security based authentication and
permission systems for data connections
and users access T also gives you the
freedom to integrate with other security
protocols such as active directory
Kerberos Etc an important point to note
here is that the tab practices lowlevel
filtering which helps in keeping the
data secure followed by that we have the
collaboration and sharing feature tab
provides convenient options to
collaborate with other users and
instantly share data in the form of
visualizations sheets dashboards Etc in
real time it allows you to to securely
share data from various data sources
such as on promise oncloud hybrid Etc
instant and easy collaboration and data
sharing helps in getting quick reviews
or feedback on data leading to a better
overall analysis of it another extremely
useful feature of tableu is the use of
Time series and forecasting easy
creation of trend lines and forecasting
is possible due to table's powerful
backend and dynamic front end you can
easily get data prediction such as a
forecast or trend line by simply
selecting some options and drag and drop
operations using your concern
Fields next up we have live and inmemory
data T ensures connectivity with both
live data sources and data extraction
from external sources as inmemory data
this gives the user the flexibility to
use the data from more than one type of
data source without any restrictions you
can use data directly from data source
by establishing live data connections or
keep that data in memory by extracting
data from a data source as per their
requirement tab provides additional
features to support data connectivity
such as an automatic extract refreshes
notifying the user upon live connection
fail
Etc next we have informative View and
even the mobile view one of the key
features of table and the one that got
its popularity is its wide range of
visualizations in t you can make
visualizations such as bar chart pie
chart Gan chart bullet chart motion
chart tree map box plot and many more
like you name it table you got it you
can select and create any kind of
visualizations easily by selecting the
visualization type from the show me tab
apart from that it is capable to
represent data in mobile view as well
tab acknowledges the importance of
mobile phones in today's world and
provides the mobile versions of Tab app
the next and the last feature is that
being capable of accessing data from
various kinds of data sources T offers a
wide range of data source options where
you can get connected and fetch data
from data sources ranging from on
promise files spreadsheets relational
databases non-relational databases
online cloud data for data warehouses
and many more so followed by the
features now we'll discuss about the
advantages of Tabu so following are the
advantages of using Tabu first one it
has remarkable visualization
capabilities of course the unparallel
capabilities of visualizing information
is on top of the list of tab use
software benefits followed by that we
have the ease of use the tools intuitive
manner of creating graphics and a
userfriendly interface allows
non-developers to utilize the basic apps
functionalities to the fullest users
arrange raw data into catchy diagrams in
a dragon drop way which facilitates
information analyzing and eliminates the
need for the help of IT department and
pattern
building next high performance apart
from its high visualization
functionality users rates its overall
performance as robust and reliable the
tool also operates fast on big data
which makes it powerful performance on
an important point on the list of the
advantages of tab and next is the mobile
friendliness one of our best advantages
out of the table benefits is its
efficient mobile application which is
available for both IOS and Android it
adds Mobility to tab users and allows
them to keep statistics at their
fingertips as well as supports their
function ality that desktop and online
versions have and finally we have the
thriving community and Forum W has a
rich Community the number of w fans who
invest their expertise and skills in the
community is increasing rapidly business
users can beef up their knowledge on
data processing and Reporting and get
many useful insights in this community
also Forum visitors are ready to help
settle any user issues and also share
their experience
next up we have the disadvantages of
Tabu the first major disadvantage is the
high cost the Tabu is not the most
expensive visualization software
especially compared to such business
intelligent Giants such as oracles and
IBM Solutions all the same the license
is quite costly for small and medium
companies which makes it one of the
considerable tab's
disadvantages next is the inflexible
pricing TBL sales stem is not flexible
enough to provide Case by case approach
for their customers ignoring the fact
that each company has its own unique
requirements for visualization tool
package the TBL sales model requires
clients to purchase and extend license
from the
start as a result a lot of companies
that you stab you arrive at the
conclusion that they don't need all
their license features they would prefer
to buying a set of requirements and
scale them if necessary followed by that
the next disadvantage is poor after
sales support on multiple message boards
users complain that table software lacks
proper after sales maintenance if
customer has software performance
problem the support team does not settle
the matter by investigating the problems
Route and eliminating it next we have
the pobi capability or the poor business
intelligence capability as previously
mentioned the tool provides best and-
class information visual interpretation
however it lacks the functionality
required for a fully fleshed business
intelligence tools such as large scale
reporting the building of data tables
and statistic layouts and lastly the
poor versioning only the recent TBL
versions support revision history while
for the older ones software rolling back
is impossible now with the advantages
and disadvantages discussed let's move
into the top companies hiring the
companies which are desperately looking
for TBL experts are Accenture ey PepsiCo
Deo Wells fago Cap Gemini and many more
now let's discuss the humongous and and
handsome salaries offered by this Tech
Giants so according to glass store the
average salary of a tab expert in
America is 82,000 Grand and for a
beginner it is somewhere around $60,000
perom and at the highest rate it is
$110,000 per anom similarly the average
salary of a TBL expert in India is
56,000 perom and for a beginner it is
somewhere around 360,000 and
and for a highly skilled experienced T
expert the salaries range from 8 lakh
75,000 perom so during this session um
we are going to see so many
functionalities of Tabo okay so before
we proceed further as you already aware
powerbi what is bi is business
intelligence tool
okay Advanced Excel business
intelligence by this time you should
give me a clear answer okay getting data
getting info from data finding
connections okay you see you have to put
all these points together then only
become as a bi business
intelligence if you're putting all of
them together then only it become
business
intelligence not just data
visualizations not just importing the
data bi will help us to get the data
from various sources
bi tool will help us to get the data
from various sources if you have data in
Excel you can import the data from Excel
if you have data in SQL or Oracle or any
other database your bi tool should be in
a position to get the data the data can
be a live or the data can be batch
batchwise data or offline report okay
once data is in what we have have to do
have you remember what are what are the
five common stages we have to perform
yes what are the five common stages we
have to perform I have very clearly
mentioned you take any bi tool yes guys
you take any bi
tool if you take any bi tool every bi
tool follow how many exactly five common
stages see it is not mandatory to
remember five common stages remember it
is not mandatory to remember five common
stages but it always good to know about
them life cycle of B2 life cycle of
report okay so first one is we have to
collect the data collection of the
data right once we have data we'll go
for what hello my dear friends we'll go
for
transformation what the third stage
going for a data model and creating a
join have you remembered this fourth
stage is doing analysis and
visualizations and fifth stages
publish if you remember five common
stages it's make easy for you to go what
report
preparation simple now these are five
common stages we have in across all the
bi tools and bi tool will help us to get
the data from various sources and the
data can be transformed based on our
business
requirement the data can be transformed
based on business
requirement and we can perform certain
data
manipulations or we can get some
insights why we have to get the insights
from the raw data to take okay decisions
now in simple words in simple words by
the help of bi tool what we can do we
can
extract meaningful
information we can extract meaningful
information or we can find what
patterns or we can bring
insides okay and see you have have raw
data you are going to perform certain
calculations why to get some meaning out
of it to find out certain patterns to
get more insights yeah why we have to do
all these things why we have to do all
these things why why why I should find
out the
patterns why should I find out the
insights why come on why why we should
do all these
things come on guys why we should do all
these things to solve the business
correct to solve the business issues
right or this bi tool will help us to
take to take wise
decisions actionable
items got
it clear all of you so this is a use or
purpose of having a business inter
elligence tools how many business
intelligence tools we have come on you
have to list down quickly you have to
give the answers how many bi tools we
have a lot how many remember Excel is
not a bi tool now we do have powerbi we
have
table right we have click sense we have
Zoho right SQL is not being VI tool
remember okay SQL and Excel those are
not VI
tools alter YX Etc clear all of you now
one question can I call powerbi or tblo
as ETL tool can we
consider all these bi
tools as ETL tool
yes can we consider them as a ETL tool
if you say s you are
wrong you're wrong all these ba tools
are
not ETL tools you cannot call them as a
ETL tool
no okay why I am highlighting this point
here because you have already gone
through powerbi so I want to add few
more
points in during inter you they may ask
you hey table is a ETL tool you should
say no it is not a ETL tool but if you
notice functionality of any bi
tool all of them are follows methodology
of ETL tool got it you can you take
powerbi or table or click sense or any
other VI tool it will
follow it will follow method of
tool but those are not ETL tools clear
all of you you will see the flavor you
will see the flavor the methodology but
those are not actually ETL tools those
are purely bi TOS am I clear okay but so
most of the time you'll see tblo and
powerbi now is nowadays power Bas is not
uh leading the market second position is
Tabo
okay if not probably you can see click
sense in a third
position but as I mentioned earlier also
if you're good at one bi tool it's easy
to learn other bi tools also
clear alter VI mostly will see to do
data manipulation and all but not that
much used remember if you're good at one
bi tool remaining all bi tools are very
easy to learn okay so now today onwards
we are going to learn
what we are going to learn what
tab okay what I will do I will correlate
with powerbi so that you can quickly
recap what we have seen while you are in
a powerbi session okay I will correlate
don't mind if you you if you didn't
attend any powerbi session don't worry
we are going to learn table from
scratch clear okay guys tblo is also one
of the most famous and well known
bi2 okay so in Tabo we do have various
products different types of products we
have in Tabo what are those different
products we have look at my screen we do
have something called tblo
desktop we have something called tblo
desktop what is the use of having tblo
desktop what is the use of having tblo
desktop in this tblo
desktop we are authorized to prepare a
report in simple words to prepare a
report we'll use
what tblo desktop clear all of you to
prepare a report we'll use tblo desktop
this is like what powerbi
desktop this is like what
powerbi desktop now second point is
table desktop free version answer is
no this is not a free version not a free
version you have to
buy orb desktop free version yes it's a
free
version but table desktop you'll get for
14 days as a trial version 14 days as a
trial version
clear you can make use of tblo desktop
for only 14 days you see tblo desktop is
used to prepare a report as powerbi
desktop okay and it is not a free
version you have to pay Okay no Okay you
have to be okay no
problem but for 14 days yes you can use
it okay now wait a minute do we have
any do we have any
open sources for this Tableau answer is
yes what it is we have something called
tblo
public we have something called what
tblo public what is the use of this so
this is also to prepare a
report this also used for to prepare a
report again it's a free version it's a
free version you see something you are
getting
for money something we have no paid
version and something you are getting
for free that means what there must be
some difference between these two
correct there must be few differences
between these two so you'll see Tabo
public with limitations as it's a
free we'll have a table public it's a
free version but we'll have few
limitations so what what I will do I
will highlight those limitations also
and during our training we are going to
use tblo public
only clear but in real time which one
we'll
use in real time we'll go for a tblo
desktop we'll go for a tblo desktop but
during training will go for tblop
public perfect I have a question since
powerbi TBL programming to primly make
reports out of the given data which is
most preferred and why powerbi is mostly
used because it's a free version okay
it's a free version mostly nowadays
powerbi is being used beside the free
version last time also I highlighted few
points since powerbi is a Microsoft
product and we all are already using so
many Microsoft
products let's say operating system
Windows yeah and U database SQL and you
can see the email for for sending emails
we use Outlook and to have a to chat
with our colleagues we'll use
teams and when it comes to Cloud we'll
have aour and we have a SharePoint from
from Microsoft what not so these many
products we have been using so when I I
use power view also that will make us
yeah to integrate without any challenges
got
it not more Futures I would say you'll
not get any uh issues you'll not see any
compatibilities
issues and is easy to comparatively it's
very
easy if you compare tblo and powerbi
powerbi is a bit easy because powerbi is
a advanced version of excel
but when it comes to
tblo tblo also very nice we have very
very nice
interface plus when it comes to huge
amount of data tblo is the best
one okay performance- wise TBL is the
best one and when it comes to map
visuals you have more scope to customize
maps map visuals and you have more scope
to you know customize Dynamic VIs uals
in Tabo got it and Tabo is a older one I
would say the age of Tabo is around 15
years almost 15 years and power is
almost seven years 7 to eight
years got
it and which is the oh okay um asking
very good question using power tblo is
this a personal choice or or no no it's
it's a organization Choice om it's not
our personal choice but mostly both are
almost same concept wise same to same
you'll see different set terminologies
that's it interface is a bit different
but concept wise all bi tools work in a
similar
way and table is very expensive so so we
do have two different products here TBL
desktop and table public correct now we
have something called
what TBL data prep
so what is the use of having this table
data prep table data prep we have right
this is used to perform
what data cleaning
activities to perform data wrangling
job any correlation with
powerbi what do we have in powerbi to
perform data cleaning jobs data cleaning
activity exactly we have something
called what
power query editor my dear
friends okay I'm just correlating that's
it okay if you are not sure what is in
powerbi you don't need to worry I'm just
correlating so we have something called
Tablo data prep now is it free version
no this is also not a free version It's
a paid version you'll get this for 14
days as a
trial clear all of
you do we have any free version here as
we have a table public answer is no no
you don't have anything for free when it
comes to data prep you'll have this for
14 days as a trial version that's
it third one is we have something called
tblo
server tblo server if power is free then
why companies go for tblo is there any
major difference so that companies are
investing in tblo that's the reason most
of the companies nowadays switching from
tblo to power
and if you correlate the age of Tableau
is nearly uh 12 to 15 years but powerbi
is 7even years that means what earlier
people used to uh earlier many
organization before powerbi lunch they
used to work on tblo you see there's a
gap between six years between these two
you see six year so now since there was
nothing except tblo so they used to have
tblo but in but again as I mentioned in
terms of performance wise or visual wise
or interface wise TBL is a really good
one okay now tblo server what is the
tblo
server to share our reports to share
reports to end user we'll go for a tblo
server and this TBL server is nothing
but what on premises server
what do we have in
powerbi in powerbi we have something
called what powerbi report
server understood this is also on
premises server on premises server all
good why we have to go for a tablet
server once your report is ready we have
to share our report to end user so how
we can share this we are going to deploy
in TBL server this is on Prem Mr server
what do we have another server come on
what do we have another server we have
two
servers another one
what Tablo online so here what do we
have
powerbi services oh my goodness it's a
Cloud
Server it is a Cloud Server got the
point what is the use of having cloud
server same to share so now you have two
options either you can upload your file
in tblo server which is on premises or
if your company is using tblo online
which is Cloud Server there also you can
upload your
files am I
clear you have two different servers one
is tblo server and another one is tblo
online tblo server means on premises
tblo online means Cloud Server and these
are are paid versions by the way you're
not getting anything free here Tableau
online also you'll get free only for 14
days as a trial version after 14 days
you cannot use that Cloud Server
remember perfect now we have something
called what tblo public server also we
have what do we have we have a tblo
public server tblo public
server that means you can publish your
files
publish to
publish
reports publicly we'll use public server
also but in fact in real time we are not
going to use this Tabo public server
okay because it is available for all the
users now what else we have we do have
something called tblo
mobile we have something called tblo
mobile
okay here also we have a powerbi mobile
yes or no powerbi mobile if you want to
see your report in mobile phone also you
can install this mobile application
right now we have something called TBL
reader this is just to read your report
read to read
reports we cannot edit
this we can't edit
report but we can read it but we can
read report
ort clear all of you it is a interview
question they will ask you how many
different products we have in TBL you
see we have tblo
desktop we have tblo desktop where we
are going to prepare a
report got it it's a it's a paid version
and we have something called tblo public
which is which is free version and it is
used to prepare a report but in general
in real time you're not not going to use
this tblo public okay but Harish Kumar
guys we are going to use tblo public
during our training period
okay now we have something called
Tableau Data prep we'll use this Tableau
Data prep to perform the cleaning data
cleaning activity we can perform and few
data cleaning activity can be performed
in tblo desktop also this tblo data
prep it is launched just four years
before
this tblo data prep launched almost five
years before got it why they have
introduced data prep earlier we used to
perform all data triangl job being in
Tableau desktop but what is happening
because of to avoid performance issues
to avoid performance issues Salesforce
team launched tblo data prep and what
are what what they're saying hey dude if
you want to make a any data
transformation make use of Tableau Data
prep once data is cleaned you can you
can get this clean data in your for in
your da
desktop anyway we are going to see this
T data prep I will highlight once again
what is the flow in real time okay for
time being what you can understand these
many products we have we have something
called tblo server which is on premises
server used to publish our files and we
have another server called tblo online
it is called Cloud Server and this also
used to publish our
files and we have something called tblo
public server and we have to tblo mobile
phone and finally we have Tableau reader
got it now these many tools we have okay
let's Le we are going to use tblo public
we are going to use tblo public
okay okay
now shall I go to Next Level you see my
screen Tablo
desktop is not a free version but we are
going to get 14 days stal version right
so
here almost every quarter Salesforce
team will release new updates they will
release new versions so here we were
talking about Tableau desktop right so
this desktop is used to prepare report
so here we do have many different
versions okay guys there are many
versions
now if you see
here so these are are different types of
versions if I open this 2024 so here we
do have two different versions 2023
under this so during
interview they will ask you definitely
what is the latest version of table
desktop
it's a interview question they will ask
you what is the latest version of T So
before one day before you go to
interview one day before so you have to
check what is the latest
version
and they will ask you on
what how they will put this question
okay what is the latest version you're
working on don't give this answer that
I'm working on 2024 no no one will use
latest version in real
time clear probably you can say you're
working on 2022 or 2021 anything is fine
but don't say you're working on 2024 as
it is the
latest
clear now you see I said tblo desktop
you can use for 14 days as a trial
version correct look at my screen what I
generally suggest to my Learners if you
want to work on it tblo
desktop if you want to work on tblo
desktop what I
suggest instead of going for a latest
version my dear friends instead of
downloading this latest version what you
can do you can download lower
versions what you can do you can
download lower
version listen to me very
carefully let assume that we have have
downloaded
2022 and we worked on 14 days on
this after 14 days what will happen you
cannot open this application after 14
days after completion of 14 days you
have to go to next version you have to
upgrade 20222 to
20223 again you can use this for 14 days
after 14 days what you can do again you
can go for a next version you have to
upgrade your product to next versions am
I clear if you're really wanted to work
on a taable desktop this is a work
around solution am I clear all of you
this is just a work around solution if
you really wanted to work on tabl
desktop okay now you can say you can ask
me hey who is going to install after
every 14 days is there any work work
around answer is yes one work around is
every 14 days you have to go for a next
version if you don't want to do this
there is another another work on what it
is we have something called tblo
student we have something called what
tblo student so tblo team is giving one
year
license they are going to give you one
product key we would say
license say license
license you see table for
students in order to get license you
have to submit your student ID
card okay you say get tblo for free so
here we offer free one year Tableau
license to
students what you need you should have
at
least student ID card and remember
student age must be greater than six 16
years 16 plus yeah if you have your
school email ID College email ID that is
also
fine within 4 hours you are going to get
a license that license can be applied in
tblo
desktop you can use it for one
year you don't need to uninstall for
every 14 14
days this is another work around
solution
that license can be applied in three
different
laptops
wow I repeat let's say you have applied
for student license you got one key this
key can be applied in three different
laptops interesting yes now plus you can
use this license not only on tableau
desktop but also tblo data prep we have
something called tblo Data prep right
same key can be
used same key can be used in tblo data
prep
also clear are you talking about email
address email address also you don't
have right you don't have such
domain if you have something like this
let's say
lesle at
Oxford university.com oxford.com yes for
this you will get
it okay otherwise let's say you have a
ID card let's say this your ID card that
ID card should have a validity it should
not be an expired State there should be
valid ID card okay if you have siblings
you can take that ID card and you can
upload it no problem you will receive
license clear
LLY so these these all are work around
solution to use Tablo
desktop if not you can go for a tblo
public that's it tblo public is
sufficient yes tblo Public public is
also a sufficient tool to do a
practice I will highlight few areas
where you need TBL desktop okay now what

now today we'll work on TBL Loop data
prep today we are going to work on a
tblo data prep guys so the moment when
you open this tblo data prep you will
see something like
this all right so what what is the flow
see flow means set of
actions series series of action set of
action is called as
flow set of action is called as a flow
okay now so here you're going to see
recently opened flows I will let you
know once again what is a flow so at the
screen here you're going to see recently
opened flows and right hand side you're
going to see some training
material okay now any bi
tool if you take any bi tool first step
is what we have to have the
data correct we have to have the data
and tblop prep is used to perform data
wrangling job or data transformation
job correct now we are going to perform
few basic data transformation using tblo
prep so that you can
understand beauty of prep
Builder okay before we proceed further
let me highlight one problem
statement let me highlight problem
statement so that you can understand how
we can utilize table data prep okay just
give a minute I'm going to open one
Excel file
why my pie is now
slow so we have one Excel file go Excel
file called group and
replace do you have that Excel file all
of
you right we are going to import that
file called group and
replace how to get the data here you see
connect to
data you see this connect to data you
have to click on this connect to
data and go to the folder where you
placed Excel
file see click on Microsoft
Excel click on Microsoft
Excel navigate to that
folder navigate to that
folder where you placed group and
replace what is the file name group
group and
replace this one you have to take this
Excel
file you have to take this Excel
file and click on open I'm holding my
screen for your
reference most of the time what I will
do I will highlight with markers
correct you have to follow my markers
okay now you see this Excel
file yeah in this Excel file we do have
one table but the data contains know so
many
errors we have inconsistency
data we have inconsistency data so we
are trying to
know we're trying to get rid of all
those
errors by using tablet to prep
build it's still taking some time for me
to load the data no
why okay meanwhile try to understand
this
flow look at my
screen this is
database this is tblo
desktop this is tblo data
prep TBL Loop prep
Builder and here we have a
server this can be a cloud server or
anything what is the first step we have
to do we have to import the data all
right you
see we are importing data from desk from
database to
prep in this tblo data prep what we are
doing we are going to perform all data
transformation right and this data
transformation in the form of a
flow in the form of a flow will perform
all those data Transformations over here
once that data transformation is done
what we will do we will publish this
flow in the
server what we will do we'll publish
this flow in the server in real
time that means here we have a clean
data now I would like to prepare a
report I would like to prepare a report
now I do have two options to get the
data one
is I can get the data from DB
to table
desktop but if I try to get the data
from database to tabl desktop what I
have to do here I have to clean the data
over here this is one way instead of
taking data from database what I will do
now I will take this flow into my
Tableau desktop because this is already
cleaned this is already clean I'm going
to perform or I'm going to prepare prep
a report based on this clean
data clear all of
you I have two options one option is I
can get the data from database if I'm
taking data from database I have to
perform data transformation once again
being in data being in table
desktop this is one option otherwise
what we can do we can take the data or
we can take the flow from the server
this flow is nothing but a clean data so
where we clean this data being in tabl
Loop
prep we'll get the data from database
we'll do data transformation once it is
done we'll publish in the server from
there we are going to pick in tablet
desktop is it clear all of you the flow
what I highlighted is it
clear you have to understand this
flow okay during interview if someone is
asking you to how to have know how table
data prep will work you have to explain
this flow that's
it okay now let me erase all these
things let me open this Excel
file you see this Excel file my dear
friends you see this
one so here we do have something called
you see a b listing in this
column let me apply the filter on this
table see here I just apply the filter
on
this data entry guy
entered this data
incorrectly yeah you see for bathroom he
entered bathroom bathrooms somewhere he
just entered ba B you
see for bedroom it just typed bed
somewhere bed RM bedrooms and
bedroom you see data is now
inconsistency here now if you look at
the second
column spelling
mistake beautiful with single L Double
L difficult
spelling mistake pneumonia pneumonia
what oh my God you see understood
spelling mistakes now naming format what
do you mean by naming format let's say
my name is Abdul Rahman first
name Abdul Rahman something like
this what has happened in few record my
name record my name is entered as Abdul
Rahman in few more records my name is
recorded
recorded or entered as Abdul Rahman
first name last name last name first
name okay Harish Kumar just we started
in First Column we have typos
here and in second column also we do
have spelling mistakes in third column
name formatting is
mismatching in fourth column again
spelling mistake P so at the
end we have
inconsistency data agree all of you how
to find tune this data if I want to do
this in Excel I have to do n number of
find and replace
agreed how easily we can perform find
how easily we can perform fine tuning
using tblo data prep there is a game
here clear all of
you right all
good now
let's see now all of you let's go to
table Loop prep
Builder you
see right perfect now my dear friends

file automatically this one sheet is
placed on the
canvas automatically this one sheet is
placed on the canvas so you see here so
if you look at this plus Mark here we we
have different different
options if you see a bit difference I
think based on
know um manges Yad based on the
versions okay based on the version
probably you might have a different
screen but mostly you'll have the same
thing what we have done here we just
imported data from Excel Abola clear all

screen you can aggregate almost we have
seven to eight actions to perform
new rows if you want to do any
aggregation if you want to do any pivate
and pivate if you want to join the
tables or if you want to write any
script what not everything can be
performed over here okay now my dear
friends you see plus
here click on this plus go for a first
option clean step we are going to clean
the data what we are trying trying to do

have to follow step by step no you can
do any action based on the
requirement right you can if you want to
do directly pay table yes you can do the
pay table if you want to join the tables

do we have to public wait wait we have
to export now here we have a two options
remember
as I mentioned in real time what will
happen we are not going to export this
data in our local machine no we are
going to publish this flow in the server
okay how you can publish this in the
server if you go to file or publish go
to top left corner file just look at our
screen now don't click on publish go to

servers but we don't have server now
what we are going to do we are going to
export this clean data in the form of
Excel how to export this data in Excel
you see now there is a plus Mark right
clean activity there is a plus
Mark Harish yes on this flow click on
plus Mark all of
you click on it yes you see Last Action
called output
output all of you click on output we are
just trying to export this data in Excel

a output action we are trying to export
this in a different different format
where you want to export this file there
is a question left hand side you see

want to save this file you have to
remember this location if you want to
change yes you can change
it okay if you want to change you can
change it but let it be there but you
have to remember this in which format
you want to see this data you see output
type there is a small drop down so we'll
talk about what is this do hyper but for
time being what we'll do we'll export
this data in CSV file all of you select
CSV
file hold on is it done all of
you no one is lagging right now it's
time to export now you see that is the
location
and file name is clean data and file
format is CSV file now what you can do
to export this there are two ways there
is option called run flow other than
that we have a play button
also play button on output on output
action we have a play
button on canvas flow
canvas huh you see all of you click on
display button run flow that's
it all of you click on this
done so this fine tune data now exported
in CSV file format you see the series of
action the set of action is called what
flow set of action is called what it's a
flow now now if you don't mind Harish
could you just open that file where it
is saved under
documents my table data prep under
documents
my table prep repository there is a by
default I think prep I
guess over here I don't think so go
back go back yeah table prep
repository
okay
here so go back to that table data prep
we'll see the location exact
location data sources under data sources
you have that file table prep repository
under data sources you have one folder
called Data
sources TBL prep repository no my dear
under tab prep yes under prep
repository here you have a data sources
you see now clean data just open
this just double click on
this is it
open yes guys you see it's very easy
right just double click Harish you
didn't double click I
guess I just wanted to show you all how
data will be
now okay
you
see how data is
cleaned it's very easy right oh
wow good perfect thank you Harish thank
you
for
demonstration
great now again what we will do
now we'll check
how to Port the data okay just give me a
second just look at my screen my dear
friends do you all see the
screen
yeah
now what I would like to do let's say we
have data something like this I would
like to summarize this data in which
format
I would like to summarize the data in
which format let's say I want to have
something like
this let me make over here let me here
let me where should I do
this let's say Here
country east
west south and north here I should I
need India us UK Canada what is the
total value of India east region let's
see if I select all the Cs total is one
756 once again what is the total value
of India in west region let's see let me
select all this
12495
1249
495 I would like to have this kind of a
summary based on this table can we do
this yes guys can we do
this in Excel what we have to do in
order to do
this let's say in Excel P table oh is
it guys do we have to go for a pivot
table in Excel to have this kind of a
summary table is
it oh let me give a try I'm selecting
this entire table going back to insert
pivot table let's say let me insert this
pivot on same sheet
right now I'm going to drag and drop
country over here and region on column
shell now you tell me what should I do
now you want me to take this Jan on a
value shell oops
no MH
see things are not getting
added
see you would like to have a summary we
would like to aggregate all those values
from Jan to December
got the point all of you this is the
problem
statement if we have data in this
format if we have data in this format we
cannot do summary quickly we can do that
but there is a work
around we can do that but there is a
work around but can we summarize the
data no directly we cannot do
summarize okay can we use Su if no Su if
also won't work JIS Scott Su if also
won't work when suf will work when pivot
table will work when you have this data
in a different format then it will work
okay which format it should be you see
now I'm just doing manually this if I
have data something like this let me
transpose this you see when we have data
in this format okay this is from country
and region you
see it's a month it's a values right so
all these values belongs to India and
east region so what is the value of West
let me copy down all these values let me
transpose
them right so all these values from Jan
to
December and all these values from west
region
and countries
India you see if I have data in this
format if I have data in this format yes
as you said we can go for a
suf or we can go for a pivot table oh is
it yes you see now I am selecting this
entire table let me go to insert pivot
table let me plot over here
now let me take country on a row shelf
region on a column shelf you see now
value should be on a valuation oh wow
you see how easily we can summarize
it got the point so that means if we
have data in this format we cannot go
for a summary we cannot create a summary
table but if we have data something like
this we can summarize the data now you
can ask me one question how should I I
know when to go for a data of
transformation or when should I go for
this kind of a transpose or when should
I go for p and and pivot answer is based
on some experience or based on some you
know practice you'll get to know how to
or when to or where to go for p but and
P The Columns clear all of
you is it clear all of you
yeah but if it is Excel it really takes
a lot of time to transpose all these
things right if it is Excel it takes a
lot of time to convert them from column
to rows but you see if you use Tableau
Data
prep you can you can do this very
quickly oh is it yes so I request you
all to know this pivot example file in
tblo prep now question do we have to
open a new tblo prep no not required you
have already tablet prep open right you
have already Open Table prep right again
go back to connect to
data see go to connect to
data pick
Excel take the Excel go for pivot
example and click on open
very
good
now what we have to do now again here we
have a plus
Mark click on
this
yeah go for a
pivot click on this pivot sorry click on
this plus Mark go for a pivot
done all of
you
now look at
this abis Sola here you have to click on
this plus Mark take a p
table take pivot table make sure to
select this table pivot
action okay then only you will see all
these options now what we have to do
here my dear friends
here under Fields you have these many
columns
right
yeah you have these many columns you see
columns to rows which one you have to
convert column to rows you have to
convert month all right so we have all
months in columns we have all months in
columns we have to convert them into
rows got it now now simply drag and drop
this Jan under this one this area ped
Fields drag and
drop you see just drag and
drop Jan okay next FB where is the
FB just drag and
drop clear all of you just look at my
screen just drag and drop over here P

you very easy right you see now
here you can rename this if you want to
rename yes if you double click on
this let's say

click that will allow you to
edit that will allow you to
edit
clear very easy now once you have done
this once you are done with
this what we have to
do we have
to execute this flow to execute the flow
click on plus click on
output click on
output okay
now file name it's your wish unprivate
table it's your
wish and this location it's your wish if
you want to change this you can change
it or let it be open I'm going to export
this in CSV
file right do
cile now you can click on this play
button to run this flow so this entire
stuff is called as a flow this is a flow
this is called a flow okay now all of
you execute this
flow that's
it in real time do you think that we are
going to execute this
locally no right keep that in your mind
remember in real time we are not going
to execute anything locally because
we'll have lot of data the the data will
not be stored in our machines what we'll
do we'll export this flow sorry we'll
publish this flow in the
servers okay now let me open that
F let me go to that
folder see this is my
folder right let me open
this it just you for your reference I'm
opening this Excel file you don't need
to open this okay just have a look you

see my laptop is connected with one
drive this this is not syn with my one
drive got
it
okay okay now let's again go back to
few simple stories what we can
do we'll go for a union we'll see how to
upend the
data how to consolidate the data okay so
let me show you problem statement so
let's say we do have three to four
different different
tables we would like to make it as a
master table by consolidating data from
different
tabs okay so we have seen in power query
editor how to append the data you see
same data we
have it's a North table it's a East
table South and
West we have data in four different
tables we would like to append the data
or we would like to create one master
table so how to consolidate this data
using table prep
Builder Okay clear all of you we are
going to see how to append the data like
this this is North data this is East
data something like
this is it clear all of you problem
statement
South
table
yes something like this yes
abisola we are trying to consolidate
data something like
this West
table consolidation we are appending the
data like
this how to create this consolidation
okay this is my local file I have
already given this guys do you have this
Union Excel file if not let me know I
will share
it okay let me share this
file okay no
problem okay all of you download this
Excel file and quickly load
this quickly load this
how to load the
data see click on this
plus click on this
plus click on this Excel
workbook all of you
take Union
workbook all of you take Union workbook
on Excel
workbook all of you take
union now this Excel workbook is
contained this Excel file contains four
different tabs four different
sheets so automatically you not see
anything on the
canvas earlier when you imported payot
example or group and replace Excel file
automatically you might have seen or
observed
the particular sheet is already placed
on Flow
canvas right but this time none of them
are imported you see because we do have
four different worksheet in
this this Union file contains four
different tabs
sheets none of them imported on report
Canvas OR flow
canvas flow pin
what we have to do now manually you have
to drag and drop one table that's your
wish any table you can drag and drop
manually drag and drop one table on the
canvas
done perfect now so here we have a plus
Mark click on this so This join we can
join the tabl over here but I'm parking
this join here because we are going to
see in tblo desktop how we can join the
tables in Tableau desktop okay now let's
pick Union there are two ways to upend
the data there are two ways to Union the
tables but we'll go with this option
click on
Union click on
union now you have to drag and drop
second table you see you have to move
this close to this you see here options
the mov the movement when you place this
second table close to East you'll see
few options or if you place your table
close to this Union again you'll see few
more
options drop
this over here add like
this abisola see my screen here you'll
have this flow
pane right here you have the table left
hand side first drag and
drop one
table you got an error message okay wait
a minute let me finish this guys once
again take another
table just move this to Union and you
have to drop over
here can't I drop here you can drop over
here also you can drop over here also
but to give you better Clarity better
picture it's better to add this new
table under Union like this so you will
see this good
picture you see you'll see a good
picture here that's it no difference at
all you see
add so how we can understand this we are
going to combine all these four tables
yeah we are going to make it as a
union clear now once it is done all of
you
generate you have to do this a bit FAS
okay okay what you have done you have
taken join close it click on the join
and delete uh click on it delete remove
it that's it it's a union now now what
you have to do drag and drop that not
left hand side yeah drag wait wait yeah
please wait Madam where s delete
it delete delete means you have to hit
on
remove delete
yeah on keyboard you have a delete
button
right delete is always easy M ah now
drag and drop North North you have to

wait wait why you rushing why doing so
fast slow slow
slow just huh slow politely smoothly you
have to Handle With Care wait you see
add button don't drop it blindly you see

have to handle very good good move
momentum
yes go near to
Union go to near to Union yes add add

yes you
see you you have taken four tables to do
Union okay join is different Union is a
different AB Sola we have discussed join
means adding column simple word join Jo
means adding column Union means adding
row what we are doing here we're adding
rows we're appending the data
clear guys you have to remember s you
have to remember in simple
words okay you have to remember only in
simple
words
now to see this output what we have to
do again click on this plus click on
output clear all of
you and you don't need to see output my
dear friends click on
output so this is let's say
consolidation

file select dots CC
file click on run flow that's
it
okay
perfect now what we will do now we are
going to import the data oh we have been
doing the same thing but this time we
will load sample Superstore data
what we'll do now we are going to load
sample Superstore data set how to get it
once again click on this
plus click on this place click on Excel
workbook sample Superstore data set I
request you all to take this
one sample Superstore
is it
done click on
Open click on open
wow this Excel workbook contains only
single sheet called orders you see
now got it now what we'll do now let's
see now take clean step first click on
this plus go for a clean step
now all of you click on this
data this one data
GD where you can see data in a table
form right clear now stop doing just
look at my screen don't do anything just
look at my screen
now here you will see how your data is
framed in this table here we do it says
you do have 22 Fields nothing but
columns and 20,000
records it's a table
structure got it now each and every
column is now representing with data
type also you see it's a data type it's
a
number it's a text it is a
date and it is also string or data type
and this is a
date clear all of you what is the data
type what is data
type so these are data types what is
data type
simple Yes guys what is data type
it's basic and very very important you
should understand you're dealing with
what type of
data you're dealing with what type of
data data data type is nothing but
format of
data in which format data is being
stored what is the format of the data is
it string is it text is it number is it
date is it Boolean what type of data it
is clear all of
you right is it really important to
understand data
type last time we have discussed
right last time we have
discussed have you remember let's say
here we do have
A10 P20
yeah can I sum of these two
values can I do summation on these two
values
no right now for example if I want to do
some on 10 + 20 what I have to do I have
to extract values right 10 so in order
to extract I'm using right function
right comma 2 I'm extracting numbers
only again write function right I need
two character vors from right hand side
what I did I have used a formula to
extract digits from right hand side 1020
now can I use some formula
here to do summation on
this can I use some formula to do
summation on
this can I use some okay what is the
output of this now if I execute this
formula what could be the output
no no if but cut no tell me the answer
if I execute this formula what could be
the answer yes
guys we should give the answer now my
dear friends if I execute this
formula you see why you saying if they
are
numeric let see if I execute this we got
zero why we are getting zero my dear
friends remember
these all are very basic things at the
same time it's really really important
to
understand okay these are really Basics
but really really
important okay in real time we are going
to face this kind of a challenges very
frequently
clear okay actually here we have used
right function this right function has
given output correctly but format of
this cell is text it is not in a number
format you see hey are you text I'm
saying yes it's true I'm saying hey are
you number say no I'm not a number say
false I'm not a number I'm a text so we
have used some formula over here to do
the addition but since it's in a text
format it is giving zero as the
answer and do remember as I mentioned
earlier
you'll have problem especially when you
have date you are importing data from
database you have a date column it
sounds like a date but it won't be a
date format it would be in a text
format due to which if you're performing
any analysis you'll end up with wrong
numbers clear all of you don't forget
this it is really really
important understanding data types
okay let's go back here so now here it
is displaying data type of each column
here we do have something called extra
geographical data you see
here
recommendations okay here recommendation
look at my
screen region wise column it's a string
of course it's a string there is no
doubt a BC is nothing but a string or
text if I click on this you see here
region wise column saying change data
role to
State country let me go back to
oops let me go to Country column so that
country column itself is string but if
you look at the recommendations it's
saying hey this country is a
geographical data type you see let me
place over
here you see ABC it's a string there is
no doubt but these are our geographical
data you see now if I click on this
recommendations you see country change
data rule to
Country it means we are trying to change
data type this bulb also
recommendation what it is recommending
it's saying hey D don't consider this
column as just a string consider this
column as a state or a country that
means geographical data type what it is
geographical data
type what is the benefit if I change
this to
geographical what is the benefit in
written what we have in return you see
tabue is super
smart whenever you drag this column
called country anyway we are going to
see this but let let me explain you why
we have to change this from string to
Geographic you see if you drag and drop
this country colum under report
canvas by default Tableau will generate
map
visual is it clear I repeat if you drag
and drop this country field on report
canvas table automatically pick map
visual
got it all of you that is the reason we
have to convert this country column
State column City column into
Geographic it just giving
recommendations hey dud you have to
change them as a geographic clear all of
you
perfect will you just change
it you can click on this recommendation
also it's your
wish see at least one column you have to
change you don't need to do all you
don't need to do this for four columns
one column is
enough
okay one column is enough
I just changed on Country
column
done
perfect if you want to split the values
you see
here go to customer ID
here go to customer ID if you want to
split the values click on this three
dots so here we have a split values
split values automatic
split you have to click on the second
one data
grid you have under data profile you
have to click on data grid to see data
in a table
form we are going to see so many options
in tblo desktop okay I'm not sure how
you're going to remember all those
things
but I'm going to each and every minute
is really
important every minute is really
important you're going to see new new
features
okay and practice is really really
needed now split
values custom split if you want to go
for a custom split you can go for custom
split use the separator what do we have
separator let say iPhone and split the
value
simple split the
values
done for example let's say you want to
apply filter on this data set for
example you you want to apply the filter
you don't need whole this data set you
need only few records which records you
need let assume that so here we do have
a ship mode right you want to have only
uh first class
records what you need you need only
first class records how you can apply
the filter on this you see select the
ship
mode first class we don't have first
class I think we do have same
day or let's say let's pick this one
region wise I would like to take only
us records how to apply filter on
this
see click on
this go for create calculated
field go for create calculated
field we are going to use this create
calculated
field probably in our upcoming
sessions just wanted to show you how you
can write this okay click on this create
calculated field go for a custom
calculations go for a custom
calculations you're going to see this Fe
this box now we'll talk about this box
later okay
now region wise is equal to what we need
us in double codes just do mention us
and click on
apply wait
wait no no just give me a second we want
to apply the filter right it is not
right way let me remove
this we'll go for
this click on this filter value
select this region wise click on
filtered
values
see region wise is equal to
what
us we're actually applying the filter on
this
column we'll talk talk about this t uh
this box
later okay all if you click on this
filter value region wise is equal to us
click on
apply clear all of
you
perfect now we have only those items
where region wise is
us we have only those items where we
have
you just reach
here done perfect you see any action you
perform you perform any action you're
going to see all those steps over here
have you
observed change data type we apply the
filter yes so here we have done
something else you have removed you see
I have
removed this is the first one is
changing data type the second one is I
have removed one column so this is a
filter
one this is
split all actions are recorded over here
if you want to if you want to undo any
Last Action left hand side we have
changes from here also you can do
that right now once
again click on this plus you see now you
can export this data
if you're trying to export this data in
the form of in the format of CSV you
will see only those records where region
is us and if you just observe
this earlier we used to have 20,000
records but this time how many records
we have only 3,000 that means it's
already applied the
filter okay
now do I have to export this in CSV file
quantv do any other
action we can do other action
also it is not like you can go with only
single action it's not like that if you
want to perform any other activity yes
still you can do that what we'll do now
we'll go for a
pivot we'll go for a p what do you say
or we'll go for aggregation we didn't
see this aggregation right all of you
take this
aggregation all of you take this
aggregation click on this play
and click on this
aggregate now drag and drop this
category under group field and let's say
we do have
what we do have profit see drag and drop
this profit over here aggregated field
can't we add one more Dimension you can
add one more Dimension also if you
want if you want to add one more
Dimension yes still you can do
that now you see now you tell me if I
export
this if I export this am I going to see
the summary or am I going to see the raw
data you tell
me if I export this am I going to see
this aggregated
results or am I going to see this clean
data Ashish we are not going to see the
raw data we are going to see the
summary clear all of you we are going to
see this summary so how we can export
this here click on this plus and click
on this
output click on this
output you see you going to see output
something like
this got
it and again you can you can you can
take this output file in CSV file in
CSV and you you can run
this you can execute
this click on this play
button that's
it clear all of
you so enjoyed table data
prep it's too good
right now
go to file and save
this go to file save
this where you want to save it's your
wish wherever you want to save this you
can save this it's your
choice
okay so now today we are going to start
working with tblo public or tblo ttop
okay let me repeat once again there are
two different types of tools one is tblo
desktop wherein we can prepare the
report but it is a paid version and we
have something called
tblo public which is free version in
this tblo public also we can prepare a
report but we'll have few
limitations that is a difference between
these two tools okay yesterday we have
seen how to install tblo public I
request you all to open tblo public okay
Victoria hi good to see you Victoria so
you have to
download tblo public let me share the
link to download it tblo public you need
table public right take this one without
this we cannot proceed further take this
link download quickly tblo public
product if it is asking you to sign in
you must have credential
but for time being what I will do I will
give you one dummy Account Details use
this username and password to sign in
use this username and password to sign
in meanwhile we'll discuss something
guys just look at my screen so this is
tblo desktop I will work on tblo desktop
and you can work on tblo public okay and
you will not see much difference between
these two but in few cases definitely so
whenever we open TBL public or Tableau
desktop we'll see three different
sections yeah first section second
section and third section under first
section you have a option to connect to
different
sources for example if you have data in
Excel and you are going to pick the
Excel if you have data in a CSV file or
a notepad you're going to take a text
file okay now if you you have data in
SQL or any Oracle database just look at
my screen here if I click on more you
see if I click on
more so these are lot different
different servers you see if you have
data in let's
say where IBM db2 you'll pick this db2
if you have data in aour SQL database
you'll pick SQL Z database if you have
data in MySQL MySQL if you have data in
one drive Microsoft SQL Server what not
sap Hana what not so my dear
friends in tabl Loop public you're not
going to see these many connectors that
is a limitation clear in tblo public you
don't have these many connectors you
will see only in tblo
desktop clear all of you now yesterday I
was highlight I was highlighting
something yesterday I was talking about
data flow how you can get the data from
server using data flow let me recap Once
Again so here we do have a
database this is tblo desktop
file tblo
desktop and here we have tblo data prep
we do have two ways to get the data
right you see I am importing data from
database to tblo data prep here I'm
going to perform data wrangling job once
data is cleaned what I'm going to do I'm
going to publish this flow in the
server I'm going to publish this flow in
the server right now in order to prepare
a report I have to have the
data I have two ways to get the data one
way I can get the data from
database if I go with this approach
again I have to clean this data
and another way I can get this flow data
from this server directly into tblo
desktop got it now again once data is in
I can create a report over here again I
publish this into the server now how to
get that flow from the
server I repeat how to get that flow
from the server you see if I go back to
here you see here we do have a TW server
right you can get the data from server
also you have to connect here if I click
on sign in once I sign in I can get the
data from server as well got it all of
you is a table
server
clear clear the flow perfect now what is
the first step we have to have the data
right so all of you click on this
Excel connect to
data click on this
Excel which file we have to import we
are going to import sample Superstore
data set all of you import sample
Superstore data set quickly okay Harish
you have to open tblo public and you
have to load sample Superstore data set
okay guys you see my screen here
whenever you trying to import the data
here we do have different
tabs bottom left corner you see data
source actually we are in a data source
tab where we can see
metadata and this is a place where
you're going to
create
relationships or or you going to create
join between the
tables it is like
a model view in powerbi in powerbi also
we have a model view where we can create
the relations right so here you can
create relationship between the tables
or you can create joints between the
table Yeah so here you're going to to
see data in a table form clear all of
you
now by default you'll see one sheet
whenever you open tblo Desktop or tblo
product by default you will see one
sheet like whenever you open Excel file
by default you'll see sheet one whenever
you open powerbi Desktop you'll see page
one here also whenever you open a app
desktop you'll see page one just look at
my screen so here this is the server
name or Excel file name in this Excel
workbook we do have a table called
orders in this table we do have these
many
columns all columns are placed left hand
side in power VI it is placed where
right hand
side why I'm keep on highlighting
powerbi powerbi because you have already
gone through with powerbi I'm just
correlating so that you can understand
in a better way why I am always
correlating because you have already
gone through
powerbi that make easy for you to
correlate all bi tools works in the same
way in power bi is placed right hand
side in table it is placed left hand
side place here also you'll see all
these columns placed in Alpha
alphabetical order in addition to this
you'll see here one divider you see one
partition here
created so these all are
dimensions or non- numerical columns
below this we have something called
measures numerical column got it now
we'll try to understand
this this is called Pages we call it as
a page Shelf
we're calling it as a what page shelf
this is filter shelf we are going to
explore all these
things yeah this is called Mark
cards marks card here we have a small
drop down by using this small drop down
we can customize the visuals you see we
do have different different
options and this is called color shelf
size Shelf text shelf what not again
these are called as a
shelves here this is called column
shelf this is called Rose shelf it is
looks like a pure table
structure yeah this is called a
page or a
sheet
and right hand side you have something
called show me
it's called show me
panel this is called show me
panel in this panel we'll have 24
visuals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 8 3 are 24 24 visuals we
have got
it and this is called report
canvas this is called report canvas the
sheet one this is a title bar it's a
title for the title for
report got it we are going to explore
each and every
point just you know I would like to go
through this quickly at very high
level now my dear friends in this sheet
one have you opened powerbi sorry table
public
right you see now you'll have this
something called tblo icon
Harish you have something called tblo
icon if you click on this table icon
you'll have option it's very easy first
stage of any bi tool is what you have to
import the data by the way we forgot to
tell you right I forgot to tell you the
second page so the second section in the
second section you'll see recently
opened files very recently whatever you
have opened those files can be seen on
second SC uh second section under third
section here we have some material yeah
some learning material you'll see on the
third section yeah
now guys in this page
one in this page you can
always plot only one visual at a time oh
is it
yes you'll have always single
visual it is not you know you can place
multiple visuals in like
powerbi in powerbi we Ed to place
everything in a single page right but
here it's not like that on a single page
single sheet we'll have only one
visual then you can plot another
chart you can take another one
you can plot another
visual every sheet will have only one
visual how to combine them
together how to combine them together
you see here we do have something called
dashboard the second icon what you see
this is called a
dashboard let me just just don't do
anything look at my screen if I click on
this yeah this is called Dash board
where you can place multiple
sheets I have three different sheets
every sheet will have a single visual
you can drag and drop all these visual
on your
dashboard dashboard means collection of
sheets collection of sheets is nothing
but
dashboard perfect
now we have something called story you
see the last icon
what you see this is called story if you
want to narrate a story you can build
the story also what is story all about
story means collection
of collection of
sheets plus
dashboards collection of you see sheets
and dashboard you are going to drag and
drop them over
here so we'll talk about dashboard we'll
talk about stories and we'll talk about
sheets and everything in our upcoming
sessions
okay so far so good
perfect now my dear friends what we are
going to do now we'll
make hand free on this tool now just
open that file would you like to share
your screen quickly just share your
screen quickly you see what is the first
first
stage collection of data right you see
left hand side we have a connect to data
top left hand side left corner click on
it what we have to
do
simple Excel workbook from where we have
to get the data Excel okay don't you
have data H download
it now what we have to do go to sheet
one
that's it easy
right okay we have something called
click
sense that is another bi tool you have
to learn click sense by yourself
only H
perfect bottom left corner you have
sheet right you see bottom left corner
left hand side ah click on
sheet click on it my dear click on it
yes
abisola share your screen yeah you can
stop it now abisola I think you have
open tblo data prep I think
so ah you see you have open tblo prep
Builder we are working on tblo
public open the tblo public desktop wait
wait T
public I think yesterday we have
installed right why you are installing
once again close
this close
this cancel Windows search go to Windows
search Windows
search uh tblo type
tblo you see public is there you see
tblu 2024 now click on
it click on it
wait
clear uh what you have do
now very
good
wait
guys I need your
attention this is tblo public
right we'll have few
limitations if you're working on tabl
Loop
public can we save this file in our
local
machine answer is no you cannot save
this in your
laptop oh is it yes how to save this
file in order to save this
file you have to sign in in Tabo public
server you can save this under tblo
public server only now how to save this
all of you look at the screen now go to
file go to
file top left corner
yes okay you see save to table public as
1 2 3 4 5 sixth one yeah this is now
grade
out the moment when we have a visual now
we are going to
see that is in enabled state so what
we'll do let me give a try with one or
two visuals then I will ask you to save
this in server okay now all of you look
at my screen now
look at my
screen this is called column shelf and
this is called row
shelves
right we are going to place
dimensions and
measures based on our requirement we do
have two different set of data over here
one is
dimensions and another one is measure
dimension means
what in Layman language non-numerical
data non-numerical data called Dimension
measures are nothing but numerical
data numerical
data
technically qualitative and
quantitative yeah you can quantify
this this is qualitative data
got it you can quantify the data that
means on the numbers you can perform
mathematical
operations for example here we do have a
product sorry profit you would like to
see how much profit we have received
what is the total profit what is total
discount what is total quantity or
average quantity you can perform
mathematical operations on numbers
you can quantify the
data got it qualitative data is nothing
but a dimension you would like to see
based on certain Dimensions B that means
from which category we are getting more
profit in which Market we are getting
more sales from which region we are
getting more number of
orders got it so that is nothing but a
Dimensions how you want to view the data
actually Dimensions describes numbers or
measures
Dimensions describes
measures how you want to see your
numbers in which angle you want to see
the numbers or at which level you want
to look at the
numbers so these are the different
different definitions of
Dimension okay now we'll plot one graph
now let's see now what we can do all of
you just drag and drop this
subcategory under row shelf like
this all of you drag and drop the
subcategory under row
shelf
clear
now it's very easy drag and drop Sals
under column shelves
wow you see now
clear do you see now bar remember it's
very easy to plot any graph in any bi
Tool It's Just DE easy job yes or
no
now we'll see how to sort this but
before we proceed further we have to
understand
terminologies you see this one under row
shelf we have subcategory right so this
is
called
pill this look like pills
right these are called
pills
clear
now yes we do have two pills but one is
in a blue color and another one is in a
green color what does it mean you see
this color indicates this green pill is
a measure
what it is this green pill is a measure
and
dimensions will be represented in a blue
color got it all of you green pills
represents
measures blue pills represents
Dimensions
yeah clear all of you perfect very good
it's a interview question by D now I
would like to
enable data
labels how to enable data
labels there are multiple ways to enable
the data labels but we'll go with this
option here we have a t for
text you can drag and drop any field
under column shelf and row shelf you're
going to get one visual okay
how we can understand this I will let
you know once we are in a visuals
okay now all if you click on this t for
text to see data
labels got
it now we have a data labels for each
and every
bar
yeah this bar
indicates the sales value
correct now how to
sort this visual based
on sales
value now there are many ways to
sort if I over my M on this area mid of
this canvas we'll see one option you see
if I over my M on Mid of this canvas do
you all see
this one
click to sort
largest to
smallest another click smallest to
largest third click sorting by ascending
order sorting subcategory by ascending
order got it all of you
sort
easy very
good now this is really very simple
sorting let me take you through advanc
sorting okay as I mentioned
yesterday you're going to see so many
options
okay now one more option you see
here this subcategory right if I place
my more than
this yeah here we have a small drop drop
down if I click on this so again here
also you have option option to
sort click on the
sort this one if I click on this
dropdown here you have option called to
sort done yep now from here also you can
sort Ascend by ascending order or
descending order this is very normal
sorting if you want to
sort by some other field still you can
do that you say sort by one is manual
sorting if you have something to sort
manually like this you can drag and drop
this is something called manual
sorting this manual sort you can do
through Visual also just look at my
screen you see for example I want to
have this label at the top you see like
this this is called manual sort
very rarely we'll go for a manual sort
okay we do have something called I would
like to display I would like to show
this one by field you
see by field by which field can I pick
some other field yes why not you see
field name just take the
profit descending order like this select
feed field field is nothing but a colum
sort order is descending from this drop
down just pick the profit things will
change automatically in back
end
done perfect shall I close this no one
is
lagging now what is happening here
actually we are sorting by The Profit
you see now let me close this
let me erase all these
markers you see cop the
subcategory is a top level but if you
look at the value sales value is lesser
than
phones why is in
top sales wise okay it is less than
phones but when it comes to profit wise
profit wise copat are giving more profit
got it to give more clarity or better
Clarity what I will do I will drag and
drop this profit under column shelf you
see now all of you drag and drop profit
under column
shelf now you'll get more clarity
now got
it sounds
good clear what is happening
here profit wise copers is giving more
profit yeah sales are lesser than phones
sales wise phones is giving more sales
but profit wise it's in a second
position perfect

sheet can we edit this title oh why

if you double click on
it if you double click on this title
that will allow you to edit all of you

problem done all of you all good okay
let's
let's let's proceed now all of you take
new sheet we'll talk about
filters we do have various
filters oh is it yes we have something
called Dimension
filter we have something called measure
filter
we have something called interactive
filters
interactive we have something called
data source
filter data source filter what not
context
filter we do have these many
filters shall I make a note of all these
filters no you don't you don't really
require to make a note of all these
things because if you go through El
s you'll you'll have one document on
this
topic okay if you go through LMS you'll
have a
document I will not prefer to go through
any
PDF okay but in PDF you have all this
content clear all of you now we'll see
how to apply the filter using Dimensions
measures and how we can have a context
filter or interaction whatnot we'll talk
about the filters in today's class
in order to do that do one thing all of
you once again drag and drop the
subcategory under row
shell drag and drop subcategory under
row shell and drag and drop profit under
column shelf n on wordss what you have
to do whenever you are doing this you
have to sort the
values and you have to enable the data
labels make a habit to do this okay so
that it's you know you can practice
this you have to sort them and you have
to enable data
levels perfect now we'll see what is
dimension filter we'll see what is
dimension filter Dimension means what
non- numerical column you see now we
have something called subcategory right
I'm trying to C the subcategory under
filter
shell all of you just drag and drop this
subcategory under filter shell the
moment when you do this you're going to
see one pop up
wow done you see here we do have three
different no not three four different
tabs here just look at my screen stop
doing this one General tab wild card
condition and top that means what you
can apply filter on this in four
different ways you can apply filter on
this in four different ways we explore
each and every
tab okay for example I'm in a general
tab I don't want to see first three
subcategories I'm going to uncheck them
you see all of you uncheck first three
categories once you do uncheck don't
click on okay you have to click on
apply what will happen if I click on
apply this change will be applied but
this box will
be written over
here
yeah
apply
done now Wild Card let's go to second
one called wild card
match values so I'm going to say s that
means you see so I have entered s over
here and I'm going to pick this ends
with that means if any subcategory is
ending with S I would like to see them
got
it go for a wild
card enter s s for Singapore end
with and click on apply I would like to
see only those subcategories which are
ending with
s got
it
clear perfect now let's go to condition
so here you can put in a condition here
you can put a condition based on a
condition things will get filtered out
oh is it yes so you can write a formula
also see by formula in powerbi we have
written so many formulas right so here
also have a scope to write the formulas
so what I'm going to do here I'm going
to say hey I would like to see some of
profit if it is greater than or equal to
what let's say
5,000 I would like to see only those
items which are above 5,000 what will
happen all these negative values plus
this one also will be
removed got it click on apply you see
it's gone
condition by
formula you just write the simple
formula over here now here how many
items we have 1 2 3 6 7 8 eight
subcategories we do have now I would
like to see top five subcategories based
on the profit right now again go to
top click on by field how many
items top five you have to remember this
we're going to come back to this top
five top 10 once again okay top five
click on
apply it will display only top five
subcategories got it all of
you oh do we have to use four different
tabs in real time answer is
no very rarely you'll get a chance to
apply very rarely you get a chance
you'll get a chance to apply filter
through all four tabs since we all are
in a training we are just trying to
explore each and every
T condition this one by formula
simple sum of open the bracket profit is
greater than or equal to
5,000 I'm holding my screen for your
reference remember guys we all in a
training right we are exploring each and
every tab you'll not get a chance to
apply using four different apps
no okay let me click on okay if you want
to
edit if you want to edit you want to
modify abisola what you have to do here
here we have a
subcategory if you place your mouse over
here you'll see drop down click on this
here you have option called edit filter
this is how you can edit the filter
clear condition is it clear all of
you got it and now whatever we have
applied we can see over here
summary right whatever we have applied
under General tab you are going to see
the
summary clear
all
good let me close
this now how to rename the title double
click on the sheet two and say Dimension

formula oh my God it's very
easy see like
this
done now let's go to next sheet all of
you if you want to rename this sheet too
yes you can feel free to rename it okay
why I'm using same naming convention
because tomorrow if you open this
file should know what you have done on
this okay okay is dimension
filter now all of you take a new sheet
once again all of you take a new sheet
once again do the same thing drag and
drop subcategory under row shell and
dragon draw profit under column shell
just do pick sort and enable data
labels done all of
you just today entire know session just
doing drag and drop Dragon drop Dragon
drop
only yep perfect now we are going to see
how we can apply filter using a
measure generally we not do this filter
but since we have this in culum quotes
and just exploring this what it is you
see measure means what a number right
here we do have a profit what I will do
I will drag and drop this profit under
filter shell you see
I'm doing I'm going to drag and drop
this under filter shell what will happen
just look at my screen the moment when I
release again we we are going to see one
popup this time this popup is a
different format see so asking me hey
how you want to apply filter on this
visual since it's a measure or it's a
numerical column we have option to apply
filter using some average median count
whatnot so these are our mathematical
operations let me cancel this if I drag
and drop any other non-numerical column
yeah we'll have a different options you
see on numeric on non-numerical or on a
dimension you can apply filter using
this but it is a number if I drag and
drop this number column you'll have a
different format similarly if I do drag
and drop date you'll have a different
options you see now it's a date So based
on the column type you going to see a
different different options right now
let me drag and drop profit over here I
would like to apply filter on this using
sum I request you drag and drop profit
under filter shelf yeah take the
sum take the sum click on
next click on next what is happening
here if you know notice this from where
we got this value see now this profit is
being displayed based on the
subcategories so what is the least value
here you see table is very so very smart
you see what is the least value it is
this these all these all our profits are
actually aggregated by subcategories so
least value is minus minus 35k the least
value what is maximum value 1 1 or 235
you see one 111
K got it so this is how it is shown
lowest value and highest value now for
example if you want to see only those
subcategories which falls under I repeat
you would like to see only those
subcategories which are falls under this
range you see
now if someone of category some of let's
say subcategory profit is some of this
12,000 minimum and maximum this you'll
see only those items like
this got it now for example let's say
you have a requirement you would like to
see only those subcategories which are
giving 10,000 to let's say
100K you would like to see only those
subcategories which are giving profit
between 10 ,000 to 100K then you want to
see only those
subcategories and here you have
different options at least or at most
you can play with

no they can see only this
visual okay if I'm placing any Dimension
under filter Shelf
what does it mean that means it's a
static user cannot modify

yes how we can change this
layout look at my screen there is a
small drop down if I click on this here
you have these many
options based on the requirement let's
say you want to always allow a single
value selection you'll go for a single
value if you want to keep it in a list
format you can set this list you see wow
always
one got
it single value drop down
yes clear all of
you you want to have a list list now
make it as a
list make it as a list only I will tell
you what can we have another dimension
as a filter
oh why not why can't we have it sure now
what I will do now all if you bring
subcategories you see here we do have a
subcategories click on this and click on
show filter once again all of you bring
subcategory as a
filter is it done just show this
subcategory as a show
filter now you see I'm just rearranging
them you can simply you can drag and
drop like this you see on the top I'm
placing category next to this below to
this I'm placing subcategory let's say
I'm a user let's say I'm a user if I
pick
technology this chart is displaying only
technology values but at the same time I
would like to have only those
subcategories which are belongs to
technology yes or
no here it is displaying all
subcategories but I would like to see
only relevant sub
categories got the point now how to
Cascade this filter to
this how to cascet the filters to next
filter to do that you see here on
subcategory we do have a small drop down
click on this so here you have here you
have an option called only relevant
values click on this on subcategory
click on drop down click on only
relevant
values yes why not definitely when your
trainer is
amazing things will have an
extraordinary way or no so how it's
really magic or really important to
place or to spin the balls accordingly
at right time we have to spin the ball
so that it it's easy to understand that
will make easy for you to understand
done all of you now if you want to
change them the layout yes for example
here we do have a big list it will cons
it will consume lot of space on the
dashboard you see this a list it's a
very big list in such scenario you have
to go for a drop down like
this got it let's say let me pick the
technology if I click on this yes to
save some space on the canvas you have
to change them
accordingly clear this is called

you drag and
drop this product name under filter
shell now you're going to see this popup

on the profit click on
apply done all of you
easy no one is lagging very
good no one is lagging
excellent let me click on this Victoria
yes you got an error right yes park it
now let me let me go back to this
notepad you see we have addressed this
one top 10 students top 10 products
irrespective
their country top 10 products there is
no such filter
now now requirement is I would like to
see top 10 products with regards to each
and every
state with regards to State let's say in
California from California what are
those top 10
products got
it now what we'll do now take the
state take the state and click on show
filter take this
state here and click on show
filter
done right hand side you'll have one
separate
section where you can see list of
states
yeah California Florida oh my goodness
what not Maryland
MD yeah
Texas so these are different different
states we
have now look at my screen carefully I
would like to see top 10 from California
if I click on this California oh my
goodness how many products are
displaying this now I clicked on
California I could see only four
items why not 10
items by the way why it has has shown
four items you see try to understand the
concept first of all we have
displayed 10 items on top of it I
applied filter using State out of 10
product four products are belongs to
California understood we have taken 10
products top 10 products out of which
four products are belongs to
California hence we could see top
four clear now let's say I'm removing
this California let me select Florida
oh my
goodness do we have any product no that
means what none of them falls under
Florida
State we have taken top 10 items none of
them belongs to Florida State hence
everything is BL
am I making
sense
yes am I making
sense now requirement is what when I
select Florida definitely the state will
have certain
products the state will have definitely
few products I would like to see top 10
from Florida only when I select Florida
I would like to see top 10 items
similarly when I select
California I would like to see 10 not
four what we have to do in order to see
with regards to the state I have to
change the
context you see how to do that here we
have a state
right click on this small drop down
click on this add to
context add to context simple
add to context
done ah now you see the magic now this
state is now become as a context filter
that means first filter is being applied
based on the state you
see California I have selected what will
happen internally listen to me very
carefully internally one logical table
will be
created one logical table will be
created the table will have only
California
records the table will have only
California records on top of this
logical table it will apply top 10
filter got it now here we do have top 10
products similarly let me go back to
this notepad so that you can understand
stand very easily first question was IR
respective region we have seen top 10
students the second requirement is with
regards to this India how many or I
would like to see list of top 10 so here
context is now
changed got it now let me go back to
Tableau clear all of you for example
let's say let me ask you one simple
question I'm checking your understanding
okay for example if I select Florida I
have already selected California let's
say if I select Florida now you tell me
am I going to see 10 products or am I
going to see 10 + 10 20 products how
many products I'm going to see 10 or
20 if I select California and Florida am
I going to see 10 products or 20
products
yes
guys Victoria
abisola 10 only
correct correct if I select
Florida Victoria try to understand now I
selected Florida now California and
Florida now what is happening internally
one table got created logical table got
created this table will contain two
different states one is California plus
Florida on top of this data set it will
apply top 10 filter hence we have top 10
items okay clear all of
you this is called context
filter
yeah Victoria when you see four items
when when you are not making the state
as a context you will see
four now we made this state as a context
filter so first it will apply filter on
State on top of it it will take top 10
items
clear so this is called context
filter to have better performance on
visual you'll go for a context filter
okay and based on business requirement
also clear all of you sounds good I
could see your screen now
yes what you trying to do
now okay go
back okay drag and drop product name
under R shelf we would like to see top
10 product so drag and drop product name
under product under R
shelf add all members add all the
members
drag and drop now profit under column
shelf profit under column
shelf right sort them quickly enable
data
labels we have to do this with fast yes
enable data labels how will you enable
the data labels correct now how we can
check top 10
items very
good go to top
by
field click on
apply click on okay done now we would
like to see based on the states right
now drag and drop

drag and drop in fact we are not going
too fast there is nothing called you
know coding we not writing any code we
not writing any form
we are just doing drag and drop drag and
drop okay now my dear friends if you
look at the subcategories we do
have two different let's say if I
categorize them based on the profit I
can say two different groups we have one
set of subcategories are one set of
subcategories are giving positive profit
and another set of subcategories are
giving negative profits you see
now got it if you see three different
subcategories over here so these are are
giving negative profit and remaining all
other subcategories are giving positive
profit so what I would like to do I
would like to create a group based on
the profit value I would like to put all
subcategories all positive subcategories
under one bucket and all negative
subcategories under different
bucket basically I would like to create
a group on
this in order to group them we do have
multiple options I would say different
ways we have to
group we have different ways to group
them now we'll go with visuals how we
can group using a visual it's very easy
just look at my screen first what I
would like to do I would like to
bring all these three subcategories
under one bucket all this negative how
to select this negative subcategories
look at my screen if I place my mouse
over here you see click and hold and
drag basically you have to select these
three negative
bars basically what you have do you have
to select these three negative Parts
like
this if you if you select and release
now you're going to see this option
called group you see now again look at
my screen click somewhere over here and
drag hold it and drag it now here you
will see
one attachment icon called group we are
going to create a group by considering
these three
subcategories click on
group got
it done
once again you see so here we have
supplies you have to click over here
hold it and drag it what we are trying
to do here we are trying to select these
three negative bars and release and you
will see over here one option called
attachment group member if you click on
this now it is now
grouped got it right hand side will have
two different
groups clear all of
you yes perfect now how to edit this
names yeah how to edit thisas you see

you double click on
this see okay Ashish look at my screen

okay how to undo let me show you how to
undo this if you want to undo any action
so here you have a back arrow do you all

screen select three wordss and release
the moment when you release you see this
one click on
group that's it

you now what we can do if I want to
rename
this you're not getting those
options
okay give a try uh
release okay hold on once again click
somewhere else okay once again give a
try wait what you have to do probably
I'm just verifying
this you just you have to select last
bar not full just off of the bar you
have to select at the end don't drag
till the end don't select x-axis once
again enough enough you see now what you
doing
abisola you are selecting X
also got it ABA if you are selecting
x-axis you may not able to see that
option
clear now how to edit this

going to edit this name if I right click
on this so here you have option called
editas you see now right click on this
bookcases look at my

profit right click on this other and
here you have option called edit alas
you want this
one right click on this other click on
edit alas make it as
positive
profit yeah
how do I click on the correct axis you
don't need to you see abisola have you
created a group first of all tell me
have you created a
group have you created a
group you see can we change
them I mean to say can we change
different
color you see to change different color
my dear friends you just double click on
it abisola what you have to do you have
to just double click on this for

plus profit that means positive profit
you can select green color click on
apply that's

you can double click on this profit
negative profit or positive profit and
you will see one option called edit
colors pick that group and apply the
color pick that group and select the
color
done now this is called group
this is called
group there is another way to create a
group oh is it yes there is another way
to create a
group how we can create the
group how we can create the bins let's
see now for
example guys for example let's
see let me take a new sheet all of you
take a new sheet
all of you take a new
sheet yeah so here we do have let's
say what do we have let's see which one
we'll pick shall we take the
country we have only US country okay
let's see so we have a state column
right so let's say for every uh let's
say group of states we have a
lead let's say we do have 10 states for
this 10 states we have particular lead
let's say asish leading 10 states and we
do have 10 more States those states are
leading by whom let's say
lesle how we can create this kind of a
group or for example with we would like
to
categorize States based on region let's
say few
states east side east
region and we do have 20 more
States those are are North Side North
Region we do have few more States those
are belongs to west region got the point
so how we can group
them let's see now go to state here
click on this Arrow
Mark click on this state there is an
arrow Mark small drop down you see this
one click on
this go to create so here we have an
option called
group click on this
group this is another way of creating
the
group okay
click on this group all of you I'm
holding my screen if you lagging
anywhere let me know done now if you
want to give a name to this group you
can give a name over
here see these many states we have what
you can do randomly you can pick one
state scroll
down and hold shift key and
select I repeat select one state hold
shift key and randomly pick one
state that means we are
creating one group by considering all
these
states now once you select these many
states simply click on what group click
on
group once you click on a group by
default you will see states names you
have to give a name to this let's say
east region
all these states belongs to
East got
it if you missed any point let me show
you once again select one
state and hold shift
key hold shift
key and randomly select any one state
like
this I'm selecting these many states and
click on group but default group name
will be your state
names so what I'm going to do now I'm
going to rearange it I'm going to say
South
Region all it if you're lagging let me
know because I'm anyway going very slow
I cannot repeat
this anyway I'm going very
slow if you're lagging let me
know don't ask me after 5 minutes 10
minutes select one
state hold shift
key and randomly pick one state like
this and click on
group and how to rame you see by default
you'll have state name as a group name
so this is let's say not
region got it
group we have created four different
regions so this is how you can create
the
group got it click on
apply click on apply or okay you see
under data
section you're going to see a New Field
called State
group can we use this
field to visualize the data answer is
yes you can make use of this new group
to visualize the data also oh is it yes
for your better understanding what I'm
doing I'm going to drag and drop the
state under row
shelf yeah now I'm going to
place let's say profit under column
shell you
see this is also another way of creating
the
group
here now all of you take a new
sheet once again
all of you take a new
sheet okay what do you mean by
hierarchy what do you mean by
hierarchy what is
hierarchy yes guys any idea what is
hierarchy no
idea like trees like a flow of pathway
hierarchy like
trees going in the flow different
values okay it's kind of a grouping okay
we are going to put relevant values
Under One
Roof right let's say simple example is
let's
say we have a team
lead under team lead we have a team
members right all these team members
reports to team lead and team lead
reports to what whom he will report to
managers and this manager reports to
whom they will report to senior manager
and the senior manager reports to whom
let's say
directors or VPS yeah so this is called
hierarchy this is called
hierarchy got it now we are going to
place actually relevant you know
Dimensions relevant categories Under One
Roof that will make us that will make
that will help us to drill down
further you can drill up or you can
drill down you can drill down or you can
drill up based on your business
requirement okay now if you
see this all order
date or ship
date most of the
time date field in across all the bi
tools will have the hierarchy by default
you don't need to create any hierarchy
when you have a date column you see
now if I drag and drop this order date
under column
shelf look at my screen
what I did I just drag and drop this
order ID under column Shi you see my
screen
here by default it has created a
hierarchy under this year actually this
date is now rolled up by year if I want
to drill down further I can see now
quarter level data you see now I clicked
on this plus Mark we have this again can
we go further can we do Dr down yes if
if I click on this plus Mark again we
can see data at month-wise you see
month-wise data again if I click on this
plus Mark again I can see Day
level got it so this is called
what this is called hierarchy by default
on top of Date column we'll have a
hierarchy for example if I want to have
my own
hierarchy how we can create the
hierarchy let's see now
you see Let Me Clear the sheet how you
can create the sheet people are removing
like this manually you guys are removing
like this okay instead of removing one
by one what you can do you can clear
this worksheet so here we have one
option called
clear clear the sheet you see if I click
on
this gone so this is how you can create
the sheet okay now what I'm going to do
I'm going to create a hierarchy
okay so hierarchy means you know putting
all Dimensions Under One Roof all
relevant
items we have a
country right yes we have a
country under this country we can place
State yes under the state we can place
City yes these are are you know
geographical data correct these are
allot relevant Dimensions can I create
hierarchy on top of this
CS can we create hierarchy answer is CS
you
see before we proceed wait wait
uh ah we'll create on this what we'll do
now all of you go for a country column
here click on
this and here we have a
one drop down right click on this go to
create so here hierarchy click on this
create
hierarchy I'm holding my
screen you have to click on this hierar
first you have to select the main
item under this you're going to add few
more Dimensions once you click on create
hierarchy it may ask you to enter the
name of the hierarchy so click on this
see let's say goo I just enter the name
called Gio hit enter in this country
what we have to do we have to place
State how you are going to place the
state one way you can click on it you
can drag and drop over here like
this you can drag and drop like this if
you have too many columns sometimes it
become difficult to do drag and drop and
there is another way now you see City
this is another another way I would like
to have City also in this hierarchy so
I'm going to click on this drop down
City so here we have a hierarchy add to
hierarchy Gio I would like to add City
column under Geo
hierarchy this is also another
way done all of
you
yeah wow
clear now actually what is the
benefit what is the benefit to have a
hierarchy you see the
benefit I'm not going to drag and drop
country state city individually I'm
going to drag and drop this g
under column
shelf now just look at my screen I going
to place the sales value under
Rell yeah or is let me switch
this so that you can see very easily
now business benefit is I just Place
country or this entire Geo so here it is
now displaying this
hierarchy the user will have a scope to
drill down further anyway user cannot
see this how user can have a scope to
drill down
so here even if I over my mouse on this
you see here we have
option if I click on this plus you
see user can drill down from
here got
it so this is the benefit of having a
hierarchy is the benefit of having high
clear all of
you instead of placing four or three
columns what I will do I will take only
hierarchy field on column shelf or a row
shelf as then when needed user is going
to drill down and drill up
further clear all of
you
perfect okay we'll talk about Le
we'll talk about alas you see now for
example let's say let me check the data
so here we have the data right data in a
table form so here we do have a ship
mode we do have different types of ship
modes we have a standard class first
class second class yeah what
not four different types of ship modes
we have what I would like to do for our
you know business requirement based on
business requirement we have to have
different names for the ship mode let's
say first class I want to have let's say
premium class or something else how to
edit this name how to give a different
name for
this
so in order to use a different
name see what we have to do there are
multiple ways to rename them actually we
are not renaming or we are not replacing
actual data as main name suggest elas
will have actual data as it is but we
are going to replicate with some other
words okay we're not changing actual
data you see now we have multiple ways
if I go to data
source but let's not go to data source
because we are already working on a shet
right we'll see everything over here
only so here we do have a ship mode
click on this so here you have an option
called elas you see elas click on
this
done now in this ship mode we do have
four different ship modes first class
same day second class and standard so
actually this is our actual data
this is our actual data we would like to
you
know have a different name or different
value for this first class let's say
instead of having first class can we say
let's
say uh FC let's say
FC or if you want to have any other name
feel free to use this same day you just
double click over here let's say SD that
means same day yeah
second class let's say SC that means
second
class standard class let's say
STC standard
class you can have any value just for
our understanding purpose I'm using this
abbreviations okay and click on okay
that's
it can we use this in our visuals yes
why
not all of you just try to drag and drop
this newly created
leas is it
done now you have multiple ways to do
that just give me a
second now you see my my my screen just
give me just look at my screen as I
mentioned you can do
this from data source
also yes if you don't want to display
play this alas let see you can click on
this let see here if you want to have
this elas here from here also you can do
that and being in sheet one also you can
do that just now we have it
yep if you want to display actual name
also you can do that where it
isas you see here also we have multiple
options to do this
okay you have multiple options to do
that
now what we'll do
now we'll talk about again let's go back
to group see we have created a
group right so especially this
one we have created two different
groups one is for negative subcategories
and another one is a positive
subcategories fair enough now let assume
that let's say we have one subcategory
called
table as of now this table is now giving
negative
profit as of now this table is giving
negative profit hence it is in a
negative bucket let's say tomorrow
onwards this tables subcategory started
giving positive
profit do you think that this table
automatically falls under positive
bucket do you think that this table is
now placed under positive
bucket
yes yes
guys as of now this table subcategory is
giving negative profit
let's say tomorrow onwards the table
subcategory started giving
positive now can you expect this table
under positive
bucket or you're going to see that
negative
only you see whenever you're going for
a group do remember
groups are always static in
nature these are all static in
nature this stable subcategory will not
go to positive bucket if it is in a
positive State
no clear if you want to move from
negative to positive you have to
manually edit
this that means what when you are sure
that things will not change
frequently then only you have to go for
a
group if things are changing very
dynamically you cannot create a group on
it is it
clear similarly here also we have
created a group right let's say here we
have created this group in a different
way for example these many states
belongs to asish or Le asish is a Le for
these many states Jenny Scott is leading
these many states if it is fixed then
only you have to create a
group for example let's say California
moved from Ashish to Jenny
Scott then you have to manually
edit clear all of you so groups are
actually static in
nature dynamically it won't change if
you want to make any changes you have to
manually change them
clear yeah
now we have something called
set what we do have something called
set what is the
set based on the condition you can
create a
group based on a such based on a
condition you can create a group let me
take a new
page let's try to understand whenever
you are creating a set based on a
condition you see set based on a
condition you can create a
set actually data will be divided into
two parts
based on a condition whenever you have a
condition at the end you'll see two
things one is true or false if condition
is met that means it's a true statement
if condition is false that means we'll
see false
statement
clear now you can create the set based
on a condition that means we have true
or false two
things now set will create two groups
always how many groups two groups one
group is called
in another group is called
out you will see all those
items in in group which met the
condition
true if condition is true you will see
all those items under in
group if condition is not satisfied
you will see all those items under out
group for
example you have 100
products you would like to see top 10
products what will happen top 10
products you would like to see top 10
products you would like to
see 10 product will be placed under in
group
and we do have remaining
90 those remaining 90 products will be
placed under out grou what is
set
yeah clear all of you what is set set is
actually subset of the data you have
data subset of the
data and this subset of the data will be
divided into two
parts one is in group and another one is
the out
group you will see all those items where
condition is false sorry condition is
met if condition is met you'll see those
items under in group if condition is
false you'll see those items under out
group that's it you'll see always two
groups in and
out clear now what we are going to do
now we are going to create again let's
see we would like to see top 10 states
based on the profit
we would like to see top 10 states based
on the profit okay but this time we'll
we we'll give a try through
sets now how we can do that you see
now where is a
state so here we have a
state right if I place my More Than This
Here create a set
all of you click on this set all of you
click on this set
done now name of the set is what top
10 top
10 give a name called top
10 I would like to see top 10 states go
to Top by field top 10 based on what
based on the
profit click on
okay all of you click on
okay let me click on okay done the
moment when you click on okay you see
somewhere over under data section you'll
see top 10 set and icon for set is
different you'll see something like this
circles
you
see you'll have different different
icons for set you'll have this kind of a
icon for group you will see
attachment right for hierarchy you will
see different
one like this for calculated field you
will see something like this equal to
ABC for calculator
field
Yeah by looking at this icons you can
understand what is for parameter you'll
see something
else we ready to discuss
parameter so you have to look at this
icons right now top 10 set is now
created fantastic now just look at my
screen what I will do I will drag and
drop the state don't do anything just
look at my screen I'm placing the state
under row shelf so these are these are
our states and I'm going to place profit
under column shell
fair enough I'm just doing quick sort
and I'm going to enable data labels so
far so good okay so these are our
different states all the
states okay now we have a set just look
at my screen this is only for your
understanding purpose top 10 states just
look at my screen when I move when I
drag this top 10 set you see the moment
when I started dragging it's showing in
and out you see in and out in and out
you see now just look at my screen if I
place this under row shelf right before
the state just look at my
screen now it has created two groups one
is in group where you will see 10 states
and remaining States you're going to see
under out
group got
it clear all of you now what I will do
now let me clear
this let me clear the
sheet I'm going to place top 10 under
row shelf you see once again let me
Place profit under col column shell you
see now what is happening you'll have
two groups in and
out in means top 10 value and remaining
State value is under out
yeah so this is also another way of
visualizing it now let me clear this now
let's give a
try all of you drag and drop State under
R
shell and drag and draw profit under
column
shelf do the quick sort and enable data
labels now drag and drop this top 10 set
under filter shelves
finally drag and drop this top 10 set
under filter
Shell by default it will take in
group sometimes if it is if if it is
throw in popup stating which one you
want to pick you just take the
in most of the time by default it will
pick in only if it is asking you to
choose which one you want to take you
can take
in done all of you
all of you rename it give a nice title
to this report let's
say top 10
states using
cell can we have bottom 10 states can we
have bottom 10
states
yeah all of you create bottom 10 states
all of you create a
set how you can create a
set see
now go to state once
again click on Create and set this
one done all of
you let's create another
set to bring bottom 10
State create
set name it as bottom
10 now to have a bottom 10 again you
have to click on top only okay name it
as bottom 10 click on this by field over
here from this dropdown you have to
select the
bottom from this drop down you pick
bottom
type
10
profit and click on
okay done all of you once it is done
again take new sheet and display bottom
10
states once it is done all of you take a
new
sheet and display bottom 10
states I'm taking new
sheet let me drag and drop State under
relf profit under column
shelf do a quick sort and enable data
labels and where is bottom
10 so here drag and draw this under
filter sh you see it is a bottom
very
easy
perfect
now one interview
question we can create set only on
Dimensions make a note we can create a
set only on
Dimensions got it only on numerical
sorry non- numerical
column clear you see product name it's a
dimension you see we have option called
set segment is a dimension create a set
perfect ship mode is a dimension we can
create a set but if I go to a measure
discount profit s and quantity so these
are our numerical columns so here we
don't have that option called
set here we don't have any option called
set what do we have here we have
something called
bins what do we have we have something
called bins we'll see bin this we'll see
this bin how to create a bin also very
shortly but before we proceed you
see we have created two two
sets one is
top and another one is
bottom yes or no so we have created two
sets top 10 and bottom 10 can we combine
these two
sets can we combine two
sets why because let's say on a single
sheet
I would like to display top 10 at the
same time I would like to display bottom
10 states also what I would like to do I
would like to display top 10 and bottom
10 bottom 10 on a single sheet in order
to display these two I would like to
combine I have to combine two
sets is it possible yes it is a possible
okay what will happen when you combine
two different
sets you see my
screen all of you select top
10 you have to select the set if you
click on this drop down so here you will
see one option called create combined
set you will see this option only when
you select the set
set you'll see this option only when you
select on a set got it
click on create combined
set
now all of you stop doing I'm going to
give a name
called top and
bottom it's a name of this set called
top and bottom I'm I'm combining this
top 10 with what with
bottom with bottom okay now so here we
do have four different ways to combine
them it's like a
joint okay it's like a joint the first
one you see all members in both the
sets all members in both the sets so
what will happen just look at my screen
what will happen if I go for a first
set you have top
10 in this you have have two
groups one is in and another one is
out and you have another set called
bottom
10 in this also you
have two groups one is in and another
one is
out got it when we are combining these
two sets what will happen it will create
another
set it will create another set in that
set also we have a in and out whenever
you create any set you'll have two in
and out so now in newly created set or
in Combined set under in what you're
going to see so you will see all in
items from top 10 plus all in items from
bottom 10
sets in and in will be placed under in
and this out out items and this out
items will be placed over
here got it here you'll see top 10 and
bottom 10 in and in you see all members
in both the sets that means positive
values that means in group where
condition is satisfied those items will
be placed under
in clear all of you and remaining all
are other items placed under out
group is it
clear
perfect now we do have few more it's
like a you know full outer join inner
join left join and right join so we'll
talk about all these joints in our
upcoming sessions okay for time me what
you can do here my dear friends give a
name top and bottom okay select two sets
from each dropdown and go for First
Option all members in both the sets and
click on
okay now here we don't have option to to
combine with more than two sets but what
you can do you see now two sets are
combined you'll have one combined set on
top of it if you want to combine yes you
can
combine at then you'll have another set
that is called combined set on top of it
if you want to add another set yes you
can do
that clear Victoria me click on okay now
again you're going to see another set
top and bottom here now what we'll do
now just drag and drop this what state
under row
shelf and drag and draw profit under
column
Shell let's do a quick sort and enable
data
labels now you have to drag and drop
this top and bottom under filter shell
wow just drag and
drop top and bottom set under filter
shelf top 10 and bottom 10
states using
combine
s all of you change the
title looks good all
good
fantastic now shall we proceed now my
dear
friends let's go back to top 10 states
here we have a top 10
states yes of course we have a top 10
states now user is asking hey dude I
don't want to have always top 10 states
sometimes I may go for 15 sometimes I
may go for 20 or sometimes I may go for
five also got it so how we can display
based on user input understood what is
the requirement what user is asking hey
I need one window where I'm going to
choose how many items I want to see for
example if I say top five I would like
to see top five for example if I want to
see top 10 I'm going to pick 10 to
display top 10 if I say 15 I would like
to see top 15 states so how we can allow
user to pick the number at the same time
based on his selection we would like to
display the
visual based on user selection we would
like to
display the
visual so this is something called
parameters what it is
parameters so if you want to take user
input value I repeat if you want to take
user value user input value and based on
that value if you want to perform any
additional calculations or based on that
input value if you want to make your
visual too Dynamic you can do
that or to perform what if analysis
you'll go for a parameters in a nutshell
you want to get something from the
user in a nutshell you want to get
something from the user based on
user value you're going to perform
certain
actions that is called parameters
parameters are more powerful
you can use this parameters in your
calculations you can use this parameters
in your
visuals got it all of you now how to
create a parameter let's see
now it's very easy you see now so here
let me click on
this this Arrow Mark oh here there are
many ways to call parameter but this is
this is easiest way this is easiest way
click on this dropdown here you have
option called create
parameter all of you click on this
create
parameter done let me click on create
parameter now let's give a
name what to select nothing Ashish you
see my screen I have highlighted with
the
markers here you have a small drop
down click on this here you have option
called create parameter
click on this create parameter let's
give a name to this let's say top
n this parameter name is top n let's say
top n what is the data type the data
type is what integer just give me a
second okay what is the data type it's
the integer select this integer now so
here you
see this one
what type of value you want to
allow if you said allow all if you said
all that means user can enter any
value user can enter any
value if you want to create your own
list predefined
list you can go for a
list if you want to set a range you can
set the range also what we'll do now
we'll pick the list
will be the list so I'm trying to Define
one list predefined list so minimum is
let's say
five yeah 10 or a
15 or a
20 you see all of you what you have to
do you select you just name it as a top
end data type of this is a
integer right allowable values must be
list we are going to create a list
manually you have to enter over here and
once it is done click on
okay done display as if you want to
display this with something else yes you
can display that
also but don't make it two changes make
it very simple click on okay done all of
you once you click on okay on data
section you'll see this parameter
see do you all see this under parameter
section based on version to version
you'll see
this yeah they have created separate
section to place all the parameters you
may or you may not able to see the
section okay don't get confused if you
don't
see so we have now
parameters let's show this parameter to
user how we can display this click on
this drop down here show
parameter click on show parameter
done now I'm in top 10
states right so now right hand side we
have top 10 parameters
remember I didn't click on show me if
you click on show me you could not able
to see this it's now
covering make sure to see this top end
parameters now from this drop down if I
select anything now is it
changing is this V is changing based on
my
input
no so we have to create relation between
these two yes or
no we have to enable connection between
these two any guess how we can enable
the
connection any guess how we can enable
the connection between this parameters
and this
visual okay now you tell me just hold on
let me give you a
clue how we have defined this
10 where we have defined this
10 you tell
me filters it's a set right while
creating set we have defined
10 agree all of you agree you see we
have seen this States top 10 states
using set
how we have set this 10 in set we have
right now let's go to that set top 10
set this one top 10 set click on this
top 10 set here you have to click on
edit the
set here you can edit the

can
edit see edit is
set got it
if you click on this edit
set now tell
me where we have to make a
change this is top here we have entered
manually this is a static
value we don't need static value over
here somehow we have to get this
parameter value agree all of you
somehow we have to get this parameter
value over here how to get this
parameter value over
here if you click on this drop down here
you will see newly created parameter
called top
n from this drop down you have to pick
the
parameters got it all of
you now click on okay now is it changing
now
now if I select five items oh wow
superb 10 oh my goodness 50 oh my

interview they will ask you how to
display Dynamic top and
items
yeah okay now let me pick top
five I'm displaying now top five items
you see in this page there is a small
bug may I know what is that
bug I'm displaying top five items but
there is a bug now tell me now yeah
title yeah you see the
title it is still says 10 but I'm
displaying how many I'm displaying
five got it so somehow I should get this
five over
here that make more sense correct
somehow I should get this parameter
value over

Dynamic correct all of
you now so how to edit this title how to
make this title two Dynamic if you
double click on
this you can you can edit this I am
removing this

get parameter value you see remove the
10 so here you have something called
insert you see here you have something
called insert if you click on this
insert you will see parameter here you
have to select parameters what is the
parameter name top n it's a parameter

done you see parameters top
end now you on
apply and click on
okay is it done all of
you see click on okay now this title
also now two Dynamic let's say 10 oh my
goodness let's see 15
20 5 yeah make sense
we'll come back to this parameters later
once again we'll see how to use this
parameter in our
calculations there is always a way to
spin the balls correctly so that others
can understand very
easily if you see the
flow if you see the flow you see very
neatly and
clearly we are going through each and
every topic and we we can easily connect
them also correct so what we have seen
today so we have seen what is tab public
tblo desktop yeah we have seen the basic
sorting and how to sort based on some
other fields and we applied filters
using Dimensions measures and date
filters and we have gone through
interactive filters and we talked about
context filter this context filter is
important during interview they will ask
you and we have seen how to group
Dimensions yeah through using visuals
and another way also and hierarchy we
have seen and we have seen how to name
itas and we have seen set right we can
create set only on Dimensions not on
measures remember this during interview
they will ask you can we create a set on
measure answer is no you can create set
only on
Dimensions right and we have seen how to
combine two
sets right we have combined two sets to
highlight top 10 and bottom 10 at last
we have seen parameter also parameter is
nothing but user input value we can take
user input value to do further analysis
what if analysis got it now it is time
to save your file remember once again
how you can save this file you guys are
using tblo public that means you cannot
save locally to save it you have to
publish this in the tblo server go to
file at then end you will see save tblo
as Okay click on it and it will ask you
to enter the credentials use your
credentials and upload it that's a wrap
