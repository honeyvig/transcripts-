i was the head of engineering
my work was
a supervisory one
especially
working out
at my job position for several years i
realized i was in touch

programming work was reduced to fifteen
percent of my work
i wanted to queue together to constantly
so i wasn't for promotion and also i
wanted to do more programming i also
didn't want to start a fresh of course
so i took the full stack java
development course at september
prior to simple learn
i was pretty much a self-taught
java developer but the cost was very
good i have not only learned java
