description box Bel below to find a data
science and data analytics program that
fits your experience and areas of
Interest now without further delay let's
get started with our powerbi project for
beginners which is a sales dashboard in
real time now before getting started
let's consider a simple use case for our
realtime sales dashboard business group
so the context is let's imagine there's
a client and the client owns a business
operating across various regions and
product categories with goals to grow
and improv performance now let's discuss
the challenge the client struggles with
limited visibility to sales data traffic
to lead ratios and lead to conversion
rates this lack of information leads to
missed opportunities and inefficient
resources location now let's plan a
solution to this with our realtime sales
dashboard a realtime sales dashboard
provides the client with a clever view
of critical business metrics which
includes the following firstly eight the
dashboard will show real-time sales
across regions and states allowing the
client to identify which areas are
performing well and which are the ones
which need more attention second one
product category performance sales
breakdown by product category will help
the client determine which products are
driving revenue and which may need more
Focus this allows for targeted marketing
and inventory management now the third
one traffic to lead ratio the dashboard
will display the percentage of website
visitors converting into leads if this
ratio is low the client can improve
website usability or come up with
promotional strategies fourth one lead
to order conversion rate tracking lead
to order conversions reveal how many
leads become customers a low conversion
rate signals the need for changes in
sales process for improved checkouts now
the last one which is the impact on
business strategy the dashboard gives
the actionable insights to focus
resources where they are needed the most
understanding which regions and product
categories are underperforming allows
for timely adjustments so in conclusion
a realtime sales dashboard enables the
client to monitor critical metrics
address inefficiencies and make
datadriven decisions now that's the
importance of a realtime dashboard now
let's continue with the most powerful
data analytics tool which is the powerbi
and built a real time sales dashboard
now this is our data set so if you could
see here we have certain entries or
columns just a moment yeah there you go
so we have order ID order date and
delivery date customer ID product
quantity traffic leads orders Revenue
Etc correct now we will make some
modifications to this particular data
set and we will continue with an
automation where we will use powerbi and
power query to make make some
transformations to this particular data
and pull this data onto powerbi
dashboard or powerbi platform and then
build a completely functional and
interactive
dashboard now we are on powerbi so we
will select a blank report so this is
how a blank report looks like so we can
directly start off with importing the
data but before that now we can directly
start off with pulling the data from
Excel data source or you can also pull
data from SQL Server if it's data you
can just pull it to the platform that's
how powerbi works but before we do that
before we import the data to the powerb
platform let's add a background so this
particular background acts as a
dashboard template now you can add a
dashboard template by selecting the
visual option over here and selecting
the canvas background and browsing the
image so my image is in the download
section so this is the one papia
dashboard
open and here you can have 100%
transparency or you can reduce the
transparency to about
90% there you go now image fit should be
fit there you go now we have the
template ready now we can get started
with importing the data now if you can
see the data you can you can see uh I
have 20 22 23 24 and 21 but inside this
for I just have one file which is 2020
so we dealing with five data sets right
so we're dealing with five data sets and
uh I'll tell you why I'm doing this
right so uh today we are in 2024 but
tomorrow we'll be 2025 and later 2026
and so on right so it is obvious that
every year a new or fresh data is
generated now if you give a location to
your platform which is powerbi and
whenever new data is generated if you
just pull the data the data will be
automatically analyzed and your data set
or your dashboard will be updated right
so we're trying to automate that so
let's follow that particular uh option
so to do that go to file option and here
you can see import button or sorry get
data and here uh go to the get data
started to get started and here you'll
have a bunch of options so you can
directly choose an Excel work work text
XML so we will choose the folder one
right now connect to the
folder browse add the folder path it's
in downloads and
uh so this is the one powerbi aers data
just cross check
once yeah this is the one PBI aers
data with one single folder yes perfect
I can close the file
press okay now that you have set a
location of your data press okay now it
will automatically select the data set I
just click on
that so instead of before loading we
would like to or I would like to do some
transformations to it so order of all
those four options uh instead of loading
I chose the uh transform option right
now we are on the power query now click
on this button which shows us double
down arrow keys to have a preview of
your dat set now select the first option
which happens to be the sheet
one now
okay now you have a brief overview of
your data right now let's do the
Transformations which we're looking for
the first one so here you can see a
column known as Source name so we have
an entire entry of source names here but
we don't want that what we can do is you
can just remove that particular column
now you can see one of the columns has
been removed so that step has been
monitored right so order ID is fine it's
an integer or number format now let's
check the order date and the delivery
date so we want this information so make
sure that the data type is perfect it
should be in date data type nothing else
and coming into customer ID here you can
see there is a small problem with it so
the customer ID is is
13278 along with the name right now
let's imagine we want two different uh
columns let's imagine we want customer
ID as a separate column and customer
name as a separate column can you do
that yes we can so all you have to do is
choose the option
of split column by D limitter and you
will have a new window popped up and
here you can choose uh the D limitter so
it has already recognized it it is
showing hyphen but the thing is we are
keeping it as space hyphen space because
in the column it is located as the same
or it is mentioned as the same just
press okay and there you go now you have
customer ID and customer id2 so this
will be not customer ID do1 it will be
just customer ID and this will not be
customer ID do2 it will be
customer name make sure that you watch
everything here right the rename column
step is also being recorded here now if
you want to change the data type you can
also change the data type go to type and
here you have the whole number option
it's fine and also check the audit date
and uh delivery date change type or uh
change uh it isn't dat it's fine now um
we have customer name category product
quantity traffic leads orders cost to
company now let's let's say I want a new
column which shows me profit now how do
you calculate profit so profit can be
calculated by subtracting revenue from
cost to the company so select the first
Revenue column second will be the cost
to company because we are trying to
subtract revenue from cost of the
company now what you'll do is go to add
column and here choose
subtract there you go now instead of sub
R fraction rename it as
profit and I you can drag and drop this
particular column right next to cost to
company right and sometimes you may get
negative numbers don't worry because the
client try to offer some discounts and
if you're selling some products on
discount then it's obvious that you'll
get a negative number it's fine not a
problem he's trying to uh you know kind
of send out the or finish the
stock from the inventory right now if
you come to the uh initial states where
you have audit date and delivery date
let's say I want to calculate number of
days taken by the delivery agency to
deliver the product to your customer now
that can be calculated by subtracting
delivery date from ordered the date
right now choose the delivery date
column first next the order
date right now same go to add column and
here subtract days now again it will go
all the way to the last instead of
subtraction you can rename it as days to
deliver there you go you're fine now you
can drag and drop this particular column
next to the order datea and Order uh
delivery
date there you go now check the data
type for your profits and
revenue so now we are back to the column
Revenue cost to company profit select
all three columns at once and right
click or double click change type to I
want the data type not as decimal number
or anything else I want it to be
currency let's check for the option as
currency it's okay U as of now I'm
unable to find out where exactly we have
the column or settings to change it to
currency format or dollar format but if
you know please feel free to comment uh
in the comment section below so that our
Learners will also have that information
so far I'm comfortable with the data
transformation now what I can do is just
go to home and in this option you can
close and
apply shortly the data will be
loaded there you go if you drop down
here you have everything you require
category cost to company and you can
just select this option over here table
View and you will have a complete view
of your data set so we have order ID
audit date delivery date days to deliver
which we made a new transformation and
customer ID separated from customer name
category product and we also added cost
to company profit calculation which is
also available here right now go to the
visualization view right now here we are
supposed to add the um kpis traffic kpi
leads kpi ers kpi and revenue kpi and
here since we also have uh in the
initial stage we discussed about four
five different years right so we have
2020 2021 2 3 4 and five so we will be
having about four to 5 years so for now
I just selected 2020 right so once we
add all the remaining data sets we will
have an option here drop down option
which will show the year data as well in
case if you wanted to track down the old
years data how the product performance
was available in the last year or last
before you can go through that here
we'll have a drop down option for state
and here you'll have a drop down option
for product if you want to specifically
search for a specific product
performance you can also do that and all
state sales so you'll have a map chart
over here and you'll have a
month-on-month sales line graph here
status so order delivered in the in
pursuit or if cancelled you'll have all
that status here and category so we have
about three to four categories and we
have five regions so you can see the
sales data in bar graph and regions so
let's proceed with that I hope I made a
brief overview of that now what we will
do is add the kpis first which is
traffic leads orders and revenues so
here you choose the
card and here you can add it now select
traffic
data drop the data here and uh check the
aggregation that is some
fine and you can make some settings to
it right you can go to visualizations
here and you can select
uh the layout and here you have call
outs and go to General again and if you
don't want the header ion you can remove
it and you can go to FX and you can
increase transparency there you go so
that you have a background there and if
you don't want the visual body you can
eliminate it
so you can remove the background as well
and now push this particular kpi to
here so the background is
off you can adjust the uh height and
width of U your card as well or you can
manually do it over here
which is also
fine we want values and transparency
will be 100% I don't want okay that's
the text
transparency so that's the value
transparency we want we don't want to
label sum of traffic and uh here you can
also select transparency here fine so
far so
good
layout I don't want the background for
label I don't want a border for label I
just want the value I can just keep it
here there you go Center
align Center align as per our request
and now what you can do is just copy and
paste the same card once again here we
will change the data values right so
initially we had sum of traffic now we
don't want traffic here I want leads
drop the data value leads to here check
the aggregation it should be
sum now you can copy paste it once again
and paste it in orders now we want
aggregation of orders so we will remove
the leads here and and we will add
orders make sure that the aggregation is
some sometimes it may change so pay
close attention to it copy paste once
again and you will have Revenue numbers
here make sure that you are adding
Revenue here most of the time you will
be focusing on Revenue very rarely
profit
okay if you want specifically profit you
can also add that there you go now here
so copy paste once again
here you will add the value as date
order
date so if you could use the drop down
here or drill down
option from here itself hierarchy you
can pull here okay you can eliminate
this one pull here and add to the data
field so that you have U okay we don't
want the count aggregation we
want okay it is considering it as a
value but not to worry we will check
this later proceeding ahead let's add
state so for that we want a slicer right
so we will add slicer here make some
changes to it
go to visuals to the
slicer let's try to add state to it and
then try to make some changes to it so
we we
have okay we did not include State here
but anyways we can have a customer name
option over here right so we can call
out customer name and add it to the
field and we can make some changes to it
right and here if you use this
particular
option
here in you can include a search bar
okay along with that if you go to the uh
visualizations option over
here you can change the slices settings
to a drop-down option and
uh you can go to
General and you can also remove the
header icon and inside the FX you can
remove the
background and you can also remove
the title
the slicer header now what you can have
is just simple name of customer over
here uh we will have that state renamed
as customer name not a big
problem just select it align it to the
center there you go now you can copy
paste this particular filter or Slicer
in here and you can change
the customer name to product
name so here we have the product added
to the field there you go now you can
have the search bar and you can also
specifically check for a specific
product so we missed out a few columns
uh during our data transformation so we
use some be lookups and updated the data
now we have the required columns
together the state and the region
columns so we can proceed with the
visualizations as per the previous plan
right now we also added the a column so
there was some data manipulation to be
done here as well so we did that we
added a filter uh I mean a slicer and as
per the data we just have one year here
2020 so we will select that and uh here
we have the states of United States all
states current states in United States
of America and here we have the product
details right now let's proceed with the
next part of our dashboard for which
will be the uh bar graph or column graph
so we will have the uh column graph and
Status uh so that we will have a brief
explanation on how many number of orders
are delivered and how many number of
orders are not so we will use order ID
in uh y axis and it should be uh sum of
all the orders and in xaxis we will have
the
status all status which will be in
x-axis total number of Autos delivered
and total number of Autos not delivered
in transit so we'll have a detailed
information on that front and uh now we
will do some settings so that we make it
uh similar to the other ones so we we
don't want title we don't want header
and Tool tips maybe we want them and if
we go into efforts background I don't
want the background it should be plane
as for the
plan you can adjust the scale of the
graph there you go we have the order
status now category wise sales let's
take a donut chart is it here and we
will have the
values
sales St and we have
Revenue
here add it to the values and the legend
should be
category there you go now we have the
category wise sales go into visual
effects we don't want the
legend we might use the details and in
general you don't want the title of the
graph header icons and to tips and in
the FX I want it to be a transparent
background now adjust the
scale there you
go
region now we can have a finnal graph
here and in values we can add revenue
and uh the aggregation should be sum of
Revenue and in a category we will add
the
region so we have
Central north south east west regions
going to visuals data labels category
labels okay we want category
labels in general we don't want the
title header
icons eliminate them and Tool tips just
have a look and after to that FX I want
it to be a transparent background there
you go adjust the
scale back to
visuals now we have the conversion rate
as well now let's proceed with the map
chart go to visuals select map
chart there you go now adjust it to the
scale before we add the values
so that on a quick Lance you have all
the states details right now let's add
the locations so state will be the
location and in The
Legend So state is the location here and
in the values we will
add data field which is
revenue there you go now go to the
visuals and in general you don't want
the title you already have the title
right here and
uh go to effects make it look
transparent so we don't want the
background here and on a glance can just
increase the size of the map and reduce
the size so that that you have an
overall view in one location right just
like that so we choosing the North
American or total All American states
here you can choose accordingly now
let's proceed with the line dra so one
thing to remember whenever you're
working with dates right so whenever you
have calendar or date related data
entries in your dat set go with the line
graph to check the performance on day by
day week on week month month on month or
year on year levels right so there you
go now let's add xais here so expand the
date or you can choose audit date here
let's choose the audit date and we will
have month in the
x-axis and in the y axis we will see the
revenue again if you want Revenue you
can go with that if you want to see
traffic details or if you want to see
any other detail you can just change the
values here
right there you go now you can see uh
one last thing uh go
to General and here FX remove the
background title we have already placed
the title here so we don't want that and
to
tips there you go so the fully
functional and
interactive dashboard is now ready right
and now this particular dashboard
works now let's save
it save it as PBI sales
dasboard there you go now what we have
to do is let's add the remaining data
correct so we have created a template we
have created a similar vpa type similar
uh query or kind of automated the
process now whenever we add the new data
into to that file that initially created
powerbi will automatically extract that
particular data and give you an updated
report right now let's go back to the uh
files and go to download section now
what we will do
is Select these files cut and drop them
into the powerbi data
folder and just close
it right now go to home home and just
click on
refresh to
refresh and now we have 10,000 rules
correct now for for the validation
purpose let's check the years here now
we have all the other years now let's
select 2024 the latest year and you have
the latest reports currently on your
dashboard now you can select a specific
State for the
final reports and you can also select a
specific U product I would like to go
with the chair and you have an updated
report right here and including the map
correct so this is how you can create a
completely interactive and automated
realtime powerbi dashboard an end to end
powerbi dashboard and with that we have
come to an end of this session on
realtime powerbi end to end dashboard
