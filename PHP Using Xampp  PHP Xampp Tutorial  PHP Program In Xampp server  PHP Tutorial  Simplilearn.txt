hello everyone and a very warm welcome
to simply learn
today we'll learn about the web server
solution software xampp and then use it
to run a php script
so without further ado let's get started
and learn what exactly is zam
now zam stands for cross platform
apache server maria database php
and then finally
perl
xampp is an open source application that
is developed by apache friends and is
one of the easiest ways to host a local
web server with access to mysql database
php and perl
so it is an all-in-one package
so now that we have an understanding of
what zamp is let us set up the software
on our system and then see how to use it
to run a php script
so now to set up the xampp software what
we need to do is
let us open the browser
and
download
our software
so as you can see here
apachefriends.org is the official
website from where you can download the
sam
software since we are using the windows
version we'll download it for windows
although it is available for linux and
mac os as well
now let's wait for the download to get
finished
it almost is
now
let's open the setup and install our
software right away
continue installation
next
now from here you can select all the
extra files that you want to install
along with the xampp setup or you don't
want to install
now this is the default folder for zamp
installation that is c drive zam and i
would recommend you keep it that way
i think this issue here
yeah well
this is the
folder for my old xampp
now
we wait for the installation to get
finished and then we'll run a quick php
script a welcome or hello world kind of
script to see how this zam software
functions along with php
now the installation is almost done
we'll just wait for a few
now the installation is complete
and
now
let us open the control panel to check
if it's
done correctly
yes
everything seems fine now so this is the
control panel for the xampp software
which includes all the services provided
by it and in our php tutorials we'll be
mainly using the apache server and the
mysql one
now
let us write a php script to show you
how
a xampp software functions so open the c
drive and the xampp folder or wherever
you have installed
it on your computer
and
into the xampp folder
open htdocs
and let us now create another folder for
a project name
let us name it demo
and
create a new text file
index
and the extension will be dot php
now let's write a
very simple php script
welcome
to
simply learn
and let's close the php script
save it
now before running the script onto a
browser first thing we need to do is
start apache server
now since we are not using any database
for this php script we don't need mysql
at the moment
now let us open a browser
now to run a
script or a program using xampp what you
need to do is type in localhost into
your browser
which will open the local web server
that the xampp software has hosted
followed by the name of your folder that
you just created that is demo
and click on enter so as you can see
welcome to simply learn our program runs
perfectly and this is how you use sam to
run php programs so thank you everyone
