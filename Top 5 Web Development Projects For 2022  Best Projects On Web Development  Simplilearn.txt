website let's start this video with
front-end web development
the front end refers to the visible part
of any website anything the user come
across while going through a website is
known as the website's front end certain
Technologies are used to create an
eye-catching front end of a website some
popular Technologies are HTML hypertext

layout of a website it uses a series of
elements to define the basic structure
of a website CSS cascading style sheet

display variation for different screen
sizes CSS is the go-to technology for
everything
JavaScript JavaScript is a scripting
language that adds interactivity and
responsiveness to a web page HTML CSS
and JavaScript can be used together to
create a fully functional front end of a
website although these Technologies can
be used to create the front end but
several other techniques can also be
used for the front and web development

web development
backend in simple terms refers to behind
the scene operations of a website

see or interact with this part of the
website some technologies used for
backend development are PHP preprocessor

Java Java is one of the most used
programming languages for developing
Dynamic web applications it allows us to
easily develop and deploy a web
application on a server with the help of
Technologies like servlet and GSP
certain databases also fall under the
category of web development some most
commonly used databases in web
development are MySQL and mongodb
if you already have an idea about some
of these Technologies then you are good
to start with projects let's move ahead
and we'll now discuss the top 5 web
development projects to work on
these projects will not only help you
understand web development more
efficiently but will also make your
resume more interactive at the same time
the first project we have on our list is
a gaming application certain gaming
applications you can make if you are a
beginner to a project you can use HTML
CSS JavaScript and jQuery to create the
applications front-end for the backend
you can use node.js and mongodb it's not
necessary to use these Technologies
instead of that you can use any
technology you are comfortable with once
done with the application you can also
deploy the web application using Java
you can also mention this project in
your resume which will greatly impact
the interviewer also you will learn a
lot about how the different front-end
and back-end Technologies come together
to create a good looking web page
the next project we have on our list is
an e-commerce website creating an
e-commerce website is fun and helpful in
understanding the concept of web
development you can create a website for
local vendors or small scale businesses
and mention that in your CV
you can add several aspects like login
the sign up page and the contact page
also an e-commerce website attracts a
lot of traffic it will impress an
interviewer or anyone who goes through
your scene
so any website you make needs to be
unique from the existing ones it will
help you in standing out from the crowd
the next project we'll discuss is a
clone website or application you can
create a clone website like Facebook
Instagram or any other social media
platform in fact you can create clones
of websites like Spotify Netflix or any
other Ott platforms for example if you
are making a clone for Netflix make sure
it looks more attractive whether it be
colors text images or anything it should
look like you have created something of
your own
while creating such projects don't
forget to make them unique and easy
going for the user my easy going I mean
the user should not face any problem
while going through the website the next
project idea we have on our list is for
freelancer Developers
you must have heard of platforms like
Fiverr and upwork similarly you can
create a website where developers can
connect with fellow developers and work
on projects together the number of
Freelancers is huge worldwide and all
they look for is an opportunity to work
for example if two people know the front
end and backend they can connect through
your website and come together for a
project
you can also mention all the companies
which look forward to collaborating with
Freelancers for several projects it will
increase the website's traffic and help
you level up your skills
the last idea we have in our list is the
most useful for any web developer it can
help you in getting a high paying job as
well the idea is to create a portfolio
website for you
why is it necessary to develop a
portfolio website being a web developer
with hands-on experience in so many
projects you can't mention each and
every project on your resume in that
case you can create a website to mention
all the projects and give the user a
brief description of what you achieved
it will also increase the user movement
in your other website because if a user
goes through your portfolio and likes
any of your projects they will
definitely open the link to your other
websites and you will automatically get
some traffic you might be wondering why
we didn't discuss different Technologies
for each project so we started this
video and discussed all the Technologies

back end of any website there we assume
that you guys already have an idea about

Technologies that's an advantage for you
