YouTube channel today we are going to
explore web development with python and
we'll start with exploring various web
Frameworks used for web development
moving on we will learn what is Django
and its key features further we'll
understand the Amity architecture of
Django but before we begin if you love

and before starting I have a quiz
question for you guys
and your question is
when was the first version of Django
released and your options are 2004 2005
2006 and 2007. please answer in the
comment section below and we'll update
the correct answer in the pin comment
you can pause the video give it a
thought and answer in the comment
section
now we will move to explore the various
web Frameworks used for web development
here are some of the most commonly used
ones we'll start with Django Django is a
high level web framework that follows
the model view controller or MVC
architecture pattern it provides many
built-in features such as an orm an
automation admin interface and a
powerful URL routing system Django
appears to be a MBC framework but you
can call controller The View and the
view the template next we have is the
flask
flask is a lightweight web framework
that is easy to learn and use it
provides a minimalistic core with
extensions that can be added to add
functionality as needed and next we have
is pyramid pyramid is a flexible and
scalable web framework that can be used
for both small and large applications it
is designed to be easy to use and easy
to extend next we have the bottle
framework it is simple and lightweight
web framework that is ideal for building
small applications and apis it has a
minimalistic core and supports many
extensions next we have analysis cherry
pie so cherry pie is a minimalistic web
framework that is easy to learn and use
it provides a built-in web server and
supports many extensions next we have is
tornado tornado is a high performance
web framework that is designed for
handling large amounts of traffic and
connections it provides a built-in web
server and supports many extensions and
next we have is web to py web to py is a
full stack web framework that is
designed to be easy to learn and use it
provides many built-in features such as
an orm a web-based ID and a powerful URL
routing system there are many other
python web Frameworks available as well
each with their own strengths and
weaknesses the choice of framework
depends on the specific needs of the
project and the preferences of the
developer now you'll move to see what is
Django
so Django is a high level web framework
for building web applications and python
it has many features that make it a
popular choice for web developers if I
talk about the average salary for a
Django developer
in us it's 105 000 and in India it's
rupees 8.4 lakhs per annum and now if we
talk about the features of Django there
are several reasons why someone might
choose Django over other web Frameworks
and these features include the first is
object relational mapping that is orm
junk provides an orm that allows
developers to work with a database using
python objects without having to write
SQL queries directly this makes it
easier to work with databases and
reduces the amount of code that needs to
be written next we have is automatic
admin interface Django provides an
automatic admin interface that allows
developers to manage their applications
data using a web-based interface without
having to write any code and next we
have URL routing Django provides a URL
routing system that allows developers to
map URLs to views making it easy to
build complex web applications with
multiple pages and Views next we have is
template engine Django has a built-in
template engine that allows developers
to create HTML templates using python
code this makes it easy to build Dynamic
web pages that can display data from a
database or other sources next we have
is format handling Chang provides a foam
handling system that allows developers
to easily create and validate HTML forms
making it easier to collect and process
data from users next we have is the
security features of Django Django has
built-in security features such as
protection against Crow site scripting
xss grow site request forgery csrf and
SQL injection attacks
it makes a very secure to use triangle
next we have is scalability Django is
designed to be scalable so it can handle
large amounts of traffic and data
without slowing down and at last we have
the built-in caching feature Django
provides a caching framework that allows
developers to Cache a frequently used
data reducing the load to the database
and improving performance so these are
the features which led developers to use
Django framework over others now we'll
see the MVC or MVD architecture that is
MVC his hair directed as mut
architecture and what Django uses so
Amity is model you template it's a
software architecture pattern used in
web applications development is commonly
used in popular web Frameworks such as
Django Ruby or rails and larval the
workflow can be explained as follows the
user requests a URL when a user requests
a URL from the web application the URL
is mapped to a specific view in the
application then we have view processes
the request this is the view and it
processes the request the view process
the request and interacts with large
model layer to retrieve or manipulate
data as needed the view also to create
some context object that contains data
that will be used to render the response
and the template it renders the response
the template receives the context from
The View and uses it to render the HTML
that will be sent back to the user's
browser and the response is returned to
the user the rendered HTML is returned
to the user's browser when it is
displayed as a web page and the user
interacts with the page the user
interacts with the web page by clicking
on links filling out forms or performing
other actions and then the process gets
repeated when the user performs the
action that requires another request to
the web application the process repeats
starting with the user requesting an URL
overall the MIT architecture separates
the responsibilities of the web
application into three distinct
components that is the model which
manages data and business Logic the view
which processes user requests and
interacts with the model and the
template which renders the HTML response
this separation of concerns make it
easier to develop test and maintain web
applications Django mvt that is model U
template is a software architecture
pattern that is commonly used in Django
framework this pattern divides the code
of a web application into three main
components that we have seen that is the
models views and templates and we just
see about models these are the backbone
of any Django application they represent
the data and the business logic and the
views and the templates now we'll move
on and build a simple web application
with the help of Django now we will
create a first Django project and for
that
first will go in Python projects and
create a new folder
and name it as
project one
and inside project one
will open the command prompt
and to create the Django project the
first thing you need is python installed
on your system
so I will show you guys
from where you can download the python
you can download from the official
website just go to the download section
and click on the download python 3.1.2
version that is the latest version so
you have to download the latest version
to make a Django project now moving on
and if you want to see like which
version is installed on your system you
could just
write a query
python space minus minus
version
and it will show you that is 3.10.2 and
the latest version is 3.1.2 so you can
install the latest version as my version
is above 3. it's okay to use that
now uh we'll use an ID
for our project and here I will use the
visual studio code
so you can use any ID which you have and
so on but I will suggest if you are new
and want to start with you can start
with the visual studio code so you can
download it from here that is for
Windows and get it installed and now I
will come back
to a folder
and we open the command prompt
and here we'll open the
or ideally that is video Studio code
with the command code space period
this will open the
Visual Studio code for us now
we will
open a new terminal here
terminal and new terminal so here in the
terminal we will write the command for
the Django admin to start a project so
there's a simple command start project
so it creates all the necessary files
for Django project that is mvt
architecture and before that you should
have extensions installed on your Visual
Studio code to get some suggestions and
it would be good for you while writing
the code
so I'll show you guys what I have
installed
I have python that is find tele sense
installed and I have also installed the
Django
okay
so you guys can also install it now
before running the Django
first we need to install it
so for that we'll just write the command
script install
Django
and you can also visit py website
don't just write Django
py
and press enter
so this is the official website you can
just copy the command and paste it in
your command prompt
so that it will just
run the files and get your Django
installed
as you can see that the requirement is
already satisfied I have already
installed Django so I will not install
the Django again so now we'll start with
a project and for that in the terminal
we'll use the
Django admin command and start project
that is the sub command of admin
so for that we'll write Django
admin
start project
and the name of the folder in which you
want to start the project
so we will write
word
as you can see that the folder is
created and if you just open it
you will see the number of files here
that is init.py asgi Dot py settings.py
urls.py and wsgi Dot POI and manage.py
so these are all the files that Django
gives you when you just write a command
start project and it will give you all
the files necessary for the Django
project
now here we'll run
the manage.py file to start our server
so for that we'll write the command
python
manage Dot py
runs server and click enter
okay so it won't be able to edit so what
we'll do is we'll come into this folder
that is the world folder and after that
we can run it it states that it can't
open the file so we'll just close this
Visual Studio code and get back to our
folder that was Project one and inside
it has created the world
so here inside this world
folder I mean open the command prompt
and cool out a ID that is Visual Studio
code and inside this
here we will get a new terminal
and inside this terminal we will write
python
manage.py
run server
by mistake we have written the wrong
spelling of python
so just
read it again python
manage.py run server
and press enter
now you can see
settings and they have started the
development server at HTTP
127.0.0.1 colon 8000 so we'll open this
link
so you can see that the installation was
successful and this is your first Django
project and you should be happy that you
have run this project now moving on this
is the default page now we'll create
some pages and show you how we can
create a basic project with Django so
first we will create a app and to create
the app we will write the command or
first this will stop this server and get
a new terminal and I will show you how
we can create a new app using Django so
to do that
we'll just
run a command python
manage.py
and you can see all the commands and
this is the command startup which
creates a new app so now we'll create a
new app and for that we'll write
python
manage
dot py space
startup
and we'll name our app
so you could see here
home app has been created and inside you
could see the files that is android.py
admin.py App Store py models.py test.py
and views.py
and this is a project world
now you can see in the project we have
settings.py file but we don't have
settings.pify in our app
and we have urls.py file in our project
and we don't have inner app but we need
to create urls.py file I will tell you
why we have to create it
so we have created
a urls.power file and we'll copy the
same content
from the project and paste it in I app
so first talking about the settings.py
file so settings files will be Project
Specific file so it would only include
in the project and in settings we have
information about templates and which
database you are going to use by default
we use sqlite that is Django uses the
sqlite if we go here you can see the
information about
install apps what installed what apps
are installed in
by default they are installed in Django
and the word middleware we are using
this is about templates
and the databases
now
in the home app we will create a file
urls.py that we have created and copy
the same from the project
urls.py file
and now if we move to urls
so what you can see here is that this
URL that is what status admin so if we
just run our server and just run it and
I will show you what this means material
patterns means here
so it has run
the server and we have opened it here
so
if you write slash admin here
you will be redirected to the admin page
so what it shows is that the admin page
if you just write slash admin with our
server that is the HTTP you will be
redirected to admin Dot sites.urls
now if a user have any query or passes
any query on a website the first thing
this project will do is it will take you
to the urls.py
file of the project
so this is the urls.py file of the
project
so it will take you there
now in this
what we'll do is
you can see in the terminal that it just
refreshes out what commands you will
write it just refreshes out and it will
show you on the website
now here
will write a path so that
if any user comes to a query it will
redirect it to the app or app and that
is to the urls.py offer app
so for that
first we will import that is from
django.urls
import
path comma include
and we'll set a path
that is
if we have empty path
then it would be included and redirected
to
home stored URL
and if this path matches it will go to
home.urls that is if it's the empty path
now we'll go to the home app
and
check its
urls.py now here we will create the
first home page
so for that
we will import
from our app from home
will import
views so in views.py
we create
all the functions
so I will tell you how we will create it
and how will be redirected to templates
currently we are not creating any
template but if we create any function
so that would be stored in the views
so we'll just set
a URL path here
so we'll set the path
and we will
write a function
and we'll name the function as index
and
name it as home
that is for the home page
now
we will move to the views.py file and in
this file
we'll create the index function which
will
do the following things and take you to
the home page website that will create
so from Django dot shortcuts we'll
import render and HTTP response
and we have imported HTTP response now
we'll create a
function
and name it as index
and inside will pass the request
and
will return
HTTP response here
and what it will
return is
this is Django home page
now
we will redirect
to the server
and we have to start the server again I
think
this one this is jungle we have deleted
terminal and we'll create a new one
and
run python manage.py
run server
now our server is ready to go
so it has opened and you can see this is
the Django home page so we have created
our home page the first one we have
created was the default home page
now we have our basic homepage here
now
we'll do some modifications and
add other things that would be static
and templates
now we see what happened here is we have
opened the port and the first query goes
to projects url.p1 that is Project one
URL dot py that is the word
and here
it has
gone to the home dot URLs and when it
com goes to home.urls what its state is
if your query is blank then you will run
the views.index function that is the
index function in views and inside the
index function what we are returning
this is Django home page
so
this function has printed this is the
Django home page
Now to create other pages
we can just go to urls.py
and right path
for
others
that is
when we write when we have written slash
admin it has taken to the admin web page
now if we write
about
so we will create a website and
in that there would be about section
and for that it will
run a function that we will create in
views and we'll name the function as
about only
and we'll write the name
about
and similarly
we'll create a path for
services
or contact us
and in that
and write views dot about
and give it a name
that is about
so you can see the error in the terminal
as we have just created the path for
that but we have not created the
function so we'll move to the views.bo
file
and we'll copy this function and create
a 1 4 about and contact us and
this would be
contact us
and in the views file
we'll name the function as
about
and we'll return HTTP response this is
about
not home page about page
and similarly
we will create it for
contact us
and we'll return this is contact us page
okay
now we'll save this and it will go
to our server
and write slash
about
and press enter you can see it shows
this is about page
so our queries are working fine
now we will create two folders that is
static and templates
so first we'll call
and create a folder static
and we'll create another folder
and name it as template
so from here we'll see how to use
templates and what is the use of static
so static is the folder in which we can
create any file
and we can store the data
that is
public that is anyone can see that data
extract their data or use their data
so static is used for that you can store
your images or any file you want to show
in public so that is stored in static
and templates are what in which we will
create the
HTML pages and we will apply CSS or we
can apply CSS also in
static also so that anyone can use it so
in this if we write
this
is a static file
after writing this uh we need to go to
the
our settings.py file and in here you
will see about the static files so this
is a static URL and
if you click on this link
it will tell you
how you can serve the
static files and use the static files
so this is the static files underscore
directories so if we use this we can
insert static files into our project
so we'll go into settings.py and here
you can paste this and but we need only
one static file not more than that
so we'll save this and move back to our
website
and here
now right
static and
name of the file that was
hello.txt
slash hello Dot
txt and if we press enter you could see
that the static file has been extracted
and it shows the data in it that this is
a static file
now we'll set the path for template so
that we can use the templates
project
so for that we'll write OS told
path to join
and inside I'll write
this
underscore
directory
comma
and we'll write
templates
no we will insert a HTML page in
template
so for that we'll create a
and we'll write index dot HTML and
inside this page
will add something that would be
this is our
request
HTML
page
yeah
we'll add some body also
that is in paragraph tag
we'll write
this is
the first
template
and in the settings.py
we have set the directories as base
directly slash template yes
you have created the folder with the
name template only
now we will move to our page and reload
it so you could see this
ID the first template we have written
ID
okay so this is the first template
and if you want to create something
good then you can use the bootstrap also
as it is for the lazy people
and I mostly use it
so first I will copy the
the root project file
and we'll replace this with us
and we'll see
what it has updated so now we have seen
what is Django and the features of
Django and how to create a Django admin
starter project and how to create an app
in Django and how to use templates and
static
files in Django so with that we have
come to the end of this session and I
hope the session was interesting and
