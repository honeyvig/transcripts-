tips for beginners the first one is
identify areas where you can specialize
you may believe that you can write on
any topic and your design is sufficient
to meet any challenges but your
potential clients want an expert you
need to stand out from the crowd so
identify areas where you can specialize
and where your knowledge will add value
for your clients develop an appropriate
portfolio around that area to Showcase
your skills to potential clients take up
online courses on your desired domain

yourself the second one is spread your
neck white to find clients you may
already have plenty of contacts in your
freelancing area because you have been
working in that business for some time
if not not you need to work to find
potential clients and it is worth
spreading your network set up your
website or blog to Showcase your
expertise set up or update your LinkedIn
profiles Etc the third one is set your
price and stick to it your hourly rate
needs to be sufficient to meet your
requirements it is not good if you
cannot earn enough in your chosen
freelance field to pay your bills
therefore start by identifying the rate
you need or want to earn once you have
decided on your early rate stick to it
as much as possible and do not bid for
work that is below your ideal rate the
fourth one is set expectations clearly
for every project and keep communicating
you may or may not want a formal
contract for every project you undertake
it is however a good idea to set out
clearly and simply what you desire to do
what you can deliver and when and how
you will work including your working
hours invoicing and payment terms it
will help if you were careful not to
over promise be sure you can meet any
deadlines you agree with and the last
one is be prepared to turn don't work
when you first start freelancing the
idea of turning down work may appear
offensive however it's better to turn
down work than fail to deliver it or
deliver something not to be required
Benchmark you should always turn down
work if you are not confident about
meeting the required deadline you do not
think you can do it the price is too low
