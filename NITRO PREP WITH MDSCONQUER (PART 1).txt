yeah hi good evening one and all I hope
I can sense the tents in the aspirins as
the date of need is out and exam was
preponed at 21 days compared to the last
year exam date so ok it's now time that
we need to run fast and try to cover as
much as tough as possible in smarter way
and I hope be a stronger team is clan in
a very better way to enhance the
preparation we come out with the best
schedule we come up with the best
question purpose we'll be planning to
post more than 100 videos in this last
90 days so that's what the plan of
action is so we'll be providing more and
best and refined work for you ok
let's work hard both you and some our
team so both together work hard to make
a decent end at the end ok so the date
of examination is December 14 to 0 1 8
and I hope you guys will definitely do
it well so now I'm will I'll be covering
few important things which are very
important an examination point of view
which were covered last in recent 2017
18 need examination topics which are
very very important
ok let's go in detail I'll be covering
dental and/or dental it also related
things so this is area where I have seen
multiple questions and of course it is
taken from 14th edition of corpus okay
the latest latest one and I don't know
why the purpose it allowed to give this
memory based stuff the first evidence of
calcification of both primary and
permanent they are very important make a
note make an order and the crown
completion dates as primary and
permanent as well as eruption sequence
as well as the eruption dates of all
primary and permanent people have seen
many many questions in 2017 as well as
in 2018 related to this chart
make a note the routine completion this
is a slight correlation ship between the
eruption routine completion but of
course I want you guys to make the
routine completion of
at least maxillary anteriors and
mandibular anterior they are very
important okay yeah clear I'll be going
further so of course I have seen many
questions related to this particular
table that's the difference between the
parotid submandibular as well as
sublingual the questions are the
development ok initial development
starts at four to six week in parotid
six weeks in submandibular and eight to
12 weeks in sublingual and the type of
secretion is purely serious in the case
of peyote mixed which is predominantly
serious in the case of submandibular
mixed which is predominantly mucous in
the case of sublingual and flow rates
are important please make a note and I
have seen questions related to the
amylase activity that is maximum in the
case of parotid and lysozyme accurately
that is maximum in the case of
submandibular and of course many
questions related to the openings of
these celebrity tux landmarks as well as
the name of the duck that is also stated
with the each clan of course unknown
thing is sudo capsule where a
well-defined thick pseudo capsule is
present is a peculiar feature of the
parotid so of course apart from these
please make a note that the parotid
gland is the only gland that derives
from the ectoderm okay it is ectodermal
dear elevator apart from these there are
many other glands in the body but
derived from the totem they are the
mammary glands and the pituitary glands
and parotid glands they derived from the
Acura make a note about this important
statement that the metal catalyst
disappears at 24th week of intrauterine
life and of course these are very
important in our Channel and note that
is the nerve supply of the gland blood
supply of the gland and the lymphatic
drainage of the gland
I'll be moving further so this is a
classification of the capillaries that
are present in the bodies the body
capillaries can be categorized into one
two three four
basing upon the semi permeability of
these capillaries the type one is called
as an a fenestration capsule type two is
a continuous which is a non fenestrated
and type three is a discontinuous caps
and a type 4 is a capsule that is also
cited the tight Junction and the
question in your exam is about the
capillaries that are present in the pump
type 1 and type 2 capillaries are
present in the pulp one important point
and majority of the metabolites that are
present in the pump are transferred by
these fenestration capsules which is
also called a type 1 captions it's 2018
nude
make a note about this child slide which
is very very important so going further
I'll be dealing about the layers that
are present in the pulp just go with the
order the painting that is present very
near to the pulp is called as a nap read
and even the first layer is called as an
ordinate of elastic layer second is
called as in a cell-free that is called
as nice and rich and fourth is called as
no punk or yes we go further so I don't
a plastic layer is the layer that is
present to the periphery jono free cell
free zone is called as no zone of inline
cell rate zone which is shown having
higher density and pulp core is present
at the center okay oh you know majority
of the questions okay I'll be just
moving to the further so again I have
seen many questions related to the
regenerate you triad or pulp
regeneration triad which can be called
as a tissue engineering track this
tissue engineering tried all these
consisting of a triad of three important
components there are the scan Force
scaffolds are nothing but which forms
the skeleton second one are the cell
cells are nothing but stem cells and
third one are signaling molecules which
are nothing but growth factors all these
combined li the result over a period of
time to form a regenerated tissue or a
regenerator Orca which is called as a
pump regeneration so basically I have
seen many questions on the stem cells
and the names and the full forms I've
seen a question called is no what is the
full form of DPS see that is nothing but
dental pulp stem cells which are
originated from the pulp of the
permanent teeth what is shared that is
stem cells of human exfoliated teeth
what is IDPs that is mu dental stem
cells which are taken from the primary
teeth PDL SC the periodontal ligament
stem cells SC AP that is stem cells from
the apical papal DFP C that is dental
follicle progenitor cells apart
I hope it's very clear and simple so
going further detail of these three
important points are self-explanatory
just go with them I have seen many
questions related to the a s changes
also for equals to changes in the pulp
which can be morphological and
physiological changes as the go as the
days increases as the A's increases that
will be decreasing the pulp volume there
will be increasing in the district's
calcifications of the pulp stones there
will be decreasing the number of pulp
cells there will be degeneration and
loss of myelin sheet and and Milan nose
reduction in the number of blood vessels
and of course exception is collagen
fibril numbers increases as ace
increases coming to the physiological
changes the there will be reduction the
ability of a pump to react to the
irritants and repair means regenerative
capacity of the pulp decreases or the
formation of a rep rate or dentin or
Terry sherry tenth incapacity of the
pulp decreases as is increases so that's
the reason but generally the vital pulp
kaptara face of the pulp capping so the
pulp regeneration procedures we
generally go in and individuals we don't
prefer at the old individuals that the
reason is the physiological activity of
pulp decreases as is increases so
identify this this is the question that
is cusp of caribbean man there's nothing
okay first of all carabiner is a fifth
one in this modest crisp with the
pom-pom is option so maxillary for
smaller you have five five cusps whereas
only for pumpkins and the location of
cusp of caramel is again important it is
lingual to the mesial lingual cast for
the maxillary first molar and of course
it is seen in the sixty percent days of
individuals all these four or five
important points which are frequently
asked in your examinations and i have
seen a question related to the
triangular ridges and transverse ridges
the simple definition of triangular
reach is a reach that descends from the
tip of the cusps of the molars and
premolars towards the central part or
the central force of the occlusal
surface whereas transverse reach is a
combination or a union of two triangular
reaches which is present on the buccal
as well as the lingual surface so I have
seen many questions related to the
ginger alginate ginger but Janet is a
decent important language that is
present in the smile designing as well
as in the cosmetic periodontal surgeries
so ginger Janet is nothing but the
definition they are asked the definition
lumps in general general the most
ethical part in the ginger will count to
thesis is enjoy water the most epical
part of the ginger encounter is called
an unchangeable john this is the most
epic al part this is the most epic on
part this red one is the most epic on
part the most ethical part in the
gingival counter is called as machines
oval genesis a neat 2017 mcq i've seen a
sex determination forum sick ordered
ology dental astrology question in 2017
need which are the following gene that
is present
the truth helps in identifying the sex
of an individual in a mass disaster the
answer is and a mal mal is a major
matrix protein gene that is also stated
with the enamel so the peculiar feature
of this gene is it is located both on X
chromosome and Y chromosome and
represents itself in a different way so
does females you know that they have two
X chromosomes so they two are identical
because they're present on X chromosomes
but male they have two an identical or
non identical because they're present on
different chromosomes that is x and y so
this particular gene helps in
identifying the sex of an individual
after mass disaster you know that even
animal is a hard structure that helps in
identifying the sex of an individual so
we can go with the basic points yeah
that's all for today thank you signing
off dr. Srikant MDS conquer please guys
it is the time where you need to react
fast like an egg pulp
not a volt but because old bulb does not
react and now the better stimulus of
notification of need is out and I feel
like this is a good stimulus for your
pulp for you to react in a better way
and respond in a better way all the best
happy learning with MDS confer signing
