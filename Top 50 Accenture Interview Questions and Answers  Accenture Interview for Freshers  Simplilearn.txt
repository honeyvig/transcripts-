welcome back to another video by simply
learn in this video session we will be
discussing Accenture interview questions
these interview questions can assist you
in understanding the Accenture process
and procedure
so let's go ahead and understand
something about Accenture and then we
will discuss the Accenture core values
after that we will understand the
recruitment process following that we
will have a look at 50 plus Accenture
interview questions and at last we will
go through some Accenture interview tips
that will act as a valuable resource for
you in your interview preparation but
before we begin make sure to subscribe
to our YouTube channel and press the
Bell icon to never miss an update from
Simply learn now before moving forward
let me ask you a quick question so who
is the current CEO of Accenture a Julie
sweet B shantanu Narayanan C salil
parekh or D Jeff Clark
do leave your answers in the comment
section below now let's go ahead and
understand something about Accenture
so Accenture is a global Professional
Service firm that specializes in
Consulting technology and Outsourcing
the company was established in 1989 and
is based in Dublin Ireland

its Consulting and Technology Services
Accenture also has a strong presence in
the Outsourcing industry providing a
range of services including call center
operations human resources and finance
accounting Etc so this was about
Accenture now let's go ahead and
understand about Accenture core values
so there are various core values of
Extinction let's understand them first
is client value creation it allows
clients to become top performance and
establish long-term relationships by
being relevant and responsive while
consistently delivering value
next is one Global Network
leveraging Global Insight collaboration
and learning to provide exceptional
service to the clients is their business
venture next step we have is respect for
the individual
in Accenture they value unique
contributions Foster an open interest
with the environment and treat all in
the same manner that reflects the
company's values coming to the next core
value which is best people in Accenture
they attract and retain the best talent
bringing new challenges to enrich
employees knowledge while fostering a
supportive and collaborative environment
following this we have integrity
being honest and inspiring trust by
keeping the word and taking complete
responsibility for actions is another
core value of Accenture at last we have
stewardship so fulfilling the obligation
of strengthening the company for future
Generations meeting the commitment to
the stakeholders and helping communities
and the global environment improve
are some of the core values of Accenture
so these were some of the core values of
Accenture now let's go ahead and
understand its recruitment process
Accenture recruitment process
so eligible candidates can apply for
employment positions that match their
abilities experience and aspirations on
Accenture career portal they can also
apply through Linkedin or other
third-party employment boards
to be considered for an Accenture
interview all applicants must meet a
relevant graduate degree with a minimum
aggregate of 65 percent with no active
backlogs and not more than one year
education Gap then there is interview
process the Accenture interview process
comprises of three rounds online
assessment test technical interview and
HR interview the first round that is the
online assessment test
serves as an elimination round the timed
examinations aim to examine an
applicant's cognitive function and key
competencies through numeric aptitude
linguistic ability and logical thinking
problems now in the second round that is
the technical interview evaluates the
candidates coding and problem solving
abilities Accenture interview questions
access students understanding of data
structures algorithms and other computer
science Concepts such as operating
systems dbms and computer networks
experienced candidates may be required
to attend two or more technical
interview rounds then there is HR
interview round which is the final round
this round determines a candidates
personality and other relevant factors
the questions delve into candidates
qualifications experience strengths and
weaknesses and some other factors in
order to determine whether they are good
fit for the organization so this was all
about the Accenture recruitment process
now let's go ahead and have a look at 50
Accenture interview questions for
freshers and experienced
now the first question you want to list
is what is a static keyword in Java
static keyword in Java denotes that
specific member is not an instance but
rather a part of a type to access class
members in Java we must First Make an
instance of a class however there will
be times when we need to access class
members without generating any variables
in those cases we can use Java's static
keyword now moving on to the next
question on our list which is can you
implement multiple interfaces in a Java
class so an interface in Java is
comparable to a class
except that it can only contain abstract
methods
a blueprint for a class is what an
interface is in Java a class can only
extend one other class but Implement
numerous interfaces so yes a class can
Implement multiple interfaces next we
have explain the significance of the
super and this keyword in Java so the
keyword this and super are reserved
words that are used in different
contexts a super keyword is a reserved
keyword that is used to call the Base
Class function or variable in Java this
keyword is reserved keyword that is used
to refer to the current class object it
is a reference keyword that is used to
call the method all right now coming to
the next question which is what is
runtime polymorphism how it can be
achieved in Java so runtime polymorphism
is a procedure that resolves a call to
an overwritten method at runtime rather
than compile time
method overriding can be used to achieve
runtime polymorphism method overriding
indicates that the child class has the
same method as the parent class
it means that method overriding occurs
when a child class provides a particular
implementation of a method offered by
one of its parent class so this was
about runtime polymorphism now the fifth
question is what is the difference
between array and arraylist in Java so
the most well-known data structures in
Java are array and arraylist an array is
a core Java functionality where as the
arraylist is a Java collection framework
class
it is the part of java.util package
an array is a container that stores a
fixed number of values of the same type
it has a single memory location
we cannot adjust the size of an array
once it has been constructed whereas
arraylist is a collection framework
class in Java it implements the
interface like list Collections iterable
cloneable serializable and random access
coming to the sixth question
State important differences between C C
plus plus n Java so CEC plus plus and
Java are three programming languages
that have many similarities but there
are also some significant differences
between them here are some of the main
differences between these languages
first is syntax so the syntax of C and C
plus plus in Java are quite different
from each other
C and C plus plus have same syntax that
is more closely related to machine
language
while Java has a syntax that is more
similar to the English language the next
difference is object oriented
programming so C and C plus plus are
both procedural languages meaning that
they are focused on defining the steps
that a program should take to complete
the task Java on the other hand is an
object-oriented language which means
that it is focused on creating objects
that represent real world entities and
actions that can be performed on them
next is memory management
so C and C plus plus allows the
programmer to directly manipulate memory
which can be useful for certain types of
programs
but can also be error prone Java on the
other hand manages memory automatically
through a process called garbage
collection
this garbage collection helps to prevent
common memory related problems or errors
fourth difference is platform dependence
CNC plus plus programs need to be
compiled specifically for the platform
they are running on while Java programs
are compiled to an intermediate language
called bytecode which can be run on any
platform that has jvm that is Java
virtual machine the last is security
Java is generally considered to be more
secure than C or C plus plus because it
does not allow direct manipulation of
memory and has built-in security
features such as strict type checking
and automatic memory management all
right so this was about the important
differences between C C plus plus and
Java now moving on to the seventh
question
what is the significance of Lambda
expression in Java the Lambda expression
is a new and fundamental Java feature it
represents one method interface using an
expression in a straightforward and
concise manner it is extremely
beneficial in a library collection I
repeat it is extremely beneficial in a
library collection it helps in iterating
filtering and extracting data from a
collection next question on a list is
distinguish between where plus plus and
plus plus where
so the plus plus operator is also known
as the increment operator when the
operator plus plus where is applied
before a variable the variable is
incremented by one before being utilized
in the expression when the operator
where plus plus is added after the
variable that is the plus plus is added
after the variable the expression is
evaluated and the variable is
incremented by 1. so this is the mean
difference between where plus plus n
plus plus where
that is in plus plus where the value is
incremented by 1 before being utilized
in the expression and the opposite is in
the where plus plus all right now coming
to the next question that is the ninth
question
so what is the procedure of memory
allocation in C the dynamic memory
allocation Concept in C enables C
programmers to allocate memory during
runtime there are four functions of
stdlib.h library or header file that
allows dynamic memory allocation in C
language they are malloc function
Kellogg function re-alloc function and
free function moving on to the 10th
question now what is the use of get CH
function in a C plus plus program how is
it different from the get CH E function
so in a c plus program the get CH
function is used to read a single
character from the keyboard without
displaying it on the screen this
function is typically used to implement
password fields or other types of input
where you don't want the user's input to
be visible the get CH E function is
similar to get CH function only but it
equals the character that is entered to
the screen so it is visible to the user
both get CH and get Che are non-standard
function that are not part of C plus
plus language itself but they are often
included in C plus plus libraries such
as konio.h and N courses dot h next
question in our list is
explain the role of friend function in C
plus plus so friend function is a
function that is specified outside of a
class but has the access to the
protected and private data of the class
members friends are not member functions
but their prototypes occur solely in the
class function
it covers class template class function
template function and member functions
where the entire class is friends moving
on to the 12th question what do you
understand about normalization in a
database
so normalization is the process of
reorganizing data within a database so
that a user can query and analyze it
further
simply put it is the procedure for
producing clean data this includes
removing Superfluous and unstructured
data and making all entries and Fields
appear comparable coming to the next
question in a list
State import and differences between
primary and unique keys in SQL
so the basic distinction between a
primary and unique key is its intended
function
the primary Keys principle function is
to uniquely identify a row within a
table a primary key must be defined for
a table to be fully relational in case
of a unique key you can use the unique
key to add additional unique condition
to your columns the primary key ensures
entity Integrity I repeat the primary
key ensures entity Integrity whereas the
unique key ensures that the data is
unique so this is the main or we can say
important differences between primary
key and the unique keys in SQL now
moving on to the next question
what are pandas in Python pandas is an
open source python library that provides
high performance user-friendly data
structure and data analysis capabilities
for python python with pandas is
utilized in numerous sectors including
Academia retail banking economics
statistics analytics and many more
alright now coming to the question
number 15
what is the role of classifier in Python
so in Python a classifier is an
algorithm that is used to predict a
class or category to which a given data
point belongs classifiers are commonly
used in machine learning and data mining
applications to predict the class label
of a given point based on its features
next we have how is the dictionary
different from Tuple in Python
so Tuple is a non homogeneous data
structure that can include both a single
row and several rows and columns
a dictionary is a non-homogeneous data
structure with key value pairs the pulse
are immutable which means they cannot be
changed dictionaries can be changed and
keys cannot have duplicates so this was
about how a tuple and dictionary are
different from each other now moving on
to the next question
explain the map function in Python
so in Python a map function act as an
iterator returning a result after
applying a function to each item in a i
tribal Tuple list Etc it is used when a
simple I repeat it is used when a single
transformation function must be applied
to all I triple items now coming to the
18th question what is XML
XML stands for extensible markup
language
an XML file includes XML code and has
the file extension.xml
it contains tags that govern not only
how the document should be organized but
also how it should be saved and
transferred across the internet now
question number 19 explain virtual
inheritance so virtual inheritance in C
plus plus is a technique that ensures
that only one copy of parent class
members variables are inherited by
grandchild derived classes without
virtual inheritance if two classes X and
Y inherit from class Z and class W
inherit from both X and Y then W will
contain two copies of Z's member
variable and one via X and one via y
so this was about virtual inheritance
now the next question is what functions
would you use for dynamic memory
allocation in C so malloc and free are
the two dynamic memory allocation
methods in C the malloc function only
accepts one parameter the size of the
requested memory space the pointer
returned by malloc is used by free now
the next question is
what is the role of a pointer in C
so there are few roles of a pointer in C
language for example to pass arguments
by reference for getting array elements
for returning multiple values and
dynamic memory allocation so these were
some rules of a pointer in C language
now coming to question number 22.
I repeat
now coming to question number 22. why is
the Java language platform independent
Java is a framework language which means
that once the code is written it can be
run anywhere
on any platform that has I repeat Java
is a framework language which means that
once the code is written it can be run
anywhere on any platform that has the
necessary environment
it is a platform independent because it
uses virtual machine that is jvm that is
Java virtual machine coming to the
question number 23 what is an auto
keyword in C
so an auto is used for defining local
variables and it is used for forward
Declaration of nested functions so this
is a simple definition of auto
question number 24 on our list is what
do you understand about exception
handling
so exception handling is a mechanism to
handle or control the runtime error
which happens during program execution
it is done using try and catch block
followings are some types of exception
which may occur like class not found
exception i o exception SQL exception
remote exception Etc
question number 25 is distinguish
between a checked and unchecked
exceptions so check the exception are
the one which are checked at compile
time and are hence called compile time
exception unchecked are the one which
are checked at runtime and hence are
called runtime exception coming to the
next question why do exception occurs
an exception is an unwanted event that
occurs during the execution of a program
and disrupts the normal flow of the
program there are various reasons for
different exceptions for example
arithmetic exception occurs when there
is error related to the arithmetics
array index out of bound exception
occurs when there is an error related to
an index of an array now coming to
question number 27
what is an concept
so object oriented programming is a
model that gives different types of
Concepts such as inheritance abstraction
polymorphism Etc these Concepts aim to
implement a real world entities in the
programs next question in our list is
explain top features of oops so as we
discussed features of oops are object
class inheritance encapsulation
polymorphism and abstractions
we can also Define that it is pretty
easy so you can have a look at those
coming to question number 29 which is
explain the term encapsulation in Java
so encapsulation is one of the important
feature of object-oriented programming
encapsulation refers to wrapping of
variables and methods inside a single
class
it prevents external classes from
accessing and changing variables and
methods of a class
this also helps to achieve data hiding
now coming to the 30th question that is
what is a recursion
so recursion is the mechanism to make a
function calls itself
this approach to calling itself offers a
way to simplify difficult problems into
less challenging ones
so using the process or method of
recursion a function calls itself again
and again until a particular condition
is met or a particular condition is
satisfied so this is what equation is
along with these there are some more
questions that are also often asked in
the interview so let's take a quick look
at them
first is what is runtime polymorphism
second is State prominent differences
between method overloading and Method
overriding third is explain inheritance
and how it can be achieved in Java
fourth question is can you use multiple
inheritance in Java explain
fifth question is how would you access a
private member of a class
sixth question is explain the term
collection framework in Java seventh is
what do you understand about list
interface in collections
now coming to the eighth question which
is distinguish between character and
where care too
ninth question is what is the difference
between delete and truncate commands in
SQL 10th question is when would you use
a DML command in dbms 11th is what are
major perks of using dbms
12th question is how is hot backup
different from cold backup in database
13 is what do the own delete Cascade
options do
14th question is what is the
significance of abl trees
15th question is which is a programming
question for a given array of integer
write a program that returns true when
there is a triplet a b c satisfying the
condition A2 plus P2 equal to C2 you can
try this program
16th question is what do you understand
about operator overloading
17th question is explain the process of
memory deallocation in the C plus
18th question is how is a Constructor
different from Destructor
the 19th question is how would you
generate Fibonacci series in a C plus
plus program
then there is 20th question
so for a given array write a program to
print K largest elements the elements in
the array can be in any order if the
array is 1 23 17 9 32 to 50 and you're
required to the print the largest three
elements that is k equal to 3 then the
result will be 50 comma 32 and 23.
if we have to write a program regarding
this
so these are some of the questions that
are frequently asked during the
interview process
now let's have a look at some Accenture
interview preparation tips
so whether you're a fresh graduate or an
