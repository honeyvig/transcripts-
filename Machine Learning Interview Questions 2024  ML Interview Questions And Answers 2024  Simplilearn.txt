let's get started so let's start with
beginner level questions and number one
is what is machine learning so machine
learning is a subset of artificial
intelligence that involves the use of
algorithms and statistical models to
enable computers to perform task without
explicit instructions that is by relying
on patterns and interference and now
moving to number second question that is
what are the different types of machine
learning so the three main types of
machine learning are number one is
supervised learning and then comes
unsupervised learning and then there is
reinforcement learning now moving to
next question that is third that is what
is supervised learning
so supervised learning involves training
a model on a label data set which means
each training example is paired with an
output level the model learns to predict
the output from the input data now
moving to the fourth question that is
what is unsupervised learning so
unsupervised involveed training a model
on data that does not have labeled
responses the model tries to learn the
patterns and the structure from the
input data so Guys these are the
beginner level questions and now we'll
move to the fifth question that is what
is reinforcement learning so
reinforcement learning is a type of
machine learning where an agent learns
to make decisions by performing actions
and receiving Rewards or penalties the
goal is to maximize the cumulative
reward so now moving to the sixth
question that is what is a model in
machine learning so a model in machine
learning is a mathematical
representation of a real well process it
is trained on data to recognize patterns
and make predictions or decisions based
on new data so now moving to seventh
question that is what is overfitting so
overfitting occurs when a machine
learning model performs well on the
training data but poorly on new unseen
data it indicates that the model has
learned the noise and details in the
training data instead of the actual
patterns so now coming to question
number eight that is what is
underfitting so underfitting occurs when
a machine learning model is too simple
to capture the underlying patterns in
the data it performs poorly on both the
training data and new data now move to
the next question that is ninth question
and the question is what is a confusion
Matrix so confusion Matrix is a table
used to evaluate the performance of a
classification model it summarizes the
number of correct and incorrect
predictions made by the model and that
is categorized by each class now moving
to the 10th question that is what is
cross validation so cross validation is
a technique for assessing how the
results of a statistical analysis will
generalize to an independent data set it
involves partitioning the data into
subsets training the model on some
subsets and validating it on the
remaining subsets this was all about
that is the 10th question or the overall
1 to 10 questions for beginner level now
we'll move to intermediate level and
here we'll cover 10 questions so we'll
start with 11th question that is what is
a Roc curve so Roc that is receiver
operating charactertics curve it is a
graphical representation of a
classifier's performance across
different thresholds it plots the true
positive rate that is tpr against a
false positive rate that is fpr now
moving to 12th question that is what is
precision and recall so Precision is the
ratio of correctly predicted positive
observations to the total predicted
positives and recall is the ratio of
correctly predicted positive
observations to all actual positives so
the formula is precision equal to
tp/ TP + FP and the recall is tp/ tp+ FN
so now we'll move to the 13th question
that is what is the fub1 score so the
fub1 score is the harmonic mean of
precision and recall it provides a
balance between the two metrics and is
useful when you need to balance
precision and recall fub1 score is equal
to twice into Precision into recall
and that is divided by Precision plus
recoil now we'll move to 14th question
and here we will cover
regularization so the question is what
is regularization so it is a technique
used to prevent overfitting by adding a
penalty to the models complexity and the
common types of regularization include
L1 that is lasso and L2 Ridge
regularization now we'll move to the
15th question that is what is the bias
variance tradeoff so the bias variance
trade-off is a fundamental issue in
machine learning that involves balancing
the error introduced by the model's
assumptions and the error due to model
complexity so a good model should have
low bias and low variance now we'll move
to the question number 16 that is what
is feature engineering so feature
engineering is the process of creating
new features or modifying existing ones
to improve the performance of a machine
learning model it involves techniques
like normalization and coding
categorical variables and creating
interaction terms so now we'll move to
question number 17 and that is about
gradient descent so the question is what
is gradient descent and your answer is
gradient descent is an optimization
algorithm used to minimize the cost
function in machine learning models and
it iteratively adjusts the model
parameters in the direction of the
steepest Descent of the cost function so
with this we'll move to the 18th
question and that will cover with the
difference between bagging and boosting
so the question is what is difference
between bagging and boosting and you
could answer this with starting with
bagging that is bootstrap aggregating
that involves training multiple models
on different subsets of the data and
averaging their predictions then comes
boosting that involves training models
sequentially with each new model
focusing on correcting the errors of the
previous mons and then we have the
question number 19 that is what is a
decision tree so a decision tree is a
known parametric supervised learning
algorithm used for classification and
regression it splits the data into
subsets based on the value of input
features resulting in a tree like
structure of decisions Now we move to
question number 20 that is what is a
random Forest So Random Forest is an
ensemble learning method that combines
multiple decision trees to improve the
accuracy and robustness of the model it
builds each tree using a random subset
of features
and data points and then averages their
predictions so these were the questions
that are for the intermediate level and
these are just the basic questions or I
will just say the theoretical questions
that can be asked in an interview so be
prepared for that now we move to the
advanced level interview questions and
we'll start with question number 21 and
here also we'll cover the 10 questions
so number one question or that is 21th
question and the question is what is a
support Vector machine so support Vector
machine is a supervised learning
algorithm used for classification and
regression it finds the optimal hyper
plane that maximizes the margin between
different classes in the feature space
and then comes question number 22 that
is what is principal component analysis
so principal component analysis is a
dimensionality reduction technique that
transforms High dimensional data into a
lower dimensional Space by finding the
directions that is principal components
that maximize the we variance in the
data and then comes the question number
23 that is what is a neural network so a
neural network is a series of algorithms
that attempt to recognize underlying
relationships in a set of data through a
process that mimics the way the human
brain operates it consist of layer of
interconnected nodes or neurons and then
comes the question number 24 that is
what is deep learning so deep learning
is a subset of machine learning that
involves neural networks with many
layers that is deep neural network and
it is particularly effective for task
like image and speech recognition now
I'll move to question number 25 that is
what is convolutional neural network
that is CNN so we will start the answer
by answering the intervie that a
convolutional neural network is a type
of deep learning model specifically
designed for processing structured grid
data like images it uses convolutional
layers to extract special features or
the spal features and patterns from the
input data now we'll move to the
question number 26 that is what is a
recurrent neural network or RNN so a
recurrent neural network is a type of
neural network designed for sequential
data and it has connections that form
directed Cycles allowing it to maintain
a memory of previous inputs and process
sequences of data so this was all about
question number 26 and now we will cover
the question number 27 that is what is
the difference between badge gradient
descent and stochastic gradient descent
so batch gradient descent computes the
gradient of the cost function using the
entire training data set while
stochastic gradient descent that is SGD
computes the gradient using only one
training example at a time so SGD is
faster but noisier now we'll move to
question number 28 that is what is
Dropout in neural networks so Dropout is
a regularization technique used in
neural networks to prevent overfitting
and it involves random ly setting a
fraction of the neur Rons to zero during
training forcing the network to learn
more robust features and now we'll move
to question number 29 and that will be
about transfer learning and your
question is what is transfer learning so
we'll answer this to the interviewer by
starting that transfer learning is a
technique in machine learning where a
model developed for one task is reused
as the starting point for a model on a
second related task it is particularly
useful when there is limit data
available for the second task now we'll
move to the last question and the 30th
question so that is what is a generative
aders Network that is g so you can start
answering this so generative adversor
network is a type of deep learning model
consisting of two neural networks a
generator and a discriminator that are
trained simultaneously the generator
creates fake data while the
discriminator tries to distinguish
between real and fake data leading to
the generator producing increasingly
realistic data and these questions and
answers are over and these covers a wide
range of topics in machine learning and
should help prepare for interviews at
various levels so with this guys we have
