yeah hi winners hope you're doing great
so i'm just going to give
the major checklist
for all the students who are preparing
for the entrance exam related to the
module 4. okay so our module 4 includes
the major scoring subjects
from examination point of view that is
particularly to the neet okay so most of
your major scoring exams will be in the
module four okay the scorings
will be
somewhere around like oral path oral
medicine
plus forensic coordinology will carry 14
plus
seven okay so oral pathology is 14 and
medicine is going to carry 7 plus score
so it's going to be 2122
and coming to the general medicine is 14
i mean 14 to 15 plus general path 7 and
physio 7
and followed by general pharmacology 7
plus dental pharmacology 7.
kovid 19 assuming it is creating the
trend setting okay trend setting and the
hot topic
in the world so assuming that they are
going to give a decent number of
questions on kovid 19 at least like
three to four
or more than that okay so unpredictable
that is because last year need we
doesn't have uh covet 19 related stuff
but this year definitely you will have
questions on covid19 and microbiology is
going to be somewhere around seven to
ten why my main concept is seven to ten
is
according to the neet blueprint it is
not oral pathology it is oral pathology
plus oral microbiology so again
microbiology questions can come in oral
pathology also infection related stuff
so that is the reason why i dropped 7 to
10 marks for micro
so i mean like you have 23 days for your
neet exam
and you have 29 days for your imi cd so
this is a combined plan
so right so you have 23 days for neet
okay and uh 29 days for ironic
so one main request from my side okay so
this is going to enhance your
preparation is i want you to spend as
much time as possible for the
preparation i don't know how how how far
you are up to okay so previously you may
be like interns they have started
initially with six hours then drifted to
eight after completing internship now
they are hitting 10 to 12 hours but my
kind suggestion for all of you is spend
as much time as possible i don't want to
mention a particular figure but if you
are hitting 12
and staying at home or staying in
the institute or staying in the library
or staying in the study rooms and you
are reading make sure you try to hit as
much as you can apart from six hours of
sleeping time and two to three hours of
miscellaneous okay uh miscellaneous and
a
multiple breaks of one to two hours
please try to spend the quality of time
as much time as possible till you reach
that exam so if there are any chances by
which you can improve the
time
that you spend with the book during this
particular 23 29 days if there is any
chance please please guys okay spend
that quality of time because this is
going to fetch you something great and
extraordinary okay so this is 23 29 days
are very very important crucial days
that's going to modify all your
preparation of course coming to module 4
module 4 is going to be a game changer
so i am going to tell what are the
mandatory things that you have to do
being a student of mds conquer
regarding the model
model 4 okay most of you are scared
about subjects like general medicine
subjects like pharmacology subjects like
physiology i hope like general path
micro oral medicine oral path and
forensic coordinator you can handle but
i feel like most of you because after
talking to you or dealing many students
from the past seven to eight years what
i feel like students has lots of phobia
towards pharmacology lots of decent
phobia towards physio medicine
and uh yeah these are the main things
that we are phobic and main reason why
most of us have that phobia towards the
general medicine is we don't read it
properly or people they don't teach us
properly so that is the main concept
okay so keeping these three things in
the mind so i just want to go with the
checklist of each and every one so i'm
going to start with oral
i'm going to start with oral pathology
okay
uh oral pathology plus oral medicine so
first of all we'll try to go with oral
path and oral medicine so coming to this
oral pattern oral medicine the mandatory
things that you have to do are the most
commons okay it's not questions on most
commons okay so whenever the paper
sitter is planning to give a case based
question or an associated question he is
going to pick the most common in the
list for example is planning to give a
question on skin diseases
his focus will be most on lichen planus
followed by fem figures
followed by sle okay you have most
common skin diseases familiar skin
diseases so his
primary pick means 90 percentage of the
cases he is going to pick a question
more than 90 95 percentage of the cases
he's going to pick a question on the
most common similarly if he is planning
to give a question on insist his first
choice is going to be okc
dentist racist
radicular cyst
and jumping into the nasopalatine cyst
gbc
or i mean these are the areas where he
loved to ask questions for example he's
go planning to go for tumors odentogenic
tumors definitely his choice is going to
be amyloblastoma or odentoma
or ce voting
or aot so this is what the mindset of
any any pap etcetera and make sure like
as we are assuming that there will be a
lengthy question paper with most of the
case based questions related to the
clinical subjects so it's better you
approach and be perfect with as much
content as possible related to
a particular most common questions okay
so this is a common sense that you need
to apply when you're reading oral path
oral medicine or when you're reading the
general medicine also okay what is what
what are my concerns sir where you can
get all these comments the smart videos
of all the subjects
okay that are available on the website
are clearly reflecting the most commons
and similarly the quick revision videos
and the live pro classes the the live
classes whatever the mentors they are
taking nowadays okay related to the
subject or the quick revision videos are
mostly focusing defining all the most
common areas so the checklist what you
have to do is apart from the dental
pulse synopsis of these subjects dental
pulse
synopsis because most of the dental
pulse synopsis of oral path and oral
medicine are tables
and single liners
now now the question paper is not
drifting towards the single liners but
these single liners are going to be the
clues in identifying your lengthy case
based question so these single liners
they act as clues
and these clues will
answer the case-based questions
is it clear
it's right so this is the one that's you
have to make it as mandatory second one
is all your quick revision videos
quick revision videos
okay the next one is whatever the
classes
classes
the ma'am is taking or what are the
classes that are going through online
whatever the content that is being
shared on your telegram last minute
revision group
telegram group or whatsapp group
okay or your pro live sessions so all
these areas are mandatory that you have
to finish it and make sure you try to
finish the pp books content of
these three oral path oral medicine and
radiology combination so these are the
main important aspects and wherever you
are not clear okay try to see the
diagrams
like you have physics this is cotton
wool appearance is same are you clear
how a cotton wool appearance will appear
like
okay at no
molar microscope smaller shaped colonies
are you familiar or not if you are not
familiar go back and see the diagrams
because
neet 2021 has shown more than 40
diagrams out of 240 means one-sixth of
your question paper moves around the
diagrams around the contents of diagrams
so it is mandatory that you have to see
as many diagrams as possible related to
this particular subject so this is all
about the oral path and oral medicine so
jumping into the next subject that is
general
medicine general medicine what is my
concern is try to finish your smart
videos
and try to finish the quick revision
videos available and try to solve as
many questions it's very difficult for
you to open high standard books of
general medicine and to revise in these
last few days so it is mandatory that
you have to go through the quick
revision
videos followed by the smart
videos content what you have prepared
previously like for example if i am
talking about cvs cardiovascular system
i am more concerned about hypertension i
am more concerned about
like congenital heart diseases i am more
concerned about traumatic heart failure
i am more concerned about
endocarditis okay so these are the
choice like left heart failure right
heart failure differences so these are
the areas where the papa sitter will
first pick the questions okay right so
please try to finish all the contents
like do more mcqs one side finish all
the contents that is your smart videos
notes quick revision notes and whatever
the classes the mentors are going to
plan in this particular model along with
the try to solve as many questions as
possible and of course the golden
principle is try to be clear with the
concepts which are given from at least
like 2014-15
until 2021 so 2014
15 to
2021 all the questions given in this
particular
subject or a particular topic you should
be clear the recent questions either you
can take these recent questions from the
website or either you can pick these
questions from the dental pulse and make
sure you try to be clear with the
concepts and everything related to these
particular topics because papa setters
will always focus on the common areas
questions may or may not be repeated
same questions but same concepts will be
repeated so you should be very clean and
clear about this general
medicine come to general pathology so
general pathology if you jump into the
general pathology necrosis
apoptosis
uh you have the calcifications different
types of calcifications different types
of necrosis and make sure you try to be
clear with the
with the diagrams of the histological
diagrams of the necrosis okay try to be
clear with the histological diagrams of
lung like how squamous cell carcinoma
look like okay so basic kovid 19 how the
histology will look like covet 19 how
the radiographs will look like so all
these contents were properly covered so
please go back and check all these areas
because there are high chances that
they're going to ask questions on this
and similarly liver hepatitis how it
looks like okay liver cirrhosis how the
gross gross diagram of the liver
that is taken out from the patient okay
who has who has a death due to liver
cirrhosis okay spleen
liver kidney
okay so heart lungs and all these
histology basic most common historic
histological picks as well as the
counterpart of it that is counterparty
means the gross specimen part i hope you
remember your general pathology
department used to have the pathology
specimens which are stored in the
formula in a glass bottles so such
diagrams they are going to ask and these
diagrams you can extract from the
robinson textbook which is the most
standard textbook of general pathology
right so papa certainly allowed to ask
questions on these areas so try to be
clear apart from that okay make sure you
try to be clear with the genetics
genetics is nothing but first important
area of the genetics is of course the
syndromes
and second one is the mode of
inheritance
and i hope most of you are familiar with
the mode of inheritance examples and
everything which are given in the power
playbook volume three first three pages
apart from this there is something
called as diagram based about the mode
of inheritance okay these are called as
pedigree diagrams so they can ask you
pedigree diagrams they can ask you
karyotype based diagrams okay so be
familiar karyotype based diagrams are
pedigree pedigree chart mode of
inheritance based diagrams basing upon
which you have to conclude whether it is
an autosomal dominant or a resistor or
x-linked dominant or x-linked resistor
basing upon that
you have to identify the example or you
have to calculate the mode of
inheritance from one generation to the
next generation so all these areas are
very conceptual things and they are very
very important and similarly general
medicine there is one more conceptual
aspect that you have to make you know
that is your
metabolic alkalosis metabolic acidosis
and respiratory alkalosis and
respiratory doses so these areas were
properly covered in the videos okay you
have meningitis different types of
meningitis conceptual videos so all
these you have to be perfect because
these are the most common areas that the
paper setter nowadays are picking the
questions and throwing out your face in
the examination right so jumping into
the next subject i want to stress on is
microbiology so divide the microbiology
because a part of micro biology will be
deal in general pathology so so first
one is microbiology i want to talk about
immunology okay in which you're going to
talk about the different types of immune
cells and different types of
hypersensitivities your type 1 type 2
type 3 type 4 type 5 hypersensitives
different types of immune mechanisms
that is immune mechanisms are nothing
but natural immunity artificial immunity
all these examples vaccinations are very
very important nowadays the world is
moving around vaccination covered
vaccinations are most important apart
from the covet vaccination normal
vaccinations are important examples of
vaccinations when to be given where to
be given what live vaccinations skilled
vaccinations all about vaccinations has
to be done immunoglobulins all the
immunoglobulins all the all the
differences between different types of
immunoglobulins you have a video okay i
hope you have prepared the notes
immunoglobulins has to be these are
going to come under immune system then
jumping into the immune system then you
have to go for the bacterial bacterial
growth curves and basics of all the
bacterial culture mediums of bacteria
apart from that
in the smart videos we tried our best to
cover 10 important bacteria where most
of your questions will move viruses you
have somewhere eight to ten viruses uh
herpes simplex varicella's oyster
epstein-barr virus hepatitis is very
very important hiv is important now
covid19 has been added to the list so
next come to the fungus after fungus uh
the most important for us is candias is
myocar mycos is now the trend changing
definitely you'll have a question of
much of my causes histoplasmosis and all
these are the basic fungus that you have
to learn and of course these two are
very very important coming to the
parasitology is not much important but
we need to learn about malaria top to
bottom
okay apart from malaria entamoeba
entamoeba histolytica
uh
occalaria branch crafty tinia sodium
okay
so and colorstone
okay so these are the important
parasites that you have to learn the i
mean apart from the basic recent
questions which are given in the
examinations you have to be clear with
all these microbiology related stuff
mandatory must read stuff
so jumping into the micro we are done
general path general medicine oral path
oral medicine of course kovid 19
ma'am has tried her best to cover
many many things related to the kovid
90s so i want you to be very clear with
the kovid 19 basic stuff okay which were
covered in the classes and which were
covered in the videos which are
available in the kobit 19 folder
community related sub general path
related stuff uh radiographic features
pharmacology related stuff
pathophysiology
uh precautions to be taken disinfection
to be done dental point of view
everything were covered in the videos so
go back check those videos because
they're high chances these are going to
be the bounces because these are not
properly covered in any sort of mcq book
available in the country so the thing is
whatever that is being discussed
whatever that is being done will be new
to every students and these are the
scoring areas where you can dominate
your competitors in the list
so jumping into the next part that is
your pharmacology so i already discussed
pharmacology so let's make pharmacology
pharmacology is something like you have
to
divide and rule so two parts of
pharmacology area one is general
pharmacology second one is dental
pharmacology so dental pharmacology is a
bit easy
what are included in dental pharmacology
local anesthesia
so you have three to four questions on
local anesthesia in the recent 2021
question paper
right next one is jumping into the
second one general anesthesia so general
anesthesia you have five to six gases
where you have to learn 10 to 15 points
about each and every gas the color
coding the pin index values the blood
coefficient values what where are the
choice okay for example there's a
specific case of kid under this
neurosurgery what is the general
anesthesia of choice you have to pick so
all these are very i mean drug of choice
general anesthesia of choice for a
particular case with this particular
disease or abnormality is is a regularly
error frequent aspect similarly stages
of general anesthesia all these four
stages four subtypes where what is
happening each and every stress all
these areas are very very important for
an examination point of view so then
comes the antibiotics so chemotherapy
let's call it as chemotherapy out of
chemotherapy antibiotics are very
important your pencil and cephalosporins
tetracyclines macrolids
uh
antiviral antiretroviral
antifungal
so all these are very very important
anti-malaria drugs anti-tb drugs
anti-treatment drugs is one of the most
common area where the papaceters are
giving questions so chemotherapy
antibiotics are more important when
compared to the regular common
chemotherapy so your focus should be
more on these uh areas okay so apart
from the drug interaction so we have
drug interactions there are few drug
interactions that you have to dental
drug interactions dental drug
interactions are very important 2018 we
have four questions on dental drug
reactions 2019 we have two questions
2020 we have decent number of questions
one or two on these areas so it's very
important you should be very very
familiar with the drug interactions and
followed by you should be familiar with
all the emergency drugs
all the emergency drugs for example if i
am talking about git i am more concerned
about what are the drugs that are used
for gastric ulcer peptic ulcer what are
the drugs that are used for peptic ulcer
part and pump inhibitors h2 blockers
antacids so these are the basic things
that you should be familiar again when
you are jumping into the
renal system i'll be more about i'm more
concerned about the diuretics
more concerned about the diabetics when
i'm jumping into the endocrinology i'm
more concerned about the diabetic drugs
i'm more concerned about the thyroid
drugs i'm more concerned about the
thyroid replacements okay so these are
the areas where the questions were
frequently being given so emergency part
also you should be familiar so coming to
general pharmacology
that's what i'm telling general
pharmacology try to stick on to the most
common areas
of general medicine with their
pharmacology treatment for example
that's what i'm talking my main concern
when i'm talking about
git is
definitely peptic ulcer
hepatology definitely it is hepatitis so
try to be familiar with what are the
drugs and drugs of choices what are that
are given for the peptic ulcer and
followed by what are the drugs that are
given for your hepatitis and all these
things so similarly in every system you
try to be confident or perfect with
these areas which are more than
sufficient to crack more scorings in the
examination i hope the the things are
clear apart from that you have to be
very very clear and keen with your
general uh pharmacology so that is
completely conceptual things okay what
is zero kinetics what is first order
kinetics what is difference between
these two and what are the drugs which
follow these zero order kinetics okay
and followed by you how many things are
like uh you have uh like you have
inhibition different types of
inhibitions competitive inhibitor
non-competitive inhibitor what are the
drugs what are the examples which comes
under competence what are the drugs
which comes under non-competitive
inhibitors apart from this what are
these
rare drugs what are these orphan drugs
examples of orphan drugs
so apart from this there are many many
many other things of
general pharmacology that you have to do
in the chapter particularly about the
studies faces trials phase one phase two
phase three phase four and there are
lots of things that you have to
conceptually read in general
pharmacology okay so i hope you are
clear with because these are properly
covered everything in the smart videos
as well as the quick revision videos
right so
so this is all about
the plan of action for module four try
to increase as much time as possible
and try to follow the
suggestions which are given on the group
respectively
time being and try to follow them okay
coming to the physiology physiology i
want you to stick on to the dental pulse
synopsis because all the basics of
physiology were properly covered okay
for example if i am talking about
endocrinology
all the hormones what are the
abnormalities associated with the
hormones what happens if it is increased
what happens if it is decreased if i am
talking about lungs what are primary
respiratory centers secondary
respiratory centers what are these lung
volumes lung capacitance everything were
properly covered everything were well
organized so please try to finish the uh
gentle i mean like physiology synopsis
okay and try to finish the general
pathology synopsis
and try to cover your power play books
tables okay most of the tables of power
play books were taken from harrison
davidson
and robinson okay so have we tried our
best to include as many tables as
possible where the questions are most
frequently repeated related to general
path
general medicine and pharmacology with
physiology so please try to spend a good
quality of time and simultaneously solve
as many questions as possible and try to
attend the videos try to attend the
classes even if you miss the class by
mistake because of this ramzan season or
xyz factors because of things in the
family make sure you try to
see the recorded version because most of
your questions will move around the
contents what the mentors are teaching
you in this limited times taking their
time out okay so that's all from my side
related to the module four hope you're
doing good and great i'm open to
like call you back okay please if you
really need my help or my suggestions or
my support
from any aspect the team is open you can
just drop me a message like whenever i'm
free i'm going to call you back and i'm
going to talk you okay so let's do this
let's work for this 23 29 days and
i want everyone to be successful and i
want everyone to get the desirable rank
what you are working from okay so and
this this batch is very special to me
because
i have seen so many things associated
with the batch code
your exams being postponed you're giving
irritated you're being called to the
college you're back to homes again
called to the callers many things happen
and this is the batch in my eight years
of experience who has spent the longest
bond and the longest duration of time we
almost have
a bonding of more than like the people
who have started on the day one of this
batch were almost like 16 months okay 16
17 18 months it's a very very huge huge
huge bond and the bond should have a
