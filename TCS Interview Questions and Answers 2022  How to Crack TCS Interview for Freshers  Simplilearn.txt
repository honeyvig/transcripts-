questions

in java
java application operations on multiple
jres can communicate with one another
using socket programming
either connection oriented or
connectionless can apply
generally speaking a socket is a method
of connecting a client to the server you
can only communicate updated information
between devices
now let's move on to the next question
mention the four basic principles of
oops
there are four basic principles in
object oriented programming
the first one is inheritance basing an
object or class upon another class or
object
abstraction selecting data from a pool
to show only the relevant detail to the
object
encapsulation
wrapping data in a single unit
and polyformism allowing using class
exactly like its parent to avoid
confusion
the next one is
list the differences and similarities
between c and c plus plus
first
c is a programming language that is
procedural
and on the other hand c plus plus
supports both functional and object
oriented programming
c is regarded as a subset of c plus plus
and c plus plus is true to be a subset
of c
c works from the top to down and c plus
plus is built using the bottom up
approach
inheritance polyformism and data
encapsulation are not supported in c and
on the other hand inheritance
polyformism data capsulation and
abstraction are all supported in c plus
plus
let's move on to the next question
what is inheritance
in inheritance one class can gain a
property from another class through
inheritance
for instance a child acquires the
characteristics of his or her parents
we may reuse the field and methods for
the executing class thanks to
inheritance as a result inheritance
increases reusabilities and a key oops
concept
the next question we will discuss is
explain the functionalities of the
linked list
the link element name first is present
in the linked list
a data field or fields and the link
field name next are carried from each
link
each link is connected to the one after
it using the one after it
to indicate the end of the list the last
link carries a link that is null
now
let's move on to the next question
what are loops
loose by name itself means it's doing a
task again and again
a for loop repeats itself a certain
amount of time
and a while loop repeats continuously
while an expression
is true a statement with a value is
known as an expression
an expression is repeated in a do while
or repeat till loop until it is fall
now
let's move on to the next question
which is what is cloud computing
a cloud computing is a delivery of
computing services including servers
storage devices
databases networking software analytics
and intelligence over the internet
to offer faster innovation
flexibility resources and economics of
scale
you typically pay only for cloud
services you use
helping lower your operating cost run
your infrastructure more efficiently and
scale as the business needs change
now let's move on to the next question
what are aggregate functions in sql
aggregate function relies on a set of
values to return a single value
following are the sums sql aggregate
functions
the first one is average
average function gives the average of a
set
the next one is minimum
min give function gives the minimum
value of the set
the third one is the count function
it returns the number of items in a set
the fourth one is max function it
returns the maximum value
and the last one is the sum function
which returns the sum of the distinct or
all values in a set

let's move on to the next question
what is a database management system
database management system is a software
for managing the entire organization's
data
including its proper storage and
presentation whenever required for
business decisions
here are few examples of databases
there are mysql oracle filemaker and
microsoft access
now let's move on to the next question
which is
differentiate between rdbms and dbms
rdbms stands for relational database
management system and dbms stands for
the database management system
in database the data is stored as a file
and in rdbms data is stored in a form of
tables
