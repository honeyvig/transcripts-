now without further ado let's get
started with our one point agenda that
is pivot charts in excel
so how to create a pivot chart you ask
it is really simple all you need to do
is just follow few steps and you have
your pivot chart ready which is
completely interactive now all you have
to do is select any cell in the data set
you have and rush into the insert
toolbar then in the group of charts you
have an option called pivot chart select
on it now you'll be asked to select the
data range and you can see
excel has automatically select all the
range that you want to include in your
pivot chart then you have another option
which is asking you to either create the
pivot chart in the current worksheet or
a new worksheet for now let's select a
new worksheet
and there you go
voila the pivot chart is completely
ready you might ask me this is
completely empty yes
the default pivot chart what you get
from excel will be completely empty but
you can add the legends and all the data
that you want to add on your pivot chart
just by dragging and dropping the data
from the right hand side of your excel
sheet that is from the pivot chart
fields so you can see we have various
options region category state sub
category sales quantity etc
now
i'll add region
i'll add region to access
and
comparatively we will see
the sales that are happening in those
particular regions by dragging sales
into values
now you have all the data in the form of
pivot chart which is completely
interactive which represents the sales
happening in those regions now you can
also select a particular region right by
default all the regions are selected but
if you want to select only central then
you can do that by deselecting
everything and select only central and
select ok and there you go you have all
the data
related to the sales happening in the
central region now
if you want to you know kind of see all
the
categories of sales happening in all the
regions you can drag the category into
values again and
in the region part
okay i think we have to add category
into legends yes now select a region
slide that is all regions
and select ok and you can see
the category wise sales in all the
regions at one single go and i hope you
did not observe it clearly uh
the excel also gives you the completely
prepared pivot table as well right which
is also interactive you can also get to
choose the data from here as well and
select ok and you'll see that being
reflected on the pivot chart
so here you can see both pivot table and
pivot charts are completely interactive
now that's how you create pivot charts
and pivot tables in excel if you have
