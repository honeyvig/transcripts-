sudoka like now we'll talk about
something
and a brief about the docker so Docker
is a popular containerization technology
that allows developers to package
applications and their dependencies into
lightweight portable containers
now we'll see the project benefits or
their objectives
so the first objective is consistency
with standardized base images all
applications run on a uniform
environment reducing compatibility
issues and unexpected Behavior across
different deployment stages the next is
Time Savings developers no longer need
to configure the environment from sketch
for each application using the
pre-configured base images saves the

intermediate level doves project ideas
so starting with creating a CI CD
pipeline using Azure devops so in this
project we'll explore the world of
continuous integration and continuous
deployment cicd and how it can
streamline your software development and
deployment processes so first we'll
understand CI CD so to begin let's have
a brief overview of CI so continuous
integration is a practice where code
changes are automatically built and
tested whenever they are pushed to
Version Control repository such as git
this ensures that the code is
continuously integrated and validated
caching potential issues early in the
development cycle and on the other hand
continuous development CD is the process
of automatically deploying the code to
production environments after passing
through the CI phase CD eliminates
manual interventions and ensure fast and
reliable software releases and this is
what we know about CI and CD Now we will
have an introduction to Azure devops so
Azure devops is a powerful cloud-based
platform that provides a set of tools
and services for software development
including Version Control build
Automation and release management Azure
devops offers a seamless and integrated
environment for implementing CI CD
Pipelines and the project goals are that
is to set up a CI CD pipeline using
Azure devops for a sample application we
will demonstrate the end-to-end process
of automatically building testing and
deploying the application to various
environments including staging and
production
now we'll talk about the project goals
or the project objectives so the first
is automate the build process that is
set up an automated build process to
compile the source code and create
Deployable artifacts this ensures that
developers code changes this ensures
that developers code changes are
consistently built and tested the next
is automate testing Implement automated
testing to validate the application's
functionality and ensure the new changes
do not introduce regressions or bugs and
the next is continuous deployment
establish a seamless deployment process
that automates the release of
applications to different environments
example staging and production as soon
as they pass the required test and the
next we have is Version Control
integration integrate Version Control
System example kit with the CI CD
pipeline to manage source code changes
effectively and the next we have is
monitoring and feedback enable
monitoring and logging mechanisms to
provide feedback on the application's
performance and health during and after
deployment so for the conclusion of this
project you can create a CI CD pipeline
using Azure devops that's an excellent

Technologies kubernetes and offer to
create a highly scalable and efficient
application deployment system let's dive
in and take a closer look the main goal
of this project is to containerize your
application using Docker making it
portable and easy to manage then we will
utilize kubernetes a powerful container
or castration tool to manage and scale
your application effortlessly so first
we'll understand Docker that is before
we get started with kubernetes let's
understand the importance of dog doka is
a containerization platform that allows
you to package your application and its
dependencies into a single unit known as
a container these containers are
lightweight portable and can run
consistently across different
environments now we'll see what is
containerizing your application now

available you can easily scale your
application up or down based on the
demand making it ideal for handling
varying workloads now we'll see the
managing application updates one of the
most significant advantage of kubernetes
is its ability to manage application
updates seamlessly with kubernetes you
can roll out updates without any
downtime ensuring smooth transition for
your users kubernets also enhances the
high availability and full tolerance of
your application by replicating your
application's containers across multiple
nodes kubernetes ensures that your
application stays accessible even if
some nodes fail and another powerful
feature of kubernetes is the horizontal
Port autoscaler HP the HPA automatically
adjusts the number of replicas based on
the application CPU usage or other
custom metrics this Dynamic scaling
keeps your application responsive under
varying workloads and the next is
monitoring and login monitoring and
logging are crucial in a production
environment kubernetes integrates with
various monitoring and logging Solutions
like promoters and Elk stack enabling
you to keep track of your application's
performance and troubleshoot any issues
effectively and now we'll see some of
the benefits of this project that is
