okay so yeah hi uh very very good
evening one and all okay so this is Dr
San from Team MDS conquer and uh yeah
we'll be starting this session uh in a
couple of minutes and this will be
extended over 45 minutes to 1 hour and
I'll try my best to cover the most
important aspects uh that an intern or a
post BDS student requires before their
at their preparation or uh before they
plan their uh future industry okay right
so I'll try to simplify as uh simple as
possible I thought of addressing it in
uh Telugu in the initial phase of this
session but we have students from
Maharashtra MP and a few students are
there from Karnataka also so I'll try to
communicate in the most easiest English
language uh if you have any further
doubts or uh queries uh you can
personally call me and we can have a
talk
uh then we can have a talk in our
regional language Telugu okay and
probably uh if time permits uh probably
after March 18th your seniors are going
to give their exam on March 18th so once
your seniors are done with their
examination uh I'll try my best uh to
reach most of your colleges not all I'm
not giving a fake commitment here so I
may not reach all the colleges but I'll
try my best to reach as many colleges as
possible uh from which students are
there mp uh indoor I cannot okay but the
leftover colleges I'll try to come and
address like including the shapur uh
including sharavati and everything okay
in personal like I I I want to spend one
more day of time with you individually
in your college so that we can discuss
more about the future because the future
is more important okay so Dentistry
future is going to be in your hands okay
so that is more important so for that I
want to come and I want to spend some
one one day of quality of of time uh in
your college campus so that we can
discuss plan accordingly okay clear so
now uh my session will be focused more
on yes of course neat and in C uh the
platforms where you can do MDS in India
apart from that I'll be discussing about
uh uh your DDS
program and your o and LDS that is more
inclined to your uh uh UK as well as
I'll be discussing about the
exam pattern and everything for Canada
and I'll be discussing about ADC that is
aalan Dental Council apart from I'll be
discussing about Indian ADC Indian ADC
is nothing but Army Dental cops okay
there is one Army job available for the
dentist I'll be talking about that also
these are the main highlights what I'm
going to discuss today okay the main
mode of conducting this uh just a second
yeah the main mod of conducting this
session is so as the day progress
particularly in the last last phase of
internship okay I see like now most of
your seniors are in the last phase of
internship Let It Be Telangana Andra or
any seniors because most of your seniors
are preparing for the entrance
examination or planning for their future
and I see most of the students coming to
the offline centers of Hyderabad and I'm
interacting with them I want I want you
guys to be in the mute here please try
to be in the
mute so I'm interacting with most of
your seniors uh in the offline center
after reaching the Hyderabad maybe
online uh most of students they they
don't like to interact because you have
this phobia right most of the students
have this uh inferior complexity okay
that uh they never love to talk with the
mentors or they never like to talk with
or interact with the teachers
okay just a
second yeah right so keeping this in
mind uh the main motto is interaction
phase is very much required okay so till
this point in BDS level you cleared
first year second year third year and
final year here you don't require a
great interaction with the mentors or
teachers because your seniors are there
to help you but when you're planning to
take your life in next in the Dentistry
here you require more interaction with
okay so you need to interact well with
the teachers uh get to know what is good
get to know what is bad okay then
accordingly you should plan your
Dentistry so that is the main motto is
to interact with you okay a proper
interface should be there to interact
with you even last year I was coming to
few colleges to to talk with the
students or interact with the students
and uh by wasting my time by wasting my
time I feel like most of the students
are busy in their clinicals okay so I
feel like you should be more busy in
focusing about the future of your life
in dentistry okay so it's nothing wrong
in taking one day off from the college
and when someone is coming uh to address
you to help you out uh to know what is
the ground reality because you you watch
a video uh or watch a video on Instagram
or watch a video on
YouTube so most of the videos they're
going to talk about only about the
positive side for example you're
planning to go to USA they talk only
about the positive side but what my
concern is I'll be talking about the
ground reality okay when someone is
planning to go to USA you should really
check whether it's going to work out for
you or not okay so I'm going to talk
about the ground reality I'm not going
to talk about the positive pH positive
pH any good face or any sort of
uh any sort of thing what you're going
to plan but I'm going to talk about the
ground reality basing upon your
situation basing upon your circumstances
basing upon your knowledge and basing
upon your family condition your
financial condition so we need to plan
accordingly okay simply a middle class
or a below middle class
individual financially cannot dream to
go to USA and do DDS logically I'm
talking more ground reality I'm talking
okay it is very difficult for a below
middle class individual to plan a
program in USA because you need to spend
more money okay time everyone will have
time but when you're talking about money
it depends upon the financial individual
of the family so that is my main concept
so uh M of conducting this orientation
before you take any call or before you
dream for anything you should know the
ground reality so in this one hour I'll
be talking more about the ground reality
of different different options and
different different things in dentistry
okay I hope most of you are
Inns right uh the first and foremost
thing is uh here apart from the hard
work okay I strongly recommend that we
require uh a bit of uh smart work to be
added to the
uh our previous hardw work okay I want
everyone of you to uh please uh stop
your videos please stop your videos
because it will be recorded okay kindly
stop your videoos
kindly okay
right yeah I'll be jumping uh a bit
quick so welcome to MDS conquer group we
have uh a dental academy we have few
hospitals and uh Dental hospitals and we
have the MDS conquer training institute
for both National exams as well as
International license exams so and I am
Dr srikant uh MDS uh from the Department
of conservative dentistry in Endo I have
done my ug from Vishnu Dental College
have done ug from s Joseph dental
college and PG from Vishnu Dental
College okay so I hope like few of you
are from the same College where I have
done and I am the CEO and the founder of
MDS conquer and officially you are the
10th batch of MDS conquer okay so you
are going to be the 10th batch of MDS
conquer and till this point I have
trained more than uh 12,000 to 13,000
students in the last 10 years of my
experience in handling students training
both from National level as well as
International
level okay so let's start uh uh dive
into the things we'll be talking more
about the ground reality rather than uh
the positive side because that is the
reason why I have not kept this uh
session open in the social media because
whenever whenever I'm facing the crowd
in the social media I need to talk about
only the positive side of this aspects
but when now I have a chance or I have a
it's a private
so where I can talk about the ground
reality and let you know uh what is the
most important aspect of it okay first
of all I want congratulate each and
every one of you for clearing your final
year or uh for getting your BDS degree
so that is a greatest or the first
Milestone uh that we have crossed and
every one of us has a doctor tag in
front of us and a BDS tag after our name
so first of all I want I want to
congratulate each and everyone for
attending this
uh attending this to happen in your life
of Dentistry okay uh the next important
aspect is yes the biggest question once
you clear your final year exam is what
after BDS okay it's the biggest question
right what you need to do how you need
to plan uh things is like whether you're
going in the right path or whether
you're going in the right way okay so
all these are uh biggest question marks
when you're planning your future in
dentistry because uh the problem here is
uh
Dentistry doesn't have a proper guidance
okay because Dentistry is doing far
better than what your expectations
because most of us we think that
whatever that is happening uh in and
around our College zone or in and around
our
College like like for example like when
I was an intern or when I was in the
final year so what is to me is what is
happening in my college is dentist to
me
just a
second yeah whatever that is happening
uh within my college is Dentistry to me
when I was in final year or whenever I
I'm an intern whatever happening to me
in my college as an intern is Dentistry
to me but Dentistry has a larger
Dimension than what you expect by
learning something from your college
okay so that is a real ground level okay
so it's open to all the colleges I'm I'm
not keeping any college as an exception
but what you feel okay what you know
about Dentistry is only 10% is okay so
Dentistry is bigger than your
expectation so this is the first hope
that I can give you is Dentistry is
doing good Dentistry is doing well it
may not be in the zone of your college
or it may not be in the zone of your uh
your village or your town where you are
living okay so Dentistry is more than
your expectation okay right so that is
the first thing that I want to admit
today okay uh I told you guys keeping
the mute stop the
videos because the session is recording
it may not look very good when your
videos are on
please okay right so so Dentistry is
bigger than what we are expecting okay
that's the first thing so don't worry
about your future when you start
exploring Dentistry the ground reel the
reality of Dentistry is going to come
and it's going to help you to move to
the next level okay so doing MDS or
doing BDS or doing
something yeah right so doing MDS or
doing BDS okay uh right these are these
are part and parcel of this uh regular
flowchart or a schedule but the future
is going to be good okay but the thing
is how you can make this future good is
you need to focus and explore the
dentistry and you need to pick something
that suits for you okay something that
that that's going to make you better in
this okay so don't worry about your
future okay let's work in the present
leave your past you may not be a great
student I regularly hear this from most
of my students I have not done very good
in the last four years of Dentistry so
past is not going to have a greater
impact but what you do in the present is
going to cause an impact in your future
in dentistry okay so now I see uh like
people uh people regularly like you see
people are commenting Dentistry is
saturated Dentistry is that Dentistry is
this but what my question is Dentistry
is saturated yes I I agree a Dentistry
is saturated but even if you take my
hometown I'm from a village okay even in
my hometown if you take just example of
my hometown my hometown is also
saturated okay the point here is dentist
is saturated but I'm not good Dentistry
okay so good Dentistry is not saturated
good Dentistry is always open good
Dentistry is always accessible to
everyone so Dentistry may be saturated
but good Dentistry is not saturated so
that is my statement so I want you to
focus to become a good dentist explore
the Dentistry learn new things in the
Dentistry okay don't stick on to the
things which are accessible or which are
available in your college okay there is
more that's what I'm telling like for
example you talk about inlands you see
where verat Koh and Anushka Sharma are
giving an ad how much how much they
charge for the ad okay so they are
branding a product of one Department in
dentistry okay they are branding a
product just imagine how much they are
going to charge and you know
that and you know that Virat kohi uh is
the one Indian having the highest number
of Instagram followers you just imagine
how much he's going to charge for a ad
for a dental product okay and you check
it off how many college how many
colleges uh are doing this invisible U
elers I mean how many colleges are doing
this invisilines or elers is very very
little number of colleges that's what
I'm telling like I'm just giving one
example like what is happening okay how
many colleges are exclusively using
microscopes now the Dentistry is moving
towards micro Dentistry okay okay so how
many colleges are really using
microscopes at a level uh making you to
learn about microscopes very minimal
okay so that's what I'm talking about
the future is going in a different way
and whatever that you have been exposed
in the college has a limitation because
the DCA curriculum has a limitation okay
and they have some procedures and
protocols to be done which may or may
not fall in the advanced Dentistry
that's what I'm talking about I want
everyone to focus to become a good
dentist and don't worry about the
saturated dentist okay normal Dentistry
is saturated but good Dentistry or
Advanced Dentistry or future Dentistry
is not at all saturated it always open
for angry individuals like you who are
going to master the dentist in the
future okay so now uh the goal the uh
individual goal like for example I am I
am an intern uh like probably 11 11
years back 2012 13 I'm an intern so 11
12 years back I was an intern so so the
the prospecto of an intern or a post BDS
like if you have not dream dreamed about
something in internship because of your
tight schedules so the prospective is to
dream big first of all you should you
should plan something like you should
you should take some references and you
should plan something you should dream
and you should work towards the dream
okay so if you don't do that just try to
copy paste the things around you like I
my senior have done this so I want to do
this my senior have did is he's doing
MDS so I'll be doing MDS my senior has
joined here so I'm going to join here so
this is just a copy paste work of course
you require guidance that is right I
agree that you require guidance but here
there will be some inbuilt uh emotion or
there will be inbuilt dream in in inside
you okay that maybe uh you want to make
your family financially strong or you
want to become professionally strong uh
get some name and fame okay by which you
can support your family because few
families they require name and fame few
families they require financial position
few families they want you to be happy
so there's different level of approach
towards the life okay basing Upon Our
circumstances and financial limitations
so first of all I want every one of you
let it be are preparing for entrance let
it be you want to do some XY Z in
dentistry or let it be you want to do
some XY Z out of Dentistry okay make
sure you start dreaming about it and
start working towards your dream okay
that is more important being an intern I
told you right I'm I'm 12 years back I
was an intern so I have a similar
mindset okay I need to do this I need to
do that okay I need to achieve this I
need to change my uh the financial
position of my family from a middle
class or lower middle class to above
middle class so these are the basic
goals that every individual has to have
it's something like not simply that you
get ready uh wear your appon move to
college have a chitchat with your
batchmates okay spend some time eat
something in the canteen have a cup of
coffee gossip on the staff gossip among
yourself evening you come back watch
some web series okay scroll Instagram
sleep day repeat again this is what
happened I know that I know what you
most of your guys are going to do I know
that okay yeah I'm not I'm not against
to this like talking with your friend
gossiping your friend spending some time
in the canteen or scrolling the
Instagram yes this is part of your life
this is part of the present generation
life I agree for this but my concern is
in this all in this all like whatever we
have listed out where are you I want you
to be there okay I want you to to be
there what you are doing for yourself
what you're doing for your family what
you're doing for the sacrifices that are
done by your parents okay so most of us
uh most of us like you see most of us
has compromised to be a part of
Dentistry right most of us the the main
target for most of us is to crack mbbs
during our uh uh entrance examination
that is after 12th standard but we have
not done that so most of us has
compromised and now we are a part of
Dentistry Okay so so you are already
compromised but what you're doing for
yourself and your family or your parents
who have sacrificed so much for you so
please do think over this okay I'm not
against to the fun activities or the
entertainment activities during
internship or post internship they have
to be a part of us but your entire
internship should not focus on enjoyment
okay or should not focus on something
like you need to take a revenge on the
college which has uh troubled you a lot
in the past four years I see most of the
in so I need to take a revenge on my
college Okay so I feel um this is not a
right platform so what I strongly
recommend is just dream for something
okay if you don't know anything talk
with your seniors talk with the staff
who are more comfortable to you plan
something take their suggestions and
start implementing sometimes in the
middle of a journey you feel like Okay
this may not be right for me this is
right for me then you can change your
plan nothing wrong rather than sitting
idle it is better you do something for
your future in dentistry okay so what
should I do then the question is okay
sir you're telling so much so what
should I do yes this is the formula that
I strongly recommend that Young
Generation has to follow first of all
you need to build trust on yourself
whatever you're doing you should have
the great trust okay like here the trust
is directly proportional to the
consistency consistency means the work
whatever you're doing whether you're
doing the work consistent or not and it
is inversely proportional to time for
example I'm going to tell a simple
example in your oral surgery department
so most of us have started our oral
surgery Department during our third BDS
okay I still remember the first day uh
when I'm doing my extraction case I'm
doing an extraction case of grade three
okay grade three I'm doing an extraction
I'm giving a block and extracting and my
hand is like shivering like anything in
SOS of dental college oral surgery
department but the same individual in
finally year I have done so many
extractions as an intern I have done so
many extractions how I get pressed on
myself when I compared with the first
case what I have done is about my
consistency repeatedly I'm doing the
same procedure so first case grade three
I have taken half an hour 40 minutes to
extract because I was more it's not
patient who is more worried it is me who
is more worried okay right so but you
see now I'm able to do maybe in
internship I'm able to do the things
fast okay so that is how I gain my trust
so trust is directly proportional to
consistency and inversely proportional
to time so this is a logic that you need
to follow like whether you prepare for
entrance exam whether you're planning to
move abroad whether you're planning to
do anything you need to build trust on
yourself on that particular segment how
you can do that consistency you need to
maintain the same sort of interest and
consistency over a period of time
initially it may take more time as you
move progress as you progress into it it
will take less time so if you're doing a
particular thing in a less time you'll
get more Trust on yourself you're doing
the same thing repeatedly again and
again again and again you will get more
Trust on you so trust is directly
proportional to consistency and
inversely proportional to time is a
Formula that you need to follow from now
in the future of Dentistry okay next the
second one is the second formula that
you have to follow is Rule of 21 I hope
like most of you are familiar with rule
of
21 so for anything to get
adapted in your in your system or in
your biological
clock in your biological clock for
anyone to get adapted you should follow
rule of 21 for example you're reading
for an entrance examination or you
preparing for IMBD or you are preparing
for ADC or let it be anything okay the
most important thing that an intern
requires is Rule of 21 means you cannot
simply read five days and decide that
I'm not fit for this because the rule of
21 the biological system rule of 21 is
clearly telling that if you want to do
anything okay for example you want to go
to gym okay you cannot simply first five
days one week it's going to be so
difficult so maybe two weeks you're
going to get settled by reaching the
third week that is by reaching the 21st
day you will be comfortable that is
going to be a part and parcel of your
schedule so this is called as rule of 21
so whenever you start something new like
for example previously you're not
reading now you're reading you have to
you have to break this rule of 21 or
previously are not working not
interested in dentistry now you're
interested in dentistry you're going to
gym you're going to to play You're going
to swimming whatever it is I want you to
follow follow the rule of 21 first one
is the formula is trust is directly
proportional to consistency inversely
proportional to time formula the second
one is Rule of 21 biological clock
formula you have to implement it's going
to be so difficult for you to read okay
difficult I agree that it's going to be
so difficult it's not going to be so
easy okay because you need to uh run
internship on one side manage your
batchmates on other side you need to
manage your staff and College on one
side and then you need to read on other
side it's not going to be an easy okay
but once you master rule of 21 it's
going to be very very simple so I want
every one of you to focus plan your
future by following the basic principles
of life okay next one for reading
purpose like if you're like for example
you have a different plans the story is
going to be different but most of the
next levels okay that let it be uh
getting into MDS or Let It Be Your
planning to move to abroad most of them
are linked to examinations so your your
your study area should be according to
your wish okay but as most of you are
staying in the hostel it may not be so
comfortable to prepare the own study
room then I want you to choose library
and in the library also it is mandatory
that you should be in the same place
throughout your preparation so people
should call you okay this is ma'am's
place okay you have a you have a place
in your college where uh you're going to
work under you work in the library so
some colleges may not have access to the
library after college hours you go talk
with your principal take the permission
and you start working because last year
when I'm interacting with few colleges
going there they said like they don't
have Library access after 4 or 5:00 in
the evening so plan your study area your
study area is going to be uh very
important okay your study area your
study position the Aesthetics around the
study area the good friends the positive
friends friends who going to give you
that positive vibes related to your
future plans so all these important so
proper study area building a study area
or building a study place your basic
stuff that is your stick notes your
highlighters okay the basic requirements
because you have to attend online
classes so most of the coaching centers
they provide you online classes so a
proper platform I see you see like most
of the students who are attending this
live are are different they they're
having a different posture of attending
live in the video can see that right
okay that is not that is not a right way
of attending a attending a class okay
because you should be uh placed properly
you should exist properly okay then your
environment should be very very clear
because uh you you're going to attend
the class okay so whenever you attending
the class uh it is mandatory that your
study environment or study area should
be properly organized okay right so that
is very very important uh the next comes
is the the time management the
distribution of time particularly if
you're an intern okay okay time
management is going to play a very very
vital role because you'll be having
College on one side Coles and you'll be
having uh your friends your friends who
are your close friends in dentistry from
your first BDS to final BDS you cannot
skip your friends you cannot skip the
college work so a proper time management
is very very very very important so
adapting to the time management will
take 21 days time that is the rule of 21
so proper time management whenever you
feel like for example like you are
posted in departments like uh
conservative or your depart departments
like Endo or departments like
proo or departments like oral medicine
Radiology or departments like oral
surgery where uh your uh op I mean the
op is going to be uh more and you will
be having more uh the load on a
particular day for example like you're
posted in departments like pedo or you
posted in departments like Community you
may be you may not be so stressed so uh
you can you can can manage the evening
hours for Preparation time but sometimes
when you're are so tied particular in
the Departments like proo or something
okay it's going to be so so difficult
for you to manage that particular uh
time duration or timeline okay so do
plan
accordingly okay uh that is about the
time management so like the the perfect
time management maybe I'll be uh taking
few more steps and I'll be discussing
again after starting your preparation
maybe two or three months after
preparation so basing upon the
Department's time management going to
vary and as an intern and uh guys are
you familiar with this have you seen
this
anywhere can you tell me what is this on
the chat
box so what is
this
anyone yes this is uh semi-finals of 20
9 World
Cup and uh yes doni was run out uh by an
inch shot and uh I mean he's one of the
greatest cricketer but this this inch
has made lots of difference in his
career okay internationally okay right
so you can tell me okay sir similar
these things were regularly happen it's
by luck so what happens
uh sorry so what my concent is so in the
next level Let It Be an entrance exam or
let it be an interview okay or let it be
any other things so most of us we may
lose great opportunities by a single
inch or by a single
McQ or by a single
Mark or by short of time so that is the
primary motor like I want every one of
you to be so serious from now okay so
whether you you you got 65 percentage
whether you got 70 percentage whether
you got 75 percentage doesn't make a
very huge
difference from uh from now to the
future but your score and your rank and
the way you attempt okay will definitely
have an impact on the department which
you are going to choose on the college
where you are going to be and in the
department or in the city where you are
going to be okay so I want every one of
you
within the limitations I'm not telling
that you should come out of your box to
break your head but what I'm telling is
I'm telling that whenever you have
chance or whenever you have uh the basic
things around you you try to give your
best and do something best for you and
your life okay
so just a
second yeah so right that that is what
my concern uh about keeping this pick
and uh yes so whenever you're are not
able to manage time properly okay I said
like interns or let it be a post intern
who's sitting at home and reading also
will have some psychological stress that
is being built by Indian families or you
have your relatives or you have your
neighbors Society in in a community or a
society you are going to have so many
people around you these people are going
to create more stress than the family
okay right so people who are preparing
post interance as a post interance they
are going to have their own stress and
people who are preparing within the
college they are going to have their own
level of stress what stress when when
you're doing good when you're getting
good scores all your batchmates are
going to focus on you uh you're reading
this is what happens in dentistry right
it very common in my batch like 10 years
back also we try to pull the legs of
others like uh you're topper you this
you are that you're doing good something
like that so this is indirectly going to
create uh few people enjoy this okay
when someone is pulling your legs few
people enjoy this but most of us will
have this inbuilt stress but what I feel
is like as we are
doctors with a professional quality you
should have the habit of ignoring and
ignoring these things and focus what you
are working for and focus what you want
to be in the future okay maybe your
batchmates few of your batchmates may be
there with you but most of your
batchmates are going to skip once the
college is done you can take my example
I'm hardly in touch with 10 of my
batchmates not 90 of my batchmates are
not in touch with me we don't talk we
don't message we don't chat also hardly
five or 10 people are are in constant
touch with me that is due to the
Professional Standards maybe very few of
my friends are in touch with me because
people will get busy in their lives as
we go deep into the life that's what the
simple logic of the life is so uh so
don't don't worry about people around
you and don't spoil your career this is
what regularly I see in dentistry why
why you are not reading the answer is my
roommate is not reading sir my best
friend is not
reading people they join the coaching
Center they read they read they do good
and suddenly they stop it and when I got
to know like why you not doing this uh
we both of us we joined
together and uh she was not comfortable
she was not reading so I am also not
reading okay so guys please don't
sacrifice anything for your besties okay
SA saice something that is really
required don't sacrifice your career or
your profession okay that is one more
suggestion I want to give yes the time
management is going to build stress so
my suggestion for you as an intern who
are going to start the preparation in
the initial uh one to two months one
month you may not have an issue with the
time management but as you want to read
more and you want to be more serious
about your preparation so once you cross
that uh one or two months of uh
preparation time then you may have a
time management
issues and once you're crossing the time
management issues and for example
suddenly you are posted in a department
like a proo where you have more workload
or maybe oral surgy you have more cases
or uh maybe like Endo you have to do
more number of cases and you'll be tied
by
evening so now you not able to manage
the time and you're not able to manage
uh or complete the syllabus then next
management that come into issue is
Stress Management stress will develop
because you want to achieve something
you're serious previously you may not be
so serious but now you're are very
serious about the uh about about the
goals and everything completing the
syllabus finishing the exams uh getting
qualified or something then what is
going to happen is then you feel stress
so then the Stress Management should
come into existence so I'll be talking
about time management in detail basing
upon the college it will be different
for different colleges for example if
you are from government Dental College
the time management Stress Management
will be different if you're a post
intern it will be different if you're a
mother it will be different if you're a
clinician it will be I'll be discussing
with you individually uh once you are
deep into your preparation and goals and
that most important thing that is
required is you should have a very good
positive vipes within your batch you
have your sub batches right your six or
eight of you are will be posted in the
same Department that positive vibe
should be there in six of you for eight
of you if luckily if all of you are
preparing yes very good or if few of you
are preparing and few of you are not
preparing because you may have a
different plans okay you kindly help
your batchmates who are really serious
about their goals in the life so don't
feel bad or don't feel jealous I see
this people will feel jealous okay
there's nothing to feel jealous because
maybe from now five years from now
they'll be in a different pattern of
Life getting settled down in a different
area you'll be in a different pattern
getting settled down in a different area
so I kindly request every one of you to
maintain that positive vibes uh within
your batch sub batch or within your
overall batch so don't keep Gres don't
be jealous and don't spoil the others
preparation okay and don't spoil your
preparation also keeping uh the others
in the in your mind okay so let's focus
on the good aspect okay let's focus on
the positive aspect let's give the
positive vibe if someone some of one of
your batchmate who may not be
financially strong as strong as you are
okay there is nothing to computate with
them okay so when they're preparing
seriously so you need to give that
positive okay you prepare I'll do this
case I'll help you out you prepare
because you have an exam tomorrow the
grand exam is there or you have a mock
exam is there you have a subject
specific exam is there so that positive
vibe within the batch is more required
like for example you have your roommate
in the hostel okay so your your roommate
has to help you in maintaining that uh
positive nature or calm nature in the
room if the room is like they're
watching a movie how can you read okay
so whenever they're watching a movie or
whenever they're talking on phone so let
them like what what you have to do is
I'm not asking you to quit the movie or
quit the web series or else I'm not
asking you to quit the phone what I'm
telling is you can use a headphone by
which you're not disturbing your friend
who is seriously preparing to change the
life of their family because everyone of
us are may not be in the same level few
of us may come to college
few of us may come to College by car few
of us will come to college by bike and
few of us will come to college by Auto
okay so why someone is coming buy an
auto and someone is coming buy a car
because their financial levels are
different so someone is working hard so
let's not disturb maintain that positive
nature okay let it be within the
Departments let it be within the room
let it be within the library so if
people are not maintaining it you should
find a way how to maintain your your
positivity and integrity so that you can
go deep into the
preparation okay so now I'll be talking
more about the options available okay so
main concern is I have try I tried my
best to cover in this half an hour I
tried to cover the main qualities uh
that that an intern or a post intern
should carry uh to be successful in the
next level okay next level or next steps
what you need to do now I'll be talking
about the options okay so tell me what
are the options you have uh after after
your BDS so after your BDS you have two
main CL I mean like if you talk about a
classification if you want me to
classify this uh the main classification
is basically divided into uh one is
domestic second one is international
domestic is staying within your state or
staying within India okay right so like
for example you're planning to get
settle down in your hometown or you are
going to planning down to settle down
within Hyderabad okay or within Viada or
within within Mumbai or Pune or okay or
you want to go to any other countries
okay uh planning to go to International
is different getting married and going
to International is different that's
what I'm telling marriage is something
unaccept uh like it is we don't expect
it to happen like when you're preparing
for an MDS entrance suddenly uh you may
get engaged okay or when you're doing
your MDS you may get engaged to a US
based uh uh or it profession or
something like that is that is
unexpected so your plan will change but
as of now your basic things are divided
into domestic that is staying within the
country and going to International and
what are the factors which are going to
affect okay so sir when I should take uh
the option of international or when I
when I should take the option of taking
domestic is there are three important
factors okay Factor number one is amount
of time amount of time that you are
going to spend before you start earning
money is very
very next one the factor number two the
factor number two is amount of
money that you are going to spend before
you start earning money okay Factor
number one is amount of time that you
are going to take and amount of money
factor number two is amount of money
that you are going to
spent so what is Factor number three
Factor number three is person who is
balancing your time and money okay tell
me who is going to balance your time and
money in India who is going to balance
our time and
money guys answer the
question different countries have
different answers but most of us are
Indians right so who is going to balance
your time and
money who is going to give you time who
is going to give you money
I want you to answer on the chat
box yes the persons who are going to
balance your time and money is parents
so whenever you're planning to go to
International three factors are
important according to me Factor number
one time Factor number
two money factor number three parents so
whenever you're taking a call of
international make sure your parent
should be in the meet because the parent
is going to give you time you you have a
different plan okay like in the next two
years I want to clear IMBD maybe I want
to jump into DDS but your parent may
have a different plan with time on you
maybe he's planning within two or two
and half years from now he's planning
you to get married for girls guys you
don't have that option no need to worry
okay right so your financial okay
Financial limitations also you need to
discuss with your parents that how much
you want them to spend on you for your
your next uh like the for your next step
in Industry okay so if you want to go to
International okay International three
factors are important one is time second
one is money and your parents support of
your parents is very much important okay
next one I'm talking more about
International
now okay so next one
is
uh
yeah so next one is when you are
planning something for example like you
are planning
inbd of us uh to jump into DDS or you
planning o to jump into
UK or you're planning ADC examinations
to go to
Australia so don't blindly start your
preparation just by following or S
suggestions taken by the mentors or just
by uh checking one uh Google review or
checking one YouTube video okay that is
not right okay so you need to do a
proper core work on this like at least
10 days core work you have to do okay to
know top to bottom about what you're
doing what is your plan what is your
future then you need to talk with an
individual in your Jone maybe your
senior or maybe your super senior or
maybe someone who know you who has
cleared these exams
and who is doing work in these
countries means you need to have a
proof you have so many stories on
YouTube but you should have a proof
which is very very close to you okay so
proof should be there then you need to
check out the milestones in this for
example I'll be talking about Milestones
of different different
options uh then uh you need to check
about the finances means how much you
need to spend how much time it's going
to take okay you need to sit with proper
mentors who has knowledge over this
don't you don't randomly do whatever you
want because this is going to waste your
time and waste your money whenever your
time and money are
wasted uh uh like for example in the
goals or in the things which are not fit
for you your parents will lose
confidence on you like today you're
going and telling that I'll do MDS pay
20,000 25,000 and after 6 months you're
going to your parents and telling that
I'll go to USA pay one back so the
parents will lose trust on you so you
have to be very very confident first of
all you should be confident and the next
one you have to pay make your parents to
be confident so this is a thing that you
have to do you have to do your core work
talk with your senior who has done this
or check out the Milestones check out
the financial limitations check out the
time that's what I'm telling like you
need to check out the pros and cons of
every option and then you need to plan
like you need to sit and think that okay
this is going to fit for me I can do
this my parents can support in this the
timeline is okay for me so this is going
to be the right option for me so I'm
going to jump into this I'm going to do
this so this is what sometimes you may
fail and you may change your option that
is okay I'm not I'm not discouraging you
I'm telling you before you start
anything please try to be clear in what
you are doing okay because if you waste
your time and money you lose the
confidence on yourself and your parents
are going to lose the confidence on you
so this should not happen at any level
uh in any platform right clear
guys okay I need your response I hope
you're following the things I hope this
is useful okay I hope you're you're able
to understand uh my my main points and
my main concerns okay I want your
response because it let let let it be a
two-way communication maybe in the first
uh part in this part we'll be talking
like I'll be giving the information
whatever I have from my knowledge later
if you want we can uh interact
individually or we can interact College
wise that's not an issue I'm ready to
help you out uh in in choosing the best
option for you okay right uh thank you
so much for your response okay now I'll
be talking about few important
options okay uh right I'll be talking
first about
inbde okay I'll be talking
about
inbde okay so inbd is a single exam okay
inbd is a single exam
uh uh which is used to enter into DDS to
practice in USA I hope you know this
right have you heard this DDS inbd guys
have you heard this or this is the first
time you are hearing it let's have a
two-way communication maybe I'll be
extending 20 minutes or half an hour
half an hour more yes you know this
right okay so
inbd uh is is a single exam that you
need need to clear and then uh you need
to
apply uh for the I mean for the for the
for the colleges and get into DDS and
DDS you have to do a course so it's just
like converting your BDS to a DDS
program which is valid in
USA okay so long back if you check out
your YouTube videos and everything there
will be like NBD part one and part two
so it is NBD part one and part two they
were there till 2019 2020
but
now yes but now
uhbd so your NBD part one and part two
NBD part one and part two now combined
together they have made a single exam
called as inbd this is called as
integrated national board examination
okay right so what are the basic steps
for inbd the basic steps for inbd is for
any International exam the first and
foremost thing that you have to do is uh
get your transcripts and all your
certificates uh everything assisted from
your respective University and you have
to send them okay so first of all there
will be some documentation work in your
University so once you are done with the
documentation work in the University so
the next thing that you have to do is
send them for easy evaluation
means internationally whether these are
okay or not you're are going to send it
your certificates your original
documents and everything you're going to
send it for EC evaluation and EC once
the EC evaluation is done you can
generate okay Dental
pin so once you generate Dental pin okay
so you can
book your slot for inbd
examination so you have to give IMBD
exam maybe interns they may require like
an 8 months or 10 months of preparation
to clear IMBD or post inance uh four
months or five months preparation time
is sufficient for a good student so you
have to book a slot for uh
inbd so once your slot is done uh you
can give this exam okay this exam you
can give only in USA you have to go to
USA okay to give this exam right so once
you are done with the exam and once you
this is a pass or fail examination okay
it's a pass or fail examination so you
can give this
exam okay once you are
pass so now you have to apply for the
universities with your inbd inbd pass
certificate along with uh all the
documents required your CV uh your
experiences your achievements whatever
it is your going to apply the individual
universities or the dental schools in
USA for example if they like your
profile okay if they like your profile
they may call you for an
interview plus bench
test bench test is nothing but a
practical examination so they may call
you for an interview and a bench test
once you clear interview and bench test
they'll give you DDS seat for you in the
course
so once your DDS seat is confirmed okay
so your DDS seat is confirmed so you're
going to have a six months time for the
documentation then you start your DDS
program and it's going to be around 2
years 4 months in most of the
universities so once you're done with
this you'll get
graduated and you can work as a DST l in
USU this is a flowchart clear guys guys
clear first thing is documentation work
from your University you should send the
documents to EC
evaluation then you should generate a
dental pin open an account generate a
dental pin book the slot move to USA
give exam once your exam is passed you
start applying for the
universities of USA if they call you for
an interview and Ben you have to clear
that get into DDS finish the DDS this is
the flowchart okay right so here uh one
as one important aspect that we need to
focus on
is uh is about your uh preparation okay
preparation for the exam okay that is
the exam of inbd the second important
aspect that you need to focus on is
preparing your profile to apply the
universities you have to prepare your
profile your CV should be very very
strong so as an
intern as an intern or as a post intern
if you are planning to start DDS program
okay okay you have to focus on two
important aspects one is preparing for
IMBD examination one the second one is
making your profile strong from the day
one from the day one of your preparation
you have to focus on both of this one is
preparing for exam second one is making
your profile strong and making your
bench test concept strong means practic
exam suddenly you cannot learn practical
exam so it's better you focus more on
one and two and followed by three this
is a sequence that you have to follow so
first priority should be more for inbd
exam and second priority should be more
on building your profile so that you can
easily get a call from the University
and the third one is you have to prepare
for your interview as well as your bench
examination okay here uh like uh like
before you're going along with your
profile uh you you have to give tol exam
also here okay English English exam tol
exam also here when you're applying for
the universities okay so the the concent
here is uh like for example you're an
intern now to finish your internship it
is going to take one year okay so you
cannot I mean like if you're very
passionate and you have like uh the
relatives or you have your blood
relationship in USA then you can go in
internship and clear the exam also this
option is also open but may not be open
for all of you so you can go during
internship to USA to clear this
examination that is also possible okay
so normally what is going to happen is
um after going to us after clearing the
exam normally a BDS student is having a
waiting period of at least 3
years okay right at least three years
waiting period is there two to three
years waiting period is there next one
because uh you need to enter into USA to
give this particular examination IMBD
you cannot give this examination in
India the main problem that's going to
happen is is uh Visa okay so simply you
tell that okay sir I'm done with my
graduation I just want to go to USA can
you give me Visa no one is going to give
you Visa okay so what is going to happen
is you see most of your seniors are
going to USA with a taglines like mph
MBA bioinformatics oral biology
healthcare administration you see all
these taglines like have you seen most
of your seniors uh they move to USA with
these taglines or these degrees guys
have you seen such any of your seniors
are there like uh doing these courses
yes yes because normally if you want to
enter into USA to give exam they may not
permit so most of the people uh the
keeping Dentistry as a plan A or a plan
B they enter these countries keeping
these degrees as an optional so once you
get admission for MPH or MBA or
bioinformatics you can enter the country
so once you enter the country you can
give this examination or the second
option is few of you may have your
brother own brother or own sister over
there okay so where you can keep
some uh some chance or take some chance
and keep a visiting visa and you can
enter tourist Visa or visiting Visa
cannot be given for a fresh graduate
okay so fresh graduate they are not
going to give a tourist visa okay right
so be smart okay they know why you're
entering their country so they may not
be so inclined or interested to give a
tourist visa for a gr fresh graduate so
that is the reason why most of the
people they keep these courses as a
Target and they enter the country and
then they keep a plan of clearing these
exams and entering into dental school
okay uh fees of dental school ranges
from uh around like 1.8 to 2.5 crores uh
for this 2 years four months program
apart from this uh you need to spend a
decent amount of money for all these
like traveling attending the
universities maybe you need to spend
around like 5 to 10 LH
lakhs okay 5 to 10 lakhs you need to
spend okay uh in before you get it get
the admission basing upon where you are
taking the coaching where you're taking
the coaching for bench test where you're
taking the coaching for inbd application
of inbd traveling to USA staying in USA
okay moving from one University to other
university to attend your interviews
bench tests everything has a feast and
everything is chargeable okay right so
this is an D outline in detail outline
uh if you want to have an in detail
clearcut outline tomorrow we have I mean
tomorrow we have a live on Instagram by
Dr sirisha MDS and DDS okay so ma'am is
already done with DDS she's working as a
dentist and she's from Vishnu Dental
College MDS okay MDS from Vishnu dental
college and UI from gam ma'am is going
to take it tomorrow one more live
session exclusively on IMBD so people
who are very much inclined to IMBD and
DDS you can attend that Instagram live
session tomorrow where you are going to
learn so much apart from the basic
things what I'm discussing okay so with
this I'm closing inbd okay so I'm going
uh into the next next one so what do you
want me to discuss the next one you have
any priority I want you to respond on
the chat
box so what do you want me to discuss
which
O Okay the next one is I'll be
discussing about
o so basically if you want to enter into
UK you have two examinations one is O
and second one is
LDS so o LDS o is basically overseas
registration
examination and uh LDS LDS is basically
licens in Dental Sciences okay so these
exams are basically categorized into two
parts one is part
one and second one is part two and
similarly your LDS is also divided into
part one and part two okay right so
these are basically divided into part
one and part two so part one of O
regularly occurs two times in the
year and part two occurs three times in
the
year okay right and uh uh the basic I
mean the basic part one fees is going to
be
£800 and the part one will
Ur the part one exam is going to occur
two days day one you are going to have
part a day two you're going to have part
b day one will be focusing more on basic
sciences and day two will be focusing
more on
clinicals after 20 days after finishing
your examination your result will be out
and you're eligible to block your seat
for part
two part two fees will
be300 okay 300 pound and part two is
being divided into four subp
parts one is
DM one is DM which is called as Dental
managements means you need to do some
pre-clinical work over there okay or
Preparation or restoration or inlay
cutting onlay cutting and all these
things the second one is
osce that is object structure clinical
examination okay and the third part is
dtp that is diagnosis treatment and
planning diagnosis treatment and
planning and the fourth one is me that
is medical emergencies okay so whenever
you fail in any of these like for
example you you passed in Part B and you
fail in part A you have to repeat the
exam again similarly again these four
units you fail in any of these parts
Part One 2 three okay you have to read
retake the
exam only part four that is your medical
emergencies okay only part four that is
your medical emergencies okay you have
one chance they are going to you can
retake the exam
only okay you can retake that only me
exam again okay and you can retake that
exam but it is only one time okay you
have to clear in one time or else if you
don't clear again you have to take your
entire part two okay so this is a rough
outline of O the amount that you spend
and money the the difficult aspect is
getting
a uh getting a slot to give examination
is going to be difficult for o it is
something like uh you see like Railway
tatkal Department
okay
just a
second yeah okay hope hope I think now
it's visible to
you
yeah so that that is how your o will be
so part one will be there part two will
be there uh part one is being splitted
into subp Parts Like A and B uh a is a
first day exam moving on Basics and B is
a second day exam moving on the
clinicals once you clear it you'll be
eligible to give part two part two is
divided into four parts one two three
four okay one is Dental managments the
second one is osce that is your object
structure clinical examination then that
the third one is DPT that is your
diagnosis treatment and planning and
fourth one is going to be your medical
emergencies only fourth one if you fail
you can you can retake the exam only
only this exam you can retake once but
if you fail anything you have to retake
enter part two so after clearing part
one you can clear part two in four
attempts
or within five
years part one you need to spend around
like 1,000
pounds and part two you need to spend
around like
3,000 when I repeating exam again you
need to pay this £3,000 pounds right if
you fail if you want to repeat it again
the main problem with this o is going to
be uh booking a slot for this is going
to be difficult now the number of slots
previously the number of slots used to
be 200 which are going to fill fast now
they have improved to 500 and uh
recently we got info that this can
change further better they're planning
to increase the number of slots okay
right so that's about uh your
UK uh
right next
one
in uh like if you want to go to U UK
apart from o there is one more exam
called as LDS okay you have LDS that is
licensed Dental Sciences okay license
exam of dental Sciences you can plan
your LDS also LDS also will be in the
similar pattern like part one and part
two okay uh but LDS part one will be one
day exam only whereas or part one will
be two days exam uh LDS part one will be
uh a single day exam okay right
[Music]
so coming to Australia Australian ADC
Australian Dental Council examination
these exams are going to be so difficult
uh for this uh you need to prepare well
okay standards of these exams are very
very tricky even for the Practical as
well as for the clinical so you should
have a strong clinical based knowledge
which I mean whatever at a BDS level is
not sufficient okay so you should
practice uh under the best mentors uh to
clear these practical and Theory
examinations okay so aost and dental
council is again uh a part
one and part two examination so if you
check out part one part one is going to
have four papers you're going to have
okay paper one paper two paper three and
paper four subjects it's going to have
different different subjects in each in
each paper and you need to clear all the
papers okay if you fail in one paper you
have to retake part one exam again
okay so basically I mean uh like for
example you check it off the university
document assessment and verification
that is common for any International
examination but I'm basically talking
about the part one so part one uh is
going to like uh it's going to cost2 200
2,000 Australian
dollars okay so it's going to cost
$22,000 Australian dollars so once
you're done with the part one before you
going to part two you have to give
ILS uh with a band score of more than
seven in each band you have to clear
this exam and followed by you need to go
for part two so part two is basically
contains of two subp parts A and B so a
is
technical technical skill
exam whereas b b is clinical skill
exam in technical skill exam you are
going to do something related to uh your
Phantoms okay the preclinical okay they
regularly don't encourage you to do a
practical exam on a patient like how we
do in India so most of these will be
technical Phantom head based
examinations so in this Phantom head you
have three categories one is
conservative procedure will be there
second one is endo procedure will be
there and the third one you are going to
have a prosthetic procedure will be
there so in prto regularly you they'll
ask you to prepare a crown and in Endo
they'll ask you to prepare access
openings and in operator they're ask
they're going to ask you either to
prepare a cavity or either to restore a
cavity whereas coming to the clinical
skill exam so you are going to have an
OSI models here you have different
different patient stations will be there
okay so you have to go into the patient
stations you have to diagnosis the case
you have to manage the case and you have
to uh discuss the case uh with the
mentors uh about the treatment plans and
everything so for this uh for this part
two they are going to charge
4,000 4 ,500 Australian dollar part one
is 2,000 part two is 4,000 good aspect
is part one can be given in India you
can give in India like if you're from
Andra and Telangana you have a center in
Hyderabad you can give in Hyderabad okay
you have a center in Delhi uh the the
details were available in ADC website
okay as far as I know we have a center
in Hyderabad and we have a center in
Delhi so you can give exam in India
itself okay in India itself you can take
this exam part one but part two you have
to go to Australia by taking the Visa
okay CH I'm
done okay so now I'll be I mean the most
important thing is UK Canada uh sorry UK
us as well as uh the Australia I have
discussed so now I'll be focusing on one
is I'll be focusing on ADC Indian ADC
that is Army Dental
cops
Army Dental
cops so Army Dental cops the basic
salary along with allowances and
everything is going to be around like 95
to, it's around like one lakh with all
the uh gazed advantages of being working
with army you have all the Army
advantages so Army Dental cops is
basically you need to work as a dentist
in the Army in the Army in the Army
basis okay clear right you know that
right okay see it will the flowchart
will be like
this first of all you have to give neat
MDS exam okay neat MDS exam you have to
give and you should get a good rank in
this exam good rank if you ask me around
rank
better you should have a rank below 1200
100 or 1,000 1, to 1200 below rank
should be there it's the same I'm
telling sometimes uh people get
admission with 1800 rank 2,000 rank also
but I'm telling safe Zone because you
cannot take a risk so it's nothing wrong
you can
uh you can give
exam okay it's nothing wrong you can
give exam uh but make sure you try to
keep your rank 1,000 below or 1,00 below
okay right so once you're done with the
ne rank army people are going to release
a
notification so once they release a
notification you need to fill the form
again along with your neat rank so once
along with your neat rank you're
preparing forms so finally people who
has applied to Army Dental cops along
with the neat rank they are going to
release a merit
list so Merit list
of uh like uh like for example if the
seats are 40
in Army CS uh they are going to ask you
to come around 40 into 20 or 40 into 15
people they're going to call for example
you take 40 into 15 so they're going to
call 600 students in the Merit
list so they are going to release a 600
Merit
list 600 Merit list is just based upon
the neat ranking your rank is good
you'll be top in the Merit list your
rank is bad you'll be bottom in the
Merit list but they are going to take
only six 00 people they're going to call
them to Delhi to army bases for
interview and medical
test okay so they're going to do
interview and medical test and they are
going to release a final Merit
list maybe for for 40 positions they may
release a merit list of 60 to 70 top out
of this 600 they are going to do the
interview and they are going to release
the Merit list or 62 to 80 out of which
top 40 of their interest can be a part
of AR
clear guys
clear I need your response on the chat
box this is about army army first you
need to give neat MDS examination once
the notification is out you need to
apply with your rank you will get a
merit list so once you are in the Merit
list the army people are going to call
you for their base camps for interview
and medical examination once you clear
the Medicals and once you clear the
interviews they are going to give you
final Merit list okay in which the final
Merit list you are going to uh the top
50 the top 40 will be getting the seats
any specific interest of children who
are having Army background yes the
interest will be in the interview and
medical so they here uh in the interview
they're going to ask ask you whether any
of you are having an army background in
your family or something so they're
going to cross check and they they may
give a priority for these kids okay they
may give a priority for these kids this
is not official you don't have any
special category for Army children
officially but
unofficially uh they are going to
consider uh the people who has Army
background in the interview because uh
conting that the people who are having
Army background in their family they
know the basic rules of Army okay so
keeping in that keeping that in the mind
okay they may consider people who are
having Army background okay right so
this is about army cops okay so now I'll
be jumping into uh MDS okay right if you
want to do an MDS in India you have two
only two examinations to do MDS long
back you have different pattern of exams
okay one examination is
neat MDS
exam which is going to
occupy which is going to occupy 98
percentage of seats in the entire
country okay the second one is I
ni examination which is going to occupy
2 percentage of seats in the entire
country okay so these are the two exams
uh by which you can do MDS in our
country okay whether you have money or
not that is secondary uh whether you
want to go for management qu or not that
is your wish but make sure you have to
enter only these F these two exams okay
so one is neat 98% second one is inic 2
perent
inic neat regularly occurs I'm talking
about your session that is 2025 so neat
may occur in the month of March 2025 for
you okay when I'm talking about inic in
occurs two times in the year one is
November
2024 second one is May 2025 in occur two
times a year okay it is two times one
and two NE occurs only once in a year
okay clear guys about your examinations
tenative
dates I want your response I want your
response let's let's finish it fast okay
so it is two times in is two times
November 2024 so Andra students okay
Andra
students right present inance okay
present inance so when you have started
your
internship starting date of your
internship January 8th January 1st
okay so uh you I mean like uh the date
the cut off dates for internship are
going to vary for November I'm not very
sure about your eligibility for November
in C because you need to finish your
internship by January okay
uh next year to get admission in
admission for the seat of November City
but anyway I'll be discussing about that
uh further okay right so that's November
in and May inct and March 2025 NE
examination next one uh how many GDC
seats are there per year in all India
okay so total number of seats in in the
country are around like 6,000 MDS seats
are there okay out of this 6,000 MDS
seats okay you have 10 per of seats are
from government dental
colleges that is around like 600 seats
are from gdcs okay you know what is what
is government Dental
Coles so
government Dental College advantage of
government dental college is government
Dental College seats are free
seats no need to pay anything to the
college as a college fees no
fees and instead of that government
dental colleges are going to give you
stipended every month okay you see GDC
kadapa in SVU or GDC vijaywada in yu
region or you see gdc's like for example
Maharashtra people are there Maharashtra
people are having more number of gdcs
you have GDC nagapur you have you have
GDC Mumbai you have GDC ner okay you
have GDC there are so many gdcs right
okay so second thing is they're going to
give us tyen okay can you tell me what
is the highest tyen for a government
Dental College in
India for a dentist in India can you
tell me what is the highest
tyen yes the highest tyen in India is 1
lakh
16,000 rupees per
month okay the highest high Fund in
India is 1ak 16,000 rupees per month
month okay so if you're getting into
central government colleges there are
around like uh uh eight central
government colleges in the country so if
you get into any of these colleges your
stifen will be around one lakh per month
okay your stifen is going to be around
one lakh per no fees and you're going to
have a very high stifen okay that where
you can do the maintenance and plan uh
your future accordingly okay so nothing
wrong you can Target this there are many
students who has achieved this uh being
an in so can Target this so how many
gdcs are there in the
country I want you to be active like
most of you have attended this session
basically to know about uh neat neat and
MDS related stuff okay so how many
government Dental College seats are
there in the
country how many government Dental
College seats are there in the country
no it's not
60 seats I'm talking about it's around
580 to 600 odd gdcs are there 600 around
600 all gdcs are there okay right so now
how many gdcs are there in your
state I see most of Andhra students are
attending can you tell me Andra Pradesh
how many government Dental College seats
are there
anyone I'm not talking about colleges
I'm talking about
seats so luckily last year uh Andra
seats has been increased okay so Andra
seats has been increased if you take GDC
vijaywada
we have 24
seats and uh GDC kadapa is a one more
GDC from Andra Pradesh you have around
like 23 seats okay so total in GDC Andra
Pradesh you have 47 seats okay so no no
need to worry about Maharashtra students
Maharashtra is the state having highest
number of gdcs in the entire country
okay so Andra people you have 47 gdcs
okay uh from both Kapa as well
as V so all the colleges Au comes under
vijaywada GDC and all the colleges in
SVU the four colleges in SVU you are
eligible to take this 23 Government
College seats available in your state
pool okay right so these are the uh gdcs
any any idea about stifen in GDC Vada
GDC
Kapa
guys stif any idea how much per month
yeah it is 60 it's around like 50 or
60,000 per month is a stifen in vij
GDC yes molana lady Hardley all all are
going to come under central government
government Dental College
seats okay right so right so that that's
a brief idea so you have a decent number
of seats in Andra and Telangana and you
have decent number of seats in
Maharashtra also okay so let's let's
start start working towards achieving
yes G government seats in Telangana are
27 you have nine departments 9 into 3 27
stifen is 64,000 in
Telangana recently the stifen of
Telangana has increased to okay right
okay so now I'll be talking about the
GDC Ahmedabad from Gujarat is having the
highest number the highest tyen among
all the government Dental College seats
like you you are categorized into
central government state government so
central government colleges will
definitely have highest tiend among the
state government colleges GDC ahmadabad
is having around like 75,000 Maharashtra
is having around like 50 to 60,000 per
month okay anyway so we'll be moving to
the next part Karnataka 50,000 only one
GDC from Karnataka GDC
Bangalore okay so the first exam that
most of you are eligible is going to be
November inic okay like November in the
total number of seats in November inct
are going to be uh 18 to 20 okay right
uh that includes
aims and the number of questions in
these exam is going to be around like
200
questions and the time duration is going
to be 180 minutes that is around like 3
hours and you'll have a negative marking
concept minus 1/3 means every right
answer you'll have plus one score and
every wrong answer you're going to have
minus 1/3
score and you need to solve 200
questions in 180 minutes so you should
do each question in 50 seconds so that
is the reason why practice is more
required you have 25 to 30 diagram based
questions simple words what is diagram
based questions is very simple like
something like your spotters in your
clinicals non-cl clinicals Anatomy
Dental Anatomy All you have spotters
right so similarly you going to have a
spotter based questions there those are
called diagram based
questions 70% of your paper will move
around
clinicals and 20 to 35 are diagram based
questions most mostly most of your
diagram based questions will be from the
clinical subjects right
clear November inic is going to be for
18 to 20
seats it is for 200 mcqs 180 minutes
with minus 1/3 negative
marking and the question paper may have
25 to
30 questions that is diagram based
questions so once you're done with
November in C for November in C as as of
now I can tell you the basic eligibility
criteria is officially you should finish
your internship by January
2025 okay for eligibility of November in
C next one the next exam that you are
going to attempt is going to be neat
examination in the month of March
2025 what are included in this all gdcs
all all private college seats all deemed
College seats your army cop selection
takes place from this
examination here it's going to be 240
mcqs inct is for how many
mcqs inct how many
mcqs yes inic is for 200 mcqs whereas
your need is going to be for 240 mcqs
time duration is same as in I
180 minutes very good negative marking
is minus 1/4 here for every right answer
you'll get plus4 marks for every wrong
answer you'll get minus one in the neat
so what is the negative marking concept
value in your as that is in your in what
is the negative marking concept
value
yes in I the negative marking is minus
1/3 okay so you need to solve here you
have more questions
so you need to solve the questions fast
so you need to complete the questions in
40
seconds so diagram based questions will
be 35 to 40 so you'll have lengthy
clinical based questions here so this is
all about the uh rough idea about the
neat
2025 March so once you're done with the
neit okay neit has a blueprint uh where
uh the neit blueprint is you have part
A and Part
B part A is going to be 100 marks 100
mcqs Part B is going to be 140
mcqs so part A is more of a non-clinical
subjects and Part B is more of a
clinical subjects clear is love
blueprint and each
subject each subject is going going to
carry 14
marks in the blueprint I'll be posting
the blueprints on the WhatsApp groups
where I have shared the links to you
guys okay right we'll be talking in
detail like when once you are very
specific to neat as you go deep into the
preparation I'll be guiding you I'll be
suggesting you can I move are you clear
till this point 240 mcqs 180 minutes
every right answer plus four marks every
wrong answer minus one your need
question paper is divided into part A
and Part B part A is going to be 100
mcqs Part B is going to be 140 mcqs part
A will be more of a non clinicals Part B
is more of a clinicals and each subject
is going to carry 14
marks the next Comes Is the once you're
done with the neat examination next
comes is the second round of in which
will be in the month of May here you
will have more number of seats May C is
going to have more number of seats when
compared with November
inic the pattern is same 200 180 minutes
minus 1/4 negative marking and all all
left over everything the pattern is same
okay but you see the number of seats
will be more in May round when compared
to November round of in
clear clear
clear so in occurs how many how many
times per year inct occurs how many
times per
year yes in is going to happen two times
per year whereas neat is going to happen
one time per
year okay now how to start preparation
okay it's very simple like preparation
is something you need to follow rule of
21 okay sit start with a positive
mindset try to follow the mentor try to
discuss with the mentor like if you have
any difficulties during reading if you
have any difficulties during
understanding after 21 days if you have
any difficulties during reading if you
have any difficulties during learning or
understanding time
management there is nothing to hesitate
you can come directly talk with the
mentor that is an advantage of MDS
conquer regularly most of the app based
coaching centers you don't have mentors
to discuss because app is going to talk
with you but MDS conquer is not like
that you are going to have a website
access but you are going to have a
mentors over here who are going to guide
you so this is a guided based
preparation so we are going to guide you
in the preparation so whenever you feel
difficulties whenever you feel
obstructions time management Stress
Management you're not able to score
marks you're not able to achieve your
goals you can come discuss with the
mentor take suggestions start
implementing them and make your
preparation better over a period of time
okay that is how you start let's start
okay because it's not an app based
preparation we are there here to help
you at all the levels so you can
interact with the team of MDS con ER so
at every time okay the mentors like if
you drop a message the mentors are going
to respond within one day they call you
you can interact with them like for
example you a group of students who want
to interact that is also possible but if
you want to interact individually that
is also possible that's an extra
Advantage being a part of MDS conquer so
that is how there will be Drift from a
theory a finally year Theory based exam
to an McQ based exam McQ entrance exams
are McQ based exams and few of the your
Li exams like for example like uh for
example o or LDS and all these exams you
have a single liners okay you need to
answer the question as a single liners
okay but you don't have options may not
be an McQ based exam but rest other most
of the entrances are going to be an McQ
based exam so here you should be clear
with the concepts previously for example
final year Theory exams even if I'm not
clear with the concept even if I know
single line regarding a particular
question what I can do is I can attempt
those questions but that may not be POS
possible in the entrance exam so you
should be clear with your Concepts and
Concepts right uh next one is books to
do or how to how to read or how many
hours to study okay these are again main
Concepts so like if you are part of MDS
conquer uh I'll be providing you
checklist like for a particular topic or
a particular subject how you need to do
where you need to do where you have to
start where you have to end if there is
any necessary that you need to read
textbook because reading textbook for
all the subjects is not going to be
possible okay for an entrance exam so
MDS conquer is having a content of 1500
pre-recorded videos covering the entire
syllabus of all the subjects so where
the mentors are going to teach you from
standard textbooks that's an extra
armamentarium where you have here so the
point here is it is going to be
difficult for you to read textbook so
conquer team is going to give you notes
or they are going to teach you in the
video directly from the textbooks so uh
my strong recommendation is reading
textbook will not work out okay so you
just try to follow the suggestions and
checklist that are given by the team MDS
conquer and you can go ahead with
them and the things is how many hours
you have to read so as an intern it
varies from Department to department so
initially I want you to start at least
like spending one to two or 2 to three
hours slowly as you hit the rule of 21
days we will try to improve
our preparation time basing upon the
department in which we are posted Maybe
by half an hour or maybe 1 hour maybe
we'll try to spend more uh quality of
time uh during the weekends or during
the holidays maybe like Saturday we can
we can do a night out or Sunday we can
spend more time with the book uh maybe
when you when you encounter a public
holiday okay or when you're posted in
departments like pedo Community or
peripheral postings in your oral
pathology or maybe postings in your
general
medicine or maybe posted in the
department where there is less op so you
can spend some more quality of time but
initially I want you to start either
with 1 to two hours or two to three
hours a quality of preparation slowly
I'm going to tell you what are the
techniques that you have to follow what
are the things that you have to
implement in the
preparation okay so uh this is a
checklist that I uh I give to the
students okay right the the things that
you have to have before you start your
preparation so there should be Power
Play Book fifth uh Edition should be
there which will be given if you're a
part of MDS conquer I want you to follow
either one of these book either uh the
dentist or either the dental pulse okay
any one of the book two books yes it's
okay but initially I want you to start
with one book and once you feel your
time management and everything is
comfortable then we'll think of adding
the second book okay so all previous
question papers from 2017 to
2022 with 23 along with your seniors
once they're done with 24 will be
available on website you can access them
whenever you want but you need to cover
half of the syllabus uh to get access of
these
content and next you have a question
Bank available on the website so every
subject and every subtopic in a subject
is going to have an a number of
questions where you can take as an exam
all your latest Concepts which are
required for the exam will be covered as
a videos available on the website you
have Smart notices whenever uh a
particular content is not sufficient
from the books where you are reading or
content is not sufficient from the
videos you have an extra added smart
notes or articles if you need to read an
article the article will be provided as
a smart notes on the website so during
the last revision pattern you will have
a last minute revision or you will have
a quick revision videos quick revision
videos I'm not going to active Now
activate now quick revision videos are
going to be activated in the last three
months of your preparation time along
with quick revision videos you are going
to have last minute revision notes will
be activated you're going to have mock
exams you're going to have grand
examinations you're going to have
textbook reading and you're going to
have uh diagram based
exams you're going to have number based
exams you're going to have case based
exams you're going to have previous
year question based question base exams
exams okay clear you have a bulk number
of exams but that's what I'm telling I
don't want to expose you to all these in
the initial phases maybe as we go deep
into the preparation maybe three or four
months from now slowly all these Futures
will get activated one upon the other on
the website okay right as of now we are
providing I don't know how many days we
are going to open the scholarship but as
of now we are providing a scholarship
basing upon your final year Theory final
year marks okay aggregate marks of fin
year so if it is above 65 we have some
considerations which will be posted on
your respective
groups for online students we have uh
two plans one is plan a second one is
plan Pro the basic difference between
the plan a and plan Pro is
Pro Plan is going to have 70 to 75 live
classes and these live classes will be
from evening 6 6:00 to 8:00 the similar
timings like how we have taken today's
orientation we have a similar live class
timings so this is not going to disturb
your college hours or this is not going
to disturb your uh mess timings I think
like most of your messes will be closed
by 8 8:30 or 9:00 so we'll be closing
the session by 8:00 even if you miss the
session the session will be available as
a recorded version for Pro Plan students
So Pro Plan live interactions uh are
going to be more track to where the
question the mentors are going to
discuss uh some Concepts they're going
to solve some mcqs McQ solving will be
there they're going to motivate you from
all the aspects so it will be more
interactive whereas plan is not going to
have those live sessions okay that is a
major difference between the plan a as
well as plan
Pro okay so that's all like I just want
uh to
add okay so so this hope you can see my
screen the new
screen 1 minute within within 5 minutes
I'll be concluding it I want your
response right okay so this is your
browser I'll be sharing this I just want
to explain few important things uh we
are starting the next batch uh uh
tomorrow we have a basic introduction uh

Stoppers of MDS conquer and you're going
uh the team is going to help you in
guidance as well as the counseling
aspect the difference between the
prolive and plan a is you're going to
have Prive classes the live classes the
recorded live classes so conquer is
standing first in state Andra and in
state
Telangana from past seven years so from
past seven years these are the recent
rank
holders uh swapna is from narana Dental
colge Navia is from Vishnu Dental colge
har prya is from gam and somia is from
Vishnu dental college verika is from
pania dental college swata is from Mala
RI
Puja is from kamani and chandana is from
P Dental col and most of these Toppers
are interns okay so if you plan properly
there is a high chance that you will get
a good rank okay so there is no
discrimination when you're going with
the preparation whether you're a post
intern whether an intern interns will
not have time post interns will have
more time no it's not time it is the
confidence that you carry it is the
commitment that you give for your dream
or for your goal that is more important
to secure a good rank at a state level
or at all India level it's not about
time okay I have more time to read I
have less time to read that may have an
influence but not much important because
you see most of the
people uh even they are interns they got
very good ranks okay so this is an
offline uh offline uh course uh which is

box
anything we can
discuss doubts regarding the admission
process with MDS
conquer rank to get into government
dental college for a general category uh
it varies from state to state uh if it
is all India wide you need to have a
minimum of uh three 350 all India rank
for a general category student to get
into all India okay for example
uh man you're from which you're from
which
state Delhi people can have a higher
rank okay Delhi people can have a higher
rank because you have uh some extra
reservation in few of the central
government College Maybe maybe 400 rank
400 450 also you'll get a government
Dental College
C Maharashtra State all India level it
is it is same for all the students okay
so it will be 300 350 for an open
category student to get a seat in all
India level when we talking about state
level for Maharashtra the state level is
going to vary a bit like you may get
till 500 550 for Andra you may get up to
700 to 800 Telangana you may get up to
700 to 800 GDC I'm talking about open
categories when you have a special
reservation at a state level or at an
all India level maybe if you're from SC
or St or you maybe from pH or physically
handicapped or you have a sub
reservations in telengana or Andra or in
our states basing upon that seat Matrix
of that particular year the numbers are
going to slightly
vary yes Assam has one government Dental
College you have GOI dental college
okay that that's why all India it is
almost the same 350 but if you want to
get into State Pool through Assam you
have to be the state top two or three
like maybe like I I I have previous
students there are so many students from
Assam so maybe you need to be in the top
four or five of the country uh five of
your state to get into
governments bear as you already said uh
Su you already said the number of seats
in your state are very very low so you
don't expect any sort of GDC from your
state so you have to focus in from all
India that should be 350
below smart notes will be available as
notes on the website okay whereas power
playbooks whatever we are going to give
will be sent as a hard copies to your
postal
address
anything
more what is this NRI seats NRI seats
that's what I'm telling like NRI seats
uh will vary from year to year okay so
it will be open in few colleges in few
years so for NRA seats also you have to
get qualified
qualified with the neat examination so
you have to qualify the neat examination
and in all India counseling what is
going to happen for your central
government colleges and state government
colleges so followed by your deemed
colleges and NRI seats will be filled
through all India if if all NRA seats
are not filled uh by the counseling so
the college can fill their NRA seats
from their way okay once the all India
is done so NRI seats that's what I'm
telling like NRI seat of a particular
Department of a particular College uh
will be cleared only after the seat
