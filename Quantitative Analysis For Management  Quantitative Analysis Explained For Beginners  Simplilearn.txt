hello everyone welcome to yet another
exciting video by simply learn today we
are going to jump into the confusing
world of quantitative analysis
we'll explore what quantitative data
analysis is how it works and a few most
popular quantitative analysis models
we'll go through all these details using
a real life example so without any
further audio let's get started with
that
this is alex he is a young engineer who
had just launched a new automobile
business venture
since his startup is new the amount of
production and manufacturing at his
inventory is comparatively lower
the amount of human resources is also
limited hence alex takes all important
decisions about business finance
investments and new project ideas all by
himself
all these important decisions are driven
by following recent market trends alex
looks into the details of current
business advancement that can benefit
the company and follows his gut to
proceed with them
this decision-making strategy is also
known as qualitative analysis
qualitative analysis uses subjective
judgment based on soft or
non-quantifiable data
recently alex made a decision to
introduce a new luxury car despite the
fact that his company is still in its
early stages
this is a complete emotion driven
decision that can even lead to
bankruptcy
nowadays if people are looking to buy a
luxury car they will directly go to the
established brands such as mercedes
tesla or ferrari why would they choose a
brand which is new to the automobile
industry and that does not have any hype
in the industry this makes sense to you
all right
and because of this complete subjective
decision alex went through a substantial
loss however as the production was
comparatively lower alex decided to take
steps to prevent any further loss he
decided to connect with an expert
business intelligence consultant
meet victor he is an experienced
business intelligence consultant he has
work on multiple business ventures to
improve management and financial
strategies considering victor's
experience alex requested victor to
assist him in streamlining all fronts of
his business decisions
victor held a meeting to understand
problems with alex decision-making
process
he understood that all the decisions
made by alex were completely emotion
driven and subjective
victor began explaining to alex where
his decisions went wrong and how he
could have prevented that substantial
loss by conducting a rigorous
quantitative analysis
he highlighted to alex how a study of
previous such ventures could have
prevented this decision to introduce a
new luxury car
since alex was inexperienced with this
business analysis process and its usage
he began questioning victor about
quantitative analysis or how it would
help him enhance his decision-making
process
alex first ask victor what quantitative
analysis is
victor started explaining alex about
quantitative analysis quantitative
analysis is a technique that uses
mathematical and statistical modelling
measurement and thorough research to
understand patterns in an activity to
make future predictions or decisions
this process begins with thorough
research first you'll have to gather
data for the topic that you are trying
to make predictions about
for instance if you are making a
decision about investing in a particular
stock then first you will have to gather
the data of people who have invested in
that stock you will hold an online
survey or gather data resources from
consultancy firms if the data is in the
linguistic format you will convert it
into string of numbers
in the next phase numerical data will go
through computer analysis computers use
advanced statistical and mathematical
sciences to make accurate predictions
the predominant area of investment its
technology here the end result generated
through this process is entirely
objective and virtually immune to
typical pitfalls of human judgment
the main reason why quantitative
analysis has become so widespread in
recent times is that the amount of
information we have these days is
enormous we live in an era of
globalization and digitalization where
new information is generated every
second at a rapidly increasing rate
and it circulates all around the globe
24 by 7. this means the amount of
historical records we have in databases
spread across the world is huge and
because of this information explosion it
becomes increasingly difficult to
separate useful information from the
useless one
this information that is useless one is
also known as noise
and extracting useful information with
human resources and intelligence is not
possible at all we can relate it with
the analogy that there are simply too
many rocks to turn over one by one
and traditional statistical models are
also broken now that is why it is vital
to challenge the conventional wisdom and
work on pure mathematical and
statistical modelling
quantitative analysis exactly allows us
to do that thus moving forward
quantitative analysis holds a great deal
of importance after listening to this
explanation alex became quite interested
in this field of data analysis he asked
victor how does quantitative analysis
works and how he can implement it in his
form
victor started explaining this to alex
with the help of an example
as mentioned earlier the first step of
this analytics process is doing thorough
research let's say you want to assess
customer satisfaction with alex newly
launched luxury automobile to perform
this analysis you'll have to gather data
of luxury car owners across the globe
for that you can use means such as
online or offline survey once you gather
all the data the next phase will be
making sure that collected data is in
numeric format if the state data is not
completely in the numerical format
you'll have to make syntactical changes
such that the meaning of data does not
change
for instance consider this sample data
of a few car owners
the satisfied with service section of
this data is entirely linguistic with
statistical models and most dominantly
computers won't be able to understand
that is why we'll have to convert this
section into numbers
we can do that by converting s and no
into numbers that is 1 and 2. this
conversion won't affect the meaning of
data however it will reduce the
complexity of pursing patterns from this
provided sample
next when data is ready to be parsed and
analyzed we apply statistical modeling
to anticipate the kind of outcome we
want from the gathered data
the quantitative analysis is solely
powered by statistical models and
procedures and basically there are two
branches of statistics that are widely
used in quantitative analysis the first
one is descriptive statistics and the
second one is inferential statistics in
your research or analysis you might only
use descriptive statistics or you might
use mix of both depending on what you
are trying to figure out in other words
depending on your aim or objective of
your research
so what are descriptive and inferential
statistics
well before i explain that we need to
take a quick detour to clarify some
statistical lingo you need to learn two
important words to understand the
difference between descriptive and
inferential statistics those words are
population and sample
let's first discover the term population
in statistics the population is the
entire group of people or animals or
organization or whatever you are
interested in researching
for instance consider the previous
example of assessing satisfaction of
luxury car owners the population in this
case would be the luxury car owners
spread across the geography or globe
however it's extremely unlikely that you
are going to interview or survey every
single luxury automobile owner in the
whole world that's practically
impossible right you can get data of car
owners for only a specific state or
locality
in reality you'll only gain access to a
few hundred or maybe a few thousand
owners using an online survey the
smaller group of accessible people whose
data you actually collect is called your
sample that means in the case of our
service satisfaction example the sample
of hundred car owners or maybe thousand
would be the sample
so to recap the population is entire
data meaning a superset consisting of
whole data and the sample is subset
meaning some portion of that entire data
in other words the population is a whole
cake and the sample is just a slice of
that cake now you might be wondering why
this sample or population thing is
important
well let me tell you the significance of
both these terms by defining descriptive
and inferential statistics the branch
descriptive statistics focuses on
describing the sample while inferential
statistics aims to make predictions
about the entire population based on the
findings within the sample
in other words we use one group of
statistical methods that is descriptive
statistics to investigate the slice of
cake and another group of methods
inferential statistics to draw
conclusion about the entire cake
moving forward we'll discover both these
branches of quantitative analysis in
detail
let's start with descriptive statistics
descriptive statistics serve a simple
but critically important role in data
analysis
the methods involved in this branch of
statistics describe your data set in
another words they help you understand
your sample
this mode of data analysis is completely
concerned about the limited data you
have
it is the beginning phase of any
analysis which you will look into to
visualize and understand your data set
the different methods involved in
descriptive statistics are as follows
the first one is mean then we have mode
and median
next are standard deviation and skewness
we'll look into each one of them one by
one
the first one is mean
this is simply the mathematical average
of a range of numbers nothing too
complicated here
next we have is mode
this is simply the most commonly
repeated number in the data field
following this we have median
this is the midpoint of the range of
numbers when the numbers are all
arranged in an order if the number of
rows in data sample is odd then the
median is right in the middle of the set
if the data set consists even number of
rows the median will be the number
between two middle numbers
fourth statistical method we have is
standard deviation
this method indicates how disperse a
range of numbers is
in other words how close all the data
points of data set are to the mean or
average
in the cases where all data points are
closer to the main will have low
standard deviation value conversely in
cases where numbers are widely spread
from the mean will have high standard
deviation
lastly we have skewness as the name
suggests itself the skewness indicates
how symmetrical a range of numbers is
in other words do they tend to cluster
into a smooth curvy shape in the middle
of graph this curve that we are talking
about is also known as normal or
parametric distribution
if the lobe of the graph tends to the
left or right side then that will be
considered as non-parametric or
non-normal distribution okay are you
feeling bit confused now after listening
to these bunch of definitions
don't worry we'll try to perceive them
with the help of an practical example
on the left hand side we have sample
data set this data set only contains two
fields named as customer number and the
age of customer who have purchased
luxury car from alex company
now on the right hand side we'll compute
descriptive statistics for this data the
first factor we are going to compute is
main
the mean is nothing but the sum of all
data values available in the data set
divided by number of data sample
which is 7 in this case
if we compute this equation the result
will be 60.4
that means the final value will have for
this mean is 60.14
next we'll compute the median
median
is the middle element of given data
points when they are arranged in order
here the number of data values we have
is odd
hence the median will be the number of
terms plus one by two term
this means the median in this sample
will be seven plus one by two
which is fourth sample of our data set
and that is 55
third descriptive statistic method we
have is mode
mode is basically the most frequently
occurring number in data set for example
if you look into our data set 70 has
occurred twice and that is the maximum
number of reoccurrences hence the mode
value for this particular sample will be
70.
following this we have standard
deviation
this parameter incorporates the
distribution of number from the mean
that means we'll have to calculate the
distribution of each data point with
respect to the mean here the formula for
this standard deviation is given as
square root of sigma x minus x bar whole
bracket square divided by n
the x here is the number of data set
x bar means mean whereas n is number of
sample or rows in our data set
if we do the computation we'll get 8.3
as an output this means the resultant
plot for our graph won't converge more
towards the mean
the final descriptive statistic
parameter we have is qns the term
skewness can be calculated by using the
formula given on your screens it is
simply the summation of x minus x bar
whole bracket cube divided by number of
data values into cube of standard
deviation
or you can use simplified formula to
calculate the skewness i am not going to
do this computation here its little task
for all of you guys calculate the
skewness and drop your answers in the
comment box below lets see how many of
us can get this right
moving ahead let's visualize the details
of our data using values that we have
computed
our graph for the data set comprised of
only 7 samples looks something like this
the mean for this graph is 60.14 which
is represented using this dotted line
the median value is 55 which is
precisely at the middle of our graph and
as we can clearly see the more value is
70 as its frequency is higher than any
other data value
the standard deviation for this data set
is also 8.3 due to that the data values
are relatively dispersed in this graph
and about skewness we can say that this
graph is not parametrically distributed
since there is no loop towards the mean
from this practical example you can see
that we have discovered the intricacies
of our data set using descriptive
statistics parameters or methods
however this is a very small data set
having only 7 record so we can't really
read into these statistics too much but
hopefully this example might help you
understand how these statistics work in
the real world also keep in mind that
this is not the complete list of all
possible descriptive statistics methods
the method mentions here are only the
most common ones
so at this point you might be wondering
why do these descriptive parameters
matter well while all these descriptive
statistics are fairly basic they are
important for a few reasons firstly they
help you get both micro and macro view
of your data they help you understand
how overall data seems and how each
parameter can affect the result
secondly they can help you spot the
potential errors in the data for example
if an average is way higher than you
would expect or responses to a question
are highly varied then this can act as
warning sign that you need to double
check your data and lastly these
descriptive statistics help you decide
which inferential statistics method you
can use as those methods depend on the
shape of your data we'll explore this in
the upcoming section so simply put
descriptive statistics are really
important even though statistical
methods are pretty basic many times
beginners rush towards inferential
statistics and then land up with some
very flawed result
so we prefer you guides to start with
and steps and give attention to
descriptive statistics moving ahead
we'll discuss inferential statistics
as i mentioned earlier descriptive
statistics are all about discovering
your sample whereas inferential
statistics aim to make predictions about
the entire population
what kind of predictions you ask well
generally speaking there are two types
of common predictions inferential
statistics make
first one is prediction about difference
between two or more groups for example
differences between weights of groups
and secondly relationship between
variables for example the relationship
between the person's body weight and the
number of hours a week person does a gym
exercises
in more clearer words inferential
statistics when done correctly allow you
to connect the thoughts and make
predictions about what you would expect
to see in the real world population
based on what you have observed in your
sample data this means when you are
working with inferential statistics the
composition of your sample is really
important
if your data is not accurate then your
predictions won't work in real life
endeavors so make sure you do thorough
descriptive analysis before getting into
inferential statistics
there are many different statistical
methods within the inferential
statistical branch and it would be
impossible for us to discuss all of them
in this session hence we'll just have a
look at few most commonly used
inferential statistics method so that
you can have a solid starting point
firstly we'll look at t-test statistical
method
then we'll discover anova and
correlation analysis
finally we'll delve into details of
regression analysis let's begin with
t-test
t-test compares the means of two groups
of data to assess whether they are
different to a statistically significant
extent
in simpler words this method tests if
two groups have significantly different
means standard deviation and skewness
for example if you wish to compare the
mean sugar levels of two groups of
people one that has had breakfast and
the other one that is fasting so to
assess the difference between these two
groups simply looking at the mean is not
enough to draw a conclusion you need to
assess whether the differences are
statistically significant and that's
what t-test allows you to do
next up is anova
anova stands for analysis of variables
this test is similar to the t-test
except for the fact that anova allows
you to compare means between a multiple
number of groups most times more than
two
third statistical method we have is
correlation
this type of statistical analysis
assesses the relation between two
variables
in other words if one variable goes up
then what happens to the other variable
does it go up or down or stay the same
this evaluation is achieved using
correlation
for example consider this plot of height
and weight with the increase in average
height we'll expect the increase in
weight too intuitively but correlation
allows us to measure that scientifically
finally we have regression analysis this
analysis is kind of similar to the
correlation in correlation we are only
interested in assessing the relationship
between variables but here in regression
analysis we go a step further to
understand the cause and effect between
variables in other words we assess if
the movement in one variable can cause
movement in another or do they naturally
move together due to some external
factor this evaluation is entirely
achieved by regression one more thing
you should keep in mind here is that the
correlation between two variables
doesn't necessarily mean that one causes
the other
to make this little more tangible let's
look at an example of correlation here
is a scatter plot demonstrating the
correlation or the relationship between
income and employee happiness score
intuitively we definitely expect some
sort of relation between these two
variables which is there in this scatter
plot in other words if you observe
closely the result tends to cluster
together in a diagonal line from bottom
left to top right the more tightly the
results cluster together in a line or in
any direction the more correlated they
are and hence stronger the relationship
between those two variables become
irrespective of distribution of data
whether it is parametric or
non-parametric descriptive statistics
anyhow draws the inference that is why
it is the most vital pillar of
quantitative analysis
with this extensive explanation alex was
able to understand how quantitative
analysis works and how he can use the
vast data at his disposal to make the
best and profitable decisions he also
decided to hire a team of quantitative
data analysts
