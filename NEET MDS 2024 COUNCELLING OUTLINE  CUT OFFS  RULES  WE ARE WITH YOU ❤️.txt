yeah hi bers very very good evening one
and all okay so exam is done the result
is out and I know there is there is a
mixed feeling including me so it's it's
it's like uh it's I was so emotional
once the result was out so it's okay
it's it's a part and parcel of game
every year uh we have this mixed feeling
like you see good ranks on other side
you see good students ending up with odd
ranks which make emotionally weak both
the student as well as the team or the
mentor who is in close association with
the student will feel bad for it so it's
all partial part and parcel right which
I am experence experiencing this from
past eight years and this is the Ninth
Batch and of course the same feeling
will be there for the next batch too
okay so concluding all these things as
always says I stand on the same word
okay whatever it is okay a rank a number
is going to tell you that what you are
up to okay and first of all a big
congratulations to each and everyone who
feel they got a deserved Rank and it's
LLY it's never the end right we always
bounce back we always come back okay so
I told myself as an best example so I
can give myself as a best example
because I have seen lots and lots of ups
and downs during my preparation phase
which was almost like three attempts
internship followed by first and
followed by second attempt which was
totally different okay so the most
stressful thing that I uncounted is
during my uh result day okay compared to
the uh yesterday's result okay so
keeping these things
aside now we'll be discussing about what
to be done so this video is is
preferably in a flowchart way so how you
need to enter one step to other step how
you need to plan how you need to
organize yourself okay a few important
things I'll be discussing I don't want
to overload this video uh we'll be
having 30 to 40 minutes of uh valid
discussion what you should know uh once
the result is out because uh counseling
is utmost important thing utmost
important thing right because I have
been seeing uh so many
students who got very great ranks at
extraordinary ranks in fact I still
remember uh there is a girl uh in
2019 her rank was 18 her rank was all
India
18 and because of some mishaps in the
counseling process and for the pressure
from the family she was not in a
position to take a seat that is the most
uh uh painful thing that I have seen in
the last N9 years of my experience girl
getting 18th rank 18th rank is not that
easy
and after getting 18th rank not in a
position to pick a proper seat okay and
18th rank was just wasted okay right so
so I I'm very very keen about counseling
so I'm very keen about counseling rather
than helping you during the preparation
phase I feel like helping you during the
counseling is uh the most better or the
best thing that we can do together okay
so chello let's
start uh the first and foremost thing is
three steps for your MDS okay the three
steps for your MDS is first is
preparation preparing well the first one
which is already done the second one
is giving exam
well I see few of you have prepared
extraordinary but during the process of
exam while giving an exam things were
not on your side I know that personally
because I know that you are good student
I know that you are a good student you
work so hard but exam yes exam three
hours is going to determine so giving
exam well so you should be perfect in
those three hours and the third one is
of course the topic of today that is
counseling so you should be perfect in
this Triad so this Triad okay is very
very important and this Triad these
three are very very important for you to
end up with a good college a good
clinical for the rank what you deserve
right okay so now we are done with first
and second steps so now we'll be
discussing about the Third Step
Counseling so the result was out so if
you check out the
counseling okay so
counseling initially okay it's going to
the first uh notification that is going
to come regarding the counseling is
about all India counseling
right the first one is all India
counseling so what all are included in
all India counseling and I hope you guys
know this one is government
colleges Government College
seats so in Government College seats
only 50% of seats are included in all
India okay right so for example a
particular College particular department
is having six seats okay six seats for
example they having six seats so three
seats will be in the state and three
seats will be in the all India so that
is called as 50 percentage of all India
so what what are included is 50% seats
of a particular Department in a
particular
College of a government Dental College
will be included in all India and the
second one is deemed
colleges deemed College seats and I hope
you know what are deemed College
so make a note none of your Andra or
Telangana colleges are deemed colleges
so everything will comes under State
College only state pool only so what
what are the colleges what are the seats
which are included in all India
counseling is one is 50 percentage of
every Department seats in every
government Dental College plus all
deemed College seats Let It Be NRI Cota
seat let it be the counseling seat
whatever seat everything is included in
all India counseling only for example if
you want to enter into manipal or if you
want to enter into K belgam or jss myour
or abetti or if you want to enter into
Savita or manaki whatever it is all
these seats are filled through all India
so all the deemed College seats in the
country will be filled through all India
counseling and all the Government
College seats 50 per of the every
Department Government College seats for
example GDC Hyderabad GDC Mumbai 50% of
GDC Hyderabad proo seats 50% of GDC
Mumbai Endo seats will be filled by all
India counseling only so first
notification that is going to come or
the first counseling that is going to
start most probably is going to be the
all India counseling right so all India
counseling uh regularly occurs in uh
rounds okay so you check out the
rounds that is round
one followed by round two followed by
mop-up
round
right so this is how the all- India
counseling is going to go right so
coming to the ranks okay so you cannot
compare the previous year Merit list or
the previous year ranking list to this
year ranking list very simple logical
because the number of seats in every
Department are going to change from last
year to this year for example if there
are six seeds Okay last year this year
it will be same
for example if there are three seats
because I see most of the colleges are
going to have three seats only okay if
three seats are there so it will be 2
one so one year the state is going to
take two seats all India is going to
take one seat the next year the state is
going to take one seat and the all India
is going to take two seats so it varies
it changes even if you're talking about
State also wherever you see like for
example you see Hyderabad GDC all the
Departments are having three seats so
one year the state is going to have two
seats the next year the state is going
to have one seats the same happens with
GDC Kapa GDC vijaywada okay so most of
the colleges most of the deemed colleges
except few deemed colleges are going to
have three seats only so one year the
number of seats in state will be more
the next year the number of seats in all
India will be more okay clear guys
you're clear till this
point so this is how
this the counseling of the all India is
going to happen and for deemed College
seats okay so you need to pay the
caution deposit in Prior okay so deemed
College seats you have to pay the
caution deposit in Prior for all India
you don't require such things for
Government College seats you don't
require for deemed colleges a payment of
two lakhs has to be done okay before you
start your counseling if you want to
apply for it you have to pay two lakhs
and this two lakhs will be deducted in
your college phe of first year for
example you are not allocated any seat
this fees will be refunded back after
all rounds of counseling three months or
four months after the counseling this
two lakhs will be given back is it clear
very very important people who are
planning to go into all all India deemed
colge should be financially prepared
because most of the deemed colleges very
few colleges have a fees of less than 7
lakhs most of the colleges are going to
have a fees of more than 7 to 8 lakhs 10
lakhs 12 lakhs 13 lakhs 15 lakhs 17
lakhs perom fees are also there for all
India deemed col so this is all about
all India so once you're done with all
India so the next step
is again in this all India cut off rough
cut offs I'm going to tell you so if you
talk about the cut
offs these are rough okay these are
rough cut offs exactly things will not
happen
so for a open
category open category student okay it
will be in the range of 450 to
500 for open category
student for OBC and
ews it will be slightly more so it will
be in the range of 500 to
600 and and for SC category it will be
in the range of, 1500 to 1600 sometimes
it can be slightly more because whenever
the end point like for example like pero
in few colleges or like oral path oral
medicine communi so non- clinicals most
of the people they don't prefer to take
and some in such cases sometimes uh you
you can see an extended over Rank by
which the counseling is going to end
similarly there are few colleges where
the Departments are not good
such a colleges people will will not
prefer to take so in such cases it
sometimes hits more and for SC category
St category so it's going to hit
somewhere around like 2, 2,500
change okay so these are the rough cut
offs of all India so once we are done
with all
India then uh the next part is uh the
state counselings the state
counselings State counseling State
notifications will
start the state individual state every
state is going to release their
notification okay so every state apart
from releasing their notification every
state has a
criteria so you have to fall under that
criteria to be a part of that counseling
for example uh there is a student from
Maharashtra who is born in Maharashtra
who has done BDS from Maharashtra he's
local it so he falls criteria for
example someone who is born in Andra and
has done BDS in Maharashtra or have done
BDS in Karnataka so they fall in a
different criteria so you eligible to
only take such category of particular
seats for example I'm giving an example
uh there is a there is a
student who's born in
tangana and who has done BDS from
Karnataka
so he is not considered
as local in
Telangana he will be considered as NL
means non-local in
Telangana so normally 85% of seats will
be for locates and 15 percentage of
seats will be for non loates so this
fellow is eligible to only these 15
percentage of
seats similarly every state has a
particular criteria of rule rule for
their domicile for the students who have
studied BDS over there or students who
has born over there okay or who are
recently residing over there for past
five years or seven years different
state has different criteria Rule and
this criteria rule will be given in the
notification okay so what are included
in state counseling State counseling is
in is going to include 50 percentage of
state government Dental
College seats so we have already
discussed 50% will be going for all
India so the left or 50 will be going
for the State Pool which will be filled
by the state students only okay State
students only for
example every state for example you are
from
Telangana through State counseling all
the state all the seats of Telangana
State counseling will be taken by
Telangana students only Maharashtra
student cannot come and apply here
similarly State seats of Maharashtra
will be occupied by Maharashtra only
sometimes NL will be there NL will be
there means for example Telangana LL one
government Dental College seat can be
there that will be filled either he
should have domicile means born in
Telangana or either she has to do BDS
from Telangana then only they're
eligible to take for example a
Maharashtra student who is not in born
in Telangana who's not born
in who's not done BS from Telangana
cannot take a government Dental College
state state W seat through the
counceling okay so state government
seats will be taken only by the state
students so the next one next things are
included which are included in the state
is all private college
seats all private college seats
except deemed colleges deemed colleges
are also private colleges the deemed
colleges counseling is already done in
all India so deemed colleges are not
going to be part of the state Council
okay right for example you see
Maharashtra Maharashtra has both private
colleges and deemed colleges so deemed
colleges will be filled through all
India whereas private colleges will be
filled through MHC counseling similarly
K Karnataka Karnataka has State
counseling as well as deemed as well as
private Tamil Nadu is having deemed
private Kerala is having deemed and
private Andra is having only private
colleges tangana is having only private
colleges orisa is having both private as
well as de so you see most of the most
most of the most of the deemed colleges
are in South Zone they are mostly in
Karnataka Tamil Nadu has more number of
deem colleges when compared to the rest
of the
states okay
and in the private college seat again in
the private college seat there are
different types of seats and this again
varies from state to state okay so in
simple words most of the mentors they
are going to keep it as a category
seat bcat
seat and ccat seat what is this a cat
seat a cat seat is of less
fees bcat seat is of moderate
fees ccat seat is for high fees
preferably these are NRA seats or
management quarter
seats
clear this a cat bcat ccat
classification varies from University to
University for example you take
uh Karnataka you're going to have KET
seat which is of less fees then you are
going to have ComEd Cas seat then you
are going to have NRI or management
couret so it varies okay from state to
state it varies so during their
notification they're going to clearly
tell how many seats are there which
category is going to have how many seats
what is the fees of the seats and
everything they're going to clearly
mention clear till this point about the
state
counseling
I need your response on the box 400 odd
students so please do respond so that
I'll go to the next step okay now the
question is can I take I am I am from a
particular State can I take a private
college seat in other state that's a
very common question right for
example uh a Maharashtra student is
there a Maharashtra student is there
want to take seat in Andra
is it possible or
not okay is it my answer is s he can
take but he cannot
take he cannot take an a category seat a
category seat is only for
locals is only for locals or non-locals
either they have to they should have
domicile previously in Telangana or
Andra B category seat you can take so B
category seat or a c category seat B
category seat or a c category seat a
Maharashtra student can take in Andra
similarly okay there are few States for
example
Karnataka okay or Maharashtra okay so
here you're going to have again a
category B category C category similar
like means low fees moderate fees High
fees so if an Andra student want to take
take a seat in Karnataka or Maharashtra
he's eligible to take only moderate fees
as well as high fees he cannot take low
fees most of the states their low fee
seats will be occupied by the local AIDS
will be occupied by the state students
only so all the state government College
seats and all the private college seats
except deemed of a category will be 99%
of seats will be occupied by the locales
whereas B category
seats and C category seats anyone can
take is it clear this is very very
important point to be noted okay because
every year I see students coming and
asking me sir I want to take in maharash
I want to take here I want to take there
gdcs are more there in state Counseling
of Maharashtra I'll go and participate
there no you should have you should you
should cross that criteria criteria
eligibility criteria is there for
example I still remember jamu and
Kashmir student was asking me I will
take in Telangana State all ranks are
very low I'll take in Telangana State no
you are not eligible to take Telangana
State counseling seats are only for
Telangana students Telangana a category
seats are only for Telangana students
15% of seats yes Andra people can take
okay or 15% of seats of telengana uh the
other states like people who are born
here studied there or people who are
born somewhere studied here if you have
some link to Telangana okay and
documents are there then you can you are
eligible for that okay clear CH it's
clear can I go to the next part in the
flow
chart yes okay so what is going to
happen is similarly to all India
counseling okay every state counseling
most of the state counselings there are
few states with abnormal counseling
patterns which I'm not going to talk as
of now so most of the States state
counseling links okay will have a
category that I told you right a uh B
and C categories again we'll have round
one round two and mop up
round rules and regulations for each
state and everything they are going to
vary slightly the there is some
variations basing upon which we'll be
discussing that individually state wise
I'm going to take some classes regarding
the options filling regarding the
counseling patterns what is this and
what is that we'll try to help you out
so there is nothing to worry about
that okay right so this is all about
counselings that you have to make a
note okay right
uh any specific doubts you
have there is one question stifen in the
deemed colleges stifen in the deemed
colleges varies from college to college
okay that will available either on the
college website or that will be
available either on the nbe website okay
so normally uh once you are planning for
all deemed College counseling so what
you H what you have to plan how you have
to plan is you have to keep uh one is
budget budget into consideration for
example my budget is 8 lakhs per anom is
my budget so how you need to calculate
this 8 lakhs per anom is so take the a
better approach the college directly
either on the phone because websites
will not be properly updated and you you
will get a wrong information regarding
the fees as well as typh because tyen
every two to three years and fees every
two to three years it varies for example
there is one Coles where the colle Fe is
10
lakhs but SI and here is
25,000 per month so how you need to
calculate is 25 into 12 so 25 into 12 is
three lakhs
College fees is 10
lakhs 25 into 12 is 3 lakhs so the net
College fees is 7
lakhs okay so now it is in my budget my
budget is 8 lakhs perom so it is in my
budget so you have to calculate the
net okay so total fees minus the fees of
the minus the stifen you are getting so
you need to calculate the net fees so
this is how you need to prepare a list
of colleges when you're planning to go
for deemed colleges options and it
should be within the budget so budget
please try to discuss with your parents
and uh you try to plan accordingly uh
the things because it has time because
all India counseling notification
everything should come out then we'll
discuss about this clearly but just I'm
giving a rough
idea
okay right
so so other important
aspect okay so other important aspect is
uh so we have already discussed about
the rough cut offs of all India so
coming to the rough cut offs of the
state okay so whenever the state
notification is
out so State notification is out and now
you are applying for the state so all
all the students of your state are
applying for the state notification so
they got some 600
applications just just 600
applications so now they are going to
prepare a
list so they're going to prepare a list
according to your neat ranks and they
are going to give state
rank and these people are going to call
you for certificate verification for
example someone has app
for for Telangana or for example they
have applied for Maharashtra so they're
going to check your certificates whether
it is real or not I have applied for SC
category but I am OC I applied for SC so
they're going to check all this cost
certificates income certificates ews you
have ews certificates everything they're
going to check so once the certificate
verification is done for example there
are some 20 people who are not able to
reach the criteria so their names will
be removed and the final 580 Merit list
will be
given so along with this Merit list
along with the release of the Merit list
okay they are going to release something
called as seat
matrics what is the seat Matrix in a
particular College in a particular
Department how many seats are allocated
to OC how many seats are allocated to SC
how many seats are allocated to OBC how
many seats are allocated to St they are
going to give a seat Matrix so basing
upon the seat Matrix for example you're
an open category for example very simple
I'm telling you there is one call as
M&R M&R has
Endo okay so one student has got a very
good rank decided to take M&R Endo
because she she or he stays very near to
the college so parents are willing to
ask her to pick the same college so
she's an open category student she
decided to take M&R Endo for example M&R
Endo is having roughly three seats one
seat is given for St one seat is given
for SC and one seat is given for
OBC here you don't have an OC seat you
cannot take a seat okay so you need to
keep options according to seat Matrix so
once the seat Matrix is out now you need
to for example I'm an sc student so what
I'm going to do I'm going to prepare the
list of of
seats in SC
category of all colleges now I'm going
to keep my priority and I'm going to
upload that as an options for example uh
I want to do surgery SVS I want to do
SVS surgery or for example I want to do
kgmc LNO
surgery okay I got a very good rank but
even after getting a good rank there
should be a seat over there in your
category for you to apply so it's always
depends upon the seat matx
clear so similarly your rank in the
Merit list of your state is important
okay and similarly your category rank in
the Merit list of state is important and
upon which the seat Matrix the number of
seats in your category are important so
all these things will tell you exactly
which department you are going to get
over a period of time not immediately we
can roughly tell that you will get a
clinical you'll get a good clinical you
will get a government dental college
that rough opinion we can give exactly
what colle is what department no one can
tell okay
clear okay right okay so coming to the
uh rough rough calculations like uh if
your rank is I mean exceptions or few
States maybe exceptions where the
competition is very low but if your rank
is somewhere around like 2,
2,500 you will get a decent a category
seat in your particular State as
Karnataka is having more seats or
Maharashtra is having more seats
slightly you may have a better option in
Karnataka and Maharashtra compared to
other states okay so normally 2000 2000
2 2,500 you will get a good clinical
seat in your particular state where the
number of colleges are decent sometimes
it may go high okay nonclinical will
definitely go high because there is a
less demand for the nonclinical
Departments as of now in the market okay
right so that is one important and
coming to category wise so because
different states are going to have
different reservation categories
Maharashtra reservation category is
different Karnataka reservation category
is different Andra a reservation
category is different so basing upon the
seat Matrix and if you have reservation
that is going to slightly vary for
example in open category in a in most of
the states 2,000 you will get a good
clinical for a OBC it may raise to
somewhere around like 2,500 sometimes
it's going to hit 3,000 there are few
categories where the competition will be
low such categories will have a better
cut offs and similarly for an sc you you
have a better cut off like 5,000 also
you're going to get a good clinical okay
St still more okay for example you you
are having a physically handicapped
certificate okay the compettition will
be very very minimal like whatever seat
you have you will get it so there's very
minimal competition so you hardly have
two to three or three to four people who
are going to give such
category a OBC student is eligible for
open Cate anyone is eligible for open
category okay right so government Dental
College cut offs are going to be like as
we already discussed that all India
cutoffs are going to be somewhere around
like 500 odd so government col state
government College cut offs will be
slightly more like 5 600 700 800
sometimes it hits thousand also whenever
the competion of ranks in that
particular state is minimal
okay okay so these are the main things
which I feel like uh uh I I have to
discuss with you now the strategy
flowchart okay the strategy
flowchart uh make sure you try to
discuss with your Mentor because the
most important thing for the preparation
is a quick start a quick restart okay
right so so the rank is
out the first and foremost thing that
you need to decide
is for example you're not you're not
falling under the category of gdcs okay
so what is the first and foremost thing
that you have to decide is sit with your
parents and let's know the financial
limitations are they ready for a
category seat are they ready for a
category so so a b c okay so first check
with your parents they're ready till
what seat they're ready till a category
or they're ready till B category or
they're ready till c category Okay so
so just a
second so the first option
is one and two is to
proceed or is to
repeat so you yourself have something in
your mind okay so my preparation was not
up to Mark during this particular year
or I'm an intern okay definitely I'll
repeat so first decide whether you want
to proceed or whether you want to repeat
okay so if you want to
repeat no discussion start immediately
this the biggest thing biggest vacuum in
most of the students is most of the
students except few States okay the
students they repeat the exam very fast
okay they start their preparation
immediately very fast but there are few
States I don't want to mention or
discuss the state names they wait and
watch I don't know what is the point of
waiting and watching waiting and
watching till all India counseling State
counseling one first round second round
third round by the time the counselings
are over it is going to hit in the month
of October or November okay so October
November your preparation will be three
to four months and again you are going
to end up with the same rank so first
and foremost suggestion is you want to
enter into counseling go with the
counseling flowchart if you don't want
to enter the counseling want to repeat
the exam start
immediately okay now want to proceed
with the counseling so check out whether
you you're eligible to get a government
seat or not don't assume that your rank
is 300 3,000 or 4,000 don't assume some
magic is going to happen and you are
going to get allocated to a government
seat let's try there's nothing to try
3,000 you'll never get a GDC so there's
nothing to try over here nothing to wait
and watch over here if you're eligible
to government okay plan accordingly if
not next the comes is private private is
all about
money so money the most important thing
the most important person to give you
money is parents so sit with the
parents and know their financial
limitations how much they're planning to
spend on your PG so then you decide a b
c for example the parents may tell that
I'm ready till B category so you don't
have C category option you have only A
and B the parents SK turn only a
category I can support B category I
cannot so now your search should be a
category so what are what are the
chances for an a category for my rank
are there good chances good chances
means 100%
is are there moderate chances means you
will get but not sure whether you're
going to get good clinical or
non-clinical or bad
clinical low low is you may get a
non-clinical or you may not get so this
you need to discuss personally with the
mentor talk with the mentor discuss with
the mentor and get an idea okay so for
example if it's 100% is ask your parents
to get prepared with the financial
things and you try to work on your
future of Dentistry for example if it is
a if it is a moderate chances are there
but in this moderate chances you are not
sure whether to repeat the
exam whether to retake the exam or
whether to proceed with the counseling
so in such cases you start
preparation don't wait start preparation
and go with the
counseling preparation and counseling
has to be done if it is very low going
for counseling is your option but you
need to start your preparation
immediately for example your B category
is open chances will be more C categor
is open you need to approach the
colleges for NRI seats and management
qua seats you need to immediately
approach the college because in cities
in good clinical departments you have
high chance
answers I'm not
audible okay right right clear so this
root map is very very important because
I am I'm personally seeing uh lots of
students in the last few
years uh
the guidance is very very important for
the counseling so last year I still
remember there is a guy who has paid
25,000 for a counselor he told he will
guide SRI countar is busy he's very
close to me he has kept he paid 25,000
and kept a counselor and what happened
finally his rank is 1200 and he has a
very good
reservation this counselor fellow told
that you will get a Paka this seat in
this colus who only that seat uh from
that college and finally this fellow did
not get and he has repeated the exam
most unfortunate thing crying it's
horrible crime very bad it's very bad so
please don't trust any sort of
counselors anyone on the websites or on
the mails or any references the best
counselor is your Mentor you can ping me
I'm ready to help you because I don't
want to see you crying feeling bad after
getting a good rank okay if you don't
get a good rank it's okay it's okay
compromised it's okay even after getting
good rank if someone is calling me on
the day of the allotment and crying that
I did not get a seat why you did not get
a seat the story is different it is
going to be so horrible for you as well
as for me being with you guiding you
preparing you training you at the end of
the day getting a good Rank and not
getting a good seat and being cheated by
someone by simply a reference or by an
online thing it's going to hurt you and
me so I'll help you okay don't worry
about me I'll help only you okay I
already got so many
calls uh from friends friends friends of
you because I was I was getting so many
calls and I was talking to them and
after after meanwhile I asked you what
is your name your your phone number is
not saved on my number that she's
telling one of my friend friend friends
of you has given your contact because
you are very good in guiding for
counseling yes I'm good I'm yes I'll
help you that's okay I can help you but
the thing is I should help you guys
first okay you are part of conquer so
first help should be you okay without
helping you how can I
help everyone is student okay I'm I'm
very diplomatic everyone is student but
I should my first help should be you
okay then I'll try to help others
there's no point of helping without
helping you and helping others that is
pointless okay I'm not uh Kaa or
something who who has to help every
individual on the media okay
right clear clear
clear so flowchart is important uh and
and one more suggestion is I see the not
all like few students
uh so they give they give neat they may
end up with 5,000 or 6,000 rank they
know that their preparation was not up
to mark
means their preparation maybe post
internship two to three months or 3 to
four months
preparation again immediately bounce
back they give
in no the point here is you should be
very clear if you feel your preparation
is good go for in nothing
wrong if you feel your preparation is
not up to Mark then planning to crack in
Reading superficially for two more
months because you read superficially
need for three months and got some 5,000
or 10 5,000 or 6,000 rank again you are
reading superficially for two more
months for in C okay so this is going to
reduce the net preparation phase for the
upcoming neat examination so don't go
for superficial readings okay so
whenever you're planning to go ahead
don't ever go for The Superficial
readings okay make sure you feel like
you're are good go for I nothing wrong
if you feel you're not up to Mark then
plan for November in don't jump for May
because May is going to compromise your
preparation by two months okay you're
already good good yes give May if you
feel you're not good plan for November
in because November in you're going to
have s to eight months of preparation
time May you're going to have two months
of preparation time followed by from May
to November again you are going to have
six months of preparation time in six
months of preparation time you cannot
get that sound Reading part okay few of
you can get but most of you may not
reach that sound Reading part again
after November inct you're going to have
two to three months of preparation phase
and again your neat exam will be there
so please do sit plan with your mentor
and plan accordingly and proceed okay
right yeah that's what that is the main
thing Revis cut offs will be uh
announced after uh all India second
round of
counseling B category cut offs varies
from state to
state within the Jone of example
Telangana within the zone of city of
Hyderabad cut offs will be cut offs of B

magana you talk about mamata the cut
offs will be more and similarly
non-clinical peros cut offs will be more
Endo will be finished
fast this recorded version will be there
it is not a quick revision class to

questions should be on WhatsApp and

calls no cut offs for deemed colleges
how many will have 15 lakhs for example
you're talking about
Savita 17 lakhs is the fees per anom 17
17 17 so it's going to cross 50 how many

it it basing upon the people in front of

doile and all these things you try to
check out uh from your local University
website regarding the eligibility
criteria criterias varies from state to
state all these things are personal
let's let's talk
personally no I cannot cut off
percentages and everything are not in my
hand okay so there's no prediction or
expectation for
that all India and state counseling will
not be simultaneous first all India
counseling round one will start then
after round one allocation and Reporting
the state counselings few of the state
counselings are going to release so
State coun all India counseling round

you need to apply for every

productive talk at least few of your
questions the questions in your mind
were cleared you have some root Maps now
what is this and what is that and uh
we'll again meet in the few more days uh
to have some more discussion regarding
the Departments and everything okay take
some time okay take some time you try to
explore don't ask me questions like how
I used to ask in your WhatsApp activity
highest length is for largest crown is
for okay so yeah you you you try to
search uh explore the things regarding
the Departments uh regarding the
colleges okay so which college is good
and everything I'm going to give you
some suggestions uh that is basing upon
my old students in that particular
College are basing upon the contacts I
have in that particular college or
basing upon my interactions I regularly
go for interactions to so many colleges
where I meet my old students I'll talk
with them at some point so that is my
suggestions okay but when you decided to
be a part of something it's better you
go uh you go and find out the find find
out the callus okay find out the call
you try to talk with the senior get some
contacts in this process I'm going to
help you okay my suggestion yes of
course it's good if you don't have any
other option but you try to explore
because this is a process of two to
three months or sometimes like private
college it goes to four months okay this
going to take four months 4 into 3 30 is
100 days plus process so you have a very
decent time so let's explore something
about Dentistry branches and the
colleges can someone buy a seat if they
don't qualify no they cannot buy
qualifying is mandatory to buy a seat
that is the main Moto of conducting a
eat exam neat exam is to qualify you
need to qualify to buy a management
quarter seat or let it be you want to
buy an you want to get into NRI seat or
management quarter SE or any sort of
seat so make sure you should
qualify if you are financially strong
deemed colleges are definitely best
deemed colleges are something which
which you are paying more when you're
paying more you get more you get best
equipment for example you say higher
paid college is Savita ranking one
college okay and similarly you have all
equipments you have microscopes over
there you have lasers over there have
everything over there so it is just like
reciprocation if you're financially
strong you can think about deed colge
there is nothing
wrong we'll discuss yeah let's the let's
let's the state notifications has to
come why you are going first all India
will start okay relax so much of time is
there just relax
okay so people who has missed this video
please try to go back maybe we'll try to
upload it today or by tomorrow morning
you uh try to check it off yes
qualification is mandatory for a deemed
College also for any college any seat
you want to join MDS you have to qualify
neat MDS 2024 examination at any
cost okay done uh bye take care
any any any things in your mind which
can be answerable uh will be we'll be

to 20 calls per day not more than that

continuously talking classes on phone
okay so everything is I'm also having
some issues with myself so I'll
accommodate 15 to 20 calls per day in
the next five days and I'll try to clear
most of your doubts personally on phone
parents are also calling so we need to
talk with parents right I can for you I
can tell something I'll call you after
when a parent is calling
we we we have that culture and respect
right so we need to answer them their
questions very tricky controversial
questions I need to answer everything
okay I'll try to help you okay time is
there you try to explore if you're
planning to join private colus uh inform
your parents that they have to be
prepared financially economically money
and everything should be ready because
once you allocated in a particular
College within 2 to 3 days or 3 to four
days you have to go and pay the fees or
else your seat will be released this is
very very important let it be a category
Let It Be B category for example you
deemed callers you'll get two to three
days or three to four days time you need
to go over there pay the fees lock the
seat or else the seat will be released
so Financial things are very very
important if you're planning to join in
the private colleges okay right uh take
care bye-bye see you we'll meet you
