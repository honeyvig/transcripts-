i realized quite early in my career that
to excel i need to upskilled regularly
and since then i've been doing
certifications to support my current job
roles

and due to that i got a
job in a company with a salary hike

practitioner certification
and my future plan is to prepare for it
master certification
i've achieved so far 16 certifications
which include msp foundation pmp article
4 managing professional and iso ic 20
000 practitioner to name a few to pursue
itil certifications i needed a blend of
instructor-based and self-paced learning
i did my research and found out that
simplylearn was providing a similar
model another added advantage was
simplylearn provided access to the
course content even after course
completion and i could revise it before
my final exam
i took two courses from simply learn
ikel4 mpt and msp my learning experience
was very good as simply learn offers
easy to understand material with courses
after every module and practice exams to
check your knowledge instructor word
certified and knowledgeable the
trainings were well paced with
sufficient time and i also enjoyed the
communication with the instructors
the certifications helped me to switch
to a new job with a salary hike

professionals in the market in this part
of the world

knowledge certifications and experience
which i gained by applying these skills
and certifications certifications have
helped me get a lot of confidence and
they gave me the drive wish i had in my
career
