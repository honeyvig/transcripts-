yes higher once I hope you guys are
eagerly waiting for this video and
definitely this video is going to get up
your preparation a lot because I think
we are left over with hardly 100 more
days for your final exam for your final
and ok there's an end point should end
with some sort of success right so for
this these are the few issues that the
students are frequently asking like once
we are done with this weekend
examination this course was not that
great but they're good enough to get
into JD she's unhappy for that but there
are many many pins today for me in
personal regarding the few issues and I
want to list out these issues as the
following topics one is not able to
manage the time particularly with the
interns and people who are working in
the clinic for the part-time and third
category are the housewives who are
society preparation of trail long lapse
so these are the common issues regarding
the time management and second one is
that many category of people who are not
able to increase this course they're
they're at a one-point 130 to 140 or 150
to 170 or 180 but even after repeated
revisions of repeated hard work they're
not able to increase this course apart
from that they're making many many sort
of silly mistakes which are a regular
direct peaks from the gentle pulse or
the discussion but even then after sort
of revision they are not able to rectify
this ceiling mistakes or as an issue and
third category is stress management
stress is outings it's like like even if
you see the proper of today's session of
or the top five all these talks I has a
complaint of stress they're not able to
manage their stress so I just want to
give a brief ideology first of all and
how to overcome this the second part
okay so it's just going to be a
correlation things
just please try to because all of these
are out of experience in particular
interacting with many many students how
they overcome so is this going to be a
solution you can accept it and if you
practice it and it's going to be
solution for you okay so we'll go we
start the things first of all the issue
with the time management so for a time -
- first of all you need to have time in
your hand because again just give a
vague statement regarding the time is
like anything in world can be reversible
except the time okay even if you die up
to a certain level the CPR can be done
and you can you can come back that as
time once it is lost it is irreversible
so don't ever waste your time so please
try to give your time okay we are done
with more than logically if you take the
time into consideration we are done with
more than 65 to 70 percentage of time of
preparation was already done right you
are left or with some hard hundred days
so I want you guys to give your best
time for these hundred days
and people the regular question like how
many of us I have to study
getting to achieve easy there's a bad
question actually how much time you can
do you just give it like I can give
eight hours go go ahead housewife can
Mac give eight hours go ahead I can show
you there are many many houses who used
to study to 6 to 8 hours with a
concentration with good concentration
end up with duties right now in GDS is
for obvious conquer so I can give 8
hours go ahead I can give car numbers go
ahead I can give 14 hours by quitting
the internship go ahead there many many
I can show you there are many interns
interns last year who started the
preparation the last three or four
months used to sit for 10 to 14 hours
and right now they're in GDS I can show
them if you want I can have it I can
have an interaction with them so it has
happened and it's going to happen again
if you do that so it's all about how you
provide time to yourselves and how
effectively you can use the time the
second thing so for this I have a
Technic like
as as if you go through the need
examination but regular need examination
it has a different pattern of
preparation so if you compare the last
last year patterns like if you compare
with ABC the pattern of preparation is
going to be different only they are PC
if you compare with the aims that's a
different pattern of preparation if you
compare with PGA different straight
level examinations which are used to be
done previously
the pattern of preparation is totally
different and you need it is completely
different in the way preparation you
need a multi-directional preparation
means you need to balance both the
clinicals on the mountain equal
everybody can bank some something better
than the clinical so you have to be more
accurate and how to be more you should
show more accuracy in the nor finical
part rather than mechanical but because
I hope you guys are very trained in the
pinnacle session so that you can give a
haptic competition the clinical part now
you need to move to a non-clinical
direction to get the best out of this
meeting so for this I have a strategy is
is all examples I can give some sort of
example so if you take 14 thousand into
consideration cycle divided your day for
example this is this is one however
should you so you may go for a 15 hours
should not mean you may go for a 10 hour
shooting so accordingly you divide the
dates into three or four parts basing
upon your convenience so this I have
divided like I have 12 hours of
preparation time and how what are the
things I have to do I have categorize
them and I have divided them in such a
way so now given three of us are given
three hours three hours two hours and
one oh this is a 12 hour showed you so
three hours first three hours are
inclined to go for the present subject
said water water it viscous on right no
for example right now we're going to
general path so I want to cover general
back task of today so the next three
hours I want to cover 104 cons revision
and 100 hour in the revision I want to
do it today excess so next thing I want
again you go for the presence of the
pathology continuation followed by the
two of us I want to cover a few topics
of pharmacology so last one hour like
whenever you feel bored try to open
power books and try to do that so this
is how you need to plan you need to
divide the day for example you can
clearly observe that I have concentrated
on consonant others the clinical part
and non-clinical part so present subject
is you know the presence of it right now
is going in and not the initial part
right
so whenever a non-clinical is going in
the present subject try to give more
attention to the ending along other side
whenever a clinical is going on the
present subject give attention to the
mountain it's also that you can
balancing the non-clinical in the
clinical part so I want you guys to keep
a separate time whether it is one one
and half hour for the pipe ebooks
because pp books are a condensed form it
you can if you if you should take into
consideration of these 5 pv books
they're going to cover a part of the
editors they're going to cover the part
of dental pulse they're going to cover
all high side textbook oriented things
it condensed way so if you learn 10
pages of PP that is equal to more than
50 or 60 pages of dental pulse so I want
you guys to keep much of your time to
power play books because powerful books
are prepared in a way that majority of
the neat quotients are covered and we
claim myself doesn't need special topics
are covered in between so I want you
guys to spend in such ever so you divide
the day into four or five parts
according to your convenience and give
half of the day to the present subject
and half of the day to the left so the
Bartlett if it is called clinical now go
for the non vehicle if it's going
non-lethal nah go for the clinical so
there are many people thinking inside we
are late to the test series and we are
not completed this topic we're not
complete let's talk again
you like if you're planning to goes with
one observation give six to eight hours
for the present subject and I've stored
four hours for the subject which you are
shalt not cover for the subjective you
need revision on people who are already
done you can keep it as accumulator
parts you can keep three hours for the
present subject three hours for the next
subject and these three hours you can
keep
accumulator part and you can the
powerbase so the strategy of preparation
you can start it then you can start the
things like this one I have mentioned
once you're done with this like next
ones you can give more the sort of time
like three hours or four hours for the
practice session like you need to
practice more m0 so simultaneously read
synopsis real clinical read non-clinical
read memory web stuff rebound play books
and simultaneously practice whenever you
feel like you're bored so there's a sort
of stress relieving pattern also like
keep on changing the book don't keep one
book assigned like if you feel bored and
if you feel some shredded with general
back open something new open something
which you like like I love a useful or
pedo like I said finish Peter in just
matter of one hour hold with the
synopsis and unsafe use it whenever I'm
frustrated with this pharmacology or not
or biochemistry like I used to open
Twitter logistic I just used to turn the
pages very fast within ten words like
once and done with the Peter in ten or
fifteen which I used to get lots of
confidence like with that confidence
again I go back to the Brisbane circuit
and I go right again if you get
frustrated to something do something
don't waste and do some excuse do
something that is necessary and
important for examination at least for
these holidays I'm not asking you to
continue it throughout the life I'm
asking you for these holidays because
these holidays are going to decide your
40s
so this is one issue where you need to
focus on and one more is revision
revision many people are aligning this
I'm very very sorry for this you need to
focus and give sort of attention for the
revision in fact there is a rule for the
revision that is actually the
70/30 rule 70/30 rule is like once you
are at end of the separation once you
are going to the second or third round
of revision for the preparation you need
to use 70 percentage of attention to the
revision and
t % is you need to go for the new things
so I want you guys to do more more more
more importance to the provision rather
than reading the new stuff people who
are reading for the second time st.
searched provisions would be 70% is 30%
is try to learn Newton's ok this is one
of the important aspects that you have
to you can see the growth ok you can see
the growth right you can see the growth
and the basic thing is like is almost
same that is the confidence soil that is
giving you the support to grow is a
confidence and whatever we are adding
the ingredients like the things that are
necessary for the plant to grow the
water or or the manure or the windows
that are present are react but the basic
thing that gives support to stand is
confidence so many of us we are lagging
in the confidence levels that isn't bad
that parish we should never do that
because the only person that you can
trust forever is you if you are not
confident and also in yourself there is
no point like I can give an example like
your friend your best friend he has lots
of confidence on your ligament rocket
take myself as an example one student
who's a cop of it I definitely I told
like she is going to get and yeah you
are going to end up with GDC for sure I
used to tell like this but I have
confidence on you right so you need to
carry the same confidence because you
are the one like you yourself if you
tell like an epochal or a division then
who is going to support you is going to
support it you should never tell that
like I'm unfit for this I can't do this
I'm not able to do this don't tell
yourself because the few things that are
going to happen if you tell yes there is
a few things that can happen
please please don't I will compromise in
what you want whatever you want you
think in a positive
this I want to beat this I want to be in
this colors I want this department
I should have my life in such Evan don't
compromise because at least you your
molecules around you will accept and we
do and we'll help you whatever you want
that's that's what that is the nature
that's the positiveness that's a
positive molecules if you speak positive
the molecules will move around positive
and things will definitely happen one
day
if you speak negative even if you're
working hard and you speak negative
negative is going to happen so don't
ever have negative thoughts always be
positive move positive so that's what
the confidence is left I will do this I
can do this and make this alpha up
so whatever we are doing we are doing in
a place where Congress you can just
trust me this is what happened with the
last pass this is what happened with the
last last lash and I trust you that we
are going to make a decent successful
result at the end definitely we are
going to have many GD sees many colorful
successful results on Jan 2018 s for
sure but the factor we are confident the
better we can tackle things the better
we can tackle the life so I want you
guys to be more confident like the
support for this plant is the soil right
that is the confidence and that all
things you are adding few things I am
adding few things a team and team is are
infusing your friends are going to add
few things your parents are going to
help you in few things so all these
things make you self grow into a tree
and that's what the success we all want
right now so please focus on revision
and you should be confident always in
these hundred days yes I will make this
yes I can do this so this sort of things
on how to hear no sir I am NOT able to
make this and not sure I can't do this
I'm not able to manage them no negatives
never never don't ever talk negative
word with me I'm not going to accept any
negative sense or any negative messages
from yourself
think positive sign I'm trying to do
this but there are few things which are
dragging me off give me some sort of
energy give me some sort of positiveness
come on let's be positive positive
positive it it's going to make it just
people start throwing more people they
prove things negative to you just catch
two negatives make it positives or them
back so this is what an attitude of a
conquer student should be forever this
is the one that's going to make you to
stand in this world this is one that's
going to change your life be positive
others whatever the situation may be
whatever the things maybe that's what
happened because I am getting lots of
messages like issue with my
grandfather's health issue with my
grandmother says the issue with my
father self
phew phew there lots of things happen
like that that things happened a few few
students I mean few of my students they
have suffered from very dear very
doubtful diseases Phil's friends they
met with a major accidents suffered a
lot come back and lost lost things
happen last year a lot of things are
having right now so everything at any
point of life anything can happen but we
should be ready for that we should be
ready for that yes something has
happened accepted talk pull of the
ambience concur last year and base
concur Monisha she met with an accident
once the Eames is done she met with an
accident
similarly the strong forces the ambra
and ten hundred often Pratibha which
take discussions she met with an
accident of brains and she was with the
mythic action and she has prepared for
one one a tough month for the night
examined she stood at 55 and in all
India I first announcer during a vitamin
GDC same happens with so many so many
few one of the interns you Mexican
Jackson invited was preparing he was two
months on the bed benefit excited
preparation like no he's in GDC it's
going to happen now now today I've got
three or four calls to people they met
with an accident one big one person two
persons one one grandfather's expired
one father expired one grandmother and
very serious condition I see because it
happens every year
it happens because we have not kids for
25 definitely our parents are going to
be in and around 60 plus grandparents
are going to be near 80 plus so things
will happen because life experience is
around 65 to 70 so things will happen
and you should accept that that's what
happened while I was preparing my first
batch I still remember the doctor Keith
right now Jean she's in gdt Hyderabad of
the department two months before the
examination her father expired but guys
please make a note if your how not get
through the examination because of this
issue your lifelong tag is like anybody
can come and ask you like why you know
not down and be is like I have prepared
well but during the examination my
father or my mother or some sort of
health issues in the home as this does
my preparation and that's the reason by
how not done and is so this is an ad D
attic reason that you can do because
then they feel like you should be happy
they seem like they want your success so
they should not be reason behind your
failure or behind you to be like please
think of this like you need to overcome
I'm not asking like emotionally you
should be I mean it's a rule but
actually but it's true because you have
to start the cycle again from the day
one that's just a very bad move yet take
a break of one bacon the brain and heart
should accept it once you're done with
this you need to move ahead so that's
what whatever it is like I can still
remember there are people used to cry
that people used to ping me at all times
and I was not in a position to help them
but I can just motivate them with my
it's like a new solutions because I'm
one of the person who has suffered
suffered a lot during my preparation
okay how major health issues with my
brother followed by a major and my
father by I was preparing so if you need
to overcome it you need a welcome I
still remember the last year that three
or four students were very very close to
me they they have so many issues in
personal there are so many issues with
the families and everything that but at
the end like once you're successful
these issues are going to be the
motivational like right now I'm talking
about 30 but - I'm talking about monisha
like I was talking about many many many
people I felt happy because they they're
successful now issues they have faced
like one girl I shop at two months
before the examination her doctor was
suffering from pain working like a major
it was like a one-year treat how to
manage the one-year kid was severely ill
in the hospital and on the other side
preparing for examination which is a
dream of her if it is not if not now it
is never suffered like that at the time
10 gold right no she's in she's in a
good clinical department in one revered
chorus that's the motivation story for
us that's the motivation for mindful
quicksand-like how these mothers are
able to manage the things like there are
many many mothers like a chief our last
year mother of two kids a lap of after
five years she banged the candle on 25
and for a 79 inch and one right now inch
she's in GDC Peter last year Dracena
right 123 yards or India right now
Peter GDC again mother of two kids lack
of three years of various but they have
the best they know how the man is the
things and you mothers don't get panic
you have so many inbuilt skills to take
them out you can create wonders
what happened I can show the plenty
plenty of mothers like even Shravan that
I had in season seals and oh she bought
UDC but she quitted it because she want
endo itself I mean she's a mother she
she's the clinician used to travel long
distance take care of the clinic take
care of the enlarge take care of
crickets without simultaneously a means
of a try a transmitter on audacity
that's very great to see such people
whatever you do things and where we are
no no no personal issues no
responsibilities nothing sitting idle in
the hostel going to chat with the
friends and judging the Android phones
with my fire and what wait where are we
come on we need to grow this we need to
grow up particularly in that direction
so this is one of the issue that many of
you guys are complaining but you can all
come with your willpower and the
confidence these are the two important
things that you need to have before you
start the things like at the tree it
needs to soil to support once it hasn't
support then it can grow by itself right
so that's a good thing and one more
important thing is like how to increase
your scores that's so that's a negative
issue right so how do you increase your
scores are the best method of increasing
this course is by solving majority of
the questions by international based so
I'm just going to give an example how
you need to do this so first of all you
guys while you're giving your paper I
want you guys to take care if oh
okay I want you guys to take an a4 sheet
keep an a4 sheet and keep the pen so
these two things are important they
should be on the left side for the right
hand that they should be on the left
side because rather than going with the
pen you need to work more with
mom's right so final exam you need to
spend 240 questions you need to make and
the time duration is 3 hours so you need
to work more with the mouse so in front
of the high-resolution disk top you're
sitting with a mouse in your right hand
and a paper on your left side so if
you're comfortable you can keep the
paper on the right side so once you are
reading a question like once you're
going through a question number one so
this is what okay you're done with the
question and you you just think in your
in your brain that you understand the
quotient clearly Oregon have you
understand the terminology in the
question clearly arad have you able to
identify the key key key point key word
in the question or not so these are the
three things that you have to practice
like once you catch the key word once
you understand the question yes go ahead
and you can just keep a dot means I am
done with the question so go through the
option here yes I am done with the
option here one more dot option B one
more dot option C one more option D one
motor so once you're done go ahead this
one this technique of all the 240
questions it may take in the initial
sense it may take some time because as
you're doing some paperwork so do this
for all the 240 questions so by using
this technique you're giving your brain
cannot skip any sort of word or keyword
particularly few questions the meaning
will change if you have if you skip
except to what those are the following
is true which is the following it's
incorrect and that is different which of
the following is correct and that is
different so you need to underline the
keyword identify the keyword you should
not keep any option for example which
are the following irrigation solution is
most commonly used in the endodontics
option a and yellow CL that's the right
house right go that's the right answer I
got into the gentle bugs but the
question is different which of the
following is most commonly used to
irrigation solution option yeah no CL
option B cell and option C EDTA option D
chloride excellent very seasonal
0.9% is slang is most commonly used
irrigation solution followed by the
hypochlorite of high salon is not there
you can go for hypochlorous what the
question in the dental box it is a line
is there you need to go for the salon we
know this but we used to pretend that
this is a question directly taken from
attentive also don't ever ever in your
examination compare a question with the
10 2010 CalPERS questions answer is this
or else MDS conquers dead serious
questions and this please
pp question lands racist don't ever do
that the test what we are keeping here
or the powerplay books what we are
providing all the dental pulse what you
are what I am asking you to go through
or the discussion for the Mendez are
doing is to build up a proper synopsis
in your brain a proper knowledge in your
brain so using this knowledge and with
additional with with your it with basic
wisdom you need to solid and secure you
need to go for the best option that's
what the preparation is that's what this
is the way you have to answer the
question don't ever compare this is the
direct pick from there this with a trick
from the way people visit that it picks
up don't don't ever do that because they
may be better option then asking you to
go for the best option not a correct
option because cart options there may be
many color options in a particular
question but there will be only best
option choose the best option so you
need to think all this I want you guys
to do some sort of paperwork from next
week examination or at least like while
you are going further practice papers
that are available on the Emmaus conquer
site so do this paperwork is make
yourself not speed we already gain the
speed now its accuracy is more important
there will be shocked terms in the
questions where you need to identify
them you should have a catchy look on
this and definitely there will be
increasing the high percentage of your
score if you do this means totally for
240 questions definitely 15 marks
increasing the score that is more than
enough to band the best reduces rise I
know you you people there are many
people who are in and around 160 odds or
150 odds in examination if you guys
follow this technique
for sure you will go for something which
is very detailed enough okay think of
this I want you guys to concentrate more
on this so last but not the least is how
to manage the stress so the first
treatment avoid stressful situations
okay we call divide because stress is
the one which drives you which makes you
study so there is no point of avoiding
the stressful situations so I mean I can
just make this statement very simple
avoid stressful situations for example
don't keep have ticked off hectic tax on
you that's what if your task is too high
which is impossible then it will be
stressful so don't ever do that okay
today I have given you a better you need
to complete the blood synopsis let's
make it like hai pages of blood synopsis
that may get us give one hour to
yourself okay one hour my target is
these five pages and you need to finish
it off so keeps a small small target
black those small targets and then go
for the next part like for example if
you are planning to play turbulence or
subway surfers don't ever keep we we
don't ever keep like so how to complete
all the stages of temple run today
itself
I have to do all the stages of
Connecticut students and we never keeps
excited we keep at least like this day I
want to complete at least one level so
that's what you do give one hour time
give high pages or give hundred MCQs
finish it off take a break of ten day
ten minutes then have to move to the
next set little by level you have to
keep your foundation don't ever kick
like how to complete and complete dental
balls in one day don't do that so in
this way you can avoid the stressful
situations and you can avoid the
extremes this is that is what that is
what the third point I am it as I was
discussing now set a realistic goals
goals which can be achievable
don't keep something impossible like how
to do whole general an automation rushes
and wandering impossible
no one can do this I want to get 240 of
240 in the final example it's not
realistic no one will get even
capital remains five or six key mistakes
even the perpetrator will not get
keeping all the textbook and all the
internet sources in front of them so it
is important don't ever do that don't I
would keep an imaginary ghost
keep something which can be achieved
like I want to be the already at first
yes
achievement I want to get 240 of 240
impossible I want to get on India first
achievement I want to make something a
decent score a chaebol I want to make
the best code its usual I wanted you I
want to get 100 percentage of 100
percent Asian it's not your 7th class or
it's not your first or second regarding
school we even get 100 of 100 it's
impossible so keep something which is
realized right and that set priorities
means there is a rule called as an 8020
rule because 80% is of the questions
will come from the 20% of the syllabus
so your first priority is to identify
those 20 percentage of topics where 80%
is of questions or covers so you need to
give more importance to these 20
percentage topics first of all so once
you're done with this 20% is you can go
and move for the next 80 percenters so
that's what I mean and come on let's
find some good techniques to make
yourself stress-free so that's what chat
with a good friend make a good Co friend
in the group you can chat with them you
can share the stress levels and you can
just find some sort of relaxation you if
you share with your best friend if
you're going to give good friend who is
preparing or traveling the same boat and
next have a good music that's what I
used to do while I was the better I used
to have a headset on all the time while
I was with the booking friend and if I
feel anything hard and tricky I should
have a colorful
notes where I use to fill with lots of
colors with different different colors
sorts of things
this color sort of things definitely is
going to increase your perception of
memory one and it's going to make your
work more effective and more interesting
so try these few techniques we can go
for a movie every weekend once you're
done with the exam and you can have some
sort of good music you can talk with
your good friend Rick color the same
work means he or she should be preparing
for the examination and should be always
positive if your friend gives a positive
sense take it if they are negative don't
result here with the left here and just
send it out with an idea so these are
the few things that you how to make a
note so apart from this I want you guys
to have a good diet because your health
is very very important there are few
cases where I have seen they have
suffered from few illnesses in the last
two and three months and spoil the
preparations so your food is one one of
the important thing not asking you to go
for the not asking you to go for a
random food but preferably take home
foot with a less oil and spices
decreases the slices and few people who
are in hostel particularly and who are
not able to take the green leaf
vegetables who are not exposed this
category you can you guys can take
multivitamin tablets okay every two or
three days you can take one multivitamin
because antioxidants are the one which
has very very important to the stress
levels so this is where you can decrease
these antioxidants and how for you I
hope you know the vitamins associated
with antioxidants you need to take those
vitamins and you need to have good sort
of fruits because these antioxidants are
going to decrease your the stress levels
and increase the oxygen concentration in
your body which make yourself more
effective in spending the time the book
that's what I used to get a calls last
year and even now like so how many hours
you sleep
no don't compare with me I am NOT a
human I sleep for just three the end of
our sub max four hours per day so it was
habituated
for me from past three years because of
the same days conquer so there is no
other know I want ask it now I feel
dizzy in the monetization but I tried to
make myself active but I'm not well
enriched with these foods or these
multivitamins but I used to tell them in
such a way like eat more fruits so that
the day shipping is a we are getting
sleep particularly girls who still used
to stay at house feels like we are not
able to need to sleep at least eight of
us
give me some techniques or give me some
prescription that's going to increase or
decrease my sleep so that I think
increase my study of us so the simple
answer for this like take more
antioxidants particularly fruits vitamin
C rich and you can you can just have an
enriched oxygen in you so that you can
spend more time with the books with less
less dizziness so how good water ample
amount of water drink more water drink
more fruits take multivitamins and stay
tuned with all confidence and the
willpower guys we are born here to do
something good and we are not making any
sort of fun or entertaining anyone here
right we are working hard we are
studying hard we are like like platforms
and we have some good goals and
priorities in our life with these things
you may end up at some point which is
going to help you and your family to
stand the best in the society ok the
only thing that's going to stand with
you from the death from the birth to the
death is your name so you're born as
something X now you have something
besides your name like doctor x videos

come so that is what the MDS and the
preferred Department and the preferred
colors and what your life is going to be
