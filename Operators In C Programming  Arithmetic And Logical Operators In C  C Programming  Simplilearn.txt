hey guys welcome to yet another
interesting and informative video by
simply learn in this video we will
understand the operators in c
programming
before we get started make sure that you
subscribe to our simple inline channel
and hit the bell icon to never miss an
update from us
so without further ado let's get started
with the agenda for today's session
first let us start by understanding what
are operators in c and then the types of
operators
now let's begin with what are operators
in c
an operator is used to operate on
operands of any type so in short an
operator is a symbol
in the example
a is equal to 2 plus 3 2 and 3 are the
operands and places the operator so
basically the addition operation is
performed on two operands
now let's have a look at the types of
operators in c
based on the operands the operators are
classified into three types
first up we have unary operators that
are used to perform operation on a
single operand
and the operators are unary minus
increment decrement and logical not
next is binary operators that operates
on two operands
arithmetic operator relational operator
logical bitwise and assignment operator
and then the ternary operator which is
also known as the conditional operator
great now that we know the types of
operators in scene
now let's understand the unary operators
that perform the operation on a single
operand with their symbols and examples
let's start with the unary minus
operator represented by the minus symbol
which converts the positive value to a
negative number
consider the value y to be positive 2
and after performing the unary minus
operation the positive value 2 will be
converted to negative 2.
next increment and decrement operators
are used to increase and decrease the
value by 1 respectively for example plus
plus y is pre-increment and y plus plus
is post increment similarly we have
pre-decrement and post decrement
next is logical not that is used to
complement the logical value for example
consider the value for x and y to be 5
and 2 and the condition is 5 lesser or
equal to 2 which is false so the logical
not operator we complement boolean value
to true in that case
i hope you got a clear understanding of
unary operators
next we have binary operators that
operate on two operands
first we have arithmetic operators used
to perform addition subtraction
multiplication division and modular
operation
let us know the performance of
arithmetic operations with the help of a
simple program
we have included all the arithmetic
operators in this particular program now
let's run the program and look at the
result
here enter the value of a and b
as you can see the result for all the
operation is printed successfully that
is 2 3 is equal to 5 2 minus 3 is equal
to minus 1 2 into 3 is equal to 6 and 2
divided by 3 is equal to 0.
relational operators are used for
comparing two operands
first we have the greater than operator
that checks whether the operand one is
greater than the operand two for example
x greater than y similarly we have the
other relational operators that are used
to compare to operands and they are less
than less than or equal to greater than
or equal to equal to and not equal to
the following binary operator is the
logical operator in that we have the
logical and or and not operators so let
us consider the example x greater than y
logical and x less than z
the logical and operator returns the
value true if both conditions are valid
otherwise it will written false
next the logical or operator returns
true if a the condition is true else it
will returns the value false
as discussed before the logical not
operator complements the value
let's understand logical operators a
little better by executing a program
as you all can see in this particular
program we're gonna perform logical
operations
so let's run the program and see the
output
so here it's asking press logical and
operator press 2 to perform logical or
operation and press 3 to perform the not
operation so let us enter one
so enter three numbers let me enter two
three and four
so here since the condition is not
satisfied the return value is zero
next we have the bitwise operators in
which we have bitwise and or xor
complement right shift and left shift
let us understand the bitwise operators
with the help of through
table the bitwise and operator compiles
the bits if both the bits are high that
is one then the result would be high
else the result is row which is zero
next is the bitwise or operator if
either of the bit is high
then the result is one else the result
is zero
next we have an xor operator in which
the result is zero when both the bits
are zeros or ones else the result is one
following we have assignment operators
you may understand better when you look
at the example the assignment operator
is used to assign a value to a variable
as you can see in the example x is equal
to 5 the value of pi is given to the
variable x next is to sum and assign
that is x plus equal to 2 means the
number 2 is added to the value of x
next subtract and assign that means by
subtracting the number 3 from the value
of x
then multiply and assign operator which
multiplies 2 with the value of x
the divide and as an operator is used to
divide for example 2 is divided by the
value of x
similarly the bitwise and and assign
operator ends the value of y with x
and then the bitwise or an assign
operator will order the value of y with
x
so i think you got a good understanding
of all the binary operators
okay so let us now understand the
ternary operator in c with the help of
syntax and example
the syntax is expression 1 question mark
expression 2 colon expression 3 and
semi-colon
for example
let us consider x is equal to 5 and y is
equal to 2
expression 1 must be the condition to be
satisfied so basically if the condition
satisfies it will execute the expression
too otherwise it will execute expression
3.
as you can see in this example 5 less
than 2 the condition is false so that it
will execute the expression 3 which
means print the value 2.
now let's execute program using ternary
operator the condition is satisfied it
gonna print expression 2 else execute
expression 3.
so let's run it
here enter two numbers
so since the condition is not satisfied
the expression three is executed
i hope you got the idea of using the
ternary operator right
now let's see how this special operator
works
some special operators in c programming
are comma address and sizeof
now let's execute the program using
special operators
so in this particular program a comma
operator is used while declaring
variables next the symbol ampersand
represents the address operator to fetch
the memory address of a variable and the
size of operator is used to know the
size of data types occupied in the
memory let's run it
here let's enter the value for a and b
so as you can see the values are printed
successfully that is the value of a is
equal to 2 the value of b is equal to 3
and the size of int is equal to 4 bytes
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on operators in c
programming i hope this session was
informative and interesting until next
