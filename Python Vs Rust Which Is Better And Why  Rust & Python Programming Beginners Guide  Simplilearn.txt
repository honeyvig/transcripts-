hello everyone welcome to this video
tutorial on python versus rust by simply
learn in this session you will go
through a brief introduction to both
languages that is Python and rest after
knowing the basics we will get to know
about the differences between them
further we will learn about the conses
of python and conses of rust so hey
everyone I'm abisara from Simply learn
and welcome to this video on python
versus rust but before we begin if you
love watching Tech videos subscribe to
our Channel and hit the Bell icon to
never miss an update let's start with
the introduction to
python python is an objectoriented high
level interpreted and multi-paradigm
programming
language it was first introduced by gudo
Van rosam in 19 91 with highly readable
code and a smart syntax python is
perfect for those that are just starting
their programming carrier Python's
versatility and resilience have made its
used cases in various domains such as
web applications application development
data analytics and artificial
intelligence development now let us know
what rust is rust is a multi-paradigm
general purpose and a high level program
in language it was introduced by gron H
along with Dave Herman Brandon Ike and
others at Mozilla research rust focuses
on safety stability performance and safe
concurrency but made its growth and
adoption across various
Industries now we will start the
comparison between Python and when we
talk about performance rust takes the
piece of cake as python takes time to
convert code into machine code python
being an interpreted language interprets
code line by line whereas rest provides
high performance and security when
compared to python the rest code is
directly compiled into machine code it
does not require any virtual machine or
interpreter to do so and it's around 12
times faster than
python rest ensures proper memory
management and checks it during comp
compation now we will compare the two on
grounds of execution python is a dynamic
style system that allows developers to
develop software easily in contrast rest
is a static type system that makes
programmers specify parameters from
function arguments to constants but it
acts dynamically inside the function
body moreover rust comes with a feature
to handle exceptions at compile time
that is is none it allows programmers to
run programs smoothly at the user
end let's see how easy it is to learn
and read these languages python provide
simpler syntax and clearly defined code
structure for a simpler development
experience documentation is highly
readable that helps quickly develop
scalable systems and has a good
Community Support in contrast rust comes
with a steep curve as its use cases
mostly are system programming it also
has simple documentation but is a little
complex compared to python just has some
complex features which makes it
challenging to learn let's check error
handling with both languages python
throws an exception when an error is
encountered and it notifies bugs after
runtime you have to wait until runtime
to get addressable errors
its job is to only find errors and throw
as exceptions it doesn't provide any
recommendations to fix these on the
other hand rest returns a value when an
error is found and it provides an easier
and improved debugging experience than
many other compile languages this
experience is backed by its features
like memory management and in contrast
to python it provides some
recommendations to easily pinpoint and
fix the
issues we'll see some applications of of
these
languages python is used for web
application development Enterprise
applications data analytics data
visualization and machine learning
whereas rust is used in operating
systems gaming engines file systems
browser components and virtual reality
engines Microsoft introduce various
components to make rust grow more and
prosper now let's check how secure these
languages are python processes garbage
collector which makes programmers
configure memory management and prevent
any memory leaks it cleans up the
unnecessary memory while the program is
running whereas rust stresses on
security and focuses on fixing memory
leaks it provides slack or Heap to use
during the compilation time and it
clears the memory when it's no longer
required it eliminates the need to run a
garbage collector
constantly now we'll see some popular
companies using these languages first
we'll start with
python first company we'll see
Instagram is mainly a visual social
media platform it uses python in
business logic that is exchange of data
between the database and user interface
next we have is Kora Kora is a question
and answer social media platform it has
used python to develop its application
next we have is Google it used uses
python as the official serers side
language along with C++ Java and
go also used python in its most popular
application that is YouTube next we have
a Spotify it is an audio streaming and
media services provider that uses python
for its backend services and data
analysis Spotify also sponsors
International python conferences namely
Python and europython now we will move
pH with companies using
rust first we will see strop box it is a
file hosting service operated by an
American company that uses rust for
parts of its file synchronization
engine the engine is highly concurrent
they choose rust over any other language
next is cloud flare it is an American
Web infrastructure and website security
company that uses rust as core language
they have replaced rust with C for its
memory safe feature next we have a
figma it is a collaborative web-based
design tool for vector graphics and
interface prototyping due to their rapid
growth they choose rust to Rite their
multiplayer sync engine rust has helped
them drop off the load from their
servers next we have is Discord it is an
instant messaging and digital
distribution platform users communicate
with voice calls video calls text
messaging media and files in private
chats or as a part of community's called
servers Discord uses rust in multiple
places of their code base both on the
client and the server site now after
comparing both the languages we should
jump to see some cons of python and rust
first we'll cover cons of python as it's
an interpreted language python is slower
compared to many compile
languages next is some error don't show
up until runtime which makes it
difficult to find errors next con is it
is weak in Mobile
Computing you'll see conses of
rust learning rust is not easy when
compared to other languages that's why
it has a higher learning curve it has
low level of monkey patching support
than Python and pearl here monkey
patching refers to modifying a class or
module at a runtime and moreover the
compiler is slow as compared to some
scripting
languages with that we have come to the
