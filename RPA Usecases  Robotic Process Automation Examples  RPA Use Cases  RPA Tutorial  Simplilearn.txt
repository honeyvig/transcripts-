a very warm welcome to all viewers and
in this video we will be looking at the
robotic process automation example let
us consider a discussion between john
and jamie john is very curious and wants
to know how and where rpa is used in
different fields
jaime being a developer helps john in
understanding the rpa examples even if
you are curious to know the applications
of rpa then you are at the right place
so let's get started
the first example
is customer service
let's look at the problem statement
a customer representative must
understand and solve the customer
queries carry out the necessary actions
by switching between the various
softwares and applications and inform
the customer
this must wait while the representative
is busy dealing with data sometimes
asking for information that has already
been requested this tends to decrease
customer satisfaction and extends call
duration
the solution requires identifying
frequently asked customer questions
assessing customer representative
actions in response to those questions
and developing rpa solutions to
facilitate those questions
when several sets of information need to
be coordinated across systems the
customer service representative can
launch a bot the bot completes all
actions in seconds with the press of a
button
for frequently asked questions a
dashboard can be created a customer
service representative will fill out the
necessary information to receive the
queries and what will use that data in
multiple systems to complete the
transaction let's look at an example
consider a scenario where a company was
providing support to the client and the
company was supposed to handle a large
number of calls approximately 20 000
calls per month which required a
significant amount of time spent in the
support team because of the system's
complexity an executive's average time
was about 10 minutes the system was
inefficient and slow resulting in the
poor customer service
with the rpa solution the organization
gained a virtual team that can complete
the task in less than a minute resulting
in a drastic reduction in an execution
time
the rpa board performs the following
task
loading a comprehensive customer profile
obtaining a detailed billing information
user preferences and other user
information are being updated resolving
common but simple customer issues
let's look at the second example
financial service
financial service involves compiling and
combining financial information from
various departments and storing the
records in a system
data is manually extracted from a bank
statements to reconcile documents and
link them to its forms using detailed
spreadsheets
to complete the reports business rely on
excel legacy software and manual labor
which is tedious and time consuming
solution robots can generate invoices in
seconds prompting clients to pay more
quickly rpa in financial services tracks
and standardizes and validates payments
process orders and avoids errors and is
always on top of things such a
disciplined assistant makes the
customers experience less stressful
adding value to the service provider
rpa in finance eliminates the need for
endless email correspondence and ensures
a smooth payment approval process
matches invoices to responsible parties
and sets deadline reminders
automated data entry speeds up the
process and relieves human employees of
huge tasks this enables precise and
structured invoice processing
consider a financial service company
that's having difficulty extracting data
from financial documents efficiently and
accurately in order to generate ratings
using rpa company implemented an
application that recognized and
processed data
this enable decline to quickly and cost
effectively automate
the tasks performed by rpa bots in
financial service are
investment management
reconciliation of bank statements
organizing the finances
record of accounts receivables and pay
the third example is hr service
this operation includes numerous routine
steps such as interview scheduling
record keeping resume screening
candidate shortlisting induction
training and onboarding airing and
firing place a significant burden on hr
and other support functions such as i.t
security and facilities management
particularly for medium and large
businesses while it is expensive to
build a solution that encompasses all of
these functions and completes the
necessary task for new or departing
employees some employees can be sloppy
with recording absences vacation or in
general using the existing absence
management system
so the possible solution for this is rpa
can be used to collect and screen
resumes and online application forms
contact
through background checks and compare
the information to all the relevant job
requisitions this allows the best
candidates to be shortlisted
rpa can be used quickly to create offer
letters for new employees
that are both personalized and accurate
can also validate records by
cross-checking data such as absentees
reports against time logged in the
corporate network and alerting when
information is missing or inconsistent
talent acquisition team of a company
automated aspects of onboarding process
for new employees
previously the onboarding paperwork was
completed manually by one person
consuming a significant amount of
employees time that could have been
spent on more valuable work
this type of work that no one wants to
do day after day
the company understands that an hr
department wants to provide a digital
and straightforward experience the task
required a lot of copy and paste
activities with the implementation of
rpa the bot completed the onboarding
paperwork in less time allowing hrs to
spend more time on corporate social
responsibilities hiring talent
initiatives and improving a company's
reputation
the tasks performed by rpa bots in hr
service are screening resumes onboarding
of new hires
attendance management
induction and training
employment management and survey report
the fourth example is telecom service
the telecommunications industry involves
high frequency of manual repetitive
rules-based processes all of which are
critical for providing appropriate
service delivery thus the foundation of
telecommunications is made up of process
that are highly amenable to automation
for telecommunication companies looking
to improve their customer service high
reliability and accuracy of process
outcomes are required
solution the use of robotic process
automation in telecom reduces error
rates to close to zero improves data
quality improves customer service and
increases operational efficiency all
while contributing significantly to cost
reduction
rpa technology can capture the business
process task performed by a telecom
company's employees
based on the employee's action a
well-structured workflow can be
generated which serves as the foundation
for automated process by mapping each
process step with its significant cost
for manual execution it is simple to
determine which action should be
automated to maximize return on the
investment
consider an example a telecommunications
and media company decided to automate
its order creation and service removal
process to cut costs associated with the
company speed booster discount service
and deal with a massive amount of
transactional data
with the implementation of rpa it
becomes simple to automate the order
build process and service removal
activity
the tasks performed by rpa boards in
telecom service are
it checks on the credit and sim card
swapping the solution of customer
complaints porting customer phone
numbers
responding to questions from partners
the fifth example is healthcare service
healthcare systems contain numerous
burdensome tasks that involve
significant resource allocation such as
claim management this results in high
operational cost and slow process
every industry has inefficiencies but
few face the healthcare industry's
challenges strict regulations regarding
patient data and lack of resources to
deal with such rules building takes time
after a health care service is provided
due to manual and repetitive task in the
management process
management process include document and
data input processing and evaluation in
addition to the automating time
consuming task patients can schedule
appointments without the intervention of
hospital employees credit to rpa
technology
along with eliminating the need of
resource allocation for scheduling by
allowing patients to reschedule
appointments more quickly this
application can improve customer
relations rpa allows healthcare
providers to track and document each
process step in structured log files to
comply with external audits
rpa improves data confidentiality
because bots handle this process
let's consider an example
daily a healthcare organization deals
with the process of patient transaction
data
customer details recording claims to the
process and data reconciliation for
health care schemes are some of the
manual process they must streamline
daily the primary goal was to increase
the efficiency of existing approaches to
achieve greater accuracy with reduced
turnaround time
robotic process automation was
implemented and the most significant
possible impact was obtained rpa
platform handled claims processing and
health data reconciliation program
healthcare was able to reduce turnout on
time with this solution
the tasks performed by rpa boards in
healthcare service are
appointment scheduling regulatory
compliance
data entry and supporting analytics to
improve treatment
