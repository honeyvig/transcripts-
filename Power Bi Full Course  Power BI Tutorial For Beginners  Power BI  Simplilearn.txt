so let's get started now let's see what
powerbi is powerbi is a business
analytics service provided by Microsoft
that lets you visualize your data and
share insights it converts data from
different sources to build interactive
dashboards and bi reports as you can see
we have an Excel data about sales using
this data powerbi helps you build
different charts and graphs to visualize
the data now that we have understood
what powerbi is let us look at the
important features of powerbi first is
powerbi desktop powerbi desktop is a
free software that you can download and
it allows you to build reports by
accessing data easily for using powerbi
desktop you do not need Advanced report
designing or query skills to build a
report second as already discussed
powerbi supports stream analytics from
Factory sensors to social media sources
powerbi assist in realtime analytics to
make timely decisions third Cod for
multiple data sources is one of the
major features of RBI you can access
various sources of data such as Excel
CSV SQL Server web files Etc to create
interactive visualizations and finally
custom visualization custom
visualization is another vital feature
of powerbi while dealing with complex
data powerbi default standard might not
be enough in some cases in that case you
can access the custom library of
visualization that meets your needs let
us jump into discussing the various
components of powerb bi as you can see
there are six major components of
powerbi now let's discuss them one by
one first is power query power query is
the data transformation and mass up
engine it enables you to discover
connect combine and refine data sources
to meet your analysis need it can be
downloaded as an addin for Excel or can
be used as part of powerbi desktop
second we have power pivote power pivote
is a data modeling technology that lets
you create data models it also allows
you to establish relationships and
create calculations it uses data
analysis expression language or Dax to
model simple and complex data third we
have power view Power view is a
technology that is available in Excel
SharePoint SQL server and powerbi it
lets you create interactive charts
graphs maps and other visuals that
brings your data to Life Next we have
power map Microsoft's power map for
Excel and powerbi is a 3D data
visualization tool that lets you map
your data and plot more than a million
rows of data visually on Bing maps in 3D
format from an Excel table or data model
in Excel then we have powerb desktop
powerbi desktop is a development tool
for power query power pivote and Power
view with powerbi desktop you have
everything under the same solution and
it is easier to develop bin data
analysis experience finally we have
power Q&A the Q&A feature in powerbi
lets you explore your data in your own
words it is the fastest way to get an
answer from your data using natural
language an example could be what was
the total sales last year once you have
built your data model and deployed that
into powerbi website then you can ask
questions and get answers easily now
let's see what powerbi service is
powerbi service is the software as a
service part of powerbi it is also
referred as powerbi online to access
powerbi service you need to log into
app. powerbi.com now let me show you
that I'll go to Google open a new Tab
and search for app.
powerbi.com
it's
loading now this is how the homepage of
powerbi service looks like I've created
some dashboards on it first you need to
log to app. powerbi service you can see
I'm logged in now under my workspace if
I go to dashboard here I have created a
finance dashboard you can see the
different charts and graphs I have
prepared and pinned it to the dashboard
so power service allows you to connect
to your data create reports and
dashboards and you can also ask
questions to your data now as you can
see in this dashboard we have created
some charts and graphs so this is a tree
map there's a pie chart there's a bar
graph below you can see there line
charts and donor charts it tells you the
total sales that were made the total
number of unit solds the sales by
product sales by country salesp segment
and lots more one of the key features of
powerbi is creating dashboards from
multiple report reports and data sets
powerbi dashboard is a single page
visualization to tell a story The
visualizations on a dashboard are
generated from multiple reports and each
report is based on one data set a single
page dashboard is known as a canvas the
visualizations you see on the dashboard
are called tiles these tiles are pinned
to the dashboard by report designers now
let me go back to my dashboard so this
is called a caners and each of these are
called tiles so on the top you can see
we have three tiles now let's understand
how to create and publish reports in
powerbi dashboards powerbi allows you to
create different reports on powerbi
desktop these reports can be published
on the powerbi dashboard using powerbi
service here you can see there is a
powerbi report created on powerbi
desktop if you click on publish it will
take you to the powerbi service where
you can build a dashboard here is the
button for powerbi publish once you
click on powerbi publish it will take
you to the dashboard so this is a single
page power powerbi dashboard on powerbi
service now let's understand the powerbi
architecture powerbi architecture is a
service built on top of a z there are
multiple data sources that powerbi can
connect to powerbi desktop allows you to
create reports and data visualizations
on the data set powerbi Gateway is
connected to on premise data sources to
get continuous data for reporting and
analytics powerbi services are basically
the cloud services that are used to
publish powerbi reports and data
visualizations using powerbi mobile apps
you can stay connected to their data
from anywhere powerbi apps are available
for Windows IOS and Android platforms
today's topic which is about how to
create powerbi dashboard in a few
minutes Yes you heard me right you can
create a complete powerbi dashboard or
also known as a report in just a few
clicks and a few minutes now in this
particular video we are minimizing the
time in creating dashboard because
sometimes data cleaning process you
already know if you're an expert or if
you are a beginner in data analytics you
already know there are steps in data
report or dashboard right first you load
the data from a source it can be Cloud
PDF Excel workbook CSV or anything and
after that you do some data cleaning
right you split the columns or you
eliminate some blank rows blank columns
and some irrelevant data which does not
fit or some um for more reference on
data cleaning you can also refer to the
video which is linked in the description
box below and so right that's the
process so basically you import the data
from The Source clean it transform it
and then load it and then create a
dashboard right so in this particular
video we have the completely cleaned
data set which is really available for
creating report which will be also
linked in the description box below if
you want to follow us along so um with
that uh let's get started right so
that's how it goes now let's have a look
at our data so our data has um some row
ID order ID a date ship date so
basically you can totally understand
this particular data set is about sales
report right let's say I'm working with
XYZ company which is based on data
analytics and I get an email from my
client that he or she wants to know how
exactly the sales are performing in what
exact States or countries and uh what
exact regions and what C category of
products or subcategory of products and
what's the sales quantity order profit
right so let's say you have a one uh
category or subcategory or a product
which is giving you high number of sales
and profit right you want to improve
more you can increase the price or let's
say you have some product which is not
performing so well right so you can uh
offer some discounts let's say like 50%
off so that you can move out the product
from your store right so some uh
basically if you analyze the data and
you come up to a decision where which
product is performing in which region or
state or country and which product is
performing in not performing in which
region state or country right you can
come up with a strategy for sales and
improve your Revenue so that's the
entire process right so with that said
so this is the data we have and let's
quickly jump onto powerbi and get going
with creating a report or dashboard
within a few minutes right so here we
are on the powerbi desktop so here
absolutely you can see you can import
data from Excel you can import data from
SQL Server you can import data from a
blank table or use some sample data but
from that you can also get data from a
different sources as well right see uh
we will be trying to do some automation
right so regarding the automation we can
also uh go through another video from
Simply learn which will help you
understand how to automate the process
of data transformation cleaning and
uploading so uh you can just give the
file location here the folder so I'm
going going with the folder here so it
will give me a new window uh you can go
to browse and I think I have my folder
in
downloads and uh Excel data sets um
Excel
I think I'll be having that named
as sales report yes just click okay and
you have the sales report
here you can have a quick preview of the
data so here you have the options
combine load transform data right you
can just directly load because I've said
you that this particular data set is
completely clean and is ready for
reports right so you can just select the
data you want and and just load right
I'm doing it this way because let's say
uh for let's not not let's say uh we
have uh the data here in a form in in
such a form that the data is from last 3
to four years right so let me select it
this
way so in this case as well it will take
the Excel file and uh even if you add
some more data to it it will uh apply
the changes to it right so let's say uh
we have the data for the last four years
2020
209 2021 2 and 3 and since 2024 is not
completed yet we are not taking that
data let's say we enter into 2025 then
the new data for 2024 gets updated and
loaded onto the same data table and you
don't have to uh you know process the
data once again clean it transform it
load it no that's not going to happen
you can just load the data you can just
drop the data on the Excel spreadsheet
and your dashboard or report will
reflect the new changes automatically
just by refreshing your dashboard right
that's the automation you can do so what
exactly automation is the process where
human effort is not involved and the
computer or your any uh tool that's the
job for you is called as automation
which reduces a lot of time of yours and
you can use that valuable time to plan
on the strategies to improve your
Revenue right that's the overall Moto of
data analytics now that's the uh preview
of the data I'm just going to directly
load it I'm not going to transform it
because uh it's completely clean and
transform data and ready for reports so
here you go and uh you can close if
there are minute errors you can just
close it and uh if you want to check
your data you can go to your data here
and you can have the sample data right
here right if you check R date not ship
date sorry uh ship date can enter into
uh 2023 as well right so here you have
2020 and the other dates right so you
will have okay let's go to the data
filter so you basically have four years
not 2024 right so uh that's the way if
you just add the 2024 data it will
automatically reflect in the
visualization now uh all that we need is
create a dashboard or report which will
help us analyze some data right so uh
let's get started just double click on
the report section and here you will
have icon or visit which will ask you
what exactly you're looking for
preparing Q&A so I
want region wise sales and I want it in
a
paragraph there you go you have the
region why sales in barograph press on
okay and you have it and you can place
it somewhere in the corner then if you
want another one double click and you
want category
wise category
sales and let's take that in pie
chart category sales buy and here you
have it press on agree and accept and
you have it over here and year on-ear
sales in a line
graph sales by date or sales
by sales by date line
graph here you have it accept that so
that you can identify which is the peak
uh performance year or Peak Performance
date for us which gave us the highest
number of sales in a certain region
right so here we have it you can place
it can customize it right
and now let's go for subcategory double
click and uh
subcategory I think we have a h from a
space
there say uh the type of chart you want
you can go with the donut
one select that and
it so you have subcategory voice sale
and now
let's go with uh region wise I mean the
country wise right so let's go to the
data again here so here we have segment
city state country okay let's go with
country now
right
country country
sales map chart so whenever you have uh
region or state or country involved go
with map charts it's the best way to
represent right so we have considered
European nations over here so for that
reason we have the European States here
and uh now we can go with let's go with
the data once again and have a look what
else we can do and shiping mode right so
you have the shipment mode as well so uh
you can identify what type of shipment
mode customers are majorly preferring
shipment mode bar
graph a so basically I think we have uh
three types of shipment
mode let's check the column name of
shipment mode properly ship mode it's
not shipment mode it's ship mode right
so let's type again ship
mode
bar
graph okay shipment mode
sales Barra there you go so agree
accepted so you have standard shipment
is the most preferred one now we have
this so let's add some kpis here so uh
kpi of
sales you will adjust that agree there
you go and let's add a KP I
for
profit and you have it
agree kpi for Revenue double
click let's check if we have a column
called Revenue quantity discount profit
right so let's go with
quantity and
discount so re new is not added so it's
okay so you can identify which uh uh
product or subcategory is highly selling
in in number of quantities so you have
you'll have the sum of profit sum of
sales sum of quantity and what else we
left the last one discount and rate
singles discount profit so let's
identify if we have offered
any okay so let's add a kpi of rate as
well if we are completely focusing on a
single product a single category we must
be having uh kPa for rate as well double
click somewhere kpi on
rate there you go accepted and you have
the
completely formatted
dashboard or sales report ready for a
meeting let's close all these so that we
have a better visualization and you can
just go to the uh slides share mode or
fit to the page mode where you can have
it that's good so uh this is how you
create a completely functional fully
functional sales report or sales
dashboard just within a few clicks and
just within a few minutes let's say uh I
want the report only for central region
click that and it's completely
interactive and let's say we don't want
that click outside and you will have
everything back to the normal right and
let's say I wanted to focus on a
particular category technology category
alone you have the sales happening and
the subcategory of sales and what are
the products over here right you'll have
that and which is the country uh
happening to ship the most of them and
what's the shipment more preferred by
them and highest performing date or year
so here you can see 2022 June was the
highest performance for sales and uh the
lowest one is somewhere here in March
2020 or something right so that's how
you can create a fully interactive
dashboard or report based on sales data
in a few minutes and in a few clicks and
that brings us to the end of this
tutorial on the topic how to create a
completely functional sales report or
sales Dash SP in a few clicks and in a
few minutes so what does data analyst do
on huge data set data analyst get the
analyze and run statical studies to
glean insights and spot RS they use
various methods and tools to transform
complicated data into useful insights
they therefore provide insightful data
that enables businesses to make informed
decision and this is the answer of
question what data analyst do so moving
forward let's jump into roles and
responsibil of a data analysis the roles
and responsibilities of a data analyst
often consist of the following the first
one is create and manage databases and
data system fixing coding mistakes and
other data related problem as necessary
the second one is using both primary and
secondary sources for data mining the
third one is rearranging data in a way
that both individuals and machine can
understand the fourth one is create
documentation that clarifies the data
analys process for stakeholder so now
let's jump into how to become a data
analyst with no experience steps and
strategies so becoming a data analyst
without prer experience can be
challenging but achievable goal so here
is a detailed guide on how to break into
the field of data analysis from a sketch
so the first one is master the basics
data analysis need a mix of Technical
and softare skills start by learning the
basics of Statics and Mathematics so key
topics are descriptive statistic learn
measures of of central tendency mean
median mode measures of variability
range variance and standard deviation
and data distribution like normal
distribution and skus and CIS the second
is inferential stat understanding
hypothesis testing confidence intervals
P values and statical significance the
third one is probability Theory basic
probability concept conditional
probability and based theorems and many
the fourth point is linear Al and
calculus fundamental concept that
underpin many statical algorithm so you
guys can learn these topics from our
simply YouTube channel where each topic
is explained in depth by our experts the
second point is programming languages
and python in Python learn the basic
syntax data types and control structures
like loops and condition the second one
is libraries for data analyses like
numai P and metp lip for data
manipulation and visualization the third
one is Library for statical analysis
like CPI and St models for performing
statical test and modeling and in our
like basic syntax like data types and
structures data manipulation like DPL yr
T yr the third point is statical
analysis basr function and package like
GG plot 2 or data visualization so you
guys can learn these topics from our
simply YouTube channel where each topic
is explained in depth by our expert the
third point is data visualization and
Reporting so in this we have first table
creating and customizing various charts
and types like bar charts line graphs
Scatter Plots the second is building
interactive dashboards and stories the
third one is connecting two different
data sources and data blending the
second one we have powerbi data modeling
and creating relationship between data
sets the second point is designing
reports with visuals filters and slicers
the third point is using X data analysis
expressions for advanced calculation in
this category third we have Excel so in
this you can learn Advanced formulas
like V lookup H lookup index match and
AR formulas the second is p tables
summarizing analyzing and visualizing
data the third is data visualization
creating and formatting charts spark
lines and conditional formatting so you
guys can learn these topics from our
simpl YouTube channel where the each
topic explained end up by our expert or
you can go through their official
document websites in master the basics
the last point is SQL database and the
key concept the key concept are basic
SQL commands select from where join
group by having or order by second is
database design understanding tables
relationships and normalization the
third is Advanced SQL subqueries window
function and Common Table expression CTS
the fourth one is database management
connecting to a database writing
optimized queries and understanding
indexes so you guys can learn these
topics from our simpl YouTube channel
where we have SQL playlist covering each
topic that is explained in depth by our
expert the second point is work on your
personal project applying your new
skills to real world problems is a great
way to gain experience so here are some
projects idea to help you get started
the first one is personal project public
data analysis choose a public data set
that interests you and perform a comp
ensive analysis for example analyzing
covid-19 Trends over time predicting
house prices or studying climate change
impacts the second is kagle competition
kagle is a fantastic platform where you
can participate in designs competition
these competition provide real world
data and problems to solve for example
predicting customer churn classifying
image or creating models to improve
sales forcasting the third one is build
a dashboard create an interactive
dashboard using tools like Tableau or to
visualize data insight for example a
dashboard tracking Global Financial
Market or visualizing crime rates in
different cities the third point is get
certified while certification won't
replace Real World Experience they can
be valuable additional to your resume so
there are numerous data analy
certification available online such as
the Google data analytics certificate
the data analyst program by simply this
data anal course by simply learn in
collaboration with IBM will transform
you into a data anal expert in this
course you will learn the latest
analytics tools and techniques how to
work with SQL the languages of R and
python the art of creating data
visualization and how to apply stat and
Predictive Analytics in the business
environment these certification not only
provide you with the solid foundation
but also show potential employers your
commitment to learning and growing in
the field the fourth point is build a
portfolio one of the best way to
Showcase your skills to potential
employe is by building a portfolio this
can include personal projects data
analysis on real world data set or even
kle competition the key here is to
demonstrate your ability to apply what
you have learned to real world problem
don't worry if you don't have access to
fancy data set or tools there are plenty
of publicly available data set on sites
like kagle or even Government website
you guys can make portfolio like this so
this is an example of one portfolio so
you can distribute your projects like
this or you can take help from this okay
the next point is networking and
mentorship connect with professional in
the field through Linkedin local meetups
or professional association look for
Mentor who can provide guidance feedback
on your projects and potentially help
you with the job reference networking
can be invaluable in learning about
unadvertised job openings or internship
the next point is internship apply for
anti- level position or internship look
for job titles like Junior data analyst
data technicians or analytics assistant
look for opportunities in local
community reach out to startups or
nonprofits or even consider offering
your services for free initially even
customer service or administrator roles
that involves data entry or reporting
can serve as stepping stones giving you
practical experience with data the
seventh point is prepare for interviews
be ready to discuss your projects how
you approach problems and what you have
learned you should also be prepared for
technical interview that may test your
knowledge of stat programming and data
analysis techniques you can refer to
Simply video on data analysis interview
question and answer on YouTube so to sum
it up master the basics build a
portfolio get certified get experience
through internship and freelancing
network like crazy and never stop
learning and most importantly believe in
yourself and your abilities let's do
some practical Hands-On demo with
powerbi so this is how the powerbi
desktop interface looks like on the left
you have the report view the dat data
View and the model view the report view
is where you visualize your data with
different charts and graphs to build
reports the data view allows you to view
the whole data while the model view is
where you check if there are any
relationship between the tables on the
right you can see the different
visualizations that you can build we'll
quickly run through all of these in our
demo so here you can see there's a
finance sample data that will help you
draw insights about the sale of products
in different countries we will create a
report to visualize different charts and
graphs and anal I those sales so let me
go to my powerb desktop first we'll
import our data so let me go to our get
data Tab and choose Excel as my data
source I click on Excel so here is our
finance sample
data we'll select sheet one you can see
the data here click on it and then
select
load this might take some time to load
the data now if I go to my data tab you
can see the entire data set it has
Fields such as segment country in which
the sales was made the name of the
product the unit sold and the sales
price and many more let's start building
our report now I'll go to my report view
so first let me create a text box let me
resize
it let me name it as Finance dashboard
we'll increase the size of the text
we'll use Font consolas Center it we'll
also add a background to this use blue
color change it to
White and increase the size
now let me first show you how you can
create a matrix I'll go to
visualizations and click on Matrix let
me resize
it from the data sheet tab I'll select
sales and drag on to
values so you can see the total number
of sales that we made now let me do some
formatting so I'll go to the format tab
click on column headers let's add a
background color and let me increase the
text size to 20 similarly under values
we'll increase the size of the text to
20 as well we can also click on border
and choose the color of the Border we
take as it it be black so this is a
simple Matrix that we created which
shows the total number of sees that were
made similarly let me choose Matrix once
again now we'll drag on the unit sold
onto values we'll continue with the same
drill under column headers We'll add a
background this time let's choose some
other color and under values let's
increase the size of the text to 20 even
for the column headers let's increase
the size of the text to
20 again we'll switch on Border me
resize a
bit so here we have two Matrix created
for our report the first Matrix shows us
the total sales that were made the
second matri Matrix shows you the total
units that were sold now let's move
ahead and create a simple bar chart so
under visualization and click on
clustered column
chart under this we'll drag the date
column onto access and the sales onto
value let me expand it so it shows you
the sales per year this is the sales
that were made in 2013 and this shows
you the sales that were made in 2014
now there's a drill down option which
gives you more
granularity this depicts the sales back
water if I drill down further you can
see this shows you the sales by month
also you have some options like s bu and
S by sales so you can see October month
made the highest number of sales moving
ahead let me now create a pie chart
where we will see the sales by different
segments under visualization I'll click
on pie chart let me first resize it
here I'll drag the segment column onto
the legend and the sales column onto the
values as you can see we have the sales
made by different segments government
segment made the highest number of sales
with
44.2% now let me add a border to both
the visualization I'll click on the pie
chart and go to the format tab I'll
switch on the border similarly for the
clustered column chart I'll go to the
format Tab and click on Border let me
resize a bit all right next we'll create
a very simple table that will depict the
total sales made by each product so
under visualizations I click on table
let me bring this
below so from the data sheet I'll first
drag product onto values you can see the
different products and then sales just
below it so this depicts the total sales
that were made by each product and
finally it displays the to total value
of the sales that were made this is same
as the one shown here now let's do some
formatting under format tab I'll go to
values and increase the text size to 15
let me expand it also under column
headers I'll increase the text size to
15 then let me go and add a
border now let me create a map that will
show you the sales that were made by
each country so first let me create a
new page and under visualization I'll
click on map now I'll drag the country
column onto
location so you can see we have our map
ready and we'll drag sales onto size you
can see the different countries and the
sales that they made if I move the map
you can see the sales made in the Europe
region let me resize it I'll add a
border to
this now let me go ahead and cck create
a donut chart that will show you the
profit by each segment under
visualizations I'll click on donut chart
I'll move this to the top now from the
data sheet I'll add profit onto the
values and
segment onto the
legend if I expand this you can see
government segment made the highest
amount of profit with
65.4% let me resize this and we'll add a
border
okay in the final visualization I'll
show you how to create a tree map this
tree map will tell you the total amount
of sales made by each product so under
visualizations I'll click on the tree
map let me expand it I'll drag sales
onto values and product onto group so
here you can see our tree map and the
sales made by each product you can see
now we have our report ready we have
created two separate canvas to visualize
our data now if you want to change the
color of These Bars you can simply go to
the format Tab and under data colors you
can choose whichever color you want in
powerbi desktop you have an option to
switch your theme this will make your
dashboard or the report look more
attractive so now we are under the
default mode Let's try out different
themes that's Frontier it's temperature
solar which is a little yellowish the
one which I like is tidle I hope this
was helpful in making you understand
understand the basics of powerbi and how
it works you learned the various
features and the components of powerbi
and looked at the architecture of
powerbi finally you saw a demo to create
a report using Finance data set now
let's get started by how to install
powerbi in Windows operating system to
install powerbi go to Google and search
for powerbi desktop download now click
on the first link and then you will be
redirected to the official web page of
Microsoft powerbi here
you have to scroll a little towards
bottom and select your language which is
English and then click on
download this will give you two options
so based on your processor select one my
system is 64bit so I'll be selecting
this one now download the file will be
558 MB so it might take a little time
now you can see your Microsoft power Pi
is getting downloaded so if we go into
the download section you can click
clearly see it so here it is getting
downloaded it might take a little time
now the file has been downloaded just
run the file and you can directly go to
next since the default language is in
English and in case if you want to
select a particular language you can go
to the select language option and select
your particular language you're
searching
for it might take a while there you go
so the installation process has been
started now you can click on next
and now you can read all the terms and
agreements and click on
accept you can change the location if
you want but I'll be keeping it as
default again if you want to create a
shortcut you can on desktop I'll keep it
as it is now install it might take a
while so powerbi has got successfully
installed you can see the desktop icon
there double click on it and you can
start
powerbi so firstly it is open source if
you want to have a licensed version of
it just get the license or buy now
option and for now let's use the open
source version so this is the bar window
and those are the charts and these are
the data connections if you want to get
connected to your data sources you can
also have shortcuts to that now what are
the steps to connect to data so now we
will go directly into powerbi and try to
import one by one few most commonly and
popularly used data sets which are most
most commonly used uh in a day-to-day
activity rest of course there are uh
powerbi supports n number of data
sources uh but we will uh do something
practical on the most popular ones so
let's let's open our
powerbi now this is my powerbi and first
I want to show you that how can I import
data directly from a web page and import
the data now it is asking for a URL in
order to import data so what I have done
is I have created a Google Excel sheet
with simple data with rows and columns
and what I've done is I've have share
this sheet as publish to
web okay so you just need to say publish
to the web the link as web page and say
done it's it's automatically lished and
say link so copy the link which you have
published on the web copy this link and
then go back to your Tableau paste it
link over here and click
okay now powerbi will try to establish a
connection with this Google doc sheet
because it's published on the
web you need to wait for a while while
it is reading
okay now it has read one of the HTML
tables so I'll select this one now you
can see it has it is showing me a
preview of the table which is there on
my Google sheet right it has 11 rows so
it has all showed all the 11 rows so now
I can go and transform this data because
I can see my headers are there starting
from the second row so there's an
opportunity for me to transform the data
so I'll go and transform it so that it
looks
clean okay so first is I need to remove
the first row which is
the null row remove the top
rows okay and then I need to use the
first row now as a header so you just
click this option use first row as
headers that's it so so now if you see
my row ID order ID order date ship date
all my data is now ready so I can say
close and
apply click apply
changes now this is an example of web
data import you can go and preview your
data right now uh the biggest advantage
of this data connection is that it's a
live data so for example I insert
another
row let me change the order
ID some some I've some changed some
basic stuff and
I it's Auto saved contrl s now I'll go
to my table and I'll refresh
now you can see as I refreshed my power
query editor I clicked refresh all and I
got my new row which is there in the
live data I got that fetched from
my okay I got that row the row row ID
number 12 so I so I have to say close
and
apply now you can see the new row the
row number 12 is now available in my new
data set in the data set because it's a
live connection it's a live connection
with the web based Google sheet okay so
this is one important way in which you
can import data now let's try to import
data from a text file now I have already
prepared a text file called
subcategories do
txt now let me just open it in a notepad
now it's a very plain simple file tab
separated file in which you have product
subcategory ID subcategory name name and
product category key so basically to
which product category this particular
sub product belongs to right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go back to
my get data
option and I'm going to select text SL
CSV
option and I'm going to select option
mod product subcategories do
txt okay so now powerbi has identified
that it's a tab delimited file it has
recognized the headers
Etc right and I can now directly load
this
file okay so now once the data is
imported in powerbi it is like
irrelevant to me it's a composite data
in import I'm doing right so in my
presentation when I'm talking about
importing data there are different
importing modes right import data import
can happen through different ways
okay one is direct query mode in which I
create a live uh connection to the
database which I'll also show you uh
using MySQL and mssql server and also
you can do a composite mode in which you
can have data imported from Excel plus
you can have direct query modes so you
can have multiple uh modes to connect
and create a composite data model and
that's what we are doing right now in
our practical so what we are doing over
here is one we have imported data from
the web second we have imported data
from a text table now after doing text
now our next task is to import from CSV
let's try another one so now I have
imported product
subcategory now I'll
import a CSV file so again I'll choose
the option text / CSV and now in this CS
CV file let me open this CSV file and
show you what is
it so this is a list of all my products
product key product subcategory key
product uh stock keeping unit Etc a
simple CSV file and I'm going to import
that okay so now it is identified the D
limiter is comma rather than a tab and
it has already recognized the headers
correctly so I'll load
it okay so now my products are there
product subcategories are there for
product categories now what I have done
is I have created a Excel mode now so
now Excel I'm using to import my product
category so now I have to click on the
option of import data from Excel and
I'll say product
categories select the sheet
load and now so my products product
categories product subcategories though
with different uh data storage types but
still now the data is imported into
powerbi it is a composite data model now
another very important data type which
you can import is the PDF also right so
what I have done is I have created a PDF
called customers my customers data is
lying in a PDF so what I've done is I've
created a
PDF which has data for some
columns are there like you know customer
key prefix first name last name birth
date marital status gender email address
annual income total children etc etc so
this is the data set which I have
created in PDF so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to select PDF
now and import customers. PDF and see it
has recognized my table on page one
which I'm going to
load
okay you can rename this as
PDF
table so this is basically these are the
different type
of
data types we have imported PDF Excel
text CSV and web page now let's take a
look at another interesting data set
which we want to import is the my SQL
Server data
set so what I have done is I've already
installed my SQL server on my local
instance and there's already a schema of
SQL live tutorial over there and I have
certain tables
already prepared over there like
Department employee Etc so my goal is
now to import this data or create a live
connection with this data set now in
order to
import my SQL datab based Connection in
powerbi you need to First
download
a connector my SQL powerbi connector so
you need to go to this
link and then click on download and
install the my SQL connector based on
the operating system you have you click
on download and install it after you
have done this go back to
powerbi and then give the IP address of
the database in my case it's there in
this
local machine and the schema which I
want to import is SQL live tutorial so
I'll give the
name click
connect okay now it's connected so now
it is asking me which particular tables
you want to create a connection with I'm
choosing department and
employe and I'm just loading them
okay so now this is the exact data which
is there in the employee and Department
in my C okay so this is one example of
how to create connectivity between
powerbi and my SQL now I want to do the
same thing using SQL Server Microsoft
SQL Server so I have also installed
Microsoft SQL server on my machine and
and I have used the SQL Express so this
is the name of my server so which I'll
copy the server name and go to get data
select SQL
server and for now database is optional
I can say direct query click
okay okay now it is showing me what all
tables I can import so in my SQL Server
tutorial in my SQL Server I
have I have these three tables customers
employe Tre Olympic events so I can use
probably the customers one which is
now you can see this is the data the
customers data which is lying in my SQL
Server okay so I can preview it and load
it so now you can you can preview the
data in uh powerbi that this is the data
so I can rename is customers from
mssql and this is
from my
SQL and
okay so now this is not the only uh
data sets you can import now if you take
a look at the options which powerbi gave
what different type and variations of
data it can it has compatibility to
import
from okay so we can just take a look at
the categorization on the left hand side
first there are file based like Excel
text XML Json is also possible you can
evenly directly import entire folder and
uh within the folder whatever uh data
types of files are there it will detect
it PDF Pary or even SharePoint folder
which is itself for
Microsoft uh technology then different
kind of databases SQL server and my SQL
we just saw but it's not only limited to
this you can connect to Microsoft Access
ssas Oracle database IBM db2 postgress
uh sbase Terra dat and then sap uh uh
databases Amazon red shift Impala
vertica Snowflake and N number of
databases which are there in the market
today uh Amazon Etc then it also allows
you to connect with its own power
platforms powerbi platforms data Mars
powerbi data flows data verse Etc azour
there are different kind of storage uh
mechanisms in azour and azour itself is
a Microsoft Technology so it has a
compatibility with lot of azour uh based
data storages like azour SQ database
blob storage uh aure data braks right
aour HD inside spark so if you have
those kind of services running on your
AER cloud services you can even import
them over here
now online services like you know you
have erps running uh or some data which
is shared on the internet if you want to
import it uh that is also possible
through certain products uh Dynamics 365
Microsoft Exchange online Salesforce
Google analytics Adobe analytics GitHub
uh LinkedIn sales if you want to do some
analysis of some social
networking uh you know feeds that also
you can
import then other miscellaneous are also
there web based Hive R script python
script if there something to import get
data from uh Google Sheets like we saw
one example in our video right now so
there are multiple options available
now once you have imported the data
which is relevant to you um in our
subsequent sessions we will see how to
create relationships but just giving you
a glimpse that whatever data you're
importing powerbi autod detect certain
relationships and it will create for you
but then you can go and manually also
change so this is the composite data
model which is getting created in the
back end while you are importing the
data you can easily go and manage these
relationships either keep them as is you
can delete and create new ones manually
so there is no limitation in
that so this is what we have witnessed
we have imported data from different
files types data types and then you know
we have tried to once it is imported
into uh powerbi then there is no
limitation of how you use it you can
create visualizations across different
data sets and then create
your standard
reports so this is the example of
importing data from web importing data
from a database from a PDF and then once
you have data you can shape and combine
data you can basically do what whatever
transformation you want to do you want
to uh make joins merge the the data so
for example if we go back to our powerbi
and if I go back to my transform data
section now as I have now different data
sets available with me I have I can do
any kind of U you know operation
transformation on the data right uh so
like I showed you I uh upgraded the
header row because one of the imported
data was not showing the header
correctly uh or this columns like this
exact one column is extra I can remove
the
column right all those Transformations
whatever I do in the back end gets
captured in the applied steps section
right this is the customer data you can
create uh you can merge it you can
append it uh you know with other data
set right looks for example I want to
create a merge data set of my categories
and sub categories so I can say mer
select the two data sets and say merge
queries as
new and I can select product categories
and product
subcategories
select product category key on both the
side and then they do a left Auto join
so whatever product categories are there
I'll get the subcategories associated
with it and I'll create a new table
which will have
now I have the table which has the
category and the subcategory and
subcategory in one table itself so I can
rename it now to
as
category
subcategory table it's a it's a merge
basically it's a join between category
and subcategory and now I have a common
table right and I can close and
apply so imagine I have created a new
table which is imported created from one
data set is which is Excel page and
another data set which is text
base see this category subcategory table
so now I can use it the way I want in my
visualization reports so that's what the
presentation says right that once you
have uh the imported data you can shape
you can combine you can adjust you can
do whatever transformation you want to
do and create your visualization what is
powerbi it is a business intelligence
tool to visualize your data and share
insights across your organization so
when we talk about bi it came into
existence as a self-service bi tool and
it does have different components which
can be used now before we get into
details of powerbi let's understand what
are the different comp components or
what are the different ways in which you
can work on your powerbi now one of the
main challenges when it comes
to organizations or users is that data
is scattered in different places it
might be in different formats and anyone
everyone would want to use that data to
basically perform some calculations
create visualizations or dashboards
which could be interactive
and that's where they would want to
bring all the data in one place might be
transform it so that you can filter out
and not load huge amount of data in your
system and you can work on selective
data so when it comes to powerbi it
helps us in ETL it helps us in data
modeling it helps in data storage and
Reporting so what are the benefits of
powerbi here are some of the benefits so
extract intelligent rapidly and
accurately so that's basically
transforming your Enterprise data into
Rich visuals and accurate reports for
enhanced decision making now one thing
we already know that when we talk about
data data in draw format might have lot
of hidden information if we look at
different data sets which I'll show you
in the
process it might have lot of meaning but
then the real meaning comes out of the
data if we can create
visualizations if we can create
relationships between different data
sets and thus that can help us in
enhanced decision making now powerbi
supports Advanced Data Services it
integrates seamlessly with Advanced
cloud services like Cortana to provide
results for the verbal data queries as
well when you talk about seamlessly
integrating with existing applications
that's one more benefit of powerbi so it
adopts analytics and Reporting
capabilities easily to embed interactive
visuals quickly in your applications you
can build Rich personalized dashboards
so it basically provides a unified user
experience with customized dashboard and
reports that meet your exact needs it
also has a way where you can have secure
way of publishing your reports so you
you can set up automatic data refresh
and rapidly publish reports allowing
multiple users to Avail the latest
information across your organization or
across your working
community so powerbi can connect to
different sources we'll see that in a
while so basically you have an option
which says get data and that basically
opens up a window where you can find
different type of data sources such as
Excel us CSV or text Json
PDF getting data from databases or
directly accessing data from databases
now before we get further into
understanding how powerbi looks like it
would be good idea to share information
in how you can set that up on your
machine so when it comes to your powerbi
and let me open up a notepad
here so for example I bring up a notepad
let's say when you talk about your
powerbi
components so you basically have powerbi
desktop and that's mainly your
playground or that's mainly used for any
kind of development
activities you have your powerbi
server or you can say service now this
one is where you would make reports
online and
share or make them
[Music]
available to different
buus now that's one more component of
powerbi and then you also have your
powerbi mobile which is mainly for
viewing the information or I would say
viewing reports so these are the three
main components we can also look at at
the licensing information of these so
these are the mains so powerbi desktop
is something which you can set up on
your laptop or on your machine powerbi
server is where you can log in with your
user ID and password and powerbi mobile
is mainly to view your reports now how
do you set this up before you can
explore or start working on powerbi so
here is a link which you can basically
use so if you look into this so this one
basically says Service s Service sign up
for powerbi it says sign up of powerbi
service as an individual normally when
you would want to use powerbi you can
use a website called
HTTP and then you have
basically app and let's say I think it's
called app powerbi.com now this is the
place where you can basically login now
if you see here I have created an
account and if you look at my account it
says aatl do on microsoft.com now how do
you get this kind of email because when
you talk about powerbi it will expect
you to have a official ID and it does
not take IDs which are from common
domains such as Google or Yahoo and so
on so this particular link gives you an
idea how you you can do that so
basically you have what is powerbi basic
explanation on that it says signing up
for powerbi service so powerbi desktop
it's a totally free download and then
you have mobile apps also a totally free
download and here it says that what kind
of email addresses it supports and if we
look into this you have to either sign
up because that does not accept your
private email IDs or you can go for this
one which says enroll US government
organization and this is where you can
basically sign up for powerbi so it
basically says try free if you go to the
website say
powerbi.com or you could go into this
one which I was saying
HTTP SL
SLA
dot your powerbi.com and this is what
you can use or as mentioned you can go
to Power bi.
microsoft.com for example if I open this
in a different tab it takes me to
powerbi Microsoft I can say start free I
can click on this it says try free but
then when it asks you to sign in this is
where some of us face problem because it
does not take your private email ID now
how do you tackle that what you can do
here is on this page which says learn
about alternate ways to sign up you can
basically open up this link and in this
link it says sign up for powerbi with a
new Microsoft 365 trial account and what
you can do is you can basically click on
this link which takes you to The Office
365 and what you can do here is you can
search for something which says say 365
E3 and here you have tried for
free so in my case is translating okay
so here you have an option which says
tried for free click on this one and
then basically go ahead with your sign
up process now once you do that you can
basically create an account or give a
email ID so it asks you to give an email
ID to check if you already have an
account and once you do that it will
guide you through the process where you
can create an account like I have done
now once you have done that
so for example we can go into my this
page which I said HTTP SL
SLA powerbi.com now once you have
created an account you would be asked to
login now I can click and login here and
then basically given my password and
once I do that it takes me to the
powerbi server or service now on the top
right it might say that go for a trial
version I have already selected that and
this is a Pro trial which is giving me
validity for 60 days so this is the
service which I can use now what it
means is I can be using my powerbi
desktop which would be also installed so
once you log into this page you can
basically click on apps you can
basically search for something like
powerbi and that will show up an app and
you can install and download on your
machine now once that is there you can
basically bring it up so for example in
my case I can just say
powerbi desktop and that's the app which
I have installed on my machine and
basically that comes up so that's your
powerbi desktop which is coming up and
it will still ask you to sign in so that
you can share your information
through powerbi so you see here on the
top I'm already signed in and here it
also shows you some tutorials and videos
which basically helps you in getting to
know something more or what's new so you
can always browse that so you would have
your powerbi desktop which would be set
up you would also have your powerbi
service which would be running and then
basically whatever you have developed on
your powerbi desktop you can share that
through the powerbi service now usually
when you talk about licensing I can give
you brief insights here so you basically
have your powerbi service as I said
licensing so you have the pro version
which is
basically uh your
$9.9 per user per month and basically it
has some kind of limitations so it has
say Max 10 gab you can work on uh some
features like incremental refresh is not
allowed you can always look onto the
Microsoft website for more details and
in those kind of cases you usually go
for the premium account if you are a
extensive user and premium account
basically is conditional base so it
depends on your requirements and then
basically you pay for the service what
you use so that's mainly about your
servicing now when you talk about your
server and Service as I said it is
basically making your reports online and
sharing and making them available to
different buus so that is the Highlight
so when you talk about sharing reports
that's one of the things you have an
normaly
detection that's also possible here you
can talk about automation of report
you have security that is you can go for
role based or role level based kind of
security implementation and all those
are some of the features of your powerbi
server and service so it is good to know
and basically have your desktop and
powerbi service set up now once you have
that then you basically have your
powerbi now when you talk about your
powerbi it basically helps you with
various things so this is how easily you
can have it set up and then basically
you can explore this so for example as I
was saying powerbi can connect to
different data sources now I do have an
option here which says get data I can
click on this and that shows me all the
different data sources I can even click
on more if I'm interested in looking
what more powerbi desktop tool helps me
to do so it shows me all the different
ways in which you can get the data you
see here the servers so the database
Services your folders your different
formats you can click on file formats or
databases you can look at Power Platform
so if basically you are connecting to a
platform and getting some Services you
can connect to the cloud that is aure
you have online services and then you
have other options so these are all the
ways in which you can get your data when
you talk about visual visualizations you
see a lot of visualization options here
which can be used once your data is
loaded and I will explore and explain
more about this so you have something
called as insert wherein you can go in
for different visuals or different types
you can also get into say transform the
data now that basically is going to pop
up and bring a power query editor now
that's where a lot of your ETL Works
happen so when you you when you do a
transform data it opens a power query
editor which we can use to transform the
data or change the data or modify the
data as per our requirement before
loading all of it into our powerbi so
you also have option here which says
modeling wherein we can create new
tables or we can work on our data where
we can manage relationship so as of now
we don't have any data so it does not
show this one is activated but that can
be activated this is where you can view
your reports so this is in short
exploring your powerbi we'll see what
are the different options which we can
use here so it basically supports
different kind of data so when we look
at the visualization pain that basically
allows us to create different kind of
visualizations here and we will
understand that
so you can basically visualize on your
different data and create different kind
of charts graphs maps and basically
derive insights from your data now when
you talk about data models that's where
you can basically establish
relationships so when you talk about
data models it is basically used to
connect multiple data sources to build a
relationship now we might have have
different data sets or we might have
data coming in from different tables
where we may want to
basically get insights or get data from
multiple data
sources for our purpose now in that case
data models do help us so for example if
you have two tables let's look at the
standard tables so you have products
lookup table and you also have the sales
table now usually what you have in any
kind of scenario is if we basically say
you have your data tables so that's
basically where your data resides and
then you have series of your lookup
tables so usually you might have say
your data tables here and this is what
I'm talking about which might have some
data for example let's say sales is one
of them you might have some other data
table which might be for example let's
say budget table or might be something
else and these are your data tables now
at the other end you might have your
lookup tables so basically you have
various lookup
tables and these lookup tables for
example let's say this one is
customer this one is territory
let's say this is
product and let's say this one is a
calendar so these are basically my
lookup
tables so we can basically as I said
your data might be coming in from
different sources let's say database or
let's say some kind of files or let's
say some kind of systems what you have
so your data might be coming in from
different places now you might want to
transform the data so this is where I
could say there is your query editor
which I was explaining so you have your
query editor which basically allows you
to edit the data table or basically
allows you to edit the data before it is
loaded right you can hide a column you
can add a new column you can modify your
column so your query editors would be
basically used to work on the data which
goes into your data tables now you might
have lot of lookup tables as I said so
let's say these are my lookup
tables and these are my data tables so
what we need is sometimes we need
information based on our lookup tables
and data tables now that's where data
modeling comes into picture so basically
if I would want to extract information
from here so I can notice that there is
a product key here and there is a
product key here now this is where we
are already talking about say foreign
keys or we are talking about your
relationships right now when you talk
about relational databases you have
something called as foreign key
constraints which is in in powerbi terms
I would say it's not exactly a
constraint but it is more of a filter
propagation instead which is used to
basically connect your different data
sources and you could have basically
cross filter directions you can go for
single or one to one or one to many or
many to many kind of relationships which
basically allows you to work on the data
so we will learn more about data models
when we are doing a quick demo there
where we can talk a little bit about
normalization and
denormalization the way the data exits
this right and then you basically would
want to gather insights from your data
so when you talk about your two data
sources as I said so you have a products
lookup table you have a sales table now
if you would want to calculate the total
order quantity of each product name
which is we are talking about the order
quantity as a information here and you
have product name here now how do you
get that information what we see here is
we would want something like this or we
would want more information so how do we
do that so what we can do is the order
quantity for each product is basically
showing us the same value now this is
because the product and sales tables are
not connected and there is no
relationship between them even if you
would want to take two sources and just
get information out of them probably I
would complain that there is no
relationship EST lished between them so
what we do is we create a data model so
what we do is we build a relationship
between both the tables using a common
key column which exists in both cases as
I said there is a product key here there
is a product key here so that basically
allows us to have a relationship between
these two now that could be one to one
this could also be related to other
tables so it could be one to many you
could have many to ones so all those
relationships are possible so product
key is basically used to create a
relationship you see the arrow Mark and
then there is also this star which can
basically mean one to many now when the
product key is used to join these two
tables or form a relationship then we
can look at the product names and the
order quantities which basically gives
me a total now that's the basic use of
your data models now what about this Dax
so basically data analysis Expressions
now that's a library of functions and
operators that can be combined to build
formulas and expressions and powerb
desktop usually when we work on our data
sources when we would want to connect
them it automatically shows us these
data analysis Expressions however this
gives us extension it basically gives us
more power to work on our data now some
times instead of working on Dax or Dax
Expressions it would be good to go for
better data modeling and have the
relationships established better and
sometimes when the relationships are
established you could use your tax which
basically gives you more power on
working on your data so your values are
calculated based on information from
each row of a table it appends values to
each row in a table and stores them in
the model it increases the file size so
that's what happens now you can right
click on any column to add a new column
and for example in this one it shows
that there was a quantity type
calculated column which was based on the
calculation what we see here on the top
in the in the expression bar which says
what kind of calculation was performed
and that basically gives us the value
for quantity type and that is basically
added here to our existing data so
that's the power of Dax and powerbi so
you also have something called as uh
measures so Dax allows you to create new
calculated columns and measures so
basically here if you see we are working
on
awor sales and then we have selected
quantity sold and what we are looking in
the report is we can basically right
click on any table name to add a new
measure here so we have added what we
call as quantity sold as the measure so
values are calculated based on
information from any filters in the
report we will see this how this can be
done and that basically here the measure
does not increase the file size it does
not create new data in the table
themselves in comparison to what we were
seeing earlier that is your calculated
columns so these are your type of of Dax
functions so Dax allows you to create
new calculated columns and measures so
you have date and time which basically
allows you to work on date and time data
or Fields you have logical functions
which allow us to create new filters or
add more filters to our data you have
text functions which basically allows us
to say transform the data into a lower
case or an upper case or basically get
the length of a string or concatenate
two fields
or basically uh do a filtering based on
some criterias or replacing some content
you also have statistical functions
which can be used you have information
functions which can be used so these are
different types of Dax functions which
we can use in powerbi so we will learn
more on powerbi through a quick demo
where we can U use some data sets and
those data sets could be found on
internet although I can also upload that
on a GitHub link and you will have
access to those data sets so let's learn
about powerbi through a quick demo by
uploading some data sets and playing
with those data sets let's look at a
sample data set and let's upload it and
as I explained while uploading let's
also transform the data so that we can
have selective field or selected data
loaded here instead of loading the
complete data set and then let's see how
we can visualize this or how we can use
the information in this data set now
what we can do here is we can click on
get data and then we can choose one of
the data formats which we would be
looking for so for example I can go for
Excel and basically click on this now
here are some of my data sets so let's
look into the folder here and these data
sets are also available on my GitHub
link which I'll share with you later so
here we have something called a super
store let's click on this and here I
already have a data set which is global
super store or I also have selective
data so let's select this one click on
open now that's basically connecting to
my data source and that will show me
what does that Excel sheet have so it
has different tabs which is orders
people and returns so let's select
orders and that basically gives me a
preview of the data which I have and if
you scroll all the way to right it shows
me city state and then country and if
you see here we do see information of
all the countries
now this can be huge amount of data
which may which we would want look into
but say for example my use case is that
I'm interested in looking for the data
for United States and uh as a country
and all its states so we will do that
when we do a transform now we can also
select the returns Tab and that shows me
these three Fields however the first row
should have been the heading of of this
uh particular data set and we will
transform that now I can go ahead and
click on load but that will load all the
data so instead of that let's go for
transforming so let's click on transform
data now once you do that it brings you
your toolkit that's brings you your
power query editor which allows you to
transform your data so for example we
have uh data from returns tab or returns
data source as you see here so we you
see column 1 column two and column 3 and
that also shows the type of the data
here it also gives me a quick small
option here let's select this and then I
can say use first row as header now
there are various other options which
you can do you can add a custom column
you can add column with examples you can
keep the top rows you can remove the top
rows you can keep errors keep duplicates
so there are different ways and you can
ALS also do a merge query or a pend
query so as of now let's just say use
first row as headers and that basically
shows that now my first row has become
the header you also see in the applied
steps it basically tells me if I have
changed the type of the data if I have
made any other changes those steps will
get added here so it basically shows me
the name as it returns it shows me
applied steps where I've changed the
type and now I basically have this
information now this is something where
you can change the type or you can
basically set it to a particular format
however we are not doing anything of
that sort right now so we can do that
for any of these columns so this looks
good when it comes to orders let's click
on this and as I said I would be
interested in selecting for country as
United States only and and let me just
work on that data however we can work on
all the data so let me scroll all the
way to right and here I have the country
now there are these filters which we can
use so basically I can click on this and
that shows me all the countries are
selected now there is also something
called as text filters which we will see
how we can use to select particular data
I basically have other ways of filtering
the data so so for example now I will
just uncheck the select all and what I
would be interested is in United States
so let's type it here that shows me has
an option here select this and then
basically say okay so that should
basically now filter out and it shows me
the data is United States only and then
you have different states and rest of
the data remains so if you look at the
applied steps it tells me that there are
filters rows now we have done the basic
transformation for this data set on
these two data sources that is orders
and returns so here you have an option
which says close and apply so close the
query editor window and apply any
pending changes you can click on this
and it says apply so for example I can
just say apply for now and that should
basically apply the
changes which I have performed using my
query editor that is I have transformed
the data so that I can have selective
data uploaded in my powerbi now it's
doing that it shows me it is working on
both of these data sources that is
orders and returns so that's done and
now basically if there are any other
pending changes we can just do a close
and apply so that basically has closed
and now you would see the data appearing
here so I have upload loaded the data as
per my preferences now if you click on
the data tab here so it basically shows
you your data fields it might take some
time to populate but if you see in the
country field now if even if I click on
the filter it just shows me United
States now that's what we wanted so we
have already uploaded this data in
orders you can always expand the option
here which shows me all the fields which
are there in this might be this is an
aggregation might be that's an order
date so this is again some kind of
aggregation we can change the data types
so we are looking at all the fields in
my orders table or basically coming from
the orders data source I also have
returns which shows me three fields and
that shows me the data which is returned
order ID and region so the column names
are applied correctly and as we want and
that basically looks fine now we can
also look at
your model so when you click on model it
shows me these two however there is no
as of now relationship established
between them so it says under properties
select one or more model objects to set
their properties so right now these are
not related there is no relationship
established between them so if I would
want some data which Rel relates to
orders and returns then that would fail
because it would say there is no
relationship now I can go to the first
option which says report and we have not
created any report here although we can
create a simple report we can look at
the data so we have our orders field now
we can basically pull out some
information from here we can choose what
kind of report we may want to create so
for example let's go for uh the table
option from visualizations you have
various options here which we can use
this is where you can do a formatting
this is where you can select the fields
this is where you can search and filter
out the data you can also add data
fields here so first let's click on
table and that basically gives me a
table now this table as of now does not
have anything so you can use the filter
and slices
option here which will affect the
visualization or basically what you can
do is now since we have orders here so
this is my orders and I would like to
work on this so let's say for example
country is I can select country as a
field and if you say it shows me country
is all as of now and it says the value
is United States what I can also do is
I'm interested in the states so I have
state now I can basically drag and drop
it here and then the state gets added
here so I can basically say select all
and that should basically take care of
my State field being added here so state
is all country is all now we can
basically look at something else so
might be let's choose
sales and I can just drag and drop Dr
Sales here so that basically says if you
would want to have any kind of advanced
filtering which says filter type so go
for advanced filtering is less than or
equal or you can also go for advanced
filters so that's fine as of now so we
have added some Fields here and that's
basically my data here so let's go for
filters
here which basically should select all
my
Fields now if you see the visualization
shows my country sales and state which
we had either by selecting the fields
and dropping them here or you can in
this section where it says field so you
can for example let me show it again so
I can just delete this I can click on
the table option I can just drag it here
I can basically make it bigger and I
need to add data to this one so it says
add data fields here so now let's say
country is what we are interested in we
are also interested in
States so let's drop that here and let's
say sales so this is also what I'm
interested so I'm looking at one
specific country I'm looking at sales
per state and when we look at sales it
basically tells me that this is
summation so you will basically get the
total sales which have happened now we
are looking at this data here we can
always go to formatting we can click on
grid we can basically increase the font
here we can change the grid color so for
example let's make it for example
blue so I can just select
this and it should basically allow me to
have the G color is blue now I can go in
for the grid thickness I can go for rope
padding outline color so we can
basically make it a little bit more
readable and then we can basically
increase the font size here to look at
the
information and you have other options
here so what would you want to do with
column headers so I can basically have
the font color background color is fine
do you want to have an outline do you
want to have a change in font what is
the text size might be we can make the
heading a little bigger and then
basically you also have the field
formatting so all those could be done
you could go for background and all
these things can be done in formatting
so now we already have our data here and
this basically looks good and this is
basically one of my visual
which I have here and this has given me
some information for sales and basically
I can scroll this I can also make it
bigger so I could select a particular
field if I'm more interested in looking
at the information for a particular
State now I can add more fields to this
so this is my one of the reports which I
have created now what I can do with this
report is I can basically have more data
fields I can add filters to this I can
basically look into all the data here by
just clicking somewhere in the grid but
somewhere outside if you select a
particular row then that data shows up
here you have an option of focus mode
which you can go for you can look at the
other options which says export data now
if this is the data which you are
interested in
you can export it you can always do show
as a table if you interested in you can
do a sort by country sales or state so
for example let's do a sorting by
state and that basically gives me the
data which has been sorted by state
information now we could obviously have
the information here so I can then
change the order so it shows me alphabe
Ally this is the information which I
have so I've created a simple
visualization using the data which I
have and what I can do is I can click on
save so that basically asks me to save
this as a powerbi file which has an
extension of PB iix and I can basically
call it my report so let's say first
report and here I can say country or I
can say
state wise sales in
USA let's say USA and that basically is
my first
report
now once you have saved this report you
can always look on your machine for
example if I go in here and if I go into
this folder might be I should look on
desktop and this is where I should have
saved it so it shows me first report
statewise that will open up in powerbi
and we have created a simple report
which we have basically used by taking
our data now I can also do is I can
publish this if I would want to share
this information so publish this report
online in powerbi service you can
basically select
your report what we have here and I
clicked on publish so it says what's the
destination so you can have different
workspaces I will choose the default
that's my workspace I can click on
select now it says publishing first
report statewise sales in USA to powerbi
you can create a portrait view of your
report and you can do all that stuff so
let it publish and then we can basically
look into our powerbi server that's our
service where the information is already
shared or published I would say which
can then be shared with different
sources so we can come here and
basically I can look into the power bi
and this is where I will be able to look
into my workspaces and let's look in my
workspace so it says this is the place
where I had initially downloaded powerbi
data set it says your data set is ready
let powerbi help you explore your data
right so you can always do this you can
click on view data set which basically
allows you to bring out your workspace
and first report state wise sales now
that's the report which we have
published so let's first check in our
desktop if that's done so it
says success open first report in
powerbi now I can click on this one
straight away and that takes me to my
service now once it takes me to the
service it shows me the report which we
created which we published and it
basically has the option where I can
save it as a a different copy or give a
different name I can embed this in diff
in a website or a portal I can publish
to
web embed this report for Public Access
by anyone on the internet we can do that
we can export it to PowerPoint so we can
do all these options you also have an
option of view where you can change the
view you can basically also edit report
here so you can do that if you are
interested in something specific you can
do a sharing to teams so if you have
your teams or group setup you can share
it with them you have an option of
common pains you can basically view
usage metrix report now that can be
sometimes helpful you can basically go
ahead and go and subscribe a particular
report so if there are new changes made
you will be the one who will be informed
you can click on share now if I click on
share here from my service it says only
users with powerbi Pro will have access
to this report recipients will have the
same access as you unless Ro level
security on the data set further
restricts them so I can grant access and
this is where I will have to give the
email IDs of the people with a message
that I would want to have them look at
this
report right you can also allow
recipients to build new content using
the underlying data sets and you can
send an email notification to the users
as of now I don't have any other groups
so I'll not be sharing it but I have
created a simple report now let's also
look at edit report let's just to see
what it helps
and when you click on edit report it
basically brings up this one which says
your file view it gives you the filters
it basically allows you to add data
fields to this so it is basically giving
access to these data sets which were in
my desktop it is basically allowing you
to give or create different
visualizations now here we have the data
which we are looking at and if say for
example somebody is interested in
filtering the data so you could do that
so you could click on filter here and
that basically applies this is the
filter we have now country is fine sales
might be I can click on sales and I
would say okay let's look at sales which
is more than a particular amount so we
can say is greater than and might be I
can give a number here so so I can say
30,000 and
basically I can say apply
filter so right now I'm applying filter
and I would look at the values which
also shows me the total value is changed
so you have not only created a report
you have published it and now from the
service you can edit it so I'm looking
at particular data here and then
basically I can click on file and I can
save it or I can say save a copy of the
report and let's say I will call it the
same name so I'll say
first report
underscore state wise sales and I will
say modified so let's do a
save and the report has been
saved so now you're looking at the data
here so that is basically giving you
information so when I click on my
workspace
here I can click on reports and that
does show me my previous report it shows
me the modified report it gives me an
option of looking at the usage metrics
report so say for example you want to
click on this one and it will basically
give you the usage metric so let's click
on this one and that basically shows me
the report usage metrics which is
generated so views per day unique
viewers per day you would want to look
at the different platforms who was using
it views by user and this can be
sometimes useful if we would want to
look into this one now I can go back to
my workspace I can click on reports and
that basically took me to usage metrics
I could be sharing it I can analyze in
Excel I can look for quick insights
based on this data what we have you can
basically look at the related
information you can also look at the
settings of this one and basically this
is how you have your data report here
now that also shows me the data sets
option so which basically gives me the
data sets which can be used to create
further reports and we have our data
here so for example if I click on create
report
it basically gives me these data sets
and we can continue working on this so
this is how I have a simple report
created without basically working on two
different data sources but I have
selected some data here and then I can
basically add details to this so for
example now if we look at orders and say
for example this is the data I have and
and say you would want to add some
Fields so let's go to returns and say
for example I would be interested in
looking at the the products so might be
what I should do is I should replace the
report here instead of country it would
be interesting to look at the product
which we have or basically customer ID
so we can look at customer ID we can
look at the order ID which would be
interesting to see if there is a
particular ular order what was the sales
which was generated and if there were
any returns which were happening on that
so for example here when I have these
let me cut out country as a field and I
will basically take order ID and place
it here so now if you see my data has
been easily modified so I have my order
ID I have sales and I have statewise
information so you have basically all
the information but this is now order ID
State and so on now what if I would want
to also see based on the order ID if I
say I would want the returned
field so for example I would want to
take this one and let's drag and drop it
here now that says cannot display the
visual now why is that so if you click
on C details that says cannot determine
relationships between the fields so it
cannot display the data because powerbi
cannot determine the relationship
between two or more fields and how do we
fix that so for example if I click on
fix this now it says there is a missing
relationship between these fields use
autod detect to search for relationships
or create them manually now I can click
on autod detect which will try to search
for fields which exist in both the data
sets or basically I can create
relationships so let's click on create
relationships and that basically takes
me to this page which says there are no
relationships defined from table to
table and so on so I can click on
new now here it says select the tables
and the columns that are related now I
can say orders now those are my Fields
where you have order IDs and it
automatically shows that returns also
has an order ID field although all the
values might not be same but this is how
you can create a relationship and it
says the cardinality says many to one so
you can have basically many to one
relationship you're saying cross filter
Direction is single so make this
relationship active and it has already
helped us basically identifying the
field so I can say okay so it says now
these two tables should be related or
should be connected based on order ID
so here we have this and let's basically
say
close now once that is done if you
see I have order ID I have
returned I have sales column and I have
state and if you see in returned I do
have a value of yes which shows this
particular order ID had generated some
sales and it was for state Alabama and
it was returned and the value is yes so
if you scroll down you basically see all
the values now we can add different
filters where we can say I would want
only yes and no now this is again an
interesting report so let's go in also
into the
formatting and what we can do is we can
look at say the grid option
if we would want to basically say
vertical grid and let's
say on and it says vertical grid color
so let's select this mightbe I can try
doing a black here it puts it in the
right nice table format and that
basically looks good so you have sales
returned and so on and this is basically
the order which I'm seeing here so for
example ex Le if I would want to change
the order and if I'm saying okay I would
like to look at sales and returned and
so on so we can be doing that we can
come here and say for example I have
sales and returned let's try moving the
sales column over here might be state is
uh an information which we would want in
the beginning so let me also move the
states all the way here so it gives me
state it gives me the order ID sales and
if there was a return which was
happening on that particular product so
easily I've modified my report now what
I can do is I can just save
it and I can do the same thing so I can
publish it I can basically continue
using it or I can work on a new report
so let's continue learning and and uh
now here we will also see how you can
load some data and perform some
Transformations and basically get
multiple results or multiple tables or
multiple data sets which can be then
further used for reporting so powerbi
does give you a lot of options now here
you have an option as we saw earlier
that is get data or what you can do is
you have an option where you can create
new data also which says enter data now
this is something which can be easily
used if you have relatively less number
of fields so you can basically add more
columns here and you can basically add
values so for example if I would just
call it something
like um scientist
ID okay and then I can say scientist
name
and then basically I can say uh
[Music]
domain and then I can say for example
let's say year of joining and and I can
keep adding the number of columns here I
can delete the columns right and I can
give this and I can say country so
that's it and now we have created these
five countries uh sorry five columns
which we have given some names and we
can start entering some values so I can
basically say let this scientist ID
be
2234 I can give some name so let's give
Peter let's say domain and I can say
biotechnology I can give year of joining
201 and I can say Germany as the country
and I really don't want this particular
column so I can go ahead and delete this
now I can come here and then I can give
something else so I can say this is
scientist ID I can give John let's say
the scientist is mainly working in
physics and then I can say
2018 and let's say
France and go back here and let's
say 4 five 67 and let's say Marie and
let's say uh she does her research in uh
molecules and let's call it
2001 and let's say
Italy okay and you can continue adding
datas in this way now you can say if the
data is already here so I can say for
example no I do not want the this
particular
row I do not want this particular row so
you can basically keep adding values
here now you can say edit so here we
have to give some Nam so let's say s
this okay and then if you choose edit it
basically brings up your powerbi editor
which allows you to work on these fields
if you would want to make some changes
now we can make some changes here we can
see what are the number of rows we can
basically perform any kind of
transactions here so this one basically
tells me what is the data type so here
we see scientist ID and this clearly
tells me this is an integer however we
will not want to do any kind of
computations here so we can as well
change this so I can just do a right
click and I can work work on this
particular column what I can also do is
I can just click on this and this tells
me that you would want to change it to
date time or you want to change it to
some number so I can just say string
because we are not going to perform any
computation here so on the ID column so
let's say text and I'm changing it so it
says replace current add a new Step so
selected column has an existing type
conversion would you like to replace the
existing conversion or preserve the
existing so I will say replace current
and now the data type has been changed
it is of a string and if you see this
step has got added here so it says that
the change type is the kind of
transformation we did here so that's
fine now what we can also do is we have
the scientist name but we don't like the
column name here so it would be good to
change this so there is something called
as remove or remove columns and so on so
when you do a right click it gives you a
lot of options in applying filters or
doing some transformation if I just
click on this one so what I can do is I
can look at the date time and let's go
here so we have an option which says do
you want to change the type now we could
have done that here or like I said you
could choose the type and do it you can
just say transform and how do you want
to change it so do you want to change it
to uppercase well you can do that and
changes all the values of this
one what I can do is I can again do a
right click and I can choose basically
if you would want to clean up the data
or if you would want to convert to
lowercase you want to capitalize each
word so let's choose that and if you see
here the steps are getting added now now
to undo any particular step if I just
cancel this then I'm back to this if I
cancel this I'm back to my original form
so you can anytime undo your changes and
you can basically work on this so we are
working on this particular column now
there are various other options that you
can look at so for example these are
this is some of my data but it does not
have much information it would be good
to load some big data set and then use
these
Transformations or basically working on
changing the data types as I mentioned
or if you would want to do a filtering
and remove certain fields and only
select particular Fields if that's what
you're interested doing a right click
where I want to create a copy of this
and then basically I can use that
particular copy now what I can also do
is I can add column from examples I can
duplicate column and then I can make
some changes to that so this is my
duplicate column and say for example you
would want um this one to be changed so
we can say remove duplicates we can
basically if you're doing some kind of
change you want to change the format
here you can do that you can use for
other things like filling up and all
that now I can just call it rename and
let's say um Alias scientist name right
and I can continue adding columns or I
can do some Transformations and once you
have done with these transactions now
this one if you see it shows as integer
but is it an integer no this is an date
format so I can go for modeling and
change the formats what I can also do is
I can select this and it says it's not a
decimal it's not a fixed decimal it is
date time it is date it is date time and
time
zone right and you can select any one of
these so for example let's make it date
which makes it more meaningful but then
what happens is when you do this it is
going for the default dates or the older
dates so I don't like that so what we
will have to do is we will have to
basically transform this and here we
have trans form you have change type so
you have date and time you have date you
have time so let's choose date and time
and if you see here it gives me some
default timing based on these values
which we do not like so again filter it
out but what we can do is we can just
make sure that this is changed or you
want to make it a string because we are
not going to do any computation here so
I can give it as d date but then if I
have more Fields like month and days and
so on then you can do that so here it
also has the options so when you have
selected this you have an option called
transform and transpose uh sorry
transform also has various options which
allow you to work on these do you want
to do some scientific calculations do
you want to work on the date field so as
of now it is just integer so we can use
one of these we can do a group by but
obviously we don't have much data here
so as of now let us retain this I can
just change this to text and that's okay
because we are going to look at this
later we can add more data and work on
it so as of now once we have done all
these changes you can go back to say
home and here you have close and apply
and I can basically say close and apply
so the changes will be applied and then
my new table which we just created by
entering some random data performing
some basic
Transformations will be available so if
you look into this
one so that's where my data is it shows
me the columns but there is no
aggregated column as such here you don't
see any summation Mark you just see the
field names or the column names you see
the values now obviously if you go into
modeling there is no or there is no
existence of a different table which you
can join these tables or you can perform
some transactions come back to the data
set so this looks good and we have it
here now obviously we have not created
any visualization based on this which we
can and we can continue working on it so
here this is my data set which is a
small table where we have created some
data and we can use it any time now
let's work on a bigger data set and see
what kind of Transformations we can do
we can then also see on modeling or
basically using some smarter ways of
working with the
data so what we would want to do is we
would want to load some data here so
let's go
[Music]
into sorry let's go into home let's go
to get data let's use our old store data
and I'm going to take the global super
store which is huge data set with all
the countries and the products and the
sales which have happened and we can
take this data but before loading it as
I suggested earlier we should basically
transform the data we should basically
transform the data so that you don't end
up loading everything and you don't work
on all the data I mean unless you really
want to so here I will this Excel sheet
which I'm talking about about has two
different tabs we have used it before so
let's use orders let's use returns and
that basically shows me the data what we
have so I can do a load but that's not
what we would want to do so you can do a
load and you can get all the data but
let's go to
transform make some basic
Transformations before we load the data
so our power bi editor allows us to work
on this now here we
have it says this preview may be up to 9
days old so I can do a refresh I can
select this and I say first thing is use
first row as header because that's what
I want so it is basically setting the
first row as header which looks good and
we have some order IDs we have
the returned If the product was returned
so let's look at the filter here so it
just has yes values which we are looking
at
so it says list may be incomplete let's
say load
more and let's see what are the filters
here so either there might be a product
which is returned or it might be blank
field so that is chosen so that's fine
we have order ID we have region which is
basically showing me different regions
here let's look at orders and orders is
again having your row ID order ID order
date ship date ship mode so you have
quite large amount of data here for your
different countries now in earlier
example I chose United States and then I
was only focusing on the states and city
in United States so we can do that now I
can basically work on refresh so
whatever preview was stored in the
memory we are just refreshing it now
here we have have this row ID and if you
see the row ID is an integer obviously
we will not be performing any kind of
computation here so here you don't have
any row ID but here we have row ID so
let's make
it uh from integer let's make it string
and I'll say replace current so that's
that looks fine it's a row ID which we
will use to search but we are not going
to perform any computations unless you
want to find on an average on row ID or
anything else now you have order IDs so
what we can do is we can filter some
values we can rename the field as we
desired right so for example let's go in
here and what we can do is let's go
into uh customer ID
ship okay and here you have say State
you have
region okay now at any point of time if
I would want to filter out the values
the easier option is that you can select
on this one and here you can do some
text filtering okay or you can basically
select the values from here so for
example if I say let's get rid of select
all what we will be interested in uh say
United States and UK that's the data we
want and then I can basically say okay
so it is basically going to filter out
the data which is for United States and
UK as of now now what we can also do is
how about doing some more filtering
before we basically work on this so
let's go in here and we are looking at
United States and UK related data and
let's look at it is sometimes good that
you can
basically uh work on the data here so
for example I go to orders now what I
would want to do is I would want to look
at the fields okay and we want to we
have not yet loaded the data so if you
look in the background I just have my
scientists because we have not applied
these changes we have not loaded we are
still in the transformation stage right
now what we can do is let's go for so we
can do segment and all these kind of
fields can be used for grouping the data
so we will see that whenever you have a
data set you would already know there
are certain fields which have repeated
values which can be used to group the
data and we can do that we can change
any kind of values which are not going
to be computed on so for example I have
postal code I can use this but again we
are not going to find a postal code
which is greater than something right so
integer is not the valid type let's
change it to text okay and uh if for
example I would want to look at this so
I have done some changes here okay and
this shows me null so for example let me
just rever this back and let let's make
it a whole
number okay so there are certain columns
or rows which do not have some values
and we can basically get rid of those
values so as of now we can do a
filtering here so let's keep the postal
code AS integer or let's change it to
text do a replace content and now now
what we will do is we'll scroll all the
way right might be I'm interested in
technology category so that's what I'm
interested in so what I can do is here I
can do some
filtering so I can basically
choose technology now the easier way
would be since these are categories and
there are only three categories we
really don't want to go and apply text
filters here but if you had some like an
office supply and um Office
Inventory then you could have done some
text filter so let's not do some text
filtering here what we can do is I would
be interested in technology so that's
the field I'm interested in so now you
are only having data which is related to
technology okay and you have some
product names so this is where we want
to do some kind of filtering
so we can rename the field we can select
some Fields so let's for example let's
go
for uh any of the field which I think
might have more entries here so for
example let's go
for Canon Wireless or Canon Image right
so let's go for product names and I will
say
let's go
here now I could have done a
transformation but that's not what we
want we want to do some filtering so
let's go to text filter and here I can
say begins with I can say ends with I
can say contains so let's go for
contains and it says enter a value here
so you would want to keep the rows where
the product name contains something and
it gives you some
suggestion right so where you are seeing
in some values here so for example if I
would have selected this then it applies
the complete thing but that's not what I
want so I will get rid of all this and I
will say it contains Canon now I can go
for advanced filtering also okay wherein
you can select Advanced and then you can
give different columns and what do they
contain what kind of values you're
looking for so you can do that but we
will not go for advance in one step
let's go for basic and let's say okay
and now I should get all the products
which are Canon and you have different
products so this is one kind of
filtering I've done it tells me what is
the category of this it is machines it
is copers it is obviously belonging to
the technology category we are looking
at uh the market which is for this
particular data when you look at the
country we are still focusing on United
States and United Kingdom that kind of
data right so we have filtered the data
we have done some uh selection based on
the data here and what I can do is I can
then basically rename a particular field
so I can do that I can say I'm
interested in um sales which is the data
here we can can basically look into the
quantity so sales is something which we
are interested in but might be we are
interested in sales which are more than
a particular value I'm not interested in
lower amount of sales I would want to
look into United States and UK data but
I'm interested in sales or I'm looking
at if the discount percentage was
something or if the profit was more
right so we can apply different kind of
values here but what we can do is with
these changes because you don't want to
transform and make changes all here you
want to make the changes once the data
set is uploaded so we have selected some
data we have create done some
Transformations we can basically break a
particular column into multiple columns
if that's what we want if we see that we
will do an aggregation based on ear or
we will do a aggregation based on the
country or ear and Order ID right so we
can break this data into multiple
columns so we can do that but for now
let's do a close and apply and let's
apply this so that's going to apply all
these changes it's going to load my data
but remember now we are having selective
or selected data which gets loaded so
that should get be available here so it
takes time sometimes so you have to wait
and then you can go ahead and check here
so for example now I'm looking in tables
let's basically minimize this let's go
for orders and this is the data I have
which obviously row ID if you see so you
have all the row IDs and again again you
can do filtering here but this is where
you have already loaded the data the
data is available and then you can start
working on the columns here so we have
this if you closely see we see this
summation Mark and this basically means
that these are my aggregated columns or
these values are measures which can be
used for calculations so we can see that
we can create our own aggregations so we
can do that we can rename the field as
we have seen we can filter out the data
so we have all the fields showing up
from orders and let's also look at the
returns which basically has The Columns
the order ID and your region so it
basically shows the region here where
was the product returned from and we
have this information so what we are
doing is we when we were doing a text
filter in the previous example remember
it was case sensitive okay and you have
to take care of when you're doing a text
filter you have to give a field which
exactly matches as it exists in the
content now okay this is the data we
have and let's look at the order column
right now what we can do is we can do
some quick Transformations here and we
can basically look for more data here so
let's say we have uh some filtering to
be done now I can do a filtering based
on
my uh product so we had all these
products but now let's do a filtering on
product and then products you have
copers you have machines so you have
mainly two categories right and when you
look at machines it basically talks
about your
PC uh something so let's look for
machines and here we have basically The
copier fields which are more so I can
basically
go for filtering
here and that's the data we have so we
don't want to really unselect any of
these here but what I'm doing is I'm
saying text filter and let's go into
this one now and let's say
contains okay so I'm saying contains and
then I can basically say uh let's say
copier here now that's what I'm
interested in and uh show rows where
product name
contains
copier okay now you can give a and
condition here so if you would want a
specific copier if you are interested in
okay let's also say uh contains and
let's go for laser
also laser and let's say okay so you see
the data gets filtered out here and uh
we have the Sal which we are seeing here
so let's go to sales and we will be
interested in anything above 500 so
let's go to
sales let's go for number filters let's
say greater than and I will say for
example 500 oh sorry
500 okay
and uh let's say okay so that basically
filters out the data and then I am also
interested in quantity Where I would
want the quantity to
be more than one or more than two so for
example so let's go
in here and you can basically choose
what is the filter you want so you can
apply any number of filters now you have
the filtering here you can always click
on the filter and if you want you can
just do a clear filter and the filtering
will be gone so you have all the dat
data right and this is the particular
data we have and here I have say for
example product name now I can keep the
filter because I'm interested only in
these values or I can filter out so this
tells me that when we did a and it is
basically going for laser and copier
right so let's say for example clear all
filters the thing is gone what we can do
is let's go here go for text filters say
contains and here I will say it can be a
copier okay or so last time we did a and
and I'll do a contains
laser so let's choose this that gives me
more entries so either the product name
has copier or it has laser it has the
quantity it has the product name and we
have all this detail here now what we
can also do is we can do some
transformation on the product ID so for
example you have product ID or order ID
so order ID shows up as uh looks like
the country name uh the year and then
the order ID so we can basically split
it up so I can select this and here I
have option of
let's go to home so when you have you
have selected this column so you have an
option of transform data here so use the
power query Editor to connect prepare
and transform the data so if you really
want to transform the data here if I
basically select
this if I just do a right click here now
here it just tells me do you want a new
column do you want to create a copy of
this column okay you want to create copy
table so this is your transformed data
what you have and for example let's
create a copy
table and let's come in here so you
should be able to see
your copy table now so let's go
in and select this
one and what you need to do here is
creen creating a copy of this or copy
table would not be the right option what
we can do is we can work on transforming
this rather than doing it from here so
you have this option of adding a new
column going for a new measure renaming
it right so that's okay but what we can
do is Select this particular column
let's do a home and first thing is let's
go to transform so I want to transform
the data
now let's select this one and it brings
up your power editor again here we were
interested in orders so we are looking
at our data
here now if you see my country is United
States and UK so you can confirm that if
you look at category it is technology
product name has copier and Laser as we
selected so those things are retained so
you have not lost any changes as of now
so this all ID column what we have now
as I said you can be doing a filtering
okay you can select this particular
colum and then you have other things
which can be used to transform here like
you want to change the data type you
want to use first row as header you want
to replace some values okay you want to
run some merge queries you want to do
some analytics so all these options are
here now what we can do is while this
column is selected I can do a right
click now then there is an option called
transform which is basically going to
help me in changing the data here okay
now I can basically duplicate the column
so I really don't want to work on this
column itself but it would be good to
have a duplicate column on which we can
work on so I can do a split column here
if I would want to but let's create a
duplicate column so let's say duplicate
column now that gives me a duplicate
column so we can rename it later so now
I will not work on my original column
but I'll work on a duplicate column and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
basically transform or split this so
again to a right click now you have a
split by so we can say split by by D
limiter or by number or by characters or
by positions so by lower case and upper
case so you can do all of this so let's
go for by D limiter now if you see it
basically identifies the D limiter which
is hyphen or Dash now you can go for
split at leftmost identifier right sorry
leftmost D limiter rightmost each
occurrence of D limitter and that's what
we want to do you can look into advanced
options where it says split into columns
so do you want to split that into
columns do you want to split that into
rows because that's more or less like
doing a group by and you can say number
of columns to split into so we have here
1 2 3 4 values so that looks good to me
and uh let's do say for example if I
choose
three so I can choose three and then
split using special characters so you
could do that so let's for example let's
say
okay and let's look at the data how it
looks like we can anytime delete the
data we can keep it the way we want
right so what we did was we created a
copy of the column then we did a split
and what we have seen is we just have
three columns now if you see the fourth
bit is gone fourth bit doesn't show up
right because I just did a three as
the resulting column so I have the order
ID okay and we can check if there is
already an order ID column so we have
order ID but that has the complete order
ID year and the relatively product ID so
you can see the customer ID you can look
at this one so it basically has your
order ID and then let's look at the
fields here so we have the product ID
which says Tec Ma I'm looking at the
first one
370 and that that has in no relation to
the order ID right so we can make sure
that there is nothing which is
conflicting with our entries now once
that is done so we have order ID which
can be used to categorize the data you
have order ID which is basically the
year okay and you have order ID which is
basically having some more value now I
can keep this data as I want so I can
basically click on this I can go for
renaming and I can say let's say let's
call it
order
ID and let's say IDs so let us in case
there is a particular column and you
would want to look at so just give the
name correctly now order IDs is find so
here we will also rename this one so
let's call it uh
order
ear and that's going to be order ear so
we can again change this to string okay
and here you have the order ID so let's
rename this
one and I have
my let's call order
number right so we have we are seeing
all the steps which we have added here
we just split the data based on the D
limiter and we have now three new
columns which have got added to our
existing data which was already filtered
and we have done some splitting up of
data by creating a duplicate and then
renaming it right so if you
go and look at your Transformations now
if I would have done a split here
straight away then my original column
would be gone but probably we want the
original column because sometimes you
may want to search order ID with a
Consolidated information sometimes you
may want to segregate it based on ear
right now we have the ear field or order
date field here you have the ship date
right but then might be you want to just
aggregate based on year you don't want
to really spend time in aggregating or
extracting the month and day and so on
so my these three columns can be useful
now what I can also do is I can merge
The Columns if I want so we have split
the columns but what I can do is I can
say select select select so using your
control and now do a right click so you
should have an option called called
merge columns right now this is
something which is uh we would want to
merge so let's say merge columns and
let's say do you want to keep a
separator so yes I want to keep a
separator but might be this time I will
give my separator is
a uh colon and then what is the merge
column name you want to create so let's
call it something like um
order okay uh year and then let's call
it num right so sometimes renaming the
fields to a name which makes more sense
or based on your naming convention is
good so let's do a merge and now what I
have done is I have done merging of
those columns so I split the data I
merge The Columns and now if you see my
The Columns which I had created those
columns are gone because you did a merge
you did a merge and now you have the
fields which are
either uh earlier you had something
which is separated by a hyphen and here
you have something which is separated by
colon right now anytime if you want you
can unmerge this by removing this step
right and you can get rid of this merge
column so if for example I would do that
so I have my data back right I have my
data back so what we could have done is
we can select
this okay and then what we can do is
like what we did earlier so you can
basically go for removing the columns
okay you can do a merge column okay you
can select one by one and create
duplicate of those and then you can
merge them right so all the possible
options are there so you can the best
option would be to create a duplicate of
these columns and then basically merge
them as per your convenience so might be
you can say order IDs and order number
is the pairing what you want ear is
something which you don't want right
because we already have the date field
so I can basically say
remove and this one is gone now I will
select this and this and let's go for
merge columns and I want to give a
separator which
is might be without the ear and you have
space or you can go for custom like
earlier we had give a
symbol and then what do you want to call
it so let's say
order
specs
okay right so this makes more meanings
because we already have the date field
so why do I want the ear into my order
ID so I can always be doing a
segregation now based on order
specs right now this is some simple
Transformations what we are doing here
we we are seeing the data which we have
okay now what I can do is I can
basically first apply these
changes so that all my changes what I
have done are applied right now once
these changes are done we can basically
go ahead and save this file so I can
just say save I can go for save as I
have different other options so if you
would want to perform keep performing
your transformation then you can just do
this you can add a column you can view
the data so for now our Transformations
are good enough and what we can do is we
can
basically go back to home we can do a
close and apply and we will be back to
our data set which has been modified so
we can see if the data what we have has
been transformed
so we have ordered specs here that's
good we did not do any filtering or um
we have the filter left here which
basically tells me that there are these
different fields we have not removed
them but what we are doing is we are
just applying a filter to choose copiers
and Laser
Printers so that's what we have here and
this is good enough now what I can do is
what once this is done I can basically
save
it so I would want to call it some kind
of report if you would want to create
okay so let's call
it as uh uh let's say
second
report and here I will say country
and
Technology specific
info let's save
it and now basically I have saved my
data so what you can do is you can go
for creating other report or basically
having this information published if
that's what you want to do if you want
to go for visualization because right
now what we are seeing is we have lot of
data here we have lot of data here it
shows me there are these uh tables or
data sets which we have worked on that
shows
me here in the models but there is no
relationship in them if you go into
visualization then you don't have any
option or you have not created any
visualizations based on this data but if
you go here now based on the data what
we transformed if you see we have order
specs right now that's what we chose we
basically have other fields so you have
ship date you have aggregated columns
which can be used for visualizing and we
can work on this so I can come back here
and what I would be interested in is
this data set is fine but I want to do
some grouping I want to basically have
some selective data in this
and for that what I can do is let's go
for ship mode now this is something what
we have so we are in this data field now
we have this transform so let's go back
to transform
again and let's choose our orders so
that's the data we have and now if you
see here this
is you know huge amount of data what we
want is we want to group them based on
the shipping mode so here you have a
option called Group by so I can select
this I can go in here I can basically
work on okay get rid of duplicate values
but that's not what we want to do you
want to do a group buy so as I said you
can do a group buy from here or you can
choose from the transform option above
and you can do a group buy so let's do a
group buy now how do you want to group
the data so I'm saying I want to group
the data here based on shipping
mode or which is the other column you
want to use to do a group buy so let's
go for shipping mode and what is the new
column name right so we want to
basically find out that you want to go
for ship mode but that's not enough I
mean I can do a ship mode and I can do a
grouping by but you want to just count
the rows no that's not what we want to
do so let's go to Advanced so ship mode
is fine so that's your grouping right
but then what we also want to do is we
want to do a grouping based
on say sales so here for example let's
go for
sales okay and what should we call this
so mightbe we can say uh
shipment wise sales whatever you would
want to call so you can basically get
the operation do you want to really
count the rows no we want to basically
do a summing or we want to might be find
out an average price right so let's do a
sum okay and here I would want to do a
summing based on say for example sales
so this is what I'm going to use for
getting a count of the sales now
grouping by might be we will change this
instead of
uh instead of sales we are using a ship
mode what we can also do is let's go for
a
segment and that would be valid grouping
so it will take a combination of ship
mode segmenting group the data based on
that and then get me the sales which is
which is basically let's call it
shipment wise
sales so it gets a sum so let's do a
okay and that's my more relevant data
which I'm looking at so I'm looking at
the ship mode I'm looking at what is the
segment and then I'm looking at what is
the total sales there I'm looking at
again the ship mode standard and home
office so always remember when you are
choosing multiple fields or multiple
columns for grouping by you are
basically
having a combination of two Fields so
that has to be unique and your grouping
is done based on that so now you're
looking at the sales wise and this is
something as an important information
what we have so we have done some
transformation and what you can do
is you can use other ways like you can
use pivote to get individual values from
it you can run on merge queries which is
basically running some merge queries and
merge the query with another query in
this workbook if you have so you can go
for this now I can basically go for
apply and close so just to add to the
group by step what we did was if you see
here I have removed the group by filter
which we just did couple of minutes back
and what I have done is in in of
transforming your complete data set you
can basically create a copy of it so for
example I can just do a copy and then I
can come here and do a paste and I have
done that and I'm calling it order
summarized but this is my complete data
now what we will do here is we will
basically go ahead and do a grouping by
again like what we did earlier based on
your shipment based on your segment
and based on the sales so that's what we
are looking for so let's go for the ship
mode and we go for group
buy and here you would want to go for
advanced to ship mode and this one I
will go for Segment so that's fine now
we want the new column name so let's say
shipment wise sales
so I want to do a summing not the
counting of rows and I want to do a
summation based on sales like what we
did earlier and then you say
okay and that basically gives you the
data here
now what we have is we have the
resultant data based on the data which
is coming in from here we did the same
thing just one minute back but we worked
on the original data set so what I did
was I created a copy and now I'm working
on this one so I'll say close and
apply and now we are back to our desktop
so it is applying these changes where we
have done some Transformations we have
done some grouping by and what we can do
is once we have the data here we can
anytime look at our data sets or tables
so this is my original one if you see
now I have order summarized I can just
pull out this information I basically
have my returns which we have not really
touched and we have the scientist so we
have all the four data sets here now
what we can also do is let's look into
order summarized and we just have this
data here so this is fine and you can
continue work working on this you can
basically merge columns from two
different data sets and then you can get
the merged column and you can rename it
so you can obviously do that you can
basically do a
uncheck whenever you're are working on
these data sets so what you can do
is if you would want to work on
transforming for example let's go back
here here and say I want to do some
transformation on it so how did we do it
we just did a
transform and you can go back to
transform so you have this data here and
the data what you have you might be
interested in transforming this into
something else and then you don't want
to maybe load this data so you have this
option where you are selecting orders
and then you have something called as
enable load which can be unchecked so
when you do a uncheck what will happen
is whatever changes you perform only
those changes related data set will be
loaded and they will still be available
but this will not affect your it will
not affect your original one so for
example let's say copy and let's go in
here I will do a paste let's say
orders oh I did a paste I need to rename
this so let's renaming let's say orders
and here I will say
summarized and I will say
us so I'm renaming it now let that get
loaded we can perform some
Transformations on it so I have
here where's my country so let's let's
look for
Country yeah and let's look for Country
so here I will go for only United
States okay that's what I'm interested
in and then I can choose well I am
interested in just Central us so I can
basically go for just the central us and
I can get rid of all of these
so now I should have only Central us
data and this is fine and this is the
data might be we are focusing on right
now for doing some visualization might
be looking at sales might be looking at
the product Nam so you have the product
name now remember you don't see any
filters here right because the filters
are coming from the resultant set and
your transformation so if you have any
filters you would be seeing in the top
row now this is the data we have let's
uh let's not restrict it to region
region would then reduce my data but
that's good enough for us I can just say
no I'm clearing off this filter I'm
still looking at United States but I
want to look at all the regions yeah
what we would be interested in category
and that's anyways chosen as technology
which we had chosen when we were loading
the data we have cop in machines right
and we can basically keep this now this
is fine I can apply the
changes I can apply the changes based on
this one and what I can do is I can just
say for now
apply so that's going to apply all the
changes which you have done in orders or
summary or the new one right and what I
can do is now I can choose order and I
can say don't enable this in load so it
says disabling load will remove the
table from the report and any visuals
that use its columns will be broken we
are not creating any visuals as of now
the table will be removed so that's
fine and now I will say close and
apply so what happens is you are loading
the data based on the changes okay now
you have
your order summarized you have returns
you have scientist but you basically do
not have orders anymore so that was not
loaded so I only have this one I only
have this one
and you have returns you have scientist
you don't have the orders column right
now that particular data set was not
loaded at all because we did not choose
that to be loaded right now while I'm in
this orders which
is let's see here and actually you can
drag in yeah so you have order summary
and this has basically kind of data
which I'm looking for so I really don't
need the orders table so you can do it
in steps and you can aggregate this you
can have aggregated data you can have
all the data which is filtered trans
transformed grouped by and then
basically just load it and the original
data set which you used that's no more
being loaded here now at any point of
time if I really
want I can go back to transform data and
remember it is still here it is still
here it's not gone right so you can
basically select this and you can say
enable load and you will have the data
back which you can continue work on
right so these are some quick
Transformations which really help us in
working on the data now obviously if you
have data you want to perform some left
joints right joints you have inner
joints outer joints so you can always do
that you can take two different data
sets mightbe I'm interested in taking
the orders summarized which talks about
standard class consumer shipment wise
sales and here if I look at order
summary I have other details but the
thing is we need to make sure that these
have the
values these have the values say for
example the segment column here and the
segment column here can really be used
to join these two tables so if I create
a relationship or if I create a join I
can basically merge the data so this is
how you work on data we will also see
some more examples on might be modeling
the data using some Expressions to work
on the data so we already looked at
creating a report selecting particular
fields and then publishing the report
onto your powerbi service now this is
the report which we had created which
says State order ID sales and then I
also added this returned field and that
was basically by creating a relationship
between order and returns which we can
also have a look in model so this is the
relationship which is created if you
just place your cursor here it tells me
that we have a relationship between
order ID of returns and Order ID of
orders and that basically allows me to
join the data bring it in my one report
now this is basically your data sources
you can look at and if you click on your
visualization so that shows you your
report now what we can also do is we can
make it interesting now we would not
want to scroll through the fields to see
wherever or what was the order or what
was the order ID which was returned now
I can do a sorting I can filter out what
I can also do is I can use this option
which shows slicer here and that
basically allows me to work with this
data so we have this report here and
basically as I said you can click in
here it shows the data now what I can do
is I would want to filter out
information or slice the information
using your returned either being yes or
having a field which has no value how do
we do that so basically I can drag and
drop the
returned here as a field which comes
from returns now that basically shows me
only the value as yes but I do know that
there is there are some fields which are
blank now how do I add filter to this so
I can click on this one and then I can
click on slicer now once that does so it
basically pulls out all the different
values so you have either yes or you
have the blank field for returned so
what we can do is we can select yes you
will see
only the orders and their IDs and sales
where the products were returned so that
gives me 10
8,118 and I can select blank so that
will basically get me all the orders or
products which were not returned now
this is a simple way wherein I can add a
filter to or a slicer to my report to
basically give viewers a choice of uh
selecting different fields and you can
add any number of slicers you can
basically say I would want particular
kind of information so for example if I
go into orders and we know we have the
state now I do have the state
information here and basically I can if
I would be interested I could filter
this out in my report itself I can sort
it I can look it in a different order
what I can also do is how about bringing
in state here and basically dragging it
here so that gives me the state option
it is giving me a visual which is
basically giving me a geographic
location of all these points so yes that
can be good what I can also do is I can
keep this which basically shows me the
state map might be it can be useful you
can zoom in you can zoom out you can
look at specific information here you
can drag and drop here so that's fine
what I can also do is I can again take
the state and bring it here and that
basically can be instead of my map I can
go for slicer so that gives me all the
values here and which basically allows
users to choose the fields or the states
which you would be interested in looking
at so for example if somebody is
interested in looking at the data for
Georgia just select this one and you see
the map automatically shows you where in
the map that's the place and it shows me
all the sales for Georgia State now I
can also basically select yes and that
shows me which were the orders which
were basically returned so that gives me
a quick overview of statewise what is
the geographical location if the orders
were returned or mightbe I can just
click on blank and it shows me The non-
Returned orders I can again go here and
uncheck the jio option and that shows me
all the states now once you have done
this this looks like a comprehensive
report which can be useful for the
viewers for your management team and so
on so we can just do a save and that
basically is saving my report so I have
this report now what if I publish this
report so I can just do a publish and
when I publish it says okay workspace so
let's say
select and then it says replacing this
data set may impact two reports you
already have a data set named by this
one view the impact I would say replace
or I will say view impact so that
basically takes me to the powerbi
service because sometimes we may have
some reports which we have already
uploaded and updating an existing report
might basically affect my existing
report so it basically shows me the
impact analysis it shows shows me one
workspace there are two reports they
they have not been added to dashboard
but these are the ones which will get
modified so let's for example as of now
go ahead here and let's look into my
powerbi so go back to your desktop and
I'll say no I don't want to replace so
click on cancel so I do not want to
publish it what might be what I can do
is I can try saving it as a different
Port so let's say save
as and now I will basically
say
additional
filters okay let's save it so now you
see the name on the top changes to
additional filters and now it's Sav to
publish this and now I can go ahead and
publish it select your
workspace and basically it says this is
the report being published with our
additional filters with a map which
gives a
geographical uh area showing us the
information and then basically what I
can do is once it is done I can look
into my powerbi service like we did
earlier you can do a filtering we can
basically query this data we can share
it with other users who might be
interested in looking at this particular
data now this says it is done so it says
get quick insights and might be it's a
good on option to look into what kind of
insights it's it gives you so click on
that see the beauty of powerbi where it
tries to search for any kind of insights
which it can gather from the kind of
report which you have built now once the
insights are ready it will let you know
what we can also do is we can come in
here click on
view data set so you see now it shows
your additional filters and here you
have option where it should be showing
your report so let's say View and view
is fine so and if it doesn't show up
sometimes it might be taking time for
refreshing so you can always go here and
then you can click on your report and
that should get populated
so this is the report these are the
filters which I have gives me an option
of choosing all the states and basically
allows me to edit the report and look at
all the information here meanwhile we
can see here it is still trying to
gather some insights from the data and
now you see there are some insights here
so it says sales which is coming up and
it's subset of your data was analyzed
and the following insights were found so
you're looking at sales by ship mode so
it says standard class second class
first class and same day so there were
different shipping modes in our data and
that's what it shows me the sales which
one had the majority it shows me the
profit so which city or state had more
profit so New York City has noticeable
more profits here average by shipping
cost by subcat atories so there are
these different subcategories which we
can look at such as copers and machines
have noticeably more shipping cost
profit by product name and you can
basically look at the row ID and
quantity so this is where you're looking
at a regression analysis you're looking
at row ID and quantity so there is a
correlation between row ID and quantity
so these are two different variables or
fields which are related you're looking
row ID by category
row ID so it says California has
noticeably more row IDs sales your
profit count of region and count of
returns so there is a correlation again
between two different variables average
of shipping cost now we would have taken
lot of time in building all these
visualizations but powerbi has already
helped you in gathering all these
insights and then you can basically
select which one of these is is what you
interested in you can focus and look for
more information based on all the fields
it has given you good amount of insights
which will help anyone who is looking at
this particular report so that's your
quick insights here and we have this
information now once you have this
information this is basically where you
have your focus mode so it says subset
of your data was analyzed following
insights were found you can basically
say
download and uh here you have other
options which allow you to work with
your powerbi so let's look at this one
so this is where we have our report and
we can continue exploring it
more one more interesting feature which
powerbi has other than having your
insights ready to use which is basically
in your workspace and you can basically
use these insights what we are looking
at various options here and basically
you have this option where it says spin
the visual if you are interested in a
particular Insight you can always spin
it which you can always go back and look
into what you can also do is you can
also click on edit report here now
that's a report which has already been
published to your power bi service not
yet shared but that can be shared or
that can be subscribed now once you
click on edit report it has option of
reading View mobile layout you have
basically an option which says basically
options for navigating through the data
set you can go for how visuals on the
canvas interact with each other you have
all these options and one of the good
options is ask a question so you can
always click on ask a question and that
basically B
says some suggestions now you can open
this and it says okay ask a question
about your data try one of these to get
started what is the average sale sort
orders by order date sort orders by
product ID how many ship modes are there
compare quantity and discount so do not
worry that your report has only 4 f so
it has State order ID sales and returned
with some filters but what about you
looking at how many ship modes are there
so it is already looking at your data so
if you click on this one here and you
can see what are the different fields
what we have and you have ship date and
ship mode so this is one of the fields
which it is showing you to ask a
question now what you can do is you can
say how many ship modes are there let's
click on that let's ask this question it
says four ship modes and do you want to
add this to report yes you can you can
let it be as it is so you can basically
keep this question here and here you
have an option the visual is showing
number of ship modes when you place your
cursor here if you see here turn this
Q&A result into a standard Visual and
let's do that and basically it is saying
number of ship modes right so now that's
the power of your uh bi power bi which
has basically allowed you to ask a
question and quickly add a visual to
your report now what we can do is we can
basically save this or you can say save
as and give a different name so might be
I'll just say save because I would want
to have this information and the report
is saved so in this way you can
basically not only create smart visuals
you can not only
relate different data sources using data
models or relationships you can add maps
you can add filters you can add quick
questions you can basically just go here
and say for example you would want to
ask a different question now we see the
fields here how about looking at the
shipping cost right so here I can say um
what is
the uh highest
shipping cost and that shows me some
suggestions let's select that and that
shows me the
value which is great and I can keep it
as it is I can basically convert this to
a visual I may want to keep the question
because might be this question was asked
and uh you would want to see the result
here mightbe you can move this somewhere
here and that gives me some kind of
question which was asked and we can do a
save and that's my report which has been
saved in my bi service the data set is
still there you can basically go ahead
and share this how to connect different
data sources with powerbi so in this
session today we will see how can you
connect different type of data types
data sets like Excel PDF CSV Etc to
import in powerbi for your data
visualization needs so what's in it for
us today we will be learning how to
connect to data different data types
data files like Excel PDF then what are
the different data importing modes and
then I will also show you practically
different sets how to import them in
power VI and use it for your
visualization purpose now what are the
steps to connect to data so now now we
will go directly into powerbi and try to
import one by one few most commonly and
popularly used data sets which are most
commonly used uh in a day-to-day
activity rest of course there are uh
powerbi supports n number of data
sources uh but we will do something
practical on the most popular ones so
let's let's open our powerbi
now this is my powerbi and first I want
to show you that how can I import data
directly from a web page and import the
data now it is asking for a URL in order
to import data so what I have done is I
have created a Google Excel sheet with
simple data with rows and columns and
what I've have done is I've have shared
this sheet as publish to
web okay so you just need to say publish
to the web the link as web page and say
done it's it's automatically published
and say link so copy the link which you
have published on the web copy this link
and then go back to your Tableau paste
it link over here and click
okay now powerbi will try to establish a
connection with this Google doc sheet
because it's published on the
web you need to wait for a while while
it is
reading okay now it has read one of the
HTML tables so I'll select this one now
you can see it has it is showing me a
preview of the table which is there on
my Google sheet right it has 11 rows so
so it has all showed all the 11 rows so
now I can go and transform this data
because I can see my headers are there
starting from the second row so there's
an opportunity for me to transform the
data so I'll go and transform it so that
it looks
clean okay so first is I need to remove
the first row which is
the null row remove the top rows
okay and then I need to use the first
row now as a header so you just click
this option use first row as
headers that's it so now if you see my
row ID order ID order date ship date all
my data is now ready so I can say close
and
apply click apply
changes now now this is an example of
web data import you can go and preview
your
data right now uh the biggest advantage
of this data connection is that it's a
live data so for example I insert
another
row let me change the order
ID some some I've some change some basic
stuff and
I it's Auto saved contrl s now I'll go
to my w and I'll
refresh now you can see as I refreshed
my power query editor I clicked refresh
all and I got my new row which is there
in the live data I got that fetched from
my okay I got that row the row row ID
number 12 so I I have to say close and
apply now you can see the new row the
row number 12 is now available in my new
data set in the data set because it's a
live connection it's a live connection
with the web based Google sheet okay so
this is one important way in which you
can import data now let's try to import
data from a text file now I have already
prepared a text file called
subcategories do txt
now let me just open it in a notepad now
it's a very plain simple file tab
separated file in which you have product
subcategory ID subcategory name and
product category key so basically to
which product category this particular
sub product belongs to right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go back to
my get data
option and I'm going to select text SL
CSV option and I'm going to select
option mod product subcategories do
txt okay so now powerbi has identified
that it's a tab delimited file it has
recognized the headers Etc right and I
can now directly load this
file okay so now once the data is
imported in powerbi it is like
irrelevant to me it's a composite data
in input I'm doing
right so in my presentation when I'm
talking about importing data there are
different importing modes right import
data import can happen through different
ways
okay one is direct query mode in which I
create a live uh connection to the
database which I'll also show you uh
using my SQL and mssql server and also
you can do a composite mode in which you
can have data imported from Excel plus
you can have direct query modes so you
can have multiple uh modes to connect
and create a composite data model and
that's what we are doing right now in
our practical so what we are doing over
here is one we have imported data from
the web second we have imported data
from a text table now after doing text
now our next task is to import from CSV
let's try another one so now I have
imported product
subcategory now I'll
import a CSP file so again I'll choose
the option text / CSV and now in this
CSV file let me open this CSV file and
show you what in is
it so this is a list of all my products
product key product subcategory key
products uh stock keeping unit Etc a
simple CSV file and I'm going to import
that
okay so now it has identified the D
limiter is comma rather than a tab and
it has already recognized the headers
correctly so I'll load
it okay so now my products are there
product subcategories are there for
product categories now what I have done
is I have created a Excel mode now so
now Excel I'm using to import my product
category so now I have to click on the
option of import data from Excel and
I'll say product
categories select the sheet
load and now so my products product
categories product subcategories do with
different uh data storage types but
still now the data is imported into
powerbi it is a composite data model now
another very important data type which
you can import is the PDF also right
so what I've done is I have created a
PDF called customers my customers data
is lying in a PDF so what I've done is
I've created a
PDF which has data for some columns are
there like you know customer key prefix
first name last name birth date marital
status gender email address annual
income total children etc etc so this is
the data set which I have created in PDF
so what I'm going to do is I'm going
going to select PDF
now and import customers. PDF and see it
has recognized my table on page one
which I'm going to
load
okay you can rename this as
PDF table
so this basically these are the
different type
of
data types we have imported PDF Excel
text CSV and web page now let's take a
look at another interesting data set
which we want to import is the my SQL
Server data
set so what I've have done is I've
already installed my SQL server on my
local instance and there's already a
schema of SQL live tutorial over there
and I have certain tables
already prepared over there like
Department employee Etc so my goal is
now to import this data or create a live
connection with this data said now in
order to
import my SQL database Connection in
powerbi you need to
First download a connector my SQL
powerbi connector so you need to go to
this
link and then click on download and
install the MySQL connector based on the
operating system you have you click on
download and install it after you have
done this go back to
powerbi and then give the IP address of
the database in my case it's there in
this local machine and the schema which
I want to import is SQL live tutorial so
I'll give the
name click
connect okay now it's connected so now
it is asking me which particular tables
you want to create a connection with I'm
choosing department and
employee and I'm just loading
them okay so now this is the exact data
which is there in the employee and
Department in my cull okay so this is
one example of how to create
connectivity between powerbi and MySQL
now I want to do the same thing using
SQL Server Microsoft SQL Server so I
have also installed Microsoft SQL server
on my machine and I have used the SQL
Express so this is the name of my server
so which I'll copy the server name and
go to get data select SQL
server and and for now database is
optional I can say direct query click
okay okay now it is showing me what all
tables I can import so in my SQL Server
tutorial in my SQL Server I
have I have these three tables customers
employe TR Olympic WIS so I can use
probably the customers one which
is now you can see this is the data the
customers data which is lying in my SQL
Server okay so I can preview it and load
it so now you can you can preview the
data in uh powerbi that this is the data
so I can rename is customers from
mssql and this is from
my
SQL
and okay so now this is not the only uh
data sets you can import now if you take
a look at the options which powerbi gave
what different type and variations of
data it can uh it has compatibility to
import
from okay so we can just take a look at
the categorization on the left hand side
first there are file based like Excel
text XML Json is also possible you can
evenly directly import entire folder and
uh within the folder whatever uh data
types of files are there it will detect
it PDF Pary or even SharePoint folder
which is itself of Microsoft uh uh
technology then different kind of
databases SQL server and my SQL we just
saw but it's not only limited to this
you can connect to Microsoft Access ssas
Oracle database IBM db2 postgress uh
sibas Terra dat and then sap uh uh
databases Amazon red shift Impala
vertica Snowflake and N number of
databases which are there in the market
to
uh Amazon Etc then it also allows you to
connect with its own power platforms
powerbi platforms data Mars powerbi data
flows data ver Etc aure there are
different kind of storage uh mechanisms
in azour and azour itself is a Microsoft
Technology uh so it has a compatibility
with lot of azour uh based data storages
like azour SQ database blob storage uh
azour data brakes right aor HD inside
spark so if you have those kind of
services running on your Azor cloud
services you can even import them over
here now online services like you know
you have erps running uh or some data
which is shared on the internet if you
want to imported uh that is also
possible through certain products uh
Dynamics 36 65 Microsoft Exchange online
Salesforce Google analytics Adobe
analytics GitHub uh LinkedIn sales if
you want to do some analysis of some
social
networking uh you know feeds that also
you can
import then other misscellaneous are
also there web based Hive R script
python script if there's something to
import get data from uh Google Sheets
like we saw one example in our video
right now so there are multiple options
available now once you have imported the
data which is relevant to you um in our
subsequent sessions we will see how to
create relationships but just giving you
a glimpse that whatever data you
importing powerbi autod detect certain
relationships and it will create for you
but then you can go and manually also
change so this is the composite data
model which is getting created in the
back end while you are importing the
data you can easily go and manage these
relationships either keep them as is you
can delete and create new ones manually
so there is no limitation in
that so this is what we have witnessed
we have imported data from different
files types data types and then you know
we have tried to once it is imported
into uh powerbi then there is no
limitation of how you use it you can
create visualizations across different
data sets and then create
your standard
reports so this is the example of
importing data from web importing data
from a database from a
PDF and then once you have data you can
shape and combine data you can basically
do what whatever transformation you want
to do you want to uh make joins merge
the data so for example if we go back to
our powerbi and if I go back to my
transform data section now as I have now
different data sets available with me I
have I can do any kind of U you know
operation transformation on the data
right uh so like I showed you I uh
upgraded the header row because one of
the imported data was not showing the
header correctly uh or this columns like
this exact one column is extra I can
remove the
column right all those Transformations
whatever I do in the back end gets
captured in the applied step section
right this is the customer data you can
create uh you can merge it you can
append it uh you know with other data
set right look for example I want to
create a merge data set of my categories
and subcategories so I can say mer
select this two data sets and say merge
queries as
new and I can select product categories
and product
subcategories
select product category key on both the
side and then they do a left Auto join
so whatever product categories are there
I'll get the subcategories associated
with it and I'll create a new table
which will
have now I have the table which has the
category and the subcategory and
subcategory in one table itself so I can
rename it now two
as
category subcategory atory table it's a
it's a merge basically it's a join
between category and subcategory and now
I have a common table right and I can
close and
apply so imagine I have created a new
table which is imported created from one
data set is which is Excel page and
another data set which is text
base see this category subcategory table
so now I can use it the way I want want
in my visualization reports so that's
what the presentation says right that
once you have uh the imported data you
can shape you can combine you can adjust
you can do whatever transformation you
want to do and create your visualization
data modeling in
powerbi now today we will discuss how to
create relationships and different kind
of data models within powerbi based on
the structure of data you're importing
okay so what topics we are going to
cover today we going to talk about
different types of data modeling and the
most important part and aspect of data
modeling is the cardinality the
cardinality which you basically decide
after reviewing the nature of data and
after you imported it what kind of
cardinality you have to basically
highlight right and there different type
of quties which you might have heard
earlier also if you are from plsql
background like 1 is to one 1 is to many
Etc we will we will talk about
that now what are the different types of
data modeling now dimensional data
modeling is one of the most popular and
most uh you know widely used uh modeling
in dimensional data modeling you have
Master data uh like for example customer
data dat date store data product data so
these are like you know uh less
frequently changing data sets so there
is an organization right and you have
set of customers their email ID phone
numbers Etc that will change less
frequently as compared to the sales
transactions because transactions are
happening every day every minute so
sales is a more fast changing data set
in dimensional modeling which is in the
terminology of data
uh is also called as a fact and customer
store product which are like more of
static data and less changeable data is
sometimes called a dimension so this is
a typical dimensional data model which
is typically used uh sometimes right and
then there is another model which is
relational model this is a typical model
which we have been using in database
design like you know primary key foreign
relationships so for example you have a
customer who has purchased a product so
probably he might have the customer
might have the details of the product
which he has purchased and you will make
a join between customer and product
table and even uh you can make a join
between product or product type or
customer or product type customer table
will also have a key to the product type
so this is less uh conducive for
reporting but it is more of a
transactional uh relational model model
but of course this is also feasible but
from the powerbi perspective when we
talk about reporting and visualization
this is the most extensively used
dimensional data model and this is what
we going to see in our example now so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you certain data sets first we will
prepare and uh create certain of uh data
sets and then we will Import in our
sample power BF file and then slowly
slowly we will create the
relationships now one important thing
which you need to understand that in
powerbi if you go to powerbi there is an
option that that powerbi autod detect
new relationships after data is loaded
and import relations from the data
source on first load so for example if
you are importing the data from a
database where you have already defined
the primary keys and the foreign key
relationships so uh that is the first
option which powerbi will autod detect
and secondly if suppose you are
importing two different kind of data
sets one is Excel one is csb and if
powerbi detects a common column key
columns it will autod detect a
relationship which you can go and later
change modify manage in your
relationship uh menu manage relationship
menu in power powerbi which I'm going to
show you okay so if I open a powerbi and
this is where the option lies go to file
go to options and setting
options data
load and these are the two options which
are by default checked you can uncheck
it and auto and manually prepare
relationships there's no limitation to
that but if you uh keep it checked then
powerbi will do its job to detect the
relationships
okay now coming to the next important
factor cardinality now before I start
playing around with my data and start
showing you certain relationships it's
very important to understand these four
types of cardinalities one is many to
one right so basically many to one means
that many
orders contain data of One customer so
per order one customer is there so from
customer to order or product or delivery
address it's a one to many relationship
and from the other side from order to
customer perspective it's a many to one
relationship okay second other
cardinality is one is to one one is to
one relationship is only applicable when
you are saying it's an extension of the
current table so for example in one
table table you have employee details
and you are extending the details of the
employee in another table like employee
address employee ID so that is like one
is to one there's no multiple records of
a single employee in the address table
only one employee ID exists
right now one is to many as I said is
the reverse side of many is to one so in
customer table only one customer record
exists per customer and one customer can
place many orders
for multiple products and can also have
multiple delivery addresses so that way
this is a typical 1 is to many
relationship we will be seeing this
example also in our sample data
set and last is the many to many
relationship now many to many is a very
typical example so which I'm going to
show you pra practically and in our case
we will see that like for example you
have placed an order for a particular
product uh you know but there are
multiple fulfillments which has happened
so suppose you made order for 10
products but at the back end when the
company is fulfilling it is first
fulfilling the first two products then
the rest three so basically you the
Fulfillment is happening in batches so
one order ID might have a multiple
fulfillments for the same order ID so
there will be a multi many to many
relationship which I'll show you
practically so now with this background
let's start importing our data now the
first important thing which you need to
import is the master data so first I'll
import all my master Dimensions which
are uh which I'm going to you know use
in my example so first is the customers
table customers
data so this is the customer details
like customer key prefix first name last
name birth date marital status and
gender some redundant columns are also
present but we'll remove
it so my customer data is loaded now
today session is all about this section
of modeling so we will keep our Focus
over here
okay now some columns probably some
blank columns are there I can select
them and say delete from model
yes okay so now this is my customers
data with the relevant columns and the
key per customer customer key now
there's no relationship in this model
right now right because only single
table is there and the associate data is
only imported now let me also import my
another important master table is the
products select the product data product
key product subcategory product SKU
product name model name product
description color size so just see all
the relevant information only specific
to the product is available so I'll
import
it okay now see there's no relationship
between product and customers directly
because until unless a customer makes an
order places an order for a particular
product there is no join right so now
between these two tables the most
important now another table which will
now make sense is the sales order table
sales table
now I I'm assuming that powerbi have
autod detected the relationship now you
can see that because I've already uh
ticked that check box now let's see what
powerbi what relations powerbi has autod
detected let's first check the relation
between customer and sales I'll double
click
this uh joint now what it has done is it
has created a joint of many to one
between me sales and customer so what
does that mean is that one customer has
can uh Place many orders right and that
is that it is detected by the quality of
the data and the data sampling which
powerbi has done you can also reverse
this relationship here I can select
customers and I can select sales now it
has become one too many so that you can
also do manually so that is what I said
what ever powerbi is detected it is up
to the discretion of powerbi internal U
configuration and algorithm but you can
go and change it so this is now you can
make this is by default active so we
want to keep it active One customer many
sales orders cross filter Direction
means that only from customers to sales
is the filter applicable not reverse
I'll come to this with my another
example but first let's change the
relationship so one is to many means
from One customer and many sales
orders similarly let's see what has
happened at the product side of the
relationship similarly powerbi many
sales orders for one product you can for
Simplicity sake you can say products
sales product key is the join now just
focus one more thing please uh also see
the co the column on which the join is
is the grade column grade out column
product key is also here and product key
is also there and it is what we wanted
so one is too many relationship from
product to sales table and active now
looks fine this is something which is
looking logical and probably now we can
proceed further to create a report now
let me explain the cross filtering with
an
example now for example I want to check
in a
report that what is the count of
products
which uh which a particular customer has
ordered okay so what I'll do is I'll
select the product count of product
name now if you
see the and for each customer in front
of each customer name the count is
coming as 2 93 293 it is getting
repetitive because because there is a
oneway filter Direction filter between
customers and sales and sales and
products right so this
join is single sided it means that from
customer to product you can't find a
relationship because it's a single side
cross filter right what does this if I
change it to both it means that that it
is equal to a join between product and
sales and every product detail now is
appended to the sales table so if I want
to make you visualize this you need to
go
here I'll first open my sales
table we can also open it here let's
make click this is okay now if I click
okay you can see the single arrow is
changed to Double Arrow it means it's a
it's a both side filter So when you say
a both side filter it means that
implicitly within powerbi you can
imagine that all the product columns now
will get appended because of both ways
filter you have applied and if you go to
your report now see the change of the
numbers now 40 20 so the total count of
products across all my customers come
out to be 293 now the report looks uh
correct if I change the relationship
from back to single between product and
sales then you can't make a join between
customers and product basically you
can't derive the product count from the
product table see
this if you have to live with it then
you would have to go to the sales table
get the product key and get the value of
count of product key but that is not
correct
okay so if you want a report in which
you want the count of product name and
even if you want a count of distinct
product name so this will not come
correctly you would have to go and
change the direction of the filter which
is from single to both so this is a
typical example there where you want to
use a twood directional filter
now let's proceed further and import
other data set in order to give show you
another example now I want to show you
an example of 1 is to
1 so I have another table which is
called customer details so the key in
this table is again customer key but
only email address annual income total
children education level Etc other
details of the customer is
there so I'm loading the customer
details now you see it has autod
detected a 1 is to one
relationship what is the meaning of 1 is
to one means One customer key only has
one entry in customer details there is
no multiple entry so if you click this
button it's a 1 is to one and the cross
filter can be both or single doesn't
matter because One customer will have
only one value you can make this as
active okay and if you go to the
customer report table you can now
easily associate
a email address with the first name you
will get one is to one
record so now you can see that with one
is to one relationship
with the first name I have Associated
the email ID and for each email ID there
is a Associated first name with that so
this is an example of 1 is to one
relationship so in this example what we
have explained is that for each customer
there is an Associated customer detail
right uh so you have the first name
email address education level homeowner
occupation and total children count so
in this report what we have done is uh
if you click over here so the first name
and the email address okay so there's a
one is to one
relationship and
then and if you
drag the customer
key uh report takes time to render and
even if if you
can so this is the reporting output you
have the customer key first name
associated email address and the count
of product names uh which the customer
has ordered now this is an example of 1
is to 1 now I want to show you an
example of many to many now for that
I'll import my
fulfillment data
set okay now in my fulfillment data set
there is a column for
order number so basically what I'll do
is I'll drag order number from here to
here okay so now what has um uh powerbi
detected I'll do one thing I'll select
sales over here fulfillment over here
and order number to order number okay so
it's a many to many relationship so it
means that per order I have created
multiple batches to to fulfill that
particular order
now many to many relationship is a
definitely a candidate for both ways
cross filter
detection uh Direction but you can you
can check that but definitely uh powerbi
shows a warning that this relationship
has cardinality to many to many and this
should only be used if it is expected
that neither column contains unique
values okay so we know that fact
that's why we are accepting this
relationship as many to many because we
know there are multiple order numbers
over here in the sales table which are
mapped to the multiple order numbers in
the Fulfillment table we'll click
okay now you want to keep uh the uh
direction as both ways or One Direction
that is up to you the way you want to uh
map the report so I can double click
over here and you can even click so now
you can select from which way single
filter you want from fulfillment to
sales or sales to fulfillment I'll
prefer sales to fulfillment and click
okay okay now we have our all our
different kind of relationships over
here uh which we have tried to short
list one to many many to one one to one
which is uh this example and uh many to
many now if I show you further
relationships which you can keep on
adding like for example I have uh uh the
example of
territories now in which particular
territory the sales was done so I can
map it over here
okay so now it's a typical one is to
many relationship because territory is
my master table uh where I have a static
list of continent country region and it
is mapped to the uh territories which
are for in which my orders have been
placed so it's a typical one is too many
so that way you know you can keep on
adding data then you
have uh details of
returns now this is another
transactional table which is about the
orders which have been returned rather
than being you know returned by the
customers so you have a product key and
so automatically powerbi has detected a
relationship between the product key and
the product uh table right and even if
you can join the territory key in which
territory the return has happened right
so mostly the most common relationship
which you will observe is the one is to
many because as I told earlier the most
common relational model is the
dimensional model uh the static data the
slow changing Dimensions the scds are
the master tables and the most frequent
changing are the fact tables so if I
talk about a typical dimensional model
the Fulfillment table sales table and
the teritories table sorry uh the
Fulfillment table sales table and my
returns table are the fact tables of my
data model so what exactly you mean by
data transformation in
PBI so data transformation can be a
little similar to data cleaning so
before any kind of data analytics you
might receiving raw data from website
Source a SQL database or an Excel file
or multiple sources right once after you
receive the data whether it is batch
mode data or streaming data you are
supposed to clean it right you might
have to clean up the discrepancies like
the blank rows or the blank cells or any
irregularities in data such as wrong
data type right such discrepancies from
the data should be eliminated in The
first stage of data analytics so that's
exactly where data cleaning and data
transformation comes into the picture so
you have various tools for data cleaning
and data transformation like Excel SQL
but if you are a powerbi user then good
news for you power query in powerbi can
assist you in terms of data
Transformations so in this tutorial we
will be discussing the fundamental the
most important day-to-day data
Transformations which a data analyst
takes care of in the process of data
analysis is what we going to discuss
today so let's quickly switch to powerp
but before that let's have a overview of
what kind of data we are exactly dealing
with today so we are dealing with
Superstore D and that's in Excel format
so this is our Super Store data set and
we have four tabs here the first one is
orders tab where we have customer ID
order ID date Shi date chip mode and
customer name and in the second tab we
have store St set which has the details
about the customer from where he or she
is the state City postal code and which
category or subcategory did they
purchase and Order sales discount profit
everything right and here we have some
information about any of the orders
which were returned and some people over
here so these are the four tabs that we
are dealing with today now that we have
an overview on the data that we're
dealing with let's quickly now switch to
pobi so now we are on the pobi window
can just discard change
changes there you go let's quickly
import the data from our downloads this
this is the data that we want to deal
with today now it might take a little
while to connect to that particular data
set and load the data onto CPN just a
couple of minutes since the data set is
a little too heavy it's about
10,000 so let's wait shouldn't take
there you go the data got successfully
loaded so you have the option of loading
what kind of data you want you have four
tabs as we just discussed you can load
the orders Tab and you can load the
stores Tab and in case if you want the
returns tab you can also load that and
if you want all of those just load all
of those right now I just want the two
tabs orders and stores now here I can
just directly load to get started
working on this but in case I don't want
any kind of discrepancies in case if I
have a doubt that this data might not be
cleaned I shall go with data
transformation so ideally you should go
with data transformation check your data
first before for any kind of analytical
processes so let's go with that
transform
data and shortly we should be having the
power query window open on our desktop
screens so there you go you can see the
complete data set has been successfully
uploaded both the stores and ERS data
sets now uh let's quickly check the data
from our data set so here you can see we
have orders date right but I can see 4 2
682 and
4253 this is not in the form of dat
correct so this is the simple uh uh step
that we discussed changing the wrong
data type so you can just click on the
lower arrow button over here and
uh we can right click and here you have
an option to change the type correct so
it is considering it as a whole number
which is wrong so you can change it
to
date rep
current so now we are trying to change
the order date from a data type c number
to date data type
so there is some error if you click on
error or if you just navigate onto it
powerp should be able to show you what
error was it and just in case if it's
not working okay we are unable to pass
the value provided so you can just
remove that and try it in a different
way change type to
date and time
zone
date I think this should
be
helpful or if it's not working here
let's quickly check what could be the
error dat
time and now let's try to refresh the
data it is taking a little
while uh we also have another
information that we deal with we have
the first row as row headers so we
should be declaring PBI that we also
have a row header over here it's taking
a little while to refresh meanwhile
let's quickly check into the
stores data and here we have customer
name so let's try to apply second di
proof data transformation which will be
like let's say split column we have uh
the complete name of U the customer
let's try to split it into first name
and second name so by the limiter and we
can give multiple options over here left
mostly limited let's say a person has
three uh parts of his name first name
middle name and second name or the last
name so but we just wanted to split into
first and second name so we would go
with the first left mostly limiter and
split the data set press okay and it
should help us to split the
data first name and second name and we
can also name the column separately as
first name and second name instead of
customer name it's taking a little while
than the ideal time but it's completely
all right since considering the 10,000
rows of stores data and 10,000 rows of
ERS data it is all right not a problem
now let's try to take a look at the a
sta if it has successfully changed it no
it is still showing as an error I don't
know what's wrong
here just maybe
incomplete let's quickly refresh
all inste preview and check if can it
can help
us so there you go after refreshing the
first order date is changeed to date
data type so what we missed is when you
change the type you're supposed to add a
step so what exactly I mean by that now
we are trying to change the second one
as well so just wait for a while and it
will give us a choice if we want to add
new step or not that's when we select
the option yes please add a new Step so
what do I mean by steps so applied steps
you can see something over here right so
every alteration every change or every
modification that you're doing every
transformation you including onto your
data will be recorded as a macro so that
can be implemented if you are loading a
similar dat to set for the next patch
let's say this is 2022 data and if
you're trying to analyze the 202 three
data and every column is similar and you
can just follow these appli steps and
the same implementation will be
automated you don't have to spend time
and doing the same process once again
there you go so this time it has
recorded the step and it automatically
take has taken a new step over here
change type step one change type step
two if you don't want the step to be
added you can just select the red x mark
over here it will remove it and
similarly when you you when you go back
to the stor data set here you have the
first name and second name split
successfully and uh now uh let's say you
want to have unique uh customer data
right in that scenario you can just even
remove duplicates from this particular
column just remove duplicates and you'll
just have unique data it's possible that
one customer might have come here to buy
the same uh Pro you know buy the same
product from different dates or One
customer might have uh done a repeated
purchase so it's possible but again if
in case if you just wanted to know if
there is a way to eliminate duplicate
entries then you can do that so for now
let's not delete the customer IDs here
because one customer might have visited
the same store for multiple times and
might have purchased a different uh
product or might have uh made the same
order with multiple products right so
there is a possibility for that let's
not disturb the data set so I just
wanted you to know if there is a way to
eliminate the duplicat from the data set
yes it is now let's also check another
possibility of data transformation so
let's say you wanted to add a new column
and identify or include some
mathematical operations for now let's
say I have sales quantity discount and
profit but I don't know what's the the
rate right so here the sale is for2 $61
and quantity is two but I don't know
what's the rate of one for so I can
include that you can just select the
last column or whether you want a new
column just go to the add new column
here and here you can just uh choose the
custom
column should be somewhere over here
yeah this is the custom column and now
if you click on the custom column you
can rename the custom clock colum to
rate of
product and here you can choose the
mathematical operations to be applied on
the columns so sales column
insert or double click divided by
quantity okay now it should give you the
rate of each product individual
product it is take some sizable time
which shouldn't take so long so there
you go you have the rate of product and
now let's say you want to combine
multiple data sets for example here I
have stores data set but my stores data
set doesn't have any data related to
orders and orders does not have any data
related to customers now I want to
combine these two is there a way yes you
can do that now let's get back to stores
and here go to home option and here you
have something called merge queries so
now the stor data set has been selected
in the first data set here just select
the dropdown and select the second data
type which is orders so here you can see
stores with the current one which is in
the first place now select based on
which primary key you want to combine
both so I want to go with customer ID
because both of my data sets do have
customer IDs so I'll go with customer ID
and both data sets will be combined at
the end at the last column powerbi will
show me a new table not a new column it
will give me a table combined with all
the columns in one column you just have
to expand the column and select which
columns from the second data set you
want to include in your overall data set
so let's do that practically so here you
can see I just have tables if I select
the expand column option over here you
can see I have a lot of uh columns here
so just deselect everything I do have
row ID I do have a customer ID what I
need is order ID order date ship date
shipment mode and customer name I do
have it so that's all I need so just
press on okay and I should have them
included in my new data set all
together it might take a little while
so there you go we have the new orders
ID order date shift date and shift mode
added to our data set now just click on
close and
apply and your data set is already for
data analysis apply changes it is taking
a little time so at the end you just
have to click on the apply changes and
your data will be ready for analysis so
that's exactly how you can perform data
transformation in powerbi desktop
version so there you go the reset got
successfully loaded all over here and
you can just drag and drop them onto the
visualization spot and you can work on
your data yes so now the powerp visuals
are on the screen you can see we have
file home and add data to your report
visualizations filters data Etc right
for now I think we don't have any data
we can quickly import the data onto this
particular platform and start an
analysis but before we get started with
that everybody knows there are simple
tricks to create all the type of
visualizations right if you expand if I
if I could expand my screen here you can
have all these visuals and let's say if
I just double click here and if I want
any type of visual it'll just show me
the visual right let's say I want a bar
graph for the sales happening in all the
regions so I'll just double click I'll
to it down give me a bar graph for sales
right it will give you and just in casee
you wanted the pie chart for the country
wise you can just give country-wise
sales py chart right but now let me tell
you a few things correct so if you are
using a pie chart and if you are dealing
with let's say a lot of companies or I
mean countries a lot of countries like
20 countries or 25 countries right in
that scenario pie chart look a little
cluttered right and let's say you wanted
to find out the sales that are happening
in the region wise and you asked power
to create a line graph for that that
would not give you the proper visual
that will not give you the proper
visualization to be honest right so as a
beginner if you are learning powerbi the
most fundamental thing is not just
understanding how the tools in the
powerbi work what kind of visualizations
you have the most critical thing that
you will need to know after
understanding the basics is what type of
chart is to be used for what kind of
visualization right so that's exactly we
are going to discuss today what kind of
data requires what kind of visualization
let's say I'm working with date data
type let's say I'm working with sces
data type let's say there is a
requirement where I need to present the
data in form of table or a card then
what are those scenarios and if I want
to use the pie chart or bar graph then
what kind of data types that I need to
deal with what are the situation where I
need to use the bar graph and where I
shouldn't right a few basic fundamentals
that we will be dealing with today so we
have uh a wide variety of bar graphs in
the first row and a wi variety of line
graphs in the second row which deal with
the line graph area area graph ribbons
Etc and in the third row we have
waterfall funnel scatter plot pie chart
donut chart tree map and next we have
map and right filled map and we have the
gauge cards and everything right and
here we also have a kpi right so will
also go through a kpi uh type of chart
and if you want to learn about the kpis
exclusively then we have the kpi
tutorial and powerbi lined up in this
particular Series so you can also go
through that and after that we have some
slicers and we have tables and we have
Matrix right so a wide variety of charts
available correct so we will try to
understand the major ones the first true
bar graph which are the scenarios where
you need to use the bar graphs next to
we have the line right line area so all
these come under one uh kind of uh set
they are similar to one another so which
is a scenario where you can use a line
graph which is a scenario where you can
use a waterfall or a funnel chart which
is a scenario where you can use a
scatter plot which is a scenario where
you can use a pie chart right a wide
variety of of probabilities a wide
variety of permutations and combinations
so what are the exact needs what are the
exact visualizations that carry a value
that carry a meaning to the stakeholder
which are those particular charts which
explain the numbers in the right way
possible so that's the point of today's
discussion so to begin with let's import
the data first from the Excel document
so we will be using the Excel data over
here just click okay now you have a wide
VAR of tables which are present in that
particular workbook we are dealing with
the data tab so just click on it select
and load if there are any mistakes or if
there are any discrepancies powerbi will
let you know and it will also it has the
caliber to also fix those particular
data rows right so there is one or seven
errors right now you can choose to close
but the overall tutorial is about
learning the type of visualization right
so seven rows out of 10,000 will not
make a huge difference for us right now
because we are trying to just understand
the basic understanding of what type of
charts to use so I'll just quickly close
this but in case if you want to fix you
can just click on this view errors and
the power query will open up in the
background you can just switch to the
power query Tab and fix the data rules
where they really need to be fixed right
so let me close it for now and now in a
short notice you can see we have the
data loaded here now we have two types
but if you let me let us imagine that
you are on tblo and on tblo you have two
things dimensions and measures right so
measures is self-explanatory anything
that deals with numbers is called as
measure and anything that deals with
characters or names or anything such
which is not a number is considered as a
dimension right so here we have category
City Country customer ID so these are
the ones which can be considered as
dimensions and where you have a
summation logo or a mathematical symbol
right in front of it can be considered
as a measure right now let's say we
wanted to create the month-on-month
sales report correct which deals with
the data type so just uh date data type
right just remember whenever date is
included in your parameters either
you're adding it to the rows or columns
just make sure that you are are using
the line chart which is over here so
let's quickly rename our page to line
charts or
graphs
correct now we have named that now you
can either choose to double click and
add that and then here you have xaxis
and y axis or you know you can just drag
the order date expand this order date
and the hierarchy is over here so if you
want to go with the month on month you
can simply add this to x-axis and you
can have your sales data somewhere over
here drag this to Y AIS this is one way
of creating it but in case if you don't
want to waste time in this particular
huge uh process you can just choose to
Simply double click on the canvas and
write it on here line
chart sales
click and there you go right brilliant
now if you choose to Spotlight or you
can just expand this right and if you
choose the spotlight you can see a
vertical line showing you the numbers
correct we start from January and all
the way to December right and here you
have the month on-month sales so
remember whenever the date data type is
included in one of your param
then the best way to represent the best
way to visualize the reports will be the
line gra right with that let's switch to
the next one now since we were supposed
to discuss the Barra first but let's
it's it's okay not a problem so let's
discuss the bar charts now let us know
the DAT at first so we have sales profit
discount numbers Etc right and we have
region wise city-wise category wise
country wise so let us go with category
now let us go with category and try to
build a bar graph just double click
anywhere and category okay bar
graph okay if not category you can also
choose to have subcategory Okay g r a p
just take care of your spellings I think
I missed an R over here bar graph
subcategory enter save
there you go so you have your chart
right here if you just expand it you can
see we have a wide variety of
subcategories and powerbi was kind
enough for us to you know sort the data
in form of highest uh um ticket price or
highest selling product in the first
place and the lowest selling product in
the last place so this is how the bar
graphs work but just in case if you you
can tell me why could we go with a let's
say pie chart right let a soier check
there if I just click on this what
happens you can see a lot of cluttered
data right you have a lot of
subcategories here more than maybe 10
right so in this scenario the visuals
are a little displeasing and you don't
have the accurate value over here just
undo it and you have the bar graph which
is a a little clearer to look at a
little more you know decent to
understand what's happening you can just
focus on the top five over here and you
can understand what's going on right now
you can just rename them
as and you can choose to go with any
kind of paragraph vertical or horizontal
or in case if you have a few more let's
say we go with the category first and
under the category you have subcategory
then you can also go with that and you
have an overlapping type of graphs over
here stacked bar graphs which can show
you in that particular category which
was the product which was highest
selling right now you can also add that
whereas the category right you can just
choose
that okay so I think we can open a new
tab and okay so we have the bar graph
next we have waterfall so let's open a
and let's name it as
waterfall so waterfall is uh something
which performance of that particular uh
property or that particular entity let's
say I wanted to find out the year on
year or datawise performance of that
particular subcategory in those
scenarios I can go with waterfall so
just simply double click and ask PP to
create a waterfold
model chart
Enter space
sale there you go so it's giving you the
period over period sales report of
subcategories and the green line
indicates that it is slowly growing in
terms of sales and sub and the the red
one shows the decline in sales which is
not happening anywhere and this is the
total the overall you know the overall
subcategories so it'll give you waterall
model and the overall total of that
particular uh segment is this much and
now we have dealt with subcategory uh
waterall model and let's try to create a
ribbon chart so ribbon chart and the
area chart those are similar to one
other stacked area area and ribbon chart
so ribbon chart will give you the
performance of that particular product
in the uh timely if you want to see the
performance of that particular product
in measured in terms of time let's say
uh month on month quarter on quarter
year on year day by day that can be done
using the ribbon chart similar to the
line chart but anyways let's take a look
I'll name it as ribbon and just double
click the PB
canvas ribbon chart I just ribbon
subcategory
enter sale there you go if you write
order month you can also track the
monthly performance of those products
right you can see a study deine you can
see a study upline and uh so here you
can see the months and here you can see
the different colors of months the
different colors represent the months so
here are the products and based on the
products how is the monthly performance
right is it declining or is it um
increasing can or find it out you can
basically find out that and uh moving
ahead we will deal with u scatter right
so first we dealt with the bar graphs
next we dealt with the line graphs and
now we also dealt with waterfall funnel
which is something similar next we have
stacked chart scatter plot chart right
now scatter plot is a little different
let's say you're dealing with numbers
only numbers nothing different
usually what we do is we carry out a
dimension and a measure right but in
this scenario you want to deal with only
numbers let's say you are providing some
discount on all your products and you
wanted to know the profit against the
discount offer here you're dealing with
two numbers profit and discount right so
in those scenarios what do you do so
that's when you find out by using this
scatter plot just double click on the
canvas write it down as build Mia
scatterplot just check the spelling s c
a r scatter
discount enter and profit now it will
create a scatter plot based on discount
and against the profit now you can give
some uh Dimension you can go with
subcategory there you go now you have
the profit obtained against discount
offered based on different subcategories
just expand it and you can see in which
subcategory what kind of discount was
offered and what kind of profits did you
make so 25% uh uh discount was being
offered on accessories and you made a
profit still you made a profit of
$33,000 and here you can see almost
200 discount was offered and still you I
think that is one plus one offer or
maybe end of the season sale but still
they made a profit based on some
parameters and here you can see the
least discount and highest profit okay
the least profit and highest discount is
in terms of tables which is 33% the
maximum out of everything and uh they
still did not manage to earn some good
profits out there so this is how you
create uh scatter plot just quickly name
it as scatter and next we can deal with
the pie chart now just double click on
the canvas pie chart
region tail so you have four to five
regions here and using a pie chart would
make a good uh impact on this particular
visual as everything seems clear and you
can easily make out which particular
region made the highest sale by just
looking at the size of these pieces
right now let's quickly name this as
p and now let's move to the you can just
uh you know you can use the same data
for creating a donut craft you can use
the same data use to create a tree map
and yeah those are similar to one
another and let's let's quickly jump and
now let's create some maps right now
when do you need to use map type charts
let's say you data set has some
geographical data something like City
something like country something like
continent right or longitudes latitudes
anything which gets in touch or gets in
line with the geographical data then you
can proceed and build the map data types
I mean the maps correct so something
which is related to the map data type
you can build a m now let me double
click on the canvas and ask powerbi to
create a
map
country
sales there you go you have as simple as
that you have the country-wise sales on
pap PI right here you can also choose to
have fill map which will show you how
much sale is happening the darkest color
will indicate the highest sale and the
lightest color will indicate the lowest
sale now moving ahead we have the cards
and gauge so cards and gauge completely
similar to each other just click on the
power double click we can write card
country okay let's go with region
because we don't want to go with or you
can we don't want to have multiple cards
we just want to have three to four cards
on our dashboard so we'll go with
category sa so you'll just have a card
here right you can just keep it anywh on
the corner in terms of real time
dashboard you you can just keep it
anywhere and uh let's name it as card
now let's proceed and create a kpi so
multi row card you can also create a
multi row card let's say you have uh
let's go back to card and check it once
so if you create a multirow card we have
three categories and you can also add
add the subcategories of each category
so that's similar to a multi- row card
correct now let's go back to the last
type or we have kpis and uh table so
kpis and table are completely similar to
each other let's try to go with the kpi
now we have discount profit sale and uh
quantity correct so kpi is something
which gives you the direct real time
number of what's happening with your
realtime dashboard correct now how many
number of you know how many number of
products are sold what's the overall
sale that we performed what's the
overall profit that we receive what's
the overall discount that we offer in
terms of one single uh dashboard you can
create a kpi for that now let's let me
create a kpi discount first that's as
easy as that now kpi for the profit
enter there you go now double click kpi
for sale enter there you go and lastly
kpi for
quantity there you go now that's how you
create the different types of charts so
basically if you integrate all these
charts into one page or One dashboard or
one canvas that's what you call as a
realtime interactive dashboard in Pap
pii and again coming back to the slice
if you were using Excel you might have
to interconnect each and every single
chart using the report connection option
but in Pia you don't have to create that
particular report connection process you
can just click on the uh s or slices any
of the chart and you can click on the
any of the options let's say you wanted
to come and find out country wise sales
you can just click on the country
provided right so here somewhere you had
yeah you have Jan Feb and everything
right so if you just click on Jan every
chart available on the powerbi dashboard
will connect to it uh connect to the
different you dependent charts and give
you a real time information without
having to create or report connections
to each other right so basically if you
just add all these charts onto one
particular canvas that's when you get
the real time interactive dashboard in
powerbi and so I hope you have
understood what kind kind of chart you
need to use based on what kind of uh
data you have so we are on the powerbi
window right now so here we can see we
have already loaded the data we have the
filters visualizations Etc and we have
the canas over here right so in the
visuals section if you closely observe
you have the kpi over here right so you
can either select and drag it onto the
canvas or you can just simply double
click and create a kpi but before that
what exactly is a kpi right it's the key
performance indicator right it's a full
form of kpi so what exactly is key
performance indicator let's say we have
the sales dashboard over here sales
status over here right now we have
region wise sales we have country-wise
sales we have region wise profits we
have region wise uh disc scans we have
quantity right so it's like a visual
it's like a number clear literal
readable number right on top of your
dashboard right so if you just want to
have a quick glance of how many number
of sales you made how's the profit
happening how's the sale happening how's
the discount that you're getting right
and how many number of quantity of
certain product is been sold in a
segment right so those are the key
performance numbers which will be
available right on top of your dashboard
so that's exactly what you call as a kpi
now how do you create a kpi so one way
is you can just hold the kpi and drag it
onto the can or so this is one way of
creating the kpi let's remove this now
another simplistic way of creating the
kpi is just double click anywhere on the
dashboard or the canvas and you will
have this so so just write what kind of
K you want to create so I want to create
kpi for sales just create that and you
have your kpi there now on another one
kpi
discount just click on that you have the
kpi for discount double click once again
kpi for profits you have the kpi for
profits now kpi for
quantity there you go that's how you
create kpis in PP should you need to
arrange the kpi sizes or color or
background you can also do that by just
simply playing around these sections
over here right the background or the
the outline section over here you can
just play with it you can increase the
size decrease the size add a background
you have a setting over here you can do
anything that you want right now we will
discuss about calculated columns now so
far what we have done as per our last
session is that we did data modeling on
the different data sets which we had
imported in powerbi like products sales
data returns fulfillment customer
details uh and customer Master data
calendar details Etc so in the last
session we prepared a data model and
established the relationships between
these different data sets like 1 is to
one 1 is to many many to one 1 is to one
Etc and we saw the examples now once our
relational model is uh prepared our data
model is prepared now our next activity
is to create certain addition
columns which we want to derive bases
the data which we have imported so for
example I'll start with my product data
set now in my product data set I want to
introduce a column which basically
categorizes that if any product which
has a color uh you know red black or
gray I'm going to tag it as a colored
product rest I'm going to say not a
colored product right so all these are
like example of bite type product SK use
so for that now in order to introduce a
new column you just need to do what you
need to select the table in the data
grid go to the table tools and say new
column okay so column will get appended
to the rightmost part and you will start
seeing a uh formula section typical to
like you get in your Excel now I'm going
to say that the name of my column is
going to be bike type color okay and I'm
just creating a if condition
if
product
color is equal
to
Black okay
or or if it is equal to red or if it is
equal
to
gray then say yes it's a colored product
I'll
say
no okay so now you can see Bas is the
product color red and black they are
saying bike type color Yes blue is no
multi is no etc etc so this is a classic
example of an if and else condition
based conditional
column okay so you can create such
columns now second column custom column
which I want to create is I'm going to
call as
discount now basis the pricing of my
products I want to associate certain
discounts which I'm ready to give to my
customers Bas is the product category
like what is the pricing of the category
again I'm going to use make use of if
else but in a nested way so if I'm
seeing if
my
product price is less than 100 then I
will
give 0 %
of uh 0 percentage of uh discount so 0
into product price just to keep it
consistent now I'm
seeing else if less than 100 than zero
else I'll check again that
if the price
is less
than 500 then I'm ready ready to give 1%
discount on the product
price
else I'll move further so like this I
have created a
formula so what I'm saying is if product
price is less than 100 give 0% if it is
less than 500 then give 1% less than
2,000 then
1.5% less than 3,000 then 2% and
otherwise else less less than 3,000 if
it 2% else 3% right now after this
column is
created now you can check right so this
see the product price for this
particular product it is less than 100
so that's why there's no discount it is
uh between 100 to 200 then this has been
given a 1% discount so like this all the
discount column is now calculated now
this column is available just like a
regular column in my product
table now after this I'll go to my sales
table now in sales table I want to
identify
uh create a column called as cost there
is no product cost column over here so
that will be
derived so let's create a
column called as
cost and it is derived by order
quantity into now the cost of the prod
product is in the product table and I
know I've already created a relationship
between product and sales
table so I just need to select the
product cost column now only keyword
which I have to use in powerbi is the
related keyword so this will pick up the
relation and now for this particular
sale order the cost has already been
been derived so this order number this
is the cost for which uh the product has
is the costing of the product for this
particular
order
okay now I'm going to create another
conditional column over here called as
order
status I'm saying if any order whose
order quantity is greater than
two then for my organization it's an
urgent order else it is
a normal order
oh
sorry
I lost
it so this is
my order status column and I have my
order
quantity urgent or
normal so any order which has order
quantity one is normal any order which
is having order quantity as greater than
two is urgent you can see this so
there's
a this whole
powerbi uh tabs and sheets allow you to
also review the data what you're doing
so it's very convenient
now I have my sales data now what I want
to bring within the sales is my discount
column so here also I want to bring the
discount which I have
created so I'll say
[Music]
discount discount will be order
quantity
into
related product discount right so the
discount calculated column which I had
created under products I'll bring over
here now I creating the order level
discount so if you see for this
particular order there's a 25
uh uh you know for 25 rupee discount at
the cost is 100,000 rupees okay
okay and what is the order price now so
I have taken the order cost the discount
now I have to create a column called as
price order price so that will be
again order
quantity into
related price which is per
product price
enter okay so now I have the cost the
discount and the price right available
with me now I want to calculate the
total uh total revenue total profit and
loss right
per order how
much so first I'll calculate per order
how much revenue I'm generating so now I
have to generate a column called as
Revenue
revenue is
price minus
discount so 1,700 - 25 1700 - 25 2071 -
42 and if I want to calculate the profit
per
order then it is
revenue Minus cost
okay so now you can see you know typical
custom columns calculated columns which
we have created are all playing around
with the number numeric values numeric
data primarily and trying to give
inferences into per order cost discount
per order price revenue and profit so
typical calculation columns which I have
prepared in front of you
now let's take a look at other different
variations of custom columns uh I'll
create certain columns for text base
custom columns calculated columns uh
using text Bas data so I'm now moving
towards my customer table in which I
have customer key prefix first name last
name birth date marital status and
gender
now I want to create a new column in
which I want to derive the age of each
customer as of today right so I'll use
another function a date function called
as date diff
now date diff so I want the difference
between the birth date of the
customer and as of today in
years okay so this customer as of today
68 year old one is 74 68 57 Etc so this
is one derivation of uh calculated
column of age
let's take another example now this is a
text based column where I want
to derive the full name of the
customer now here I'll say first
lower case in lower case I'll
concatenate the
prefix then
end
space
end first
name
ment space
ENT last
name and closing brackets
Etc full name
okay so this is an example of full name
in lower
cases now another calculated column
conditional column at the customer level
I want to identify a flag which says who
is my Target customer bases the
demographics shared over here Target
customer so I'll say if
the marital status is equal to
M
and total
children
three and total children annual income
so okay so let me change the logic a bit
so marital status is M and
age
is less
than
50 these customers are my Target
customers okay so I would
say
yes else
no see this his marital status is
married Logan and age is less than 50
else everyone so if I try to filter
so these are the my Target
customers 69 out of 1178 so this is just
a conditional column but a logical
condition an example which I'm trying to
highlight over
here okay now let's look at certain
calendar date oriented columns
calculated columns
very typical like now I have a simple
date column now I'll keep adding certain
columns which are you know which help
you which will help you understand how
we can uh you know do some calculations
on the dates so like for example I want
a date which is 12 days after the
current date the date in the column so
just simple 12 Days After select the
date and add 12
now if you see the date format you can
go and change the format at the top and
if whatever you feel like like
this now see 12 days after 1 gen 2015 is
13 gen 2005 you can go and change the
format and other
details let me also show you if I go to
my cost and other columns I can go and
change the the format this is like a
currency cost is currency so I can go
and uh select the change the currency
type and you can even show the dollar
value or whatever currency type it
is so for numbers you can do currency or
text or dates you can select the format
so this is available at the column tools
level
now in
customers like we had
our column of full name so now what all
things are available format as text okay
data type text so very minimal options
are there with date you have options of
the date
format now
next I want a column which finds the
expiry date okay so 8 months prior to
the expiry date with is which is uh
coming up in 8 months so I'll create a
column called as 8 months
expiry and then there is a e date
function I'll use that I'll use
my date in the data set
comma I'll say eight so now this date
column will append eight months to
my actual date and again I can go and
change the
format correct now another important
column like I want to know the date
name so I'll use a function called as
format and I'll select my calendar date
column and I'll say give me the
dddd format of it so it will give me the
day name the day the day name of on that
particular
date next
next ear in
between so I want the ears in between
the today's date and the date of my
calendar so equal to date
diff the calendar
date comma
today comma
year end
7 years 2015 to
2022 then last date of the month so if I
want what is the last date of this
particular calendar month I will use a
function EO month which is there
available in
the powerbi so I'll
say last date of the
month equal to E o
month
then just select the calendar CSV date
comma zero in months and
enter change the format
then similarly start of the
month so I'll use a function called
start of
month so for for all January dates end
of the month is 31st gen and start of
the month will remain first of J
change the
format next I want to know what is the
week number of that particular date so
now there is an inbuilt function
called week number week num and just
pass the date and you will get the week
number first week of the year second
week of the year
Etc now another very
good example is whether the
week day is a week day or a weekend
right so what is it's a weak type
okay so I'll CH I'll put a if condition
and there is a function called
weekday and I'll pass the
calendar if it is less than six it means
it's a weak day else it's a
weekend so all
Saturday and Sunday day names will come
as weekends and else everything else
will come as
weekday so these are very different
variations of different column types
calculated column s which is a very
important utility and uh and any Bravo
bi project you will definitely be ending
up creating n number of calculated
columns to derive your numbers to
prepare your reports but it's important
to understand what all things we can do
that yes there are n number of functions
available in powerbi uh but uh what I
have tried to Showcase over here is some
important functions but basis your
utility basis your problem statement you
can uh look up for a relevant function
in the powerbi
dictionary now with
this introduction to calculated column
this is the base for us to now get into
our next session where will be we will
be talking about creating Dax measures
and Dax functions we will be using
powerbi Dax functions which is much more
powerful than simple uh calculated
columns where you can do more uh complex
Cal calculations uh you can calculate
totals and then use them in the reports
so for that we will look up into our
next session powerbi let's also learn
about Dax expressions and that's
basically your data analysis Expressions
so it's basically collection of
functions operators and constants which
can be used in formulas or Expressions
to calculate or return one or more
values now we can basically add a new
column so we can do that or we can also
create new measures now usually there is
a shorter way of doing it you can go
into modeling and here as of now nothing
is highlighted because there is no data
uploaded we see just a new table what I
can do is I can go to home and I can
let's get our data but this time I'll
take the simpler data although we can
work on the same earlier data set which
relates to IP addresses and all that so
that also can be done and to learn we
can take up this particular data which
is global super store which we have used
earlier now here I can select orders I
can select people and I can also select
returns now what we can do is before
loading we can just do some quick
transformation on this particular data
so that opens up my power query editor
so here if you remember we have worked
on this this is returns so what I can do
is I can basically go in here I can say
use first row as headers now that's one
transformation which I would want to do
let's go into people and it basically
has person and region we will still do
the same thing use first row as headers
so that gives me the name of the person
and the person belongs to which
particular region you have then your
orders data set and here things look
fine so we can select different
countries we can select different
product categories we can basically work
on your different use cases here like we
have seen earlier picking up a category
as technology picking up a
subcategory and we can also create
models based on these three data sets so
this looks perfectly fine to me so let's
go ahead and just do a close and apply
and let's have our data quickly loaded
now as I have explained earlier it is
good to do transformation enough data
wrangling so that your data is not huge
when you're loading it because then that
will slow down your queries slow down
your visuals slow down your reports and
so on now this is the data we have and
say for example I would want to work on
a visual so we know how we can do that
so I can basically click on my orders I
can look at the aggregated columns such
as discount might be postal code might
be profit and it depends if you have
basically not changed the data types now
if you see here postal code and
summation really does not go well
probably this has been as uh this has
been loaded as a data type which is
integer but profit and quantity looks
good row ID sales look good so we can
work on Dax expressions now here if you
go into the modeling it says do you want
to create a new measure you can create a
new column that will get added to your
Visual and here when you are looking
into the table you can click on this and
this also gives you an option of
creating a new measure or a new column
new quick measure and you can work on
Dax so when I said Dax let's quickly
look at what or how Dax looks like talk
about Dax the simplest way to understand
is knowing the basic syntax so usually
you first have some kind of measure name
so for example we can say average about
something we can say okay let's say
average sales so that becomes one of my
measure which I'm interested in
calculating now how do I calculate that
so for that I use an operator so which
shows here so that's your operator which
you going to use and then you use a Dax
function so Dax has or powerbi has lot
of functions which we can use so for
example I would use a function like
average which we can choose from the
drop-down as we start typing in now this
one as a function then needs a referred
data table so basically let's say I
would be interested in orders so I can
select my table or my data set as you
say and then you can choose a particular
column so from orders I would want to do
an average on say sales and I can key in
the column name
here and that basically is my simplest
tax expression so we can have a
complicated way of looking at it or we
can basically say okay I would want to
find out average s
and I would want to might be look into a
particular City or where I would say it
is per City so mightbe I could say
average sales and then I could say buy
City or by year or I would want to look
into a particular year if we have the
order date so we can say greater than a
particular order date so we would want
how how our sales have got affected
after a particular date and that depends
on the situation so I can do that and
here I can say greater
than order date now for that obviously
we have to use the operator and then I
would want to calculate so I can
basically say
calculate now this is what I would want
to find out so I can say calculate and
then in calculate I can say let's take
the column which we are interested in so
we can pass in something like a measure
here so for example I can just say
average sales this is what I want but I
will give a separator here to filter out
the data and then I am going to use my
order
date for example I can basically say
let's take
orders and in that I am taking order
date and then basically this order date
has to be greater than or lesser than
something so here you are specifying
your data set your table and the column
you are giving a filter here and that's
basically your Dax expression so your
Dax has different functions so when we
talk about these functions like as I
said you are going for average or you're
going to calculate something so you have
what we uh usually mean or uh we use is
your predefined formulas now that can
perform calculations by using specific
values called arguments so which are in
particular order in structure so always
remember that when you talk about Dax
this always refers a complete column or
a table now there are different
categories of functions which we can
work on so you have date and time such
as date difference or finding out now or
finding out a later time you can use
something like time intelligence which
is dates between first date and last
date you can go for information
functions which contains custom data you
can have logical functions mathematical
functions statistical functions uh text
functions you have uh basically working
on parent child relationships so there
are different function categories which
can be used and as I said we can go for
creating a new column or a new measure
and we can use this Dax for our data
analysis now let's see how we do that so
say for example I have my order date now
I would want to
work on this so let's select say for
example go to your data set and you have
lot of data here so you can basically go
for all this data here which shows me
complete information of the different
columns and you can choose which columns
you are interested in which columns
might be you would want to cut short so
for example I have order ID I've row ID
might be I don't want a row ID so I can
choose if I want to delete this and you
can say okay I would want to delete this
now these are some changes which you are
applying and now if you see there is
no uh row ID what we see here as a field
you start with your
order ID you have your category you have
your order date
shipment and here you have your
segment and for example we have country
region Market category subcategory
product name sales and then you have
your quantity discount profit and all of
this now what we can do is I can
basically add something here so this is
the data which we have and what we can
do is we can continue working on
this so so let's click on home and here
you have ways to transform the data you
have a new measure you have quick
measure you have new column and you can
try out these so for example I can go
into new column and that basically says
okay what is your column called now I
can say for example as I was explaining
let's go for average sales so let's call
it average sales now that's what I'm
interested in now I need to use an
internal function so let's type in AV
and that shows me okay so there is an
inbuilt function called average we can
use this one so you can just hit on
enter and now it's says okay which is
the data set you're interested in now
based on the reports based on the data
sets I've used earlier it shows me
options of different tables what we have
or different data sets what we have so
let's choose orders so this is what I'm
interested in you can go for double
click and that gets selected and now it
says okay you want average on sales but
which is the column which you would want
to use so we can go for category we can
go for Country we can go for customer ID
all of these are your different columns
so for example I can go for something
like country and that basically gets
selected now I can complete this by just
closing the
parenthesis and that's basically my dag
function so my dag function is ready and
if you want you can add details to it so
if you would want to continue your
function you can always do a shift enter
that takes you to the next line if you
do not want it you can go back you can
add a comment by saying all
shift and letter a and then you can say
my first Dax function and you can give
in some information depending on what
kind of function you are creating and
that basically allows you to create the
function so this is done now let's hit
on enter and basically it will say the
function average cannot work with values
of type string and and that's right I
mean we basically chose the wrong
country I mean you cannot have an
average on Country so that's not right I
should use something where I have to
take a numeric value so for example I
will replace this so I will say I want
average sales and here I can choose what
should I take so for example let's go
for sales and that's what I would want
so it says order sales and then hit on
enter and it basically has populated my
new column but then it is basically
taking average sales and it has taken
average sales overall now we have not we
have just selected a column we have not
given any filter so it just gives me
average and it populates every row with
this one now this is fine that we have
added a column it has the same average
value and that basically gives me sales
on average so as I said your Dax
function always references a complete
column or a complete table and then
basically it adds the value now let's
see how we can use this if you notice
the field or the column has got added
here let's get into
visualization and what I can do is I can
basically choose one of the type of
visualizations so for example if I
choose this and say for example I would
be adding this a sales and that is the
data I would want to look into so what
we can do is we can just say okay I'm
interested in this average sales it
shows me the function and we can add it
here now this is just giving me the
average sales overall now that really it
doesn't make sense let's look at this
one or plotted graph so it gives me what
is the average sales and it gives me
some visualization so we can create
visualization like this based on our
column now what we can also do is we can
go back to our data and we can go for
different functions so as I said you can
create a function that adds a column now
let's go for something else so I will
say
average sales and I would be interested
in say a particular
product now we have average sales and
that is the measure which we can use so
for example I would want to find
out
um wherein the year or let's look at the
date field here so for example we have
country as France
it is telling me City it is giving me
customer name it gives me a segment so
let's choose a different field and we
can filter by that so for example I'll
say average sales by or whatever name
you want to give let's say segment now
what I will do here is instead of using
this
average so I will go for something like
calculate now now I can go for calculate
I can go for concatenate so let's go for
calculate and we know that we have a
particular column so let's go for this
one which is let's open up a bracket
here so let's go here let's give
our column name so that could be your
average sales so let's look at what was
the column name and we have average
sales with a and SS Capital so let's go
for average and then let's go for sales
now this is what I want to do but on
what so let's choose this and here I'm
going to now
[Music]
choose orders so and then we have to
basically look at the column which has
the segment value so so segment now this
is what I would want to use and then we
can try giving a value to this so you
have segment as corporate so for example
let's say let's go
for so it says calculate given
expression which we have already given
that's your average sales or we can
basically give the expression what we
did earlier and then you go for a
filtering value so I'm saying order
segment and let's go for something like
corporate now that going to be my
segment let's close this one so here's
the example what you do is you give your
measure name so that says average sales
by segment you can do a calculate now
here you have to pass in a measure so
for example I'm saying average and I'm
saying take an average for
sales that is give me an average value
of sales but what I'm interested in is
when the order segment is Corporate so
I'm giving a filter here and then it
gives me average sales by segment so
that's the column value here and it is
basically filtering out based on the
segment being corporate so segment is
our particular column here with which is
showing up
somewhere let me see where is my segment
column so we have your
product now I
have uh let's search
for Country City postal code customer ID
and since we have chosen order sales it
is giving me this average value and you
can choose it a different column or you
can say profit is greater than something
else so I would be only interested in
those values and you can continue adding
things to your tax
expression and this is how you can do
here so basically what I did was we were
using a measure which is average order
sales I said my segment has to be
corporate or basically you can just say
segment has to exist so you can say a
Boolean value like equals true now I'm
saying orders profit has to be greater
than 100 and I'm only looking for my
average sales by segment where profit is
greater than 100 segment is Corporate
and now this has calculated the value so
you basically see here so it tells me
286 if you look at the profit value so
it is greater than 100 what I can do is
I can even add a filter here so for
example I can say greater than and let's
give some value here so for example
let's go for 100 and let's see if it has
done the work so you see all the average
values where it is greater than 100 and
then we have to also look at our other
values we can filter it so segment has
to be corporate and let's apply the
filter here so I will check I'll say
corporate now this is what I'm
interested in so it tells me the
corporate is sector now you see the
sales value which is already showing up
here which we have we have average sales
by segment which is telling me that you
have corporate segment and it gives you
where the profit values are greater than
100 now we have this Dax here we have
applied we have the filter and what we
can do is we can go to quickly
visualization and what I can do is I can
choose this I can add it here and then
that says me aage sales by segment
however we can go for different kind of
visualization which can give us more
meaning here and look at the data so
this is how you can simply use your tax
Expressions now this is a simple quick
uh session where you are looking at the
Dax expression so when you look at this
symbol it means it is a Dax expression
so you can
obviously double click on this one and
that shows you what is your Dax
expression now as I said I have given
two filters here so always remember once
you have given a measure you give your
first filter and then you can give any
number of filters you can just order it
in a different line that should be fine
let's say say average sales by
segment okay so let's say
average
sales
by segment okay
profit greater than 100 so I can give
some kind of name which basically
identifies my column and that gives me
the value now if you see here we have
applied these filters and that's why we
are only seeing the relevant data which
is profit which is a particular segment
and you can create any number of Dax
expressions like this using some inbuilt
functions so anytime if you would want
to see if your Dax expression is working
fine what you can do is for example I
can say test function okay now I would
want to create a function and then I can
basically choose the available functions
as I said you have logical functions you
have statistical functions you have
mathematical functions you have
information functions so you have all of
these options here and you can choose
one of these so for example we were
going for average you have and and or
for example I can directly go for and
but that would not make sense in the
beginning you can go for absolute value
of something so for example let's choose
absolute
and now I want to work on orders so I go
for orders and here I can say okay I'm
looking at orders but I would be looking
at sales value I I would want the exact
value so I can choose this one right and
here now once I am creating a function
so I can be selecting a different column
so this is basically one column now you
can add calcul ation you want to do but
this basically says unexpected
expression because this is a new dag for
a new column so what I can do is I can
take this out from here I can go ahead
and create a new column and then or a
new measure so I can do that and it
works perfectly fine now I can save this
and we can call it whatever report you
would want to call so let's say super
store
with new Dax and you can share it you
can publish it you can continue using it
in your reports so you can create any
number of functions as such and then
just save it so for example I have set
of Dax functions and I can upload it on
a GitHub link so here for example if I
go in here and if I click on Dax so that
tells me the different kind of
visualizations I have based on on the
standard data so it depends on uh my
file which is which should be existing
here so I can go in here and this should
actually work but the location has
changed and I just click on open report
I can do a browse report I can go into
powerbi content and here let's look into
this one and just say open so that will
not only load the report it has
different visuals
and uh different visuals with the
standard data set which comes with
Microsoft and it basically has different
kind of visuals and each of those
visuals again have different tax
functions so you can use these also so
what we have learned is working on a
store data set working on some thread
hunting data sets working on our own
created tables and these are some of the
Pages what you see here so this is based
on the data which comes in with AWS and
you can always look into one of these
and you can search if you see here look
at this icon and it tells me okay this
looks like a attack function and let's
double click on this one and that shows
me the function what you're doing so
you're creating a function called age it
uses date difference it works on dim
customer table on on the birthday date
and you would want to basically find out
the date difference between now and the
birthday and you would want the year so
this is the data what you have you can
obviously choose this you can look at
the result of this and you can see the
visuals so these are some simple tax
Expressions you can create lot of data
expressions like this now this
is here
you have date function so I can choose
which are the tax functions which are
existing here I can just load them so
for example this one is one of my other
data sets and then you can play around
with the data here so this is how you
create your Dax expressions and this is
just this was just a quick demo on going
for some simple tax Expressions you can
create different kind of visuals
and you can then save those reports you
can publish it to powerbi service and
and you can then gather insights based
on this so this is how you work with
powerbi wherein uh you can use Dax you
can use powerbi service to gather
insights you can use desktop to work on
loading your data transforming your data
in different ways and then basically
analyzing it so these days you you might
be hearing a lot about PBI we do have a
lot of bi tools in the market like Excel
Tableau click view a lot but people are
talking about powerbi the most but why
so we will be knowing that in a while so
let's get started with uh building a
dashboard first and eventually in the
process you will definitely understand
it so making a dashboard in powerbi is
just like a breeze so before we get
started with powerbi I would like to
explain you a few fundamentals that you
might want to take a look at before
getting started so data cleaning is a
much needed process so you can do data
cleaning using public query or you can
just simply open your Excel and try to
check the data types for blank cells any
inappropriate datas eliminating them
right so simple basic fundamental data
cleaning process if you have some
irrelevant data in your data set just
eliminate that row or try to fill that
with the proper data that was supposed
to be there and if there are any blank
rows or blank cells eliminate those
blank rows and blank cells so that your
data is up to date and accurate and
apart from that uh let's check out some
data types for example the first one
which happens to be the ru ID here so
this is the data set that we will be
dealing with today so this particular
rad ID has a general data type so it can
be either a number or a float and when
you come to the ship date over here the
AUD date over here right so those are
date data types and they might follow
different formatting let's say they
might follow uh date number that is day
number and for month they might add the
alphabetical name like J an or FB and
the year or a few others might format
with date time and uh you know we will
be having date uh and at the time which
will'll be describing the hours minutes
and seconds right so there are a lot of
variations where a data from date data
type can be saved so it's your
fundamental you know responsibility to
make sure that all the elements from a
specific column are of one single data
type so that the N entire data set is
integ you know it's very uh good and it
should be intact that's the whole point
of it and if you have any
inconsistencies in your data set that
might result in you know abnormal
predictions abnormal dashboards or
charts whatever you make there will not
be uh those dashboards cannot be relied
on your reports cannot be uh reliable so
that's the whole point of it so just
make sure that you go through the
fundamental very basic data cleaning
things like eliminating blank rows blank
cells maintaining a uniform data type
for all your columns you know based on
the data it's not like you have to
maintain character data type for your
dates so you need to make sure that what
kind of data type suits what kind of
data and you need to check that and make
sure that all the elements in that
particular column follow one standard
data type so I'll be going with date
data type for audit date and ship date
and ship mode will be character serial
that is row number will be serial number
or row number will be integer and uh
everything else will be C data type and
when it comes to the last four rows
sales quantity discount and profit so
those will be the uh you know float data
type and when you check out the location
here we have country north so these will
be segregated by your bi tool either
Tablo or powerbi whichever you're using
so those will be segregating these
particular location type data types and
it will show them as map right so this
is the major thing which you need to
make sure before starting with your you
know building the dashboard so that you
know having said that let's begin with
the powerbi let's me start the powerbi
bi tool here it is just click on it it
should take a while so here we are we
are on the you know first page of the
PBI so you can import the data from
Excel you can import the data from SQL
Server you can just copy paste your
blank tables so you can make use of some
apis and plugins and get connected to
the data sources from web or any other
sources and you can also import the data
from that particular source so today we
will be dealing with the Excel data set
so we will be importing the Excel file
and before that here you can see some
options which are filters data
visualizations and uh data so we haven't
loaded any data so you can see the data
over here and if you are on table they
will be available on the left side and
you will call them dimensions and
measures so you can apply the same uh
analogy here so you'll be available with
the dimensions and measures once we
import the data and here you have a wide
variety of charts and graphs that you
can just you know drag and drop and
create so once you have the data over
here you can just drag and drop onto the
canvas over here and then it will
automatically generate some type of a
data set or chart let's say it'll give
you a tabular chart you can just click
that particular chart and come over here
over over here and you can select any
one of the charts available here let's
say you wanted the P chart you can do
that uh you can do a donut chart you can
do a dream app right so once you H onto
it it will tell the name of that
particular chart and you can select that
like it's based on your choice right so
this is about it basically now you can
also do some drill throughs that's again
for a session in another time another
day so that's a session for a different
day for now let's try to create a
dashboard in a routine way remember I'm
telling you or I'm specifying in a
routine way because we also about to
learn why powerbi is being uh so popular
currently in the bi industry right so
there are some tips and tricks that will
help you in the long term so let me
close the filters close the
visualizations close the data and now
let's click on this particular option
which says import data from Excel right
now we are in the Excel data set so this
is the file where I basically store my
Excel data sets that I'll be working on
so you can also have access to this you
can just let me know and we will drop
down the tribe Link in the description
box and you'll have
the accessibility to all these data sets
so remember I spoke about data cleaning
right so this Excel data it has
completely cleaned every data column has
a uniform data type and it follows that
data type throughout and if you check
out this particular original data set
which is sales European sales over here
so this is the original data set which
follows different nomenclatures for data
types for example if I come down to the
date column there are different types of
data types some of the cells have only
dates they follow date month and year
and some of these cells have date month
and year along with the time so another
clitch here so a few of the cells were
following the uh you know 24hour timing
nomenclature and a few others were
following 12 hours that is specifically
mentioning amm and p.m. right so this
causes a lot of trouble when you're
creating a report trust me I've been
there so what I did is I clean the
entire data set remove the cells I mean
the blank cells remove the blank columns
remove the blank cells remove the blank
rows and in any situation if there is um
you know uh discrepancy followed in data
types I've also cleared that and I saved
it as Excel data right so we will be
using this particular data now and if
you need these data sets I can provide
you with that using the Drive Link and
you can have access you can also try
your data cleaning by following our
tutorial which is linked in the
description box below for data cleaning
and you can do it and you can start with
your dashboards now let me just extract
this particular D set just click on open
and you will be having it on the screen
just in a moment so when you check out
the original data set we have a lot of
sheets here right so these were some
pivot tables that we created for data
analytics using Excel so you can also
check out that video now we will be
doing the same data analytics and
creating an entire interactive dashboard
on powerbi with the same data set so you
can see uh powerbi is trying to load all
the tables and all the sheets available
in that particular file but we just need
one out of those you can also click all
of those or you can just get one out of
those so for now I just need one out of
those so here it is and you can check
the data you can have a quick priew of
how your data is looking right and then
just click on load and the best part is
powerbi will also perform a data
cleaning operation from its end and
identifies if there are any rules or any
sells that I missed out to clean and it
will notify you if there are any errors
and it will also I mean it is also
capable to you know um fix those errors
for you you can see I have seven errors
right so I can just view errors and
clear them or I can just close so that
in the background PBI will take care of
them for me now we have the data right
so here you can see the data tab got
opened and here you can have a new drop
down if you click on that you have all
the data elements present in the data
set or in terms of T you have dimensions
and measures so basically wherever you
have a sumission or any kind of
mathematical operation present in front
of the column name that particular
element or that particular column is
considered to be the measure so which is
which is basically dealing with the
numbers and all the others which do not
have any other mathematical symbol like
equals hashtag or submission those are
the dimensions basically the character
data type or the date data type
whichever uh the data type it is but not
numbers right so here we have it so what
you basically do is completely similar
to uh Tablo click view or any other
business intelligence tool basically
just drag and drop right now let's say I
want to find out the U region wise sales
what can I do here is I can just drag it
on to the canvas and again I have sales
over here I can drag sales to the canvas
I can just you know H it onto the
existing box you can see this particular
box right you can just drop it inside
the box so that powerbi will understand
that I'm trying to uh you know extract
the region wise sales and it will
perform the sumission of all the sales
region wise and it'll give you a table
let's say you're not satisfied with this
particular table representation you can
just hold your table and here you can
open the visualizations and open the
filters right and here you have
visualizations over here if you want to
segregate that in form of a py chart you
can do it right now it will give you the
sum of sales based by region now want to
calculate the U let's say audit dat you
know uh date wise sales then I can also
do that you can just drag the sales over
here and select that particular table
and you know whenever you are dealing
with date data type right when you're
dealing with date data type then what
you do is you try to use the line CFT
it's the best way to represent your
sales how they are happening right and
uh few other things let's say I want to
calculate uh the profit by city or
country which country is facing the
highest number of profits we can also do
that just drag and drop you know how it
is and okay it's giving a lot of
countries but but still it's not a big
problem for us can just drag and drop
the sales and here you can select any
one out of these let's go with the
barograph and here you have it right now
so far so good right so far we so good
now if you U worry about the
interactivity you don't have to
basically when you're using Excel or any
other tablet let's say if you're using
Excel you might have to use slices right
so if you're not aware of what am I
talking about you can just go check the
data analytics of building the dashboard
using Excel where I have completely
explained the the same data set and we
have you know built an interactive
dashboard there so it'll give you a
better idea about it so before that um
let's get let's Circle back so here uh
you don't have to create a slicer and
you don't have to report the connections
between each and every chart it's
automatically done in the background for
example let's say if I wanted to
calculate the sales of central region if
I just click on the central region it
will automatically change the display of
the entire dashboard it'll give me the
central region sales right and uh if I
just go back it'll you know it will give
me the entire sales dashboard let's say
if I want to calculate the west region I
have my best data right so that's the
best part of probab bi and now we are
going to identify why this this is one
good reason why powerbi is popular but
there is another good reason why powerbi
is so popular right now so popular so
easy and so effective that even a
schoolgoing kid can build a dashboard
trust me a schoolgoing kid of grade 11
grade 12 or a candidate who is just
graduating or a fresher or any person
who doesn't have a computer knowledge
but has some good knowledge about
numbers and how businesses work they can
definitely create an interactive
dashboard using powerbi even if they are
new to P so we're going to just see just
that let's create a new page or you can
just go back to the same
page okay let's create a new page now
let's say I don't know uh how to create
a chart I don't know let's say my
manager asked me to create a complete
report of of the sales happening and I
don't know powerbi and I don't know
anything about how to create a chatel
and how it's work right but I have
certain
idea right let's say I have a certain
idea I want to find out the region wise
sales I want to find out the
country-wise sales I want to find out
the performance of sales date on date
year on year month on month quarter on
quarter whatever it is you just want to
create you know you just want to extract
the you want to build an Insight on on
the date wise sales and uh you want to
find out um you know profits based on
certain regions or certain categories
right which category is the highest
performing category which is the majorly
used shipment mode right there are
Limitless possibilities you know what to
build but you don't know how to build
right in such situations powerbi is here
for the rescue just right click on the
canvas just click anywhere right now you
okay it was not the right click it was
the double click so just double click
anywhere on the power P canvas and there
you can see something called ask a
question about your data let me expand
that for you you can see ask question
anything about your data now let's say I
want to create the same region wise
sales right you can just type on the
region wise sales and it's so already
giving you a uh you know it's already
giving you a bar graph now let's say you
don't want the bar graph you want a p
pie chart or a donut graph right donut
chart so you can either select any one
of those I'll go with the pie chart for
now so you can just select on that and
here you have your pie chart right how
simple is that how easy is that right
and now you can just place it anywhere
on your dashboard check the size
alignment and you're good to go let's
close this video filters for now so that
the canvas is a little more better
visible now let's say I want to find out
chip mode profits and uh the type of
graph I'll go with the bar graphs there
you go sales that happened using a
certain ship mode and you have the data
right here and I'm choosing the B graph
now let's say I want to calculate the
month-on-month sales right so double
click anywhere on the canvas
sales audit date and
remember we want to represent the okay
it's too intelligent it already gave you
a line graph right just click that
select that and uh just place it
anywhere on your chart and you can
expand it there you go there you have it
right and now let's do let's try to find
out a few more things let's try to find
out uh which of these segments gave me a
lot of uh profits category wise
profits category profit and let's try to
build U we have a pie chart so let's
build a donut chart there you go place
it anywhere on the canvas like whever
you need it now few more things
statewise okay now let's make it a
little more
interesting State fail map you wanted a
map right so just select on that and you
will be having the map okay some problem
here so I think let's go with
country sales map okay let's enter now
let's select this particular chart okay
no interactivity I need right now select
this and here let's select map and map
and fil M visuals are disabled to enable
them go to a file options settings
options close Global Security details
okay let's try this file options and
settings options global global security
use map and fi map visuals I think this
should fix this okay let's refresh it
should help us there you go you have
your map let's place it anywhere in r in
the dashboard now we have the regionwise
sales or country-wise sales
and shipment mode subcategory and uh let
me know what else we can build let's
have the kpis here now let's go to the
sales just stack and drop the sales sign
anywhere on the table and I want the
data presented in visuals I have the
card now let's have profits and that
should be a card again and let's have U
quantity that should be a card again
that's our kpi okay profit sales
quantity discount is another one where
which you can add and just add number
card again there you go you can go to
the insert option insert text box and
there you can just write down sales
dashboard align the text to Center and
that should be good there you go so far
so good and in case if you wanted to add
a few more visual athetics to your
dashboard you can also do that just
click down yeah I think you remember
your PowerPoint right just go to view
and you can select any of the
backgrounds you want and there you go
you have it if you're not happy with
this you can also have some images in
the background you can add some images
which will make it look a little more
interactive right so that's how you
build an amazing interactive dashboard
in powerbi and uh that's the reason why
uh the Simplicity why powerbi is being
so popular amongst the all other
remaining bi tools and now let's get
started with the customer analytics
dashboard using powerbi so we will be
using the Amazon sales St say from 2023
and 2024 for this particular dashboard
using CBI so let's quickly switch
between the PowerPoint presentation and
the data set that we are going to use
today so this particular data set is
available on kagle and it is actually
the data set between 2020 and 2021 so we
carried out a little bit of data
cleaning process and we enhance the data
set like removing the blank spaces
removing the blank cells and the blank
row basically so and after that changing
the data type of dates so you might be
wondering there might be a few discrepan
in the way the data is formatted because
there are many ways for example if I
just select this column and go back to
data type and if I go to the available
dates there are many formats so you can
see here month and date date month and
year and there is an alphabetical
representation of month right so there
are many variations where you can
represent the date so we are going to
use one single format for the entire
data set so that it can be easier for us
to identify the week on week month on
month quarter on quarter and yearly uh
analysis so that's your whole point of
it first point just try to eliminate any
kind of blank cells rows or columns in
your data set so that the accuracy of
the data that you are using to perform
analysis is intact and good right so
apart from that just check if you want
to eliminate any of the decimal points
just select this and here you can see
the option to element leading decimal
numbers right you can use this option
over here so there are about 2 lh86 393
rows in this particular data set so it
might take a little while to uh reflect
my actions on this particular data set
and apart from that if you could uh just
hover over through this particular dat
set you have a lot of things to deal
with you have regions you have username
discount percentage and uh you have
first name last name of the user
quantity order price value so why are we
basically going through this particular
D set is it is when you understand it is
when you can quantify what's happening
with the D set that's when you can plan
out what kind of analysis you want to
perform right let's say you did not get
any kind of prerequisites from your
manager you just had the DS head and you
need to perform the exact uh you know
analysis which could benefit your
organization so they also want some
insight so that they can make out some
decisions out of it right some business
decisions so in that situation you just
have to go through the data at once and
do the data cleaning process and then
understand what exactly has been
mentioned in this particular data set
and what kind of uh insights you can
extract out of this data set and you can
proceed with that so basically we have
quantity ordered price value and uh
total apart from that you have category
you have uh different payment methods
you have uh the year you have the dates
and uh so when you have dates you can
also create some trend lines out of it
and apart from that uh let's say you
have zip codes region right so you can
find out region by sales and and a few
more things what you can basically do
out of it right so having the data set
understood let's go back to powerbi so
this is our powerbi platform so
basically just select this particular
Excel work option and import the data
I've done it basically here you have it
so we have the age category City Country
everything presented over here now let's
quickly create
the visualizations using this particular
J so I would firstly go with the bar
graph okay let me choose this uh
paragraph right over here and uh let me
create gender wise sales let's let's
have this
gender
here so we should be having something
called as a price or a sale so we have
price over here you can quickly draw and
drag this and drop it on the
x-axis okay we y axis and uh gender on
the x-
axis so we don't want this filter over
here you can eliminate
this so now you have um gender wise
sales right now next let's use a pie
chart now you can find out the region by
sales quickly add the region
into the
Legends here you have the region by
sales so you have Midwest Northeast
South and southwest regions so these are
the s numers
uh line graft which can help us to do
okay so just click on the canvas and
then double click for your gra
sheet now let's use the audit
date and drop it onto
xaxis and
um r on to Y
AIS now if you could uh use the drop
down and use the date hierarchies you
can use the year on year month on month
so let's go with month on month or
quarter okay let's go with quarter on
quarter now you can see how are the
sales running quarter on quarter in the
for this particular data set so we have
two years that is 2020 and I mean yeah
2023 and 2024 the quar on quarter
comparison for year on-ear sales figures
right now let's click on the canvas once
again and now you can choose the over
here and uh so since we
have to genders and I think we also have
a column for age it should be somewhere
in the
list so basically you can derive what
age groups have made the maximum number
of sales
right yeah so here we have it
and the sales so basically it'll create
a bucket right uh age group from 18 age
group from 19 20 21 and so on now just
go through the orders or you can go with
the price so just drag and drop it in
values and you have it here and you
created a donor chart of it and uh let's
try to create a field map now uh you can
understand which
uh area or which region was the highest
uh sales uh we received so just go
through the data set over here so we
have the country just drag and drop the
country and then have the price or
orders you can use anything okay let's
go with the
orders quantity
order and add it in the
values so here we have it so if you
could expand you can find out which
region was the one which giv us the
highest number of
orders and there is another simple way
to do it as well if you just double
click on the
[Music]
canvas will give you a prompt where you
can write
map country
wise M Pok state so we have a state
column here sales or
price and uh it will automatically
understand your query and create
a map which will show you the highest
number of sales from the regions or the
region or statewise sales brilliant now
if we proceed into the final chart okay
we have a waterfall chart so now you can
create a waterfall chart so you just
name it
waterfall so we have a category
somewhere yeah Vall category wise just
enter price or sale and we have a
waterfall chart over here based on the
categories you can just drag or you can
expand the cans to have a clear
picture and uh yeah so far we have de
with okay we have a scatter plot we can
do a scatter
plot scatter plot for quantity of orders
received against discount
offered so we should be having quantity
ordered 2
T5 against
discounts or I think we can go with
order ities so it will give us a unique
uh representation the has been small
discrepancy order ID or you can also go
with customer ID
against discount
offered so we have a huge data set 2
lakh plus so it might take a little
while to respond to the requests that's
completely all right now what left out
is the kpis so you can also create some
kpis so just double tap and uh write a
kpi for total sales write a kpi
toal
orders 29,000
ERS API for total discount
kpi for discount
percentage we can use kpi for agenda
which can tell us how many number of uh
females or how many number of males did
create an order we will be having a
number
here or
writing if you could just close these
visualizations over here we can expand
the canvas and you can also have okay we
can also minimize this particular area
and we can also have another
chat of bar bar
graph for types of payments payment
types
payment method right so we will be
generating a bar graph with highest
number of payment methods used that is
cash and delivery online payment emis
Etc so it will take a little time to
reflect on this particular screen that's
all right now if you can just go to view
and here you will be having various
options for representing your data set
just click on the best way to represent
your data set there you go so basically
that's how you create okay let's try to
rearrange our charts a little bit so
that the kpis and K is are
visible there you go so that's how you
create a customer analytics dashboard
using powerbi hey everyone welcome to
Simply learns YouTube channel today we
will learn how to create a daily
activity tracker in msxl that's said if
these are the typee of videos you'd like
to watch then hit that like And
subscribe buttons and the bell icon to
get notified now today we will try to
build an activity tracker using
Microsoft Excel so I have opened my
Microsoft Excel here you can see I have
some tests so we have all been through
this right you might have n number of
tasks for a day and you might get
confused which to prioritize and which
not to and which is is the one which is
having the highest priority and should
be closed within a few hours right we
all face that so for that one reason I
have made this particular activity
tracker for day in Microsoft Excel so
you can have a number of jobs so I have
added some jobs here so not a particular
names I've just named as numbers number
34 five we have 15 jobs here and their
respective priorities if it is high low
or medium if it's high you can have a
command like reporting your
month-on-month report to your manager or
your client and if it's slow you can
just your daily activity like you know
uh regularizing your attendance or
writing an marketing email to your
client or something like that which has
low priority or it's already done it
could be something like that right so
some of the tasks like uh taking an
interview or scheduling an interview for
your team member or something like that
which is uh in progress and maybe yet to
be done and has medium priority because
let's say your interview is in the
upcoming month or upcoming week so you
still have some time to breathe right so
it may have some medium priorities
something like that so you can
categorize your task based on the
priority based on the time constraints
and importance right so high medium or
low and accordingly you can add
recommend to uh understand what exactly
you need to do within what time period
and what's the stat and everything right
based on that you also have another
column to uh notify the status of that
particular task so you can um check if
it's done or in progress and accordingly
you can select that particular option
and here you also have the data
validation option where you can select
high priority medium priority and low
priority right and here you have have
the options so how many done tasks are
there how many in progress tasks are
there and how many tasks are there that
needs to be started yet and based on
that if you're in the safe Zone which is
done and uh some some of the which isn't
done in progress can be blue so you're
in safe zone right so based on that you
can create uh a par graph like this and
you can understand how safe your you are
so maybe it was showing done as Orange
so maybe okay so there is some color
coding to be done here not a problem we
can do that so basically that's how you
can create uh and daily activity tracker
so this is already done and this
particular workbook will be attached in
the uh description box below if you want
this template to use for your dayto
datas but now let's try to create an all
new daily activity track up in sheet
number two from scratch so that you can
understand how exactly I've created it
right so without further delay let's get
started I'll just quickly borrow the
column headers from the previous sheet
so we will be needing serial tasks
priority commands and Status so we will
quickly copy and paste them right over
here so we have copied them and we have
pasted them right here right so uh task
you can have a pretty much good length
for that so that you can name the task
and now we're just writing them as uh
job one job two so it's okay to have
minimum length and for commments you can
also have some space to bre where you
can write down some important things
about your comments right so for now
let's uh add uh maybe like 15 tasks just
like we did in the previous one let's
rep try to replicate that particular one
right so you can use Flash Fill here so
accordingly it will give you the number
of uh jobs you need so we have 15 Tas we
we're trying to replicate the same one
and Tas you can also use Flash Fill here
job one job two so now select both the
uh cells and here you can have a flash F
logo highlighted so you can just click
on the green box double click and you
have it there and uh State this and
comments so you can also have comments
here comment one
and
comment
to again you can use make use of flash
pill for that select both the cells and
you will have individual commands for
your individual jobs now what we left
out with the priority and status now we
are going to make use of some data
validation so that we have a drop- down
option to select a particular priority
for the task and select a particular
status for the task with it's done in
progress or maybe uh yet to start right
so we're trying to replicate the same
table that we had before so what you can
do is simply select the first cell from
the priority column go to the option of
uh data and here you can see uh the data
tools group and that you can see the
data validation and click on data
validation go to the first one settings
and here you will choose list so you can
give a source or you can just write down
simply uh
high
medium and low right and those are the
options in case if you have multiple
maybe 10 to 15 uh priority things or
something it can be right in case if
you're one of them which has multiple
priorities then you can create a new
sheet and you can write down all your
priorities and the source range for now
I am just having three so I'll just
write them down here here and you have a
drop down menu now you can use the
flashold option here as well just drag
them to the bottom cell and you have
them right so whenever you select an
option you have the priority and
similarly before we add the priority
let's also add the status using the same
technique of data validation so I'll go
into Data validation I'll select list
and here I'll add done in progress and
yet to be started
right so these are my three options and
again I can make use of Flash Fill dra
them the last cell here there you go and
you'll have the options now accordingly
we'll have some random
priorities uh I'll take high and
alternatively we can have some high
priority tasks like we will also have
other options medium so we will copy
some medium priority tasks and paste
them and we'll also select some low
priority task which can be considered as
in progress or maybe having some time or
maybe done right so we will have them
here and done so we have our priorities
sorted and Status so we will have some
in progress for all the high and medium
so wherever you find the medium or high
you can have progress or yet to be
started so we will have some yet to be
started uh high priority tasks medium
priority as well and we will have some
tasks which are already done right so
that you have a Tracker so uh you can
make use of data validation to have some
options so if and whenever your task is
done you can mark it as done and if and
whenever your task is in progress you
can mark it as in progress or yet to be
started right so you can also do some
customization to your table like adding
some colors or something like that to
make it look a little better so you can
also have some bage if you want or you
can just go to the view option and here
you can design table something like that
right so you can go to the format table
thing now if you want to highlight your
task like if say if it's in high Market
as red if it's in medium Market is blue
if it's in low Market is green something
like that you can also do that through
conditional repeat you can also do that
through conditional formatting go to
conditional formatting in home add a new
rule cells that contain only select C
value as specific text and uh type high
and go to format and here you can select
any shade of red and select this one and
press okay and go to conditional
formatting once again select a new rule
and cell that contains and select cell
value as specific text if it's
medium you can go to the format option
and here you can select a color for that
maybe blue and uh press okay and again
go to conditional formatting new tool
and sell that contains select cell value
for a specific text and for low you can
keep it as maybe a shade of green that
will make it look better so that you can
feel that it's comfortable enough there
you go and similarly you can have uh
some colors for your status as well so
you can go to new rule and uh format
cells that have specific text if it's in
progress formed as a shade of blue okay
and uh press okay for that and go to
condition formatting once again new rule
and Here Sell value should be a specific
text and if it's yet to start mark it as
green sorry not green mark it as um
maybe a shade of red and press okay
there you go and again conditional
formatting new rule go to format cells
that contain cell value specific pixel
done mark it as green any shade of green
right I'll select this particular one
and that should be good enough okay
right so far so good now what's
remaining is the tracker for that you
might need this one right so here we
have the three options that we have
place them somewhere over here and now
we will have a ctive function here we
will give a range so the range is this
particular one comma criteria in
progress which is this particular cell
then it will count the number can drag
the formula across all the cells and
you'll have the number right you can add
bers to it if you want there you go and
now create a chart go to insert option
and here we have bar graphs and here go
to 2D graphs 100% stacked par graph
right now right click this particular
one and select data and here you can
switch the rows to columns and there you
have it and you can also change the
positions right you can move up or down
if you want I'll keep it as it is and
press okay you can delete the chart
title and you can delete the horizontal
numbers 0% 20% but if you want you can
keep them so you can also minimize the
size as per your requests
and place it somewhere which is clearly
visible right and I'll move it to here
is clearly visible to me so that's your
activity tracker you can also remove the
uh vertical columns don't want and
that's how it's done and it can also
change in real time if it's done it will
be changing it's completely real time
and if you want to extend and this you
can also drag this particular cell
across the column and you can change the
make some modifications to the status
make some modifications to your priority
add a new serial number add a new job
add a new comment right so that's how
you create a daily activity tracker in
Microsoft Excel we will learn how to use
Microsoft power query that's said if
these are the type of videos you'd like
to watch then hit that like And
subscribe buttons and the bell icon to
get notified now without further delay
let's get started with the topic which
is how to use Microsoft power query so
imagine you have a lot of data it can be
an Excel file it can be a PDF SQL
database cloud or anything if it is Data
it's your data right so you have a lot
of data now you have the source of the
data after that I'm absolutely sure that
the data is not clean enough to perform
some analysis so you go through another
step where you have to clean your data
from unwanted rows and columns which
doesn't make sense or might have some
invalid data right so you need to make
sure that your data is completely
accurate and has some standards for your
analysis right so that's the next step
which is clean and transform after the
clean and transform step you have the
next step which is load that particular
data to your platform it could be Excel
it could be some data visualization tool
like TBL Loop VI ET Etc right after that
you generate some meaningful information
of that you create some pivot tables
pivot charts and uh line graphs Etc
right so which makes the some sense of
that data you will understand what what
exactly is happening with your business
how many leads or how many traffic
orders what right and which is the best
performing product which is the worst
performing product and you need to take
some decisions on your business which
can make some impact on your overall
profit or Revenue right so imagine if
you want to do this for an year if you
get one year's data and you do it in a
day or two it's fine and if it's on a
monthly basis you get month-on-month
data and you want to do it okay it could
not be worse you can spend one or two
days and it's fine but if what if it's
week on week you start to think right
what if it's a daily task it's a mundane
task right you have to do all these
Steps step by step repetitively and it
it doesn't make any you interested
anymore in that particular type of job
and uh the major point of this is you
end up spending more time on cleaning
the data transforming loading it and the
worst part you don't get proper time
specific time which you want to actually
dedicate to plan out something and bring
up strategies to improve your business
right so what if you could automate this
right what if there is someone who could
perform all these steps for you in the
way you want and you can actually have
some time to produce some pivot tables
pivot charts and then understand what
exactly is happening with your business
and find out some critical points where
you can improvise and bring up some good
Revenue what if there was someone who
can perform all these steps for you
clean your data transform it the way you
want load it to your platform and help
you create your paper charts and P
tables and actually save you a lot of
time where you can spend all that time
understanding your critical points where
you need attention you can fix them and
plan some strategies out to bring out
some good Revenue right that exact
someone who can do all these steps for
you and automate your data cleaning data
transformation and loading tasks for you
is exactly the Microsoft power query so
you can use Microsoft power query either
in Microsoft Excel or Microsoft power PI
right now let's um kind of generate some
data so uh this data will be generated
using chat GPD and we will not generate
data like which is not small like for a
week on WE analysis or a day-by-day
analysis we will create data for years
so we will take five consecutive years
starting from 2020 to 2024 and we will
have some uh data generated using chat
GPD and we will automate that data and
try to get some analysis done right
let's jump on to chat GPD so before we
go to chat GPD I have a prompt written
here so this particular prompt will
guide or explain chat jpd what exactly
you want right so giving some uh like
the Excel data right over here we have
aut date order ID shiip mode and
customer name customer ID everything
right so we have the sales quantity
discount profit Etc so in the same
format or a similar format if not the
same format we are explaining chart gbd
that we need these columns the order ID
order date delivery date Etc and we want
all these files in a downloadable Excel
file links right so you can also specify
this column should have certain certain
things and this column can have certain
certain things right so we will copy
this prompt and head back to chat GPD
and you can just face The Prompt and hit
enter there you go now your request has
been analyzed and shortly you should be
receiving some downloadable Excel files
or some recommendations from chat GPD
I've already performed this process and
we have already downloaded some data so
there you you go you have the data from
2020 to 2024 you can just click on this
to download the file so so I've already
uh done this job and U I've downloaded
the files so those files are exactly in
my downloads here so if you go to
downloads here we have ERS data for 2021
2022 2023 and 2024 so this orders data
has just one file which is orders 2020
so we will perform the data cleaning so
first we will specify the source of the
data then we will perform the data
cleaning and transformation process
then we load this particular Excel 2020
data into Excel and then we load this
Excel data into the visualization tool
we'll use Excel for this and then
generate some pivot tables and pivot
charts we will only do this for one file
which is 2020 right now what's the
surprising part is this particular file
will also get data continuously for the
next year 2021 for the next year 2022
for the next year 2023 and the current
year 2024 right when we just copy paste
or cut copy paste these files into this
particular folder the same
transformation steps the same data
cleaning steps and the same data loading
steps and also including the analysis
will be done for you in the Excel pivot
table right the process has been just
automated right so you can see that
happening for that let's open a new
Excel file so I have the Excel folder
right over here so a new blank Excel
workbook will be opened and if you go to
data here you have get data as we said
it can be a file it can be an Excel file
XML Json PDF it can be from cloud it can
be from a SQL database any any other
source if it's data can work from it so
we will give a file here right so just
uh uh okay so so we will get a file here
so select file and go to the last option
which reads as from folder right so go
to downloads and select that AIT data
yeah go to downloads and select that AIT
data remember this particular folder
should have only one file according to
us which is 2020 data the first years
data right select the folder and open
and this should include the data of only
one file which is a 2020 right so if you
have multiple files you can either
combine transform and load if you have
just one file you can just go with the
transformation option over here or you
can load if you are comfortable with
what you have so I feel there are some
minor changes which I would like to make
to my data so I would go with the
transform option now the power query
window will shortly open now with the
power query window opened you can select
the orders 2022 X Excel folder and it
will be loaded now let's try to click on
the content button over here which
should load our data now you can go with
the first file so here's the preview as
we expected we have the order ID order
date delivery date Etc just press on
okay so the data has been successfully
loaded right now we have the First
Column as Source name which we will not
be needing anymore and you can just
remove that order ID is fine
or the date is fine is it no right so
you can just select both the columns and
change the data type right so here you
have the option of change the data type
where you will change the data type from
whole number to date so that you get a
date right so you have that the First
Transformation step changing data type
has been recorded here so this is like
uh V EXL vbx or macro which will save
all the steps and will apply uh to all
the uh upcoming files right you have to
change the type of delivery date as well
so we will be finding uh the how many
days it took to deliver or if it if the
delivery got delayed right so we can
test that and here if you see uh yes we
requested customer ID and customer name
so we got customer ID along with the
name so we don't want that we want that
in two separate columns we can do that
so you can just select the entire column
go to the split column option over here
select by D limiter so I think it all
automatically recognize that for us but
there is one loophole we have a space d
limiter space option so just press okay
and they should be helping us with the
customer ID so let's rename the customer
ID to just customer ID and this to uh
customer name space name right and
that's done here we have product which
is fine quantity is fine traffic is fine
leads is fine orders and here comes the
money part so we have Revenue cost to
company so we don't know the profit yet
right so to calculate the profit what
you need to do is subtract revenue from
cost to the company and automatically
you will get your profit so in some
instance
you might get a negative value don't
worry about that because uh that can be
a discount offer or some 50% off 75% off
that you regularly sell out your
products which are selling in less
number so that you can just you know uh
move out the products from the store so
that can be done and order status so we
have order stat is as delivered in
transit not delivered yet or order
canell right so we we might have to rule
out some uh status here right so we are
calculating profit here so we don't want
the profit for cancelled orders or not
delivered okay maybe okay okay not
delivered orders uh this might be
considered as the cost of company and
revenue because uh it takes some delay
to refund the amount to the customers so
we can just add a filter to this
particular column and uh we will
unselect not delivered products and
Order cancel products so not delivered
happens when the vendor is not available
to deliver the product to the delivery
agencies so in that case uh the order
gets automatically cancelled and uh the
order will be the money will be refunded
to the customer so we will rule out
these now the data is clean now uh as we
thought to calculate the profit select
these two columns first Revenue then
cost to company because we are
subtracting cost to company from revenue
right so we will go to add to column and
standard and here we have some options
so we will subtract that so we will get
the profit here so now you can name it
as profit done so we just move that
column to the money part of this
particular data set so profit cost to
company and Revenue are the money parts
so we will change data type from just
values to currency right so then that
should be converted into the dollars
format now the first one we don't need
this Source name so you can just ru out
this you can just uh remove this column
and there you go now you have a clean
data you have the order ID order date
delivery date yeah we forgot uh the
another part of this particular data set
transformation where we wanted to find
out the number of days it took to
deliver the product okay I think we
changed uh order ID so we don't want
this so the first okay let's change this
to the to the whole number as it was
okay so order ID fine now we wanted to
find out the number of days it took to
deliver the product so we will select
the delivery date first and then the
order date second go to add column and
uh we will select subtract in days and
we should have that now let's change the
uh subtract subtraction name to days to
dat and you can move this column right
select the whole column and hold it drag
it and you can move this column along
with the dates part of this data set we
have the ordered date and delivered date
right right over here
and you will find how many days it took
to deliver a certain product now um
let's recheck once order ID order date
delivery date dat to deliver customer ID
customer name what product did he or she
ordered and what quantity and uh the
traffic which we received to the website
the traffic which we received to the
website the number of leads we got out
of those traffic numbers the number of
orders we got out of those uh uh Le
and what's the revenue we got out of
those orders and what was the cost of
the company and what is the profit that
we made out of that order right and we
also have the order status remember we
only considered remember we only
considered two types right uh we
considered in transit and delivered
statuses only we ruled out cancelled
orders and not delivered orders so that
we have accurate results of our profit
made and revenue made out of this right
now I'm completely satisfied with my
transformation and cleaning of my data
set now let's go to home and here we
have the option of close and load so we
will go with that and this particular
data set should be loaded to the data
visualization where we have selected
Excel right uh so we have the ERS data
for
20 20 correct okay let's not add date
here because after all we will have some
more data for 2021 2 three and four
right so let it be the way it is and if
you just check the filter here we have
only one year and if you just check the
filter here you will have only one year
and if you just check the filter here
you will have only one year 2020 and if
you go to the delivery date which let's
say if you have an order placed on
December 31st and it got delivered on
January 5th or something so you'll have
a little bit of a part of 2021 data
which is completely all right not to be
worried about so the main important
thing is audit date so we want the audit
dates of 2020 so that is loaded here
right now you can just select the whole
data set over here and uh you can add or
insert some pivot tables here right from
the selected range and uh let's go with
the default option which creates a new
sheet everything in a new location right
here you have it now let's say you
wanted to make out some U insights from
this uh data set let's delete the other
sheet which we don't want and let's name
it as
pivot now the products will be loaded to
the columns and uh profit will be loaded
to values so you have a data set over
here sum of profit from beds chairs
cupboards sare tort so here you have the
pivot table which has sum of profit bed
chair cupboard sofa T and grand total
some of profits made from these these
these and these now select this entire
data and go to the uh SE option here go
to the pivot chart and uh here
automatically here you can see that it
is you know suggesting recommending us
to go for the bar chart which is a lot
more better just select okay and you
have your PIV chart over here right and
see the grand total here 22
4811
4.15 now this is only for one years of
data now what we will do is go back to
the downloads folder select the
remaining years which is 2021 2 3 and
four add that to the file location so
let's quickly go to our folder here and
go to downloads select the folders I'm
going to cut them from here go to a data
and paste them here right now our job is
done if we go back to the data here go
to home and
data okay let's so now that we have
added the data to our folder go to the a
data and here select the data segment
and just select refresh all so
everything is refreshed now let's check
the audit date filter and we will have
all the 5 Years From 2020 to one 2 3 and
four and let's press okay for that and
if you go to the pivot table you can
also see the changes here just press
refresh all and there you go you have
the updated data right over here now
that saved a lot of time for you and now
that time can be utilized to plan a
strategy and focus on the low parts of
your business and improvise them and
bring a big change to the revenue in
this video we are focusing on chat GPT
and its groundbreaking role in data

Chad GPT is not just revolutionizing
data analytics but also how we
understand and interact with the vast
Universe of data and don't forget to hit
that like button subscribe and ring the
bell to stay updated on all our future
Explorations into the fascinating world
of technology now let's get started and
unlock the potential of chat GPD for
data analytics together so guys an Excel
data analyst always looks for ways to
improve their efficiency and gain deeper
insights from the data that's where chat
jbt comes in handy so chat jbt is an AI
powered language model that can assist
you in various task including Excel
based data analysis and for that data
analysis let's dive into some demos to
see how it works so guys as you can see
this is the chat jpt 4 and you could see
this has the support of D browsing and
Analysis and usage limits May apply like
we have the version that has some usage
limits and for the data I have
downloaded the data from the kar I will
provide you the link in the description
if you want to download the same data
you can and I have that in my downloads
so this is the data that we'll be using
so the first thing we'll be doing is
data cleaning and preparation so firstly
let's explore data cleaning and
preparation before diving into analysis
it's essential to ensure our data is
clean and ready for processing so for
that we will write a prompt in chat jpt
and ask him to clean the data chat jpt
has the feature to insert the files
provide the Excel file to the chat jpt
and we'll ask him that can you help me
identify and remove duplicates in this
Excel spreadsheet so let's ask him can
you help me identify and remove
duplicates duplicates from this Excel
spreadsheet from the
provided
Excel spreadsheet you could see that Chi
has started generating the response and
he is telling us that he can definitely
help us with that and he's analyzing
that so you could see that J has
provided us the response so let's first
go to our
spreadsheet so this is the spreadsheet
order number quantity
ordered price of each quantity and Order
lines so you could see that first chart
GPT has encountered an error and that is
with the corrector and coding Mis patch
and then he has loaded the spreadsheet
successfully with the second attempt and
you could see that he has provided a
like the smaller or the briefer version
of the spreadsheet that is the data set
consist of sales data with column such
as order number quantity order price
each order line sales order date status
so he asking us could you specify how
you would like to identify duplicates
for example should be consider a row a
duplicate if all its values match and
row exactly or are this specifically
columns we should focus on to determine
duplicates so we should or here we'll be
focusing on the column section so here
we want to
identify column
section so is asking which columns they
should identify duplicates so we want
the duplicates in order number
so the CH GD has started analyzing the
spreadsheet so you could see that CH GT
has puras the response that they have
identified a total of
287 rows in the spreadsheet that have
duplicates based on the order number
column so this indicates that multiple
rows share the same order number
suggesting there might be different
items or transactions within the same
order would you like to proceed by
removing the these duplicates while
keeping either the first or last Ence of
each order number or do you have another
approach in mind for handling these
duplicates so before identifying the
duplicates what we'll do is we'll first
get rid of the extra spaces so we'll ask
chat jbt
that first
find the Extra
Spaces in the
spreadsheet and
and help us remove
them so you could see that it has
started analyzing
it so he is asking us that would you
like to proceed with any further
cleaning or data manipulation yes we
going to proceed further with data
cleaning only and now we will treat all
the blank cells if there are
any now treat all the blank
cells if there are
any so the spreadsheet contains blank
cells in the following columns with the
respective counts of blank entries that
is address line two has 2,521 blank
sales than the state so depending on
preference or the requirements of data
analysis we can treat these blank cells
in several ways such as filling them
with a t holder value that is not
provided using a specific value that
makes sense for data that is example a
default state of TI but potentially
leaving them as if blanks carry
meaningful information in the context of
your data so what we will do we will
provide a
placeholder provide a placeholder
instead that
is not provided or not applicable okay
so we would see that J has responded
that it has replaced the plank cells in
the columns that is address line two
state postal code and territory with the
placeholder node provided so you could
see there's a verification sample
showing the updates so this is how you
could clean the data and now with chat
jpt you can quickly identify and
eliminate duplicates in your Excel
spreadsheet using build-in functions and
formulas
saving your time and effort so that
would be done by the chat GPD and you
can download the Excel file from the
chat GPD only after that you can just
ask him that provide me the output or
the resulted spreadsheet so if we talk
about now data analysis and
visualization let's delve into that so
Excel offers powerful tools for
analyzing and visualizing data and chat
gbt can help you make the most of them
so for this also we'll write a prompt to
the chat JT and we'll write for example
we'll write please create a pivot table
and a corresponding chart to analyze
sales performance by region so let's see
like this prompt what output does CH je
show to us so let's ask him please
create a PV
table and a
corresponding chart to
analyze sales performance
region so you would see that J has
started analyzing the data and the
spreadsheet and you could see that the
pivot table below shows the sales
performance per region or the territory
so this table indicates that the EMA
region has the highest sales performance
followed by regions where the territory
was not provided then ape and finally
Japan so now let's create a chart to
visually represent this sales
performance by region you could see that
it has provided a chart that is a b
chart illustrating the sales performance
by so you could see the guys that it has
provided us the analysis and CH jpd can
guide you through the process of
creating pivot tables charts and other
visualizations in Excel enabling you to
gain valuable insights from your data
with ease so let's move to Advanced
analysis and automation
so lastly we will explore Advanced
analysis and automation so Excel
capabilities extend beyond basic
functions and chat jpd can help you
leverage its full potential and for this
also we'll write a prompt to the chat
jpd that can you assist me in building a
forecasting model to predict future
sales based on historical data present
in the spreadsheet so let's see what CH
J respond to us so let's ask him
can
you assist
me in
building a forecasting
model to predict future
sales based on historical
data so let's see what CH G respond to
us so you could see that building a
forecasting model to BU future sales
based on historical data involves
several steps so for this you have to
prepare the data select a model train
the model evaluate the model and make
predictions so let's start by preparing
the data we'll aggregate sales by order
date to create a Time series of total T
sales then we'll choose a model based on
data's characteristics so we
will grant the permission to J gyt to
proceed with the steps so we started
analyzing the data
so you could see that that the data has
been prepared into a Time series of
total daily sales and before choosing a
forecasting model it's helpful to
visualize the sales time series to
understand its characteristics such as
Trend and seasonality so Chad GPT has
floated a daily sales data and then he
has given the visual Trends and the
possible seasonal patterns and the next
steps would include testing for
stationarity model selection and
parameter touring model training and
then forecasting so you could follow all
these steps with the help of chat GPT
and could create a forecasting model if
you want we can move to the next step so
you could like provide a prom to the
chat chy that move
to or proceed with Next Step
so step by step Chad Gip will provide
you a forecasting model or it will help
you create a forecasting model as you
can see it has started analyzing it to
the augmented Dy Fuller that is ADF test
gives up a P value of approximately
0.0033 since this P value is less than
the common significance level of 0.05 we
can reject the null hypothesis that the
time Series has a unit rot meaning the
time series is stationary so you could
see that he's asking us shall we proceed
with the Sima model parameter selection
yes here is the model parameter
selection so you could select any based
on the trends and the bar graphs ploted
by the chat
GD so you could see guys that the chat
gity has analyzed the spreadsheet and
provided the response that the grid
search for the optimal Sima parameters
based on the lower
information Criterion suggest the best
fit model uses the parameter 011 and for
ARA and
0112 that is for the seasonal component
so you could see that it has provided
the model and the parameters now is
asking us shall we move on to
forecasting future sales with this model
yes proceed with that so you could see
that with JJs assistance you can build
complex forecasting models in Excel
allowing you to make informed decisions
and plan for the future effectively so
chat jpt is a valuable tool for Excel
users and data analysis offering
assistance in data cleaning analysis
visualization and Automation and by
integrating chat JY in your Excel
workflows you can enhance your
productivity and uncover new insights
from your data so you can try J gbt for
Excel data analytics today and take your
Excel skills to the new level and you
could see that uh there's an error in
the analyzing and he is encountered an
error while trying to plot the forecast
with its confidence intervals so this
type of error can occur due to data type
issues particularly when handling data
indices in forecast and despite the S up
the forecasting process using the ca
model was completed and we were able to
generate forecast for the next 12 months
unfortunately due to the plotting issue
he couldn't visually display it so we'll
ask him can you try once
again so you could see that this time
share GPT has provided us the forecast
for the next 12 months that is the
forecast have been successfully ploted
along with the historical daily data so
here we have our forecast model and with
the chat J's assistance we can move with
other analysis also that's a wrap on a
powerbi full course in 2024 if you have
