design today we are going to explore the
top 10 AI tools that can really level up
your uiux design skills we will cover
tools like Coco cleanup dot pictures
let's enhance and a lot more don't worry
we'll dive into each tool with Hands-On
examples so you can see exactly how they
work first things first what exactly is
UI ux design well UI is also known as
user interface is all about how a
website or app looks like think about
buttons colors and layouts on the other
hand ux also known as user experience is
about how easy and enjoyable it is for
people to use that website or app
together they make sure that the user
has a great experience both visually and
functionally now here's the exciting
part with the help of AI tools you can
make your design process a lot faster
and more efficient AI is here to stay so
if you're looking to save time while
still delivering amazing designs this
video is for you if you are new to uiux
design or unsure where to start I have
got you covered check out my previous
video where I break down the full road
map for beginners the link is in the
description below without making any
further delay let's get started the
first tool I will be talking about is
Coco search for Coco in the search bar
in the web browser and then just log in
with your email address and after that
when you're inside this figma uh you
need to go to this figma community and
then plugins and then search for Coco
coco. it will take a few minutes and you
are here these are this uh upgrade plan
to Pro for dollar three for per month so
kindly ignore this for now and you can
uh see that you can build user Persona
user Journey mapping design r VI and
many more options are there so go for a
Persona and after that when you click on
Persona you will get the Persona
demographic scenario and you need to
mention here uh the instructions for
which personal you want to build for
example I will take the example of a
let's write a 24 year
old uh University student and in the
scenario let's write looking for a I
mean trying to
find job
online and let's generate it and there
you go your persona is created see uh
they have mentioned Jordan Smith and age
is 24 task and activities challenges and
pain points touch points and channels
attitudes and thoughts and everything
and anything they have created it so
basically it is the magic of AI now now
let's see about user Journey
mapping let's create a new user Journey
same Persona demographics and scenario
let's take the same example as a 24 year
old old University
student trying to find job
online and let's generate
it it will now create all the faes that
the user may go through such as I will
show you see the phase it has now
created the user Journey mapping
basically it will create all the phases
that the user may go through such as the
job search interview preparation and so
on with each phase it will create the
attitude challenges pain points task and
activities and Etc in a nutshell nothing
can replace the manual research but it
can make it a lot faster and thus it
helps tremendously as a ux designer just

Journey now the next tool I will be
talking about is cleanup. pictures
cleanup. pictures is an AI powered
online photo editing tool designed to
remove The Unwanted elements from images
such as people objects text or logos so
let's try it with an example here in the
section you can see try with an example
or you can click here or drag an image
file so let's try it with an
example so basically you need to point
this particular object that you want to
move and
erase see the pencil has gone so it is
awesome actually
it's so easy and handy to remove the
background pictures so I if you are not
using it I will recommend you use it the
next tool is let's
enhance as a designer you always work
with images and you want your images to
look upgraded and sharp but
unfortunately it's not the case all the
time this is where let's enhance workin
it's an AI power tool designed to
upscale and enhance images without
losing the quality with just just one
click I will show you see the difference
this was the original picture and after
enhancing it it became like this so it's
nice the next tool we will see is clad
clad doai this is basically a product of
lets enhance the tool which we used
previously this tool is designed to
create different products as per your
need you can change the background
enhance an up scale res size and extent
correct the colors background add
shadows and whatnot so let's try this
with the help of an
example correct
colors you can increase and decrease the
intensity exposure and anything and
click this button to apply
operation so it has finally done it the
next tool is what we all are familiar
and in love with that is our chart J it
is very helpful to write copies building
user personnels generating all sorts of
research for our projects and whatnot we
can just directly get in and ask write a
copy write a
copy of the podcast landing
page including all the
sections and after giving this prompt it
may take a few minutes and yeah it has
started creating
so it has started making the latest
episodes welcome as simple as that our
simply learns podcast Channel about the
podcast why listen uh to as simple as
that subscribe today meet the host
featured guest and listener reviews join
the conversation and get ined so in no
time with a chat GPD you can make
anything and everything so if you're not
using chj nowadays you are missing out
on on a lot of things so I would
recommend use chity for making your UI
design Journey a lot faster the next
tool we would be talking about is
attention Insight so attention Insight
is a tool that helps understand how
people focus on websites images or ads
it uses artificial intelligence to
predict where users will look the most
this helps businesses and designers
improve their design by highlighting
important areas like you can
see it is getting the most attention
work on Big Ideas without the busy work
like the headlines and all the uh
people's faces they're getting the most
attention so it's basically a type of
website that scans your website and lets
you know which areas people focus more
on there are various features see all
the features you will uh see there are
various features inside attention hit
Maps percentages of attention focus map
launch with full confidence Clarity
score it will be Clarity score like 65
and anything it will be the overall
score you have higher Clarity than 60%
of the most popular
websites so it is a very nice
tool the next tool we are talking about
is mid Journey so you can just go to the
website and explore and see it has
something awesome till this day
according to me the best image generator
is obviously mid Journey uh which
operate inside a Discord but pretty soon
we'll get some uh search bars over here
where we can type our own prompts and
get to generate images uh you can
upscale this zoom out and anything
amazing with it mour is just getting
better you can see the uh images it just
creates you know is the best image
generator according to me and it has the
like um Mid journey is just getting
better and better and in my opinion it's
one of the best image generating tools
driven by AI in the market so this you
can't miss out on this so the next tool
I will be talking about today is font
Joy you might be not so much familiar
with the tool but yeah font Jo will
create interesting and generate font
pairings like if you um you can you can
go over here and change the font
according to your wish and then you can
just lock it by clicking over here and
you can just uh be generate like if I
balance control like I'm decreasing it
and generate see you can feel the
difference right and you can create the
adjustments and just click on generate
and it will generate something very cool
if you're struggling with the font
pairings font Joy can be your savior the
next tool is kind of similar to the
previous like this font Joy this is
color mind
so it is a color palette generator that
is AI driven and allows you to generate
really cool and unique color palettes
and we have a bunch of really cool
palettes over here down the page you can
choose particular
color and like you can generate and it
will keep on changing and you can go
over here and change it it's so cool you
can even get the color code over here
and
generate so it is very nice if you're
struggling with the font pairings again
font Joy can be your savior so the last
tool I will be talking today about has a
lot of UI capabilities that is nothing
other than visil Ai and the last tool I
will be talking about today is visil AI
it has a lot of UI capabilities over
here and when you open the website you
can see a particular section that is
only dedicated to visil AI so it is it
will make something awesome aome and
here if you click on this you'll find
screenshot to design text to diagram and
the most interesting thing is sketch to
design you can even upload your file or
see some sample sketches like this and
something good is happening it will take
some time it's completed and you can see
how nicely it is built if I zoom in you
can see the dashboard projects themes
and has created just from the particular
diagram that was even like a sketch and
nothing and it has created such an
awesome thing really AI is a magic
