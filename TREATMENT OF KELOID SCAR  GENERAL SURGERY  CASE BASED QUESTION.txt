yeah happiness uh this is dr srikant
from team mds conquer now we'll have a
quick glance of this
particular
topic which is most commonly and
frequently repeated in the exam so
before going into the treatment i am
just going to give three or four
important points related to this
particular
scar for a case based question
so the background history they may
give related to this particular scar
like it is most common in the woman or
they may give
ethiology of occurrence of one
particular bacterial infection that is
tuberculosis is one of the ethiology
for occurrence of this keloid scar
and it is most common in
uh
blacks that is negros it is most common
in negros when compared to the regular
population
and it has claw-like process and
the keloid is unslightly
often tender to touch and always itches
itching is one of the most common thing
and of course uh in the case based
question they can give you that excision
followed by reoccurrence reoccurrence is
very common
commonly occurred in the keloid when
compared to that of the hypertrophic
scar like itching is there
okay and reoccurrence is very familiar
women
tb theology so coming to the treatment
so treatment we have lots of questions
on treatment and most of you are
confused about the treatment so
according to ssdas the treatment options
for the keloid were categorized into two
types
the type one is conservative and type
two is surgical
surgical problem is reoccurrence will be
more than surgical so it's better
treatment if they ask you the best
treatment ideal treatment it is
definitely the conservative treatment
where you will go for intra relational
injection of steroids
okay so first of all coming to the
conservative treatments so in
conservative treatments we have the
following options which you have to
focus on first is the intralesional
injection of steroids
or you can try the introduction
injection of
hydrolysis which helps in lysising this
collagen fibers or immature
immature fibroblasts and all these
things you can try uh intra-regional
injection of
vitamin a and methotrexate has also been
tried but the best is the first one
the next one deep x-ray therapy has also
been tried a mode of radiotherapy
okay
with with some success rate
so basically what happens here it it is
going to
suppress the proliferation of immature
fibroblasts and blood vessels
and thereby stops the growth of the
keloid and it stops the itching also
there are a few studies telling that
itching is also being stopped by using
deep x-ray therapy
and ultrasonic therapy has also been
tried okay so you can make a note about
ultrasonic therapy also in the case of
your conservative coming to the surgical
excision and resuturing is most commonly
uh
done but uh recurrence rate is very very
high so what they have done is they have
added pre-operative and post-operative
radiotherapy for a better result but
it's not the best treatment
sometimes because of the overgrowth
class-like process and all these
development so shaving away the excess
scar tissue and resurfacing the tissue
with thin skin graft has also been tried
so these are the two sessions of keloid
scar that you have to make your own
there are high chances that they can ask
you a case based question or
interlinking a case based question with
the best treatment plan among the list
of the options okay i hope you are clear
i am done with this small topic
study well all the best signing of dr
srikham from team mds concur
