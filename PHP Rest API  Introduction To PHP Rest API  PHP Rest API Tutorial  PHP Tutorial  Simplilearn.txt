hello everyone and welcome to Simply
learn today we will learn what is rest
API with PHP now let's get started now
suppose you want to create a weather app
for weather forecast in your area now to
do that you have to set up a superc
computer and a satellite to monitor the
realtime weather but I wish everyone
could be that rich now for those who
cannot afford the setup you can get the
same information from an existing web
service using an API now an API acts as
a medium between a web service and your
application which helps you communicate
your request with the service and get a
response so in this video we'll be
learning about what is rest API
principles of rest API how does a rest
API work and finally creating a sample
rest API with the help of
PHP now let's move on and see what
exactly is rest
API API stands for application
programming interface Now API is a set
of protocols which acts as a medium of
communication between programs in other
words it is a way two programs talk to
each other now let us understand this
with an
example suppose you the client go to a
restaurant to eat now here the
restaurant is supposed to be the server
how do you communicate your order to the
kitchen here the waiter comes in the
picture now here the waiter acts as a
medium between you the client and
restaurant the server to send your
request to the kitchen and get food in
return as per requested this is exactly
what an API
does so now that we have an
understanding in of API let us look at
what rest means in rest
API now rest stands for representational
State
transfer it is an architectural style
which defines a set of Protocols of how
an API is
written now rest follows a set of
principles for the design and
development of an
API now it is a very efficient
technology as rest takes less bandwidth
over over similar other
Technologies so now that we know what
rest API is let us move on to
understanding the principles on which a
rest API is
designed now the first principle is
client server the second stateless third
cachable fourth uniform
interface fifth layered system and sixth
code on demand now let us understand
understand these principles one by
one client server a rest API design
works on the concept that the client and
server should be isolated from one
another and develop
independently this helps in increasing
manageability across various
platforms stateless now according to
this principle rest API should be
stateless which means calls can be made
independent of one another also every
request sent from the client to the
server must include all the info needed
to comprehend the
request cachable this principle states
that a rest API should be able to hold
cachable data the data in the response
should be indirectly or directly
categorized as cachable or
non-cashable uniform interface according
to this principle there should be a
uniform interface across all devices
and platforms for the interaction
between application and
server layered systems now rest API
architecture includes several layers
that operate together to construct the
hierarchy that helps generate a more
scalable and flexible application now
due to the rest API layered system the
application has better security as
components in each layer cannot interact
outside the subsequent layer moreover it
balances loads and offers shared caches
for stimulating
scalability now the last code on demand
now this is optional but this principle
allows for coding to be communicated
through the API as executable code to
the client to be used within the
application we now know on what
principles an API is designed now let us
see how an API
work rest API makes use of HT HTTP
methods to implement various tasks based
on the client risk request so the HTTP
method uses grud to perform various
operations on the server grud here
stands for create read update and
delete now in case of HTTP methods post
method is used to create get method to
read data put method to update it and
delete method to delete data
so I hope you have some understanding of
what risk apis are principles on which
they are designed and how do they work
now let us move on to creating a sample
risk API with the help of
PHP so first let us open the zamp
control
panel and start our Apache and MySQL
servers
now what I'm going to do is I am going
to
create a
database for my
API let us name it
API and let us name the table as
users it will have four columns
first one would be ID integer and it
will be Auto
[Music]
incremented the second let us name it as
name third would
be
Ag and finally
email now name would be a text an email
will also be a
text let us quickly save
this and now we have a table for
us now let us add some data into the
table
so
Mac age would be 21 email would be
Mac
xyz.com now
let us create another
entry name could be simply
learn
age
30 email simply learn atate xyz.com
now as you can see we have added two
rowes with the data that we just
entered now let us move on to the visual
studio code
and see Zam HT
dos and let us create a new folder let's
name it
API and
open with Visual Studio
code let's create a new file let us name
it
tutorial.
PHP and now let us start writing our
code now first what I'm going to do is
I'm going going to connect my
database with this
code now since the database is locally
hosted it will be Local Host
root since there's no password this
field has to be empty now
what was the name of a database that is
API that is what we have to enter
here now this is a
variable to get the response from the
server for the database
okay there's something
wrong now it seems like my opening curly
veres key is not working so I had to
open this on screen
keyboard we don't need you right
now now let us create and another
variable named
SQL now this is Select this command will
select all the data from a table users
users
again we going to need the curly
[Music]
braces what I'm doing here is I'm
creating a
variable as a counter and I'm going to
give it a value of zero now let us
create a v Loop and in this V
loop I am going to fetch the
data and display it in Json format
now we are going to write the names of
all the rows that we created in a
table now I'm just going to copy paste
tast it otherwise we'll have to use this
on screen keyboard again and
again second one
was
name agent email
now what I'm going to do is I
will Plus+ the
counter now to display it as in in Jon
format we have to
write disant
code with the response for
error message and now let us and the
code let us go and
quickly save our
code open a
browser go to the Local Host post API
this is the folder that we created now
as you can see our tutorial. PHP is
visible here and when you click on it
you can see the data from the database
being extracted with the help of API in
JM
format so this was all about R API with
the help of PHP thank you for watching
