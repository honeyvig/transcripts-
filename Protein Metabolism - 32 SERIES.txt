hello guys this is dr ramya from team
mds conquer
in this 32 series we are going to study
some important points on the topic of
protein metabolism
point number one gout is primarily a
disorder of urine metabolism
number two uric acid is the final
breakdown product of purine degradation
in humans
number three primary growth results from
either
increased production or implied
extinction of metabolic end products
of purine metabolism that is p uric acid
number four urea is mainly formed in
liver onto small extent in brain
point number five sources of carbon and
nitrogen in urea or methane are
carbomide citrine and
arsenal number six theanine lysine
phenylalanine methionine isoleucine and
nusins
tryptophan valine arginine and histidine
are
nutritionally essential amino acids
whereas arginine and histidine are
semi-essential amino acids among them
arginine is more essential than
histidine
point number nine hemoglobin is an
allosteric protein
allosteric protein is the one in which
binding of a ligand to one side
affects the binding properties of
another site on the same protein
phosphor fractal finals is an allosteric
enzyme
the allosteric enzyme is the one in
which binding of a modulator to the
enzyme
induces a conformational change in the
enzyme
making it more active or less fractured
point number 13 proteins are responsible
for maintaining the structural strength
of cells
that is this cytoskeleton and tissues
point number 14
collagen is the most abundant of the
fibrous proteins
other prominent fibrous protein include
keratin
and myosin proteoglycans are made up of
sugar and amino acids
point number 17 glycosaminoglycans hold
large amount of water
thereby producing gel life matrix that
forms the basis of body's ground
substance
and lubricating to other structures
number 18
aspartic acid migrates fastest on
chromatography on carboxymethyl
cellulose medium
number 19 an alpha helix of a protein is
most likely to be disrupted
if a mistance mutation introduces the
aspartic acid
within the alpha helical structure
number 20
aspartic acid being a urged amino acid
disrupts the coiled spiral structure
number 21 convergence is an evolutionary
process by which
distinctly unrelated organisms like
proteins
acquire morphologically similar traits
whereas divergence produces different
types in related to the same ancestor
organisms point number 23
triple bonds are found between cytosine
and grain and base paint
whereas double bonds are found between
adenosine and tyrosine base phase
folding of a protein chain is due to
hydrogen bonds
the hydrophobic weak interactions are
predominantly important for proteins
stabilizing the conformation whereas
hydrophobic residues are largely buried
in the protein
interior away from water and the number
of hydrogen bonds and ionic interaction
within the protein is maximized
thus reducing the number of hydrogen
bonding and ionic group
that are not paid with the suitable
partner number 27
glutamine is the sole form of transport
of ammonia in brain
this is an amide of glutamic acid which
is formed from alpha ketoglutarate
number 29 alanine using is a
conservative mutator
the secretary proteins and transport
proteins are synthesized in ribosomes
attached to the endoplasmic reticulum
whereas
proteins which have to be delivered in
cytosol are synthesized in free poly
ribosomes
point number 32 chaperones are the
proteins
that play a role in the assembly or
proper folding of other proteins
without themselves being component of
the latter
that's it for today's 32 series guys
hope you all note down these points
revise them well all the best thank you
