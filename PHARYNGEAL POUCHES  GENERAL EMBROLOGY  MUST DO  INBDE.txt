happiness
i'm back here
with one more important topic related to
the embryology so before jumping into
the pouches i'll be talking about
the pharyngeal arches
so as we know during formation there
will be six arches out of which the
fifth one disappears
so finally we are left over with five
so when you take each pharyngeal arch
into consideration okay the outermost
like you can divide the pharyngeal arch
into three parts okay one is the
outermost part
okay that is you can you can call it as
a surface
the second one is the core
okay the second one is the core part and
the last one is the inside part okay the
last one is the
inside part
when coming to the surface the surface
is basically formed from
ectoderm
whereas the core is basically found from
mesoderm
plus
neural crushed cells
whereas the inside is basically formed
from
endodon the inner most is formed from
endodontics these are the points that
you have to make you know apart from
that
you try to cover
the derivatives of each pharyngeal arch
so now jumping into pouches so you have
five pouches out of which most commonly
asked questions will moves around third
fourth and fifth pouches okay so
particularly
inferior parathyroid glands originated
from third one whereas the superior
parathyroid lens originated from
fourth touch most of they can ask you
like parathyroid glands derived from
which are the following pouches the
answer is three and four inferior is
third one
superior is the fourth one
thyroid gland is again a frequently
asked question thyroid gland is derived
from the fourth pharyngeal pouch thymus
okay so thymus we learn the thymus in
ortho that is negative growth which are
the following has negative growth so the
following organ has negative growth the
answer is thymus and thymus is also
derived from third pharyngeal arteries
palette and tonsil
translator fossa they're derived from
the second pharyngeal arch
and almost all the stuff related to the
ear when they ask your tympanic cavity
auditory tube inner surface of the
eardrum they are derived from the first
pharyngeal pouch and of course fifth
pharyngeal pouch is again the most
commonly asked question so just have a
quick glance okay very important area
and master
take care all the best i'll be back with
one more video
