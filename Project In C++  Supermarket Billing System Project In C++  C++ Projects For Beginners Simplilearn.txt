hey guys welcome to another tutorial by
simply learn i hope you all are doing
well
so in this session we will learn how to
create a supermarket billing project in
c plus
we will create this project in small
parts as there are various functions
that we will be creating for this
project
like the add function to add the goods
and products in the market and delete
function to delete some products etc
also we will create a buyer site where
the buyer can buy the products or food
items of his choice
so now let's go ahead but before that
make sure to subscribe to our channel
and press the bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn
now we will move to our code editor that
is dev c
so now let's create a new file
and we'll start with
adding the header files first of all
we'll add hash include iostream
then we'll include the f stream file
right hash include f stream because
here we have to do the file handling
operations as well so we'll add the
stream file
now we'll write the namespace standard
now let's save this one and name it
billing 1 dot cpp
all right so we have named this file
now first of all we'll create a class
and we will declare some variables and
functions
so let's create a class and name the
class as
shopping
inside the class shopping first of all
inside the private scope
we will create or declare some variables
p code
then
float type
price
then another variable discount of load
type
then name which should be string
all right let's name it p name
p stands for product
all right
now inside the public scope we will
declare the functions
so
let's name this function as menu
because we have to create the menu then
administrator function
all right now let's create a buyer
function
a buyer customer whatsoever
all right
now let's create add function
then the edit function
these definitions of these functions we
will create later first of all here we
are declaring these functions
after that we have to remove some
products for that we will create remove
function
and then the list function to display
the list
and at last
recept function
all right
so here we have declared the
functions and the variables
so now we'll put semicolon in the end of
the class
and we'll start with the first function
that is the menu function
so we'll write wide
class name
then the scope resolution operator
and
menu function
so now inside this function
first of all we will create a
variable
that is choice
and
some more variables like let's say
email
and password
because here we will need
email as well as password for the login
purpose
so now we have to create this menu and
for that we have to first of all display
supermarket main menu and after that we
will display that administrator buyer
etc and
all that so now let's start with that
for that we have to display and
you can display in your own style
like i usually do like this
slash t to add some horizontal space
it's just for formatting
and
after that same will do
to save some time let's just copy and
just paste it
and but now we'll here we'll write
supermarket
main menu
reduce some space
all right now similarly we'll do here
now let's just copy and paste this part
all right now again some space
all right now we'll create a menu in
which
the user have to select the customer
have to select
whether he is an administrator or a
buyer
so let's do that
and for that
write c out
slash d slash d slash d to add some
horizontal space
and
all right now
administrator
now similarly here we'll do for
we'll add some space over here
just remove this one
in number two will write buyer
the person who wants to buy stuff
from the market
all right
now
let's format it
we'll add some space over here
now in number three we'll write exit
all right it's pretty much done
after that again if we want to add some
space we can
add some
it's just for formatting purposes you
can do it in your own way
and after that
we have to display a message saying that
please select
so we'll display message
forgot to use semicolon
now we'll take an input from the user
that
whatsoever he wants to click on like if
he is an administrator he'll click on
one if he's a buyer then he'll click on
two and if he wants to exit he can click
on three
so we will take an input of choice
now we have to use switch case
and let's create that
switch inside this will write choice we
all know how switch case works
all right now for case 1 that is
administrator case we will ask the user
to enter the login credentials if he or
she is an administrator
so let's just do that
so first of all we'll display a message
saying that please login
so
slash t slash d
enter email and then
we'll take the input of email we already
declared this variable
email and
now
we'll take the password from the user
now we'll take the input of the password
so as we have taken the email and
password from the user now we will set
an email and password that only admin
knows and no other person can enter that
and let's say
for that we have to use if else
statements
so
if
email
equals
now let's set the email first of all
robbie at the rate email.com
you can write the email and password as
of your choice
and i'll set the password now as
robbie at the rate one two three
now inside the if block
if the user enters this
that means it is the administrator
and
we will call this administrator function
all right
now in the else block
we'll simply display a message saying
that invalid username password
invalid username
invalid email password
all right after that we'll use the break
to end the case
now we will create case 2 case 2 is for
the buyer so we'll write
case 2
and in this case we'll simply call the
buyer function
so this is the case 2 and now we have to
create the case three
inside the case three
case three is for exit so we'll do exit
zero
it means successful termination of the
program
now
default case
so inside the default case will simply
display a message saying that
please select from the given options
default case will execute if a person
selects any other option
rather than one two three
so
we'll have to instruct him
that please select from the given option
select from the
given options
now
after this we'll use a go to statement
after the switch statement
so go to is a jump statement
so it will help us in jumping to the
main menu again
after the completion of this switch case
and
this m is a label we have to put this
label at the starting of this menu
so let's do that
right m
now coming back to the next function
so this function is done
so we'll close this function
all right so now we will create an
administration function in which there
will be different
options inside the administrator menu
so now let's start with that
so we will write
void
shopping that is the class name
group resolution operator
administrator
so our function name is administrator
so inside this function
first of all we will declare variable
choice
now after that
we will
create a menu in which there will be
different options
so
let's do that
first of all we'll write slash in
then slash d
some horizontal spaces
so that
administrator
menu
all right
after that
it will be our first option
so first of all we'll write slash and
then slash these
just to make it bit fancy we can do this
add the product
so the user can select this option if he
wants to
add the product not user the
administrator
now we will add some space in this one
now again same
we'll copy it from here then paste it
so here we will change it to the
modified product
modify the product and
we have to adjust it as well
all right now again we'll add some space
we can copy this one
now
here we write delete the product
now here again
three and make this four
four will be off back to main menu
all right
now after that we will ask the user to
please enter your choice
so we'll display a message saying that
please enter your
choice
all right
now the user
will enter the choice
now again we have to use the switch case
statements
inside this
first case first of all we'll
make and inside this first case
we will call the add function
after that we'll use break statement
now we'll create case 2.
in case 2 we will call the modify
function or the edit function
so we'll write
edit
and again the break
now
we'll create case 3
in case 3
there will be delete function
so we'll name this function as remove
rem stands for remove
now case 4 would be back to main menu
so for that
we'll simply call the menu function
now after case 4 there would be default
case
so we'll write default
and we'll print a message saying that
invalid choice
all right so
after the switch case statement again as
we have done in the previous function
we will mark
m with the go to statement which is a
jump statement and label it over here
all right so administrator function is
done
after this function now we will create
another function
let's say buyer function
so
for that
void shopping
scope resolution operator
buyer
all right
so inside this buyer function first of
all we'll declare the variables
and choice
now inside this function we'll ask the
user that he or she wants to buy the
product or go back so let's create that
first of all here we'll write
by the product now first of all we'll
write buyer
yeah
after that
let's get some space
now
first would be
my product
now there is some space let's copy it
and paste it over here
and
space
[Music]
alright so these are some options
after that we will ask the user to enter
your choice
then the user will enter his choice
so we are taking the input
after that
we'll use the switch statement
and
choice
so inside the switch statement first of
all we'll create case one
[Music]
inside this case
we will call
the recept function
inside the recept function all the
operations of the buyer will take place
so this is the receipt function and
after that we'll use break
now we'll create case 2.
in case 2 will write
or call the menu function as
2 would be go back as you can see
now default case
write invalid choice
now after this again we'll use the go to
jump statement
and mark here m
all right so after this function
now we will create the add function
so as we know if the user over here
the administrator over here will click
on this add the product that is the
first
case then this add function will be
called so now we will create this add
function
so we'll write void
shopping
add
so inside this function we will use some
file handling operations
so
create an object of fstream class
so data is the name of the object
now we'll create some variables like nc
and
token equals zero
and
float
p
float
d
and
string n
so these are the variables that we have
declared now we have to create a menu
kind of a structure
in which we will ask the user to enter
the product code of product the name of
the product price discount etc
so let's do that
so let's write
add new
product
all right after that we will write the
product code of product we'll ask the
user to enter the product code of the
product
so we'll write slash and slash in and on
slash d
we'll
take the input in p code we have already
declared these variables at the top of
our code
now
we will write another
message saying that name of the product
for that i'll write
name
of the product
now we will take the input
in p name
now we'll display
price of the product
we'll take the input in price
now we'll ask to enter the discount
so we'll write
discount of the
discount on the product
all right so
here we are asking the user to enter the
product code of the product and the user
will enter the product code then the
name of the product then he will enter
the name then the price and then the
discount
so after that
now we will have to open a file
because as this add option is being used
by the administrator so we have to store
these product details inside a
particular file so that we can display
to the user that we have these products
in our supermarket
all right so
for that
we'll have to use the file handling
operations
data is the name of the object as you
can see
and with the help of data.open
we can open the file
and
the name of the file we can write here
database
dot txt
all right
after that
we want
to open this file in reading mode
ios in will open the file in reading
mode and ios out will open the file in
writing mode
so now
we will use if statement and will write
if not data that is if this file
doesn't exist
then
inside this function will write
data dot open
database dot txt
we will open this basically we will open
this file in writing mode if this file
doesn't exist
and if this file exists then in else
block will do that
ios out
ios app stands for append mode and io
sound out stands for write mode
now
in order to write inside the file
we'll give some space and
now we'll write
p code
this is how we can write inside a file
after that p name
then again some space
after that there is price
then again some space
after that
this for discount
then we'll
use slash n
all right so after that we have to close
the file as well
write data.close
data.close after that
in else block
that is if the file exists
then
we will read from the file so this is
how we can read from file
and
p
d these are the variables here we are
initializing the file because after that
we have to use the while loop to iterate
through the file
so let's do that
first of all i'll write this part and
then i'll explain
inside this we'll use if statement
and
if c equals to p code
then
token will be incremented
and
for
initialization
or for iteration
we'll again do that
so here what we are doing is first of
all we are initializing the index of
file here we are initializing the index
because after that we will use the while
loop inside this while loop
we have written
not data dot eof this eof is the end of
file function
this while loop will make sure to check
every content of the file
by iterating it so one by one each
content of the file is checked if the
code matches with the p code that is if
there is a duplicacy then
the token variable which we have
we can see initialize with 0 will be
incremented
it will become 1 basically after that
for the iteration purpose we are reading
from the file
and after that now
we will close the file
data dot close
all right
now
we'll use if statement that if token
is one as we know
if token gets incremented that is
if there is a duplicacy
then again
it will go back to the menu
that is if the product code entered
by the administrator already exists then
he have to enter another product code
because if
the administrator enters the duplicate
code then it will again go back to this
menu
so this go to m
we have to label it over here
all right now in the else block
that is
if
the token value is not incremented
that is the product code entered by the
administrator is unique and not
duplicate then we can enter the
the product that is its product code its
product name its price
so for that we can just copy paste this
part
it's the same
and
we can paste it over here
so here we are writing inside the file
so this is how we can write inside the
file and here we are opening the file in
append and writing mode
to write inside the file we have to open
the file in writing mode
so after that
we will display a message saying that
record inserted
there's some bracket error the else
block will close over here
all right
now this add function is done
we have done this part
now we have to create another function
named the edit function
as the add function is used for adding
the products in the market
based on their price
names discounts etc now edit function
will edit the products like if you want
to edit some product like
juice instead of milk or something like
that you can do it with the help of edit
function so we'll do that functionality
in edit function
so let's do that
we'll write void
shopping
edit the name of the function
so inside this function we will create
two
objects
of fstream class
that is data1 and data2
that is data and data1
all right
so these two are the objects of fstream
class
now we will
declare some variables
or string n
all right
now we'll write
a message displaying modify the record
so write slash in
now we will ask
to enter the product code
so we'll write
now we will open the file and check if
that file exists or not
now if
that file doesn't exist
then
we'll simply display a message
saying that file doesn't exist
and in else block
we will open the file
but not the same file the other file
this
file would be database 1 and we will
open this file with the help of this
object that is datavan
so we'll write
data one dot open
the name of the file would be
database
one dot txt
and we will open this file
in append mode
and writing mode
so here what we are doing is we will
save our edited data
in this file and we will rename it to
the original name that is
database.txt
the name of this file is database1.ext
we will save the edited data in this
file and then
we will rename this file as database dot
txt that is the original name of the
file
so now we will write
data
p code
then p name
price
and then
this
so we are initializing this file
basically we want to iterate this file
so
not data dot end of file
it will check each and every content of
the file
all right now
using if statement
we will check if p key equals to p code
p key is the code that is entered by the
administrator
which
he wants to edit
so if that matches
then inside the file
write slash n
slash t slash t
then product
of
new code
product new code
here we are asking the administrator to
enter the new code for the
product
so
[Music]
cnc
he or she will enter the code then we
will ask
to enter the name
so write slash and slashing
name of the
product
p name
n
now the price
so we'll write
now the discount
now all the updated details of the
product will be entered with the help of
data1 object
again some space
then
again some space
and here p
then here
d
all right
now
we'll write
a message saying that record edited
record edited all right
after that we'll increment the token
that is token plus plus
now
this was the if block now in else block
gain data one
that is if
the product key or the product code
entered by the administrator doesn't
matches with
any of the product code within the file
then
the old variables that is
p code
p name
price
and after that discount
that is this
all right after that
yeah
we'll do that selection
now outside this else block we'll write
that
e code p name
just for increment purpose
we want the while loop to iterate so
that is why we will use this one
so that this while loop can iterate
all right after this
we will close both the objects that is
data
dot close we are closing both the files
and data1
dot close
now as i already discussed that we have
to rename that database 1 back to the
original name that is database so we
will use two
functions in c plus plus
that is remove function and rename
function with the help of remove
function we will remove the list that is
the database.txt file we will remove the
database.txt file and then with the help
of rename function we will rename
database 1.ext to database dot txt
so let's do that
remove inside remove we will write the
name of the file
it will basically remove all the list
inside the file
all right now rename function
inside the rename function first of all
we have to write the old name
that is database
one dot txt
then the new name
that is database
dot txt
so now
using this function
this name will be changed to database
dot txt
all right
now
if
token value is not incremented
or we can say is zero
then
it will display a message saying that
record
not
found
sorry
and with that we are done with the
edit function
and now we will create
remove function
so we'll write
void
shopping
rem remove
this remove function will be bit similar
to that of the edit function
so now let's start with that
f stream
will create two objects
data and data one
now
hint p key
and
int token
will initialize it with zero
now
we'll display
slash d
delete
product
now
we'll display
to enter the product code so we'll write
similar to previous function
now data dot open
database
dot txt
we are opening this file
in reading mode
and then we will check
if this file exists or not
so write
so here we will write
if
not
data
then inside will display
file doesn't exist
all right
now in else block
inside the else block we will open the
data1 file
and the file name would be database one
dot txt
and we will open this file
in append and writing mode
all right now after that
the sp code to initialize or iterate
the while loop
we will write this
this is how we read from the file
and here we will use data because we
will
iterate through data.eof
that is data file
now inside the while loop
again we'll do the same as that we have
previously done
data dot eof end of file
now
use if
p code
equals to
p key
then
we'll simply display the message saying
that
product
deleted
successfully
all right and now we will increment the
token
now in the else block we will write
data one
space
then p code
then p name then price then discount
now
rename
then
price
then discount
here the p key entered by the
administrator will check for the first
product code if it matches the if block
executes
in the second iteration it will not
match and else block will execute and
database 1 file will be displayed
in other words in else block all the
products will be displayed except the
one which you want to remove or delete
so we will show this file database 1 and
then rename it with the previous one
that is
database all right so now let's go ahead
we'll do the same in order to white rate
this while loop
now
as we've done previously
dot close as we have to close the files
data one
dot close
and after that again the remove function
to remove the database file
and rename function
firstly we will write the database 1
that is the old name
make sure to put semicolons then
database
then database
dot txt the new name
all right after that if
token is not incremented
that is if token is zero
then it will simply
display a message
saying that record cannot found
or record not found
so as we have created three major
functions
now we will create another function
named list
it will help us in showing the list to
the customer or the buyer all right
shopping
now i will write
list
inside this function
write
the data
the object of the stream class
then data.open
will open the database file
dot txt
in the
reading mode
all right after that
we will format it a bit
so after that again
we have to write the product number name
price etc so we'll write
product number
and then
we can use slash d
again name
then
price
and then we'll use slashing
please put them inside the double quotes
and now again we'll copy this part
you can design it in your own way
and
now we can do
the reading part
data
p code
then rename
as we have done previously
price
this
while loop inside the while loop again
we'll use
not data
dot eof
now inside this file
we'll write the product code
product name and the price we'll start
with product code
then
product name
that is p name
after that
price
for the iteration purpose we'll write
again p code
p name
discount
all right now after that we will close
the file by writing data dot close
all right so we are done with this
function as well after this now we will
create the receipt function in which all
the customer operations will take place
so now let's create this recept function
so we'll write void shopping
r e c i p t recept
and now inside this function first of
all we'll create
the object of fstream class
then we'll declare some arrays because
we have to store multiple product keys
and multiple quantities of those
products
so that is why here we have to use
arrays
and then we will declare some variables
so let's start
first of all f stream class the object
of this class is
data
now after this we'll create
array
array c means array of codes
so i'll declare it in that way
now after that
now we'll declare another array
array of q that is quantity
now
choice variable
then there would be
a counter variable let's say
then discount variable
we'll initialize it with zero
and we'll initialize amount with zero as
well
all right now
total variable
now we will display a message
saying that recept
so that the user will know that this is
the recept
now after that we will open a file
that is data dot open will open the
database.txt file and then we'll check
if that file or database exist or not
so
we have done this previously
data.open
database
dot txt
will open this file in
reading mode
now we'll use
if block and inside this if block will
write not data we are checking that if
this file or database exists or not
all right
if it doesn't exist if not data that is
if this file doesn't exist or this
database doesn't exist then we will
print the message saying that
empty database
empty with a p
now as this
now in else block we'll write if that
file exists
then first of all we'll close the file
that we already opened
now in else block we will call this
list function that we have created
because if the file is created then we
have to call the list function and will
show the user or the customer that these
are the products available in the
supermarket
and for that we are calling this list
function
now we will
design the structure and ask the user to
place the order
so let's do that
please place the order
now again we'll copy this part
all right so now
we'll use
do while loop
the purpose of using this do-while group
is that we have to run a specific part
of the code
every time and
the other part of the code we have to
run based on the choice
so now let's start with that
inside the do
block
first of all we will
ask the user
to enter the product code and enter the
product quantity
so first of all
we'll write
product code
enter product code
we'll take the input in the array
now we'll ask the user
to enter
the quantity
all right now
we'll take the product quantity let us
see in
a r r
q
see
now
we will check that
if the product code entered by the user
matches with the product code
that is being already entered
then we will display a message saying
that duplicate product code please try
again
so for that we have to use the for loop
first of all and inside the for loop
will initialize i with 0
i less than
c we have already initialized c with
zero
now
i plus plus
so inside this
for loop use if condition and check if
the
product key or product code entered by
the user matches with
the product code that already exist in
the file then we will display a message
saying that duplicate product code so
we'll write
if
rac of
c that is entered by the user
equals array of c
i
so i will keep on iterating as we have
used for loop
so inside this if we will display a
message saying that
duplicate product code
please
please try again
all right
now
we'll write go to m
again jump statement as we have already
discussed
now after this
we will increment c plus plus
that is
if the product
key is not duplicate then c will
increment that is the counter will
increment
all right now
we will display a message saying that do
you want to buy another product or not
all right
all right so as we have displayed this
now we will take the input of the user
see in choice that whether he wants to
buy the product or not
so this is our do loop now we'll have to
use after this do block we'll have to
use while loop as we're using the do
while loop now here is the condition
that if the user will press yes that is
y
then
this loop will execute
all right
now
we'll make a design structure so we'll
write c out
and
slash n
slash and slash t slash t slash t
and now we'll write receipt
all right now after that
now we'll write product number
sorry by mistake we write
capital n now we'll write product number
then now we'll write
product quantity
product name sorry
now
product quantity
then the price
now we'll use the for loop to iterate
through the file
so we'll write
4 and i equals 0 i less than c i plus
so now inside this for loop first of all
because we have to do the iteration
we'll open the file data.open
database
double quotes database dot txt
and we'll open this file in reading mode
so ios
in
all right so after that
we will kind of initialize this file
we'll write p code
p name
then
price
after that there was discount
all right
now as we have done previously while not
data
dot eof that is end of file
and inside this while loop we will check
we are actually matching if the code
entered by the user that is ar r c i is
equal to the code present in the file
and if so
then we will do the calculations and add
those file in the customer basket
so let's do that p code equals
array of c of i
here we are checking
if so
then
we'll do the amount amount equals to
price of the product into the quantity
of the product
all right after that we'll have to do
the discount part
so in this part we know that
the discount is calculated by
multiplying amount with discount divided
by 100
and then we have to subtract it from the
amount
so let's do that amount minus
amount
into
discount
divided by 100
all right
now after that as we are done now we'll
have to add discount to the total
variable
because
in this part
the total amount
after getting discount is stored in this
disk variable now we will add this
variable to the total variable
all right so as this is done now we will
print this part
so in this part we are just printing so
we'll
do the slash n and now
then p code
then p name
then
array of qo5
array of q
i
all right now after that price
then amount
and amount after discount or will write
discount only
because we have to write the variable
all right now we'll have to add the
slashed is in between them
so let's do that part
all right so we have added the slash d's
in between them for the formatting
purpose
now to iterate the file for the
iterating purpose we'll do the same
that p code
rename
price
discount
all right now
after this while loop
now we will have to close the data file
so write
data dot close
so after this data don't close we have
to print the total amount so let's do
that first of all we'll do some
designing part like let's say selection
slash in
now
just for design purpose
i will simply print the total variable
we'll write first of all total amount
now the variable
total
all right so everything is done except
the main function now in the main
function
we'll write
so int main
now inside this main function as we know
we have created the class shopping class
so we will create the object of that
shopping class and we will call
the menu function with the help of that
object as we know that is the first
function that must be called so we'll
write shopping
and let's say the object of this is
s
and s dot
menu function
so as we know the menu function is the
topmost function
so this
menu will display when we run the file
so now everything is done
and now let's run this file
let's press compile and run
i hope it works
[Music]
there are some errors
all right so 335 okay
so this is the error and now
57 line
line number 57
yeah we have to use double equal to
and
one more error is there i think
now let's try to run this
there might be some more errors
as you can see
all right after this 386
okay so we haven't labeled this one
we have to label m
now let's try to run this
so here we can see supermarket main menu
first is administrator
then second if you are a buyer three to
exit so first we'll login as an
administrator
so as you can see please login
so now we'll enter the admins
email
so we'll write
robbie
at the rate
email
dot com
now the password
robbie addret123
now this is the administrator menu as
you can see first is the add product if
you want to add the product second to
modify the product three to delete the
product and flow to back to main menu
so now i'll click on
like i want to add the product so i'll
write
one i'll press one and enter add new
product so now i have to add product
code of the product
like let's say the product of code of
product is one
name of group product let's say juice
and price is
70
and discount on product is
2
record inserted
now again
i want to add
so i'll click on one
product code of product would be two
now name of product would be let's say
bread
price
30
discount again to
record inserted now again
product now would be
let's say butter
three
butter
price of product would be 60
discount would be four
now fourth product
sorry add product no product could be
fourth
and this would be
let's say x
price would be 170
discount
three percent
record inserted so now we will check
that these records are inserted or not
so we can cross check it by
going here and open this database file
so as we can see one
juice product code one is juice
price is 70 2 is the discount
then second is bread third is butter
four is egg so first this is the product
code this is the price and this is the
discount on that product
now let's come back and modify the
product
let's say first product was juice
and we want to modify that product
so what we'll do is we'll add the
product code one
and the new product code would be
one only let's say we don't want to
change that
and name of the product would be
chips
we'll replace it with chips
price would be
20
and discount would be two percent
so record edited as we can see
here record edited
and now we can check
so now we'll open this database file
so as you can see
as you can see one chips
two bread three butter four eggs so the
first product that was juice is replaced
by chips
so this function is done now let's try
the delete function
we'll click on 3 for delete
and now we have to enter the product
code of the product which we want to
delete
so let's say we want to read the fourth
product
and we can see product deleted
successfully we can check that
as you can see there are three products
left the fourth one got deleted
so now let's go back and let's check if
the customer wants to buy the product
how can he or she buy so let's first of
all click on phone to go back to them so
now let's click on two as a buyer to buy
some products
now we'll click on one to buy the
product
so as you can see our products are chips
bread and butter
so product numbers are 1 2 3 and their
price are 20 30 60 respectively
and now we will enter the product code
of the product which we want to buy so
i'll click on one
and the quantity i say
2
want to buy another product or not
they're asking if you want to buy
another product if yes then press y and
if no then press n
so we'll click on why because we want to
buy another product
so now i'll click on two that is bread
product quantity i'll add product
quantity as four breads
and now butter so for that first of all
why
for butter i will click on three
product code of butter is three now
quantity would be two
now
i don't want to buy any other product so
i'll click on n
so as you can see
product numbers product name their
quantity price amount and amount with
discount
and the total is there that is 272
and if we wish to buy another product so
we can click on one else we can click on
two to go back
so this is our recept our total amount
is there
so this is our complete project on
supermarket billing in c plus you can
try it although the code is bit long
approx 400 to 450 lines of code
but it is worth trying
all right guys with that we have come to
the end of this session
