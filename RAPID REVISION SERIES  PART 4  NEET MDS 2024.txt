okay right so according to schillberg
there are five that is Preservation of
tooth structure retention resistance
form structural durability marginal
integrity and preservation of the
parodontium and according to Rin still
there are basically three types uh one
is biological Concepts mechanical
Concepts and aesthetic
Concepts
okay so the next one is uh coming to the
tapers okay so normal range if they're
asking so normal range if they're asking
your answer should be 2 to
5° clinical range clinical range is 10
to
16° clinical range is 10 to
16° and uh
coming to Optimum degree of
tapers for an anterior teeth it will be
10° Let It Be maxillary or mandible for
a posteriority that ranges from 12 to
22° 12° are regularly used in the
premolars 12 degrees are regularly used
in the
prolar so can I tell me what is the
concept of taper related to
retention how the tapers are going to
relate to
retention so the curve of
uh taper and retention okay so will be
like this okay so it will be like this
means as
okay so uh yes regularly a 0 degrees
taper is going to have the more
retention okay so when the taper is
zero which is clinically not possible so
this is going to have
perfect
retention as the taper value increases
retention is going to decrease and at a
particular level it is going to become
constant
okay uh so can I tell me uh the
decreasing order of value that is from
lightest to darkest very frequently
repeated in
question yes it starts with starts with
B1 B1
A1
so B1 followed by A1 followed by
B2 followed by D2 followed by A2
followed by
C1
C2
D4
A3
D3
B3
a3.5
B4
C3 A4 and what is the last one
C last one is
C4 the sequence is very
important so this is from lightest to
darkest
value
okay and the next one is yes uh coming
to rule of three uh which is basically
used in or your Oro okay so can you tell
me the landmarks the hairline Landmark
is the hairline Landmark
is
it is
Trion so the landmarks will be Trion the
second one is
gabilla and the nasal
is
subnasal and the lower one
is Menton okay right so these are the
landmarks which are important so it is
first one is from this to this second
one is GL to NAS third one is Nas to
Mento
okay the next one is one more case-based
question by seeing this
cols can you identify the
case you can see multiple uh yes of
course the answer
is actino micosis very good so so the
most common area can you tell me the
most common area of occurrence of uh
Acom
micosis facial
cervical that is angle of mandible you
can see here in this diagram you can see
angle of
mandible where you can see multiple
multiple sinus
openings you can see multiple sinus
openings and if you check out the sinus
opening the sinus opening is having some
yellow granules what are these yellow
granules granules
so these Al granules are sulfur
granules and what is this histological
feature you can see
here you can see
Sunray Sunray
appearance and how will be the colonies
in uh Acom micosis
yes one type of colonies in Acom micosis
yes perfectly right they are molar like
colonies can you tell me what are the
other types of
colonies yes very good one is molar like
colonies you can
see second one is spider like
colonies
can you tell me what is the drug of
choice drug of
choice yes drug of choice
is
pencillin can you tell me what is drug
of choice for
anug anug drug of
choice yes anak drug of choice is again
pencillin okay okay pencillin is the
better
drug followed by
Metro followed by Metron penin followed
by
Metron syphilis what is a drug of
choice yes syphilis again the answer is
pencillin so drug of choice based
questions are very very important okay
so syphilis is penin drug of choice
based questions are very very important
make sure you try to be clear with the
drug of choice of course Raa you're
right it is 2.4 million units regularly
we give uh the pencillin for treatment
of syphilis okay now can you tell me
what is the diagnosis of this intraoral
ulcer so what is this alcer what is the
diagnosis which
stay which stage it comes
under
yes here uh the diagnosis
is
snail
tract ulcer okay yes the diagnosis is
syphilis and which which stage of
syphilis you see this yes you see in
secondary
syphilis can you tell me which stage of
Syphilis is more
infectuous infections will be
the chances of infections will be yes
yes which stays is more infectuous is
you can see more load of syphilis
causing organisms in secondary syphilis
the same
okay very good can you identify me what
are these
instruments five in
number so what are these
instruments no you see the tips here
you're not able to see on my
screen the curates will be like
this yes these are
pkes yes PK will have two Carvers also
yes uh these are
PS so what is the full form of P
K what is the full form of pkt is it is
Peter K Thomas it is Peter K Thomas so
pkt are instruments are basically five
so the one and two instruments are
basically useful for adding of wax so
one is useful for larger increments of
adding two is useful for smaller
increments of adding adding and three
number is useful for burnishing and four
five are basically useful for carbet
okay so these are PK instruments Peter K
Thomas you have five instruments one and
two are useful for wax Edition out of
which one is larger increment two is
smaller increment three is useful for
varnishing and four and five are useful
for
carving so specifically if they're
asking which instruments are basically
used for addition of wax your answer
should be
127
one two we have already discussed one
two are pkts pkt1 pkt2 are VX the
seventh one seven number seven is a
spatula so number seven spatula one for
larger increments and two for smaller
increments so these are
basically uh instruments which are
useful for addition of
wax clear
done so I'm going to the next part so
next part is the concept of biological
width so biological width uh is a sum of
junctional
epithelium the sum of junctional
epithelium plus connective tissue
attachments that is 0.97 + 1.07 together
biological withd around a natural teeth
biological width around a natural teeth
is going to
be the natural is going to be
2.04 mm okay anyway so we got the
concept of biological width okay
similarly I want to ask you a few
questions can you tell me what is a
biological width or normal range of
probing depth around the
implant teeth is 2.40 so I'm asking
implant biological
width yes implant biological width the
answer is 4 to 4.5
mm same question was given in need 2023
also so biological width around the impl
is 4 to 4.5 mm whereas biological with
around the natural dation is 2.04 mm can
you tell me what is the critical probing
depth
value
critical probing
depth yes critical probing depth is
5.4 mm similarly can you tell me what is
the critical pH of
anamel below which demetalization takes
place above which rization takes place
5.2 to
5.5 can you tell me what is
histological histological probing
depth histological probing depth value
yes histological probing depth value is
1.8
mm can you tell me normal probing depth
value normal probing value normal
probing value is 2 to 3 mm okay so
normal probing value is 2 3 mm
histological probing value is 1.8 mm
biological with around the natural
dentation is 2.04 MM and biological
width around the implant or probing
depth around the implant is 4 to 4.5 mm
critical probing depth value is 5.4 mm
and critical pH is going to be 5.2 to
5.5 mm clear
done I'm moving to the next
aspect okay so DM related stuff I hope
like you're familiar they can ask you a
sequence based question a very important
uh sequence of reactions that takes
place uh in the calcination process of
your gypsum okay so gypsum is
basically you can see your gypsum is
available this is calcium sulfate
hemihydrate okay so it is hemihydrate so
whenever you heat this calcium sulfate
hemihydrate at a temperature this
temperature value is very very important
that is 110 to 130° Centigrade so this
is going to
yes the dihydrate it is going to convert
into hemihydrate okay so the water will
be lost few molecules of water will be
lost here you're going to have two H2O
now it's going to be half H2O so a
dihydrate is going to convert into
hemihydrate whenever you heat to a pH
heat to a temperature of 110° to
130° followed by when you're overheating
it increasing the temperature from 13
130 to 200° centigrade okay now Complete
Water will be lost and that leads to
formation of hexagonal
anhydrate and whenever you increase the
temperature from 200° centigrade to
1000° Centigrade you change in the
crystalline form that is that is your
oromic anhydrate will be formed the
sequence of events are important and the
sequence of temperature changes are
important what are the sequence of
events first dihydrate is there
converted into hemihydrate converted
into hexagonal converted into orthic
anhydrate if you're talking about the
temperatures first it starts with 110 to
130° Cen next one 130 to 200° Centigrade
the next one 200° centigrade to 1,000°
cenra clear done okay very important
must must
do the next one I'll be going with the
concepts of C Vector little bit of
controversy there I I'll be discussing
about the controversy also first and
foremost thing about the C Factor I want
you guys to tell me the formula of C
factor C Factor so what is the formula
of C
Factor it is number
of bonded surfaces by number
of unbonded
surfaces now what is the use of C Factor
now everyone knows the formula so tell
me what is the use of C
Factor yes C factor is going to talk
about polymerization shrinkage C factor
is directly proportional to
polymerization shrinkers okay because uh
one of the most important disadvantage
of your Composites is the characteristic
feature of polymerization shink Cas
which lead to a clinical symptom in the
patient leading to sensitivity or
something okay so as C Factor increases
the polymer shrinkage is going to
increase so it is basically because C
factor is directly proportional to
Bonded surfaces so as bonded surfaces
increases as bonded surfaces increases
bonded surface increases the C Factor
increase which indirectly increases the
polymerization shrink is so C factor is
directly proportional to polymerization
shrink is so we need to try to decrease
our C Factor so the polymerization
shrinkage is going to decrease okay
there are different methods okay
incremental method different different
methods are there decrease this
polymerization strink Cas by decreasing
the C Factor so now my main concern is
about the exam okay so whenever they're
asking C factors of a particular teeth
or something okay so simply Okay C
factor
is bonded by
unbonded as you know how the uh cavity
preparations will be so you know what is
what are the number of bonded areas what
are the number of unbonded areas and you
can come out with the exact value of C
Factor okay no need to worry or else
simple ways class one class 2 class 3
class 4 class
5 okay simple five 4 3 2
1 coming back 5 4 3 2 1 okay out of
which
this is wrong so these are the C factors
that you have to make sometimes basing
upon the bonding concept and basing upon
the cavity configuration C factors will
be slightly different for class 4 but
rest all C factors will be same for
example what is a c factor for class
one so C factor for class one and class
five will be same okay that is 5 by 1 C
factor for class
two c factor for for Class 2 4 by two
the answer is two c factor for class
3 3x3 1 C factor for class 4 vary basing
upon the bonding configuration or
bonding concept or basing upon the
cavity preparation but it ranges from
0.5 to
.25 around this value okay clear clear
clear done
now I just want to ask one more
important question for you okay so right
so this is one more table from a
standard reference they can ask you C
factor for
MV so MV is is something like a cavity
like this right m is something like a
cavity like this so how M they're going
to take is so buckle side they're going
to take it as one okay lingual side
they're going to take it as
two okay and clusion side okay so buckle
lingual and pulpal side so the bonded
number of bonded Jones are Buckle plus
lingual plus pulpal whereas number of
unbonded are occlusal misal and disturb
so it is 3x3 the answer is one
clear and I want to add one more
important point about C factor C factor
is going to be highest
for so in classes it will be highest for
class one or class 5 but normally
this is going to be highest
for root canal
filling because root canal filling is
going to have only bonded surface not
bonded not unbonded surface so few
textbooks are clearly mentioning that
the caor is going to highest for the
root canal filling material okay because
uh the bonding Concepts also came into
root canal system okay so C factor is
going to be highest for root canal
filling material and it is around like
thousand clear clear so Point number one
C factor is equal to number of bonded
surfaces by number of unbonded surfaces
C factor is directly proportional to
polymerization shink Cas okay so the
number of bonded surfac increases C
Factor increases by which the polymer
shink case increases so our goal is to
decrease the C Factor coming to values
of c Factor this is how you need to
calculate the most important thing is C
Factor value is highest for class one
and class five if not it is highest for
root canal system that is about th000 C
factor for m is going to be 3x3 the
answer is 1
done I'm moving to the next one okay
most of you are familiar with this the
first year stuff okay
so uh this is about the impression uh
objectives of impression so what is the
uh abbreviation that we have learned
about the objectives of impression
making yes it is p r e
SS P for
preservation r R for retention e for
Aesthetics s for stability and S for
support
press okay the next one like most of us
are familiar about this so because we
are going to use heat cure uh in the in
the prosto department as well as you are
going to use cold cure so which is more
advantage and which is more comfortable
right regularly we always prefer self
cure that is more comfortable right but
why you have to go for heat cure is so
when you're talking about the residual
monomer residual monomer concentration
which is going to cause shrinkage in the
future okay so the residual monomer is
going to be less in the heat cure so by
which the shrinkage will be decreased
whereas the residual morom or percentage
will be more in the self cure where the
shrinkage will be more so they can ask
you how much residual monomer will be
there in the heat cure and self cure so
the residual monomer values in the heat
cure will be 0.2 to 0.5 percentage
whereas in the self cure it will be 3 to
5
percentage okay next one definition of
flux so most of us are familiar so flux
is a Latin word uh it is
basically to flow to improve the flow
okay so normally whenever you take this
uh metals all these areas so metals are
going to react
with oxygen in the atmosphere and they
form oxide
layer okay basically these oxide layers
are very passive they don't react they
don't allow it to react okay so whenever
you want to react it okay so you have to
remove this oxid layers to improve the
flow what you have to do you have to
remove this oxide coating that is
present on the metal surface okay the
process by which you remove this is
called as applying a flux to improve the
flow see here I want you to make a note
so the byproduct which is going to form
after applying flux that is resultant
you have a solution of oxide layer okay
that is called as slag they can ask you
what is slag slag is the
byproduct which is basically the
solution
of oxides that are formed this is
SL clear now I'll be talking about the
types of fluxes so fluxes are basically
divided into one protector flux second
one is reducer flux third one is solvent
flux what is protector protector is
basically protector you can easily
remember
protector with a word
p protect prevents p p and p okay so it
covers the metal surface and prevents
the oxide layer formation P for P that
is prevention next one reducer r r so
reducer is reducing the oxide layer
formation
S S for S okay solvent solvent flux is
dissolving the oxide layer that is being
formed okay right so there are three
types protector is preventing the oxide
layer formation reducer is reducing the
oxid layer formation solvent is
dissolving the oxid layer formation
next one if you jump into different
types of fluxes basing upon their
composition fluxes are basically divided
into borax fluxes and fluoride
fluxes in which the borax is going to
have boric
acid
silica and borax glass whereas fluxes
are again divided basing upon the pH of
the flux that is being used you know
that the pH is basically Let It Be
acidic pH or let it be basic pH let it
be neutral pH so acidic fluxes are sao2
basic fluxes are either lime or
Limestone that is CAO or ca3 whereas
neutral fluxes are basically either you
can use FL Flor floros Spar that is caf2
or Borax fluxes that is na2
b42 okay so they can ask you what is
acidic flux what is basic flux what is
neutral
flux so the next one uh when we talking
about uh according to the source basing
upon the source your fluxes are being
divided into organic fluxes or inorganic
fluxes so organic fluxes are basically
used in soft soldering procedures which
requires low temperatures so these are
soft
organic soft and low temperature
the next one is inorganic fluxes okay so
these are basically acid base fluxes
they are used in brazing okay which
requires higher temperature okay so
brazing which requires high so in
organic requires higher temperature can
you tell me what is the difference
between soering and
brazing soldering
and brazing
can you tell me what is the difference
between these two
terms yeah how I simply remember is
b b for
Big B for Big B for big So Sol ring is
basically less
than
450° Centigrade whereas brazing will be
more than
450° Centigrade okay so basically in
soering you are going to use organic
fluxes whereas in the case of brazing
you are going to use inorganic
fluxes okay done next one basing upon
their composition here it is very
important you have borax fluxes and you
have fluoride fluxes okay the most
important thing is what is the type of
flux that is used whenever you're going
for Noble Metals so Noble Metals what is
the type of flux so Noble
Metals you're going to use borax fluxes
whereas base Metals you're going to use
fluoride fluxes very very important FB
you can remember it as
FB F and b f for fluoride
fluxes B
for base metal
alloys
FP clear done can I move to the next
part okay so the next one is anti
fluxes so anti fluxes flux is going to
allow the flow so now anti flux is going
to restrict the
flow anti flux is going to restrict the
flow okay so the two important anti
fluxes we have is one is graphite so
graphite is basically lead pencil okay
that is going to contain carbon the
disadvantage is whenever you prolong
prolly Heat at a higher temperature this
will burn off and give discoloration so
there is something one more flux anti
flux that is called as whitening agent
which is ca3 and
alcohol and water
suspension so you have two one
is graphite and second one is cac3 in
alcohol
okay clear I'm going to one more
important concept where the questions
are very frequently repeated so I'll be
talking about electroplating
now okay so before jumping into
electroplating uh can you tell me what
are the impression what are the
elastomeric Impressions which can be
electroplate which of the elic
impression can be
electroplated
yes perfectly right the answer is poly
sulfate so poly sufate impression
material can be electroplated one okay
so electroplating electroplating is
going to have one important aspect is
it's going to have a
solution it's going to have an anode
it's going to have a cathode okay can
you tell me what is the solution name of
the
solution name of the solution
electroplate what is the name name of
the solution yes the name of the
solution is silver sined very good the
name of the solution is silver sined can
you tell me what is
anode what is
anode because this question was repeated
twice in the last five
years yes anod is silver can you tell me
what is cathod I I told you easy to
remember how your impression tray will
be this is your impression tray
impression tray will be
c-shaped so impression tray will be your
impression will be cathode your anode is
silver and the solution is silver
cite right clear right all the Four
Points which elastomeric impression can
be electroplated the answer is poly
sulfide what is the solution that is
used silver cite what is anode silver
what is cathode impression
material okay now few terms I want to
add one is death chamber gas okay
sometimes what what can happen is
because the silver sined is present
sometimes there may be release of cide
vapers because of the release of cide
vapers this area or this chamber is
called as death
chamber okay and as you know uh where
the deposition should
occur where the deposition should occur
cathode or anode
yes you can see because cathode is an
impression material something should
come and fall under cathode then only
electroplating will occur so cathode
deposition should occur and the
deposition will start from anode okay it
starts from anode okay that is silver
and the deposition will occur on cathode
okay so this process this process is
called as throwing
powder this process is called as
throwing powder they can ask you where
the deposition will occur the deposition
is going to occur on the cathode that is
impression now the other important point
that I want to highlight here is the
last lines okay so how much time it has
to be carried out electr plating is
carried
out for approximately 10
hours electroplating will be carried out
for 10 hours and the current that is
used is 5 to 10 milliamp per cm square
of cathode
surface and one more important point I
want you to make a notice an anode of
pure silver pure silver is anode right
at least twice the size of the area to
be electroplated so how much amount of
silver you have to give us it should be
twice the area that you are planning to
electroplate on the impression material
such amount of silver has to be provided
at anodes so that it will be deposited
upon the cathode how much time 10 hours
how much current 5 to 10 milliamp per cm
square of cathode
surface okay right clear here concept
where where what is anode what is
cathode which materials are basically
used that is your poly sulfate and where
the deposition will occur were the
questions which are given in the last
few years okay the answer is cathode
where the deposition is going to occur
okay next one uh a few uh one or two
important lines about your
Dy
material
okay can you make D with amalgam yes or
no not
now I mean like not not used nowadays
but I'm asking uh yes amalgam can also
be used as a Dy material okay so the
most stable D material are most accurate
and stable die materials sir most
accurate and stable die materials sir
what are most accurate and stable D
materials what are most accurate and
stable die
materials yes yes yes and four and five
types of your fourth fourth and fifth
type of your gypsum material four and
five types of type of your gypsum
material or your D stone is going to be
the most accurate and the most stable
okay so now I just want to add one
important Point related to epoxy resins
okay epoxy resins but the main
disadvantage of this four and five
gypsum materials is their abrasive
resistance is very very poor okay so
when I'm talking about epoxy
resins so when I'm talking about epoxy
epoxy resins epoxy resins has more aasu
resistance okay but the main problem is
they are less accurate and less stable
okay I want you to make a note so they
can be used safely uh with elastomeric
impression materials like poly sufate by
using a separating media and addition
silicon and polyether so epoxy resins
can be used with poly sulfide Edition
silicon and
polyether okay so these are more they
have more abrasive
resistance but more accurate are your
type four and type five gypsum
products okay so jumping into uh uh the
centering temperature classification two
times repeated in the last five years of
your neat examinations of course it's
repeated so many times in in also so it
is a mandatory that you have to make a
note and you have to keep them in the
checklist and revise them again and
again okay the first and four most
important thing is temperatures okay so
temperatures they can ask in Centigrade
or temperatures they can ask in foreign
here okay right so High
fusion is more than 1300° Centigrade or
more than
2,372 Dees
forit and ultra low Fusion will be less
than 850 or less than 1562 Dees forign
okay so similarly they can ask you
medium Fusion they can ask you low
Fusion also so sometimes they can ask
you at what temperature at what cing
temperature regularly we use gonium core
Ceramics okay the answer is High fusion
okay so they can ask you the application
part also okay normally crown and Bridge
Ceramics will be done at either low
Fusion or ultra low Fusion temperatures
okay so very very important so please do
make a note and add this to your
checklist uh during your last round of
revision next definition of laminates
laminate verar definition so a
conservative aesthetic restoration of
anterior teeth that is basically used to
mask the
discoloration restore the Mal align
teeth close the midline diastema and
correct the minor tooth Mal element okay
so this is from Moss Bas uh dictionary
okay so very very important so nowadays
they're asking these such a questions in
the examination so laminate verer what
is the definition a conservative
aesthetic preparation which is masking
the discoloration restoring the malan
teeth minor tooth Corrections can be
done and closing the midline
dma okay now tell me what are the
restorative materials which combination
of restorative materials are used in
Sandwich
technique which restr materials are
basically used in Sandwich techniques so
in Sandwich technique basically we are
using yes you you guys are right we are
using G in combination with
composite so sandwich technique is
basically of two types one is open
sandwich and second one is closed
sandwich open sandwich where the GC is
exposed outside you can see this orange
color is outside it is exposed to the
oral
cavity so open is open to the oral
cavity G is open to the oral cavity
closed is GC is not open to the oral
cavity you can see here the GC is being
covered from all the directions by the
composite okay so that is the difference
between open sandwich and closed
sandwich
