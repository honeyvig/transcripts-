yeah hi everyone now I will be
discussing about murmurs which are
important for examination point of view
for the dental students so before going
into that individual things okay we have
something called as grading related to
this okay so it starts from grade one -
it starts ends at grade six so grade one
is it is audible under normal conditions
but as grade 2 is okay it is soft coming
to the grade three the grade three is
having you will have a moderate
intensity and the grade four is it is
loud with with a thrill okay so next one
is grade five it is very loud okay and
the last one is grade 6
it is heard with service cope and
without touching the heart okay so it is
heard with telescope but without
touching the chest okay so these are the
about the grades and grade four is once
tasked in the examination okay and grade
one is asked in the examination - okay
so please do make a note about these two
things which are very very important as
a repeats so next goes with the
different types of murmurs so first
we'll deal with the systolic murmurs
okay so it is heard between first and
second heart sounds and it is regularly
soft you will have three types in this
one is mid-systolic second one is
pansystolic third one is late systolic
and of course the important area where
you need to focus here is about the
questions that are asked okay
so the examples for the mid-systolic is
a s PS T Y of ASD and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy
yeah the second one is pansystolic the
examples are mr t r vs t and of course
the late systolic dance it's a mitral
valve prolapse okay again you can see
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy okay so this
is about the systolic murmurs the next
comes is about that diastolic mud mats
so diastolic murmurs are heard between
first and second heart sounds there are
non radiating murmurs they are rough
okay and you will have two types in this
that is early diastolic and the medina
story and coming to the examples you
will have AR and you how PR that is
pulmonary regurgitation okay we're in
this condition you can see other murmur
called as gram Stillman Valley and in
the mid diastolic you can see ms and you
can see the same AR so they can ask you
questions like AR is seen an air both
early as well as mid diastolic murmurs
have seen in the case of air but if both
options are there it is better to go for
mid as a best option okay and the next
one is you will have something called as
continuous murmurs so they're nothing
but a combination of both diastolic and
systolic and you can see them in PDA and
few other common terms are common names
that are asked in the examination one is
C Kerry Kerry combs Mar which is a mid
diastolic murmur and which is seen in
the case of acute rheumatic fever next
one is Gibson's
magma which is also called as training
tunnel okay what you seen in the case of
PDA another one is called as tilts or
still murmur there is something called
as stills disease okay that is different
it's a question in your oral medicine
that is it is a rheumatic fever in the
case of children that is called as still
stasis now it is stills murmur it's
nothing but it is a vibratory systolic
murmur which is seen in the case of
tomorrow the next one is something
called as musical map but these are
rarely asked questions now which are
discussing from now musical murmur which
is or sometimes called a single murmur
which is C min they are the next one is
means murmur okay what is seen as pan
systolic murmur in thyrotoxicosis okay
okay hope you're clear so I just want a
few important normal repeats or MCQs I
hope you know there is something called
as Wharton's duct that is related to
your salivary glands there's something
called as Wharton's jelly
this waters any structure is present in
the case of umbilical cords okay and
this is a repeat of your need that is
handing downs is take yourself a leak
