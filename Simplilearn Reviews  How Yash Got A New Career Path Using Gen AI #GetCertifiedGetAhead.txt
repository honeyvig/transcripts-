from flunking in class 12th to acing my
MBA examinations with flying color I
turned my challenges into opportunities
initially in my sales role I struggled
to generate lead until unless I
discovered the power of AI that could be
a GameChanger in my career and that's
when I realized the true potential of AI
and I wanted to Deep dive into the AI
world and blend those skills to make my
career then I enrolled in simply learns
generate a AI for business
transformation which not only cuts down
my time but boosted my productivity
today as a digital marketing freelancer
I put those skills of AI to thrive in my
projects and in my
career hi my name is Yash ATI I'm a
digital marketing freelancer and this is
my journey I live in Hyderabad I have
pursued my MBA from Alliance School of
Business Alliance University in
bangaluru I'm also a singer and a
professional badminton shutler I started
my professional career from LOA groups
where I was an intern in sales and
research Division and marketing and at
that time I learned about Ai and AI
features currently I am a freelancer in
digital marketing and I do projects on
WordPress and SEO in digital
marketing I wasn't really great in
studies I plunged in 12th and posed that
I received a lot of criticism from my
relatives to my you know friends family
members and and then after that I
somehow I gathered myself and I flew to
bangaluru where I've done my BBA and
after that I've done my MBA from
Alliance University and from there I got
a campus placement in Loa gr and my
motto the real motto of mine is why be
normal when you can be the
best there are so many memories in my
life but one of the best memories is of
my grandfather when he was in his death
bed and I promised him that I will
become the winner and I will break this
middle income barrier and that thing
motivates me like anything to move
forward every day as far as failures
concerned the journey is always filled
with failures and we have to learn from
it like I'll tell you one incident in my
first two months of my job I was not
able to convert leads and somehow I
learned from my seniors and through
internet and then I understood the power
of AI when I get into this and I created
sales funnels which created more lads
than my peers and then I realized I can
do something of my own and blend these
skills for my career and my project in
my cohort if you see people are from 40
years of age and they are still Lear so
it clearly shows that learning has no
age as a barrier and AI is very very new
and possibilities are endless and if I
cannot sail that boat right now it will
create Mups in my future let me be very
clear before taking up this course in my
college I only knew about Chad GPT J and
or maybe uh from some friends I heard
about CLA AI but after completing this
course I'm equipped with so many AI
tools like juliia AI for data
interpretation after that I use co-pilot
for my logo and posters design so it is
a very new field and I'm very very
fascinated about AI in my graduation
days when I started my MBA Journey at
that time I got a project on python so I
don't know anything about python as
everybody is doing YouTube so I posted
How to Learn Python what other the
things and I got to know about simply
learn while scrolling down and there was
a course of about 10 or 7 hours I don't
completely remember and it was very
fulfilling course and I learned a lot
and then I realized and I thought why
not give it a try so then I've started
learning from Simply run and I'm here
right so as I told you I'm an early
adopter that's why I always give it an
try to new things so for me there are
two things which matters the most the
first one is the trainer and the second
one is the flexibility of this course
the trainers of this course is very very
thorough professionals and they are you
know apt in their fields as per the
support system the RMS are very
professional like let me tell you an
incident I was traveling to Hyderabad
from bangaluru 3 weeks back and I missed
my classes in between so I called my RN
and told him that this is the problem I
faced and I'm not able to attend those
classes so how I can unlock my
certificate they said first you finish
off your recording classes and then they
will unlock the certificate and that's
what they did they are always there for
24 into 7 they are the best and you know
the professional RMS you can ever the
only thing I want to tell you right now
just don't wait take up the scores move
forward otherwise you will be replaced
by the person who is using AI right now
and learning AI
