the emba program offers a second chance
to those who regret not acquiring a
full-time mba early in their career and
missing out on all of the fantastic
leadership and management rules
so in this video on what is executive
mba we'll discover what are the benefits
of executive mba what is the difference
between an executive mba and a
traditional full-time mba what is the
eligibility criteria for emba programs
the first topic we have is what is
executive mba program
the standard full-time mba which many
ambitious young professionals choose
tend to focus on essentials of
management
in a conventional mba program
professionals will be educated for a
management professional
and unlike a standard full-time mba or
traditional mba program an emba focuses
on intricacies of the business
it is designed to teach existing leaders
how to become more efficient managers
after completing this course emba grads
can be chosen for roles such as vice
presidents of various departments such
as marketing finance human resources
technology and many more
further if you look at the student
profile for both mba programs you'll
find significant differences
according to the executive mba council
that is embsc the average executive mba
student is 38 years old and has around
14 years of professional experience
including about 7 years of managerial
experience
since this program is designed for those
who are currently working as employees
dmba classes typically takes place on
weekends and weeknights the goal of an
executive mba is to help professionals
advance their business expertise within
the context of their existing
professional path
this program provides professionals with
management business and leadership
training for bigger and better roles in
their current industry
now moving forward let's have a look at
few benefits of an executive mba
career advancement is the first benefit
that we have on our list the opportunity
to set one's career trajectory on fast
forward track is one of the most
significant benefits of enrolling in an
executive mba program
those that enroll in such programs are
already well known inside their
organizations
the typical emb applicant is 35 years
old thus their experience has quite a
substantial edge in determining how they
wish to structure their career growth
this program fills the voids that are
essential to place them in leadership or
senior executive positions
the next benefit of an emba program is
career transformation
dmba program can prepare you for
challenging managerial roles
if you have been a software engineer for
over a decade and now dreaming of
becoming a software project manager in
your firm you can do so through an
executive mba without stopping your
routine of his work
furthermore you can change industries
geography and the nature of work with
the post graduation degree
the third and last one on our list is
opportunity to begin an entrepreneurship
journey
the emba program focuses on taking
business case study challenges on a
regular basis to allow students to
analyze the positives and negatives of
great business models out there
these exercises help professionals find
their entrepreneurial spirit
that is why the students of this course
end up creating startups with
collaborative efforts
moving forward we'll look into a few
differences between the executive mba
program and the regular full-time mba
program
the first parameter which differentiates
emba from full-time mba is the expected
student profile the executive mba is
intended for seasoned individuals with
extensive work experience who want to
advance their careers within the same
field a regular mba on the other hand is
for professionals with only a few years
of experience who want to enter business
management roles or alter their career
paths
the average age of students who apply
for an emba program is 38 years
while the average age for students who
apply for standard full-time mba is 28
years
the next parameter
is nature of course
students in traditional mba program have
to quit their jobs to obtain an mba
degree whereas the emba program allows
students to learn on weekends while
continuing their jobs that is why the
emba program is preferable option for
individuals who do not want to step out
from their c-suite positions
the next topic is admission selectivity
an emba is not as rigorous as full-time
mba the intake capacity is lower for
this course additionally the acceptance
standards are less stringent including
low gmat scores averages being one
example
regular mba programs on the other hand
are incredibly competitive with
acceptance rates of less than 10 percent
you need to have very high gmat score in
order to get selected into this mba
program
the last factor on our list is post mba
aspirations
a full-time mba is more of a career
changer program for young professionals
in contrast the emba program is aimed to
develop leaders or vice presidents of
particular departments
emba graduates are more likely to be
promoted and given more responsibilities
and furthermore they're also paid
considerably more than the regular mba
graduates because of their extensive
past experience
on that note let's discover the
essential prerequisites to be able to
get into this ema program
work experience and success throughout
the years of employment are the
essential criterias for almost all ema
programs
to select a student for an emba program
business schools considers factors such
as learning attitude management
experience leadership potential desire
for the program and career objectives
for emba heart selection factors such as
gmat gre or candidates academic record
are weighed up by b schools but some top
business schools host executive
assessments or mini gmats to measure
candidates preparedness
the documents that are essential for
this selection process includes resume
embassy topical score and recommendation
letter from your employers
following the evaluation of your
application the final interview round is
held to confirm your competency
the whole interview procedure allows the
interview panel to learn about your
goals for this emba program
so before this round you must be clear
with your agenda for getting into emba
program
in addition to that these emba programs
are deemed to be challenging and you
cannot use this program as an excuse to
take a break from your obvious work
penance hard work and compromise must be
your companions along the road at least
until you plunge to the post mba success
one of the main motivations for pursuing
an mba is the drive it gives to a career
with handsome salaries and that's not
surprising because when you are spending
loads of money you would be anxious
about what you are getting in return
besides knowledge
that is why when you are willing to act
for an mba you should ask yourself why
do you want to pursue an mba degree
what are the career prospects after
finishing this degree
in contradiction to the popular belief
that an individual's career trajectory
rises as soon as he has an mba degree
not many candidates end up working in
their dream roles with great
compensation packages
hence each individual must have clear
objectives and future goals only then
they can have a successful career after
mba
