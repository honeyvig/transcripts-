YouTube channel
today's session will be a guide for you
to create your own Twitter board using
python but before we begin if you love
watching Tech videos subscribe to our
Channel like the tutorial and hit the
Bell icon to never miss an update
and before starting
let us have a simple quiz question to
brush upon our knowledge and your
question is who amongst these is one of
the founders of Twitter or the
co-founders of Twitter
any option so
the first option is Jack Dorsey the
second option is
and the third option is Elon Musk and
the fourth option is Ned Segal
and please answer in the comment section
below and we'll update the correct
answer in the pin comment you can pause
the video give it a thought and answer
in the comment section
and I have an insightful for you guys if
you are focused on building strong
foundational skills for career growth in
that case you can check out a free
course to Learn Python Basics with a
completion certification from scale up
by simplylearn you can check the python
Basics free scale of course with the
link in the description box below
now moving to our project
first we will create a folder
and we'll create a folder in this python
projects
and named as Twitter bot
and inside this we will open the command
prompt
by writing the command CMD
and now we'll open our
code editor or ID with the command code
space period this will open our Visual
Studio code you can use any ID that you
have Hands-On I am using visual studio
code
now here we will create a file
and name it as Twitter Dot py
so now what is a Twitter board
so it's a Twitter account managed via
the Twitter API that performs actions in
an automated manner most of what you
regularly do through Twitter's graphical
interface is also available through its
API for instance you could automate
sending Tweets at schedule Arts replying
to tweets with a predefined text or
following or unfollowing other accounts
so this is what a Twitter board can do
now we'll install the module to EP that
is used to make our Twitter board so for
that we will go to our Command Prompt
and write the command
pip install to EP
and I will also show you that
in a browser
so this is the
website for WP that is
docs.tweepy.org you could see the
easiest option to install the latest
version of
2ep that is PIP install to be
so we will write the same command here
in our Command Prompt or you can write
the command in your terminal of your ID
it will act as the same way
so we have written pip install to EP and
we'll press enter
and it shows that that the requirement
is already satisfied as I already
installed this module so it's showing me
requirement is already satisfied so you
can just copy the command from the
website and just paste it here or just
write it down and the module would be
installed for you and if you face any
error or any issues just comment down
below and we'll get back to you
and if we talk about 2 EP so 2p is a
library that mainly accesses HTTP post
and get methods to interact with the
Twitter API in case you are interested
in how it works you can check out the
tweepy library
that is this library and you can see all
the options that is post or get
and if you
install it and if you get any error just
search it on the web or any browser and
you can get the answer in stack Overflow
or any Community or you can just comment
down in the comment section and we'll
get back to you
now
to access these tools and the API
we need to create a developer account
for that
will open a website that is Twitter
developer
so for that you can just search Twitter
developer portal on the web and this is
the website link that is HTTP colon
slash developer.twitter.com portal
dashboard so this is the website we have
to visit to create a
foreign
and now
the first requirement to create a
developer app is that you should have a
verified account with a verified phone
number
now you need to apply for being a
Twitter developer by filling out an
application once your account is
approved you can access the developer
documentation and tools to create a
Twitter board
now to do that first I will show you if
you
don't have your mobile phone
verified you could just visit settings
and support
and then settings and privacy before
that this is the profile I would be
using to create my developer board
Twitter board sorry
and
I should have my mobile number verified
so for that
I would go on settings and privacy
and then the account information
and here it will ask for my password
I will write down my password and
confirm it so you could see I will blur
this so you won't be able to access my
phone number and email ID
and the account creation and the other
details so you could just verify the
phone number here it will ask you for
verification and a code would be sent to
a mobile phone and an email address so
just verify that and after that just
come back to this website that is
developer portal
now we'll start creating a Twitter app
so Twitter doesn't allow developers to
access their API and database using
traditional password or key
authentication for all projects instead
for every used case or project the
developer needs to create a new Twitter
app and every app has its own set of
authentication keys and that's how your
board will get itself authenticated so
that it can communicate with the API and
to create an app we will click on the
developer portal and navigate to
projects and apps
that is projection apps and then we'll
click on the overview and now we will
create a project I have already created
the project so it won't allow me to
create another project
so when you click on the overview you
will see here an option to create a
project so you should click on that and
then it will ask you first it will ask
you the name of the project you would
write the name of the project there and
then click on the next then it will ask
you what will be the use case for
creating your project then you can
choose from the drop down menu that I
will be using it to making a board
and then click on the next then it will
ask you about the project description
then just write about the description
that you want to develop a Twitter board
for educational purpose and then click
next and then it will ask to create an
app that would be
here so we have created the app
previously
that is Twitter underscore board
underscore using dot underscore python
we will be using this only
and I will show you
how to create app so we'll click here
just add app
we'll click here create app and now
he is asking about the app name so we
will give it a name that is Twitter
underscore new underscore bot underscore
with underscore pi
we have given this name if it's Unique
it will tell us
or it will tell yeah it's Unique so it
has shown us the API key API key secret
and the bear token
so these are the keys that you should
copy somewhere
and keep it safe because you would be
using this in your project
and now you have created the app now
Twitter allows you to create a maximum
of 10 Twitter apps which are more than
enough for almost everyone trying to
explore the API once you click the
button it will ask you to name the app
that is we have named it and now you
have some unique strings that is the API
key API key secret and the bearer token
so save them somewhere that is secure it
is crucial that you do not share these
with anyone other yourself a person
having your keys can perform actions on
your behalf in case you feel that
someone might have gotten hold of your
API Keys you can always regenerate them
on your app settings
note that this will require you to
update your project with new keys as
well so if you are guys if you guys will
see my keys I will regenerate them so
that none of you can access my API
and moreover I will blur these
so now on the app settings page you can
see information about your app on the
settings tab and the set of keys on the
keys and token step now scroll the
permission section and change the
permission to read and write for that
we'll just click on the app settings
and now we will click setup
and here we'll choose read and write and
direct message
and the type of app will use is web app
automated app or board
and callback URL that will set as HTTP
colon slash slash twitter.com
and same here that is website URL that
would be same
and now we'll save this
it's saying us that changing permission
might affect our app so we'll click on
the yes
now here you will be generating the
consumer keys for your app which along
with your API keys will be used to
authenticate your app and thus let you
assess the Twitter API in the
authentication tokens section go to SS
token and secret and click on generate
the page will show you your tokens that
was generated for you to note down as in
the case with API Keys these tokens are
very sensitive and you can always
regenerate them if you lose them or
happen to accidentally share them with
someone else once all this is done you
step of creating a Twitter app is
complete
now moving to our project that is in the
visual studio code we will import to EP
now to import to AP we'll write the
compound import
to EP
now importing to EP
now you should declare your quiz by
initialize tips uh repeat
after importing the 2p we will
initialize our keys with respective
variables
so for that
we will
first create a variable API underscore
key and
here
you should store your API key
and here
API underscore secret you could name
anything and have any variable to store
your keys
I am
initializing these variables to hold my
keys
now here I will store my API underscore
secret underscore key that would be API
secret key and here
I will be storing my BR token and
I will name it similarly only
be error underscore
token
and here I will store my Bearer token
and
just before the beer token we will write
r
and now after storing the beer token we
will
store the SS token and for that we'll
create a variable and name it as SS
token only and here we will
paste our key that is a search token you
have to copy your keys in any text file
or you can save it somewhere
I have saved it in Google Docs you can
save it there also
now
we will have access token secret key
and that also we will store here
and now gaining access and connecting to
Twitter API using these credentials
first what we'll do is
we will create a variable and name it as
client
and inside we will use tweepy dot client
and inside will pass Bearer token
and after that we'll pass API key
and after that we will pass
API
but we have API underscore Secret
that is API secret key
and after that we will pass assess token
NSS token Secret
foreign
we will create a
variable
and name it as
authorization and we'll just write auth
just for the short form and here we'll
use 3p
now here
we will call
zero authorization one user Handler
and inside we will pass the parameters
that is API key API Secret
and SS token and SS token secret here we
won't pass the
BR token
so we'll just copy this
and paste it here
so we have passed the API key API secret
SS token and SS token Secret
now here
we'll just create API that would be
equal to 3p dot API
and inside we will pass authorization
and now
will fill out all these Keys here as I
want you guys to know how this project
will run so for that I would reveal all
my keys and if possible I would just
blur them
so that no one can misuse them
so I have pasted my
credentials in a Google doc
and I'm just copy pasting them
sorry
so you could also store them in any of
the text file
and just copy paste them and
be assured that you secure them and not
give it to any of your friend or any
person
as he could access your Twitter API
after that
so now we have created the authorization
and now we are connected to the Twitter
API
we will run this
okay we
got an error here and that is in 9
9.921 here token okay good will object
is not pullable
okay
English Knight
key
yes respond
let me just confirm that our keys
of kwu
is your
um
okay
now one to s
2
yeah okay
these are good now we'll see if we have
any error
that is just set client equivalent plan
and pass all the case then authorization
equal to TP dot or authorization one
user Handler and password will be
then if you want to repeat it here
okay so we'll save this again and run it
and it is showing us
error again
Okay so
we have the capital c here that why
it was showing
the client invite
now if we see
now it has rendered successfully now we
are yeah we are connected to that
Twitter API now moving on we'll start
with
our commands
that is
first we will see how to tweet
with commands and after that we'll
create the boats
first to
eat
we will just write a command client Dot
create
underscore tweet
and inside will pass
text what you want to tweet and that
should be in inverted commas
so we will write
hello simply
learners
and we'll save this
and run it
as you could see it has
successfully
executed we will go to our account
that is home and now our profile
and our tweets
it's yeah that is hello simply Learners
and it's just before 18 seconds
now we have seen how to
tweet using the commands
now moving on
we'll see how to like a tweet for that
we'll write a command client Dot like
and inside we'll paste the Tweet ID
and that would be in inverted commas
and from where we can get the Tweet ID
we just click on this tweet
access the street and this integer value
this is the client ID
or tweet ID sorry
we'll copy this
and paste it here
and we'll save this and run it
now the program has executed
successfully
so we'll move back and just refresh this
page
and you could see that we have one like
and that is done by us with these
commands now we have seen how to
like the Tweet we will comment it down
and move to another command that is
retweeting how to retweet to retweet
we'll just write the command client Dot
retweet and inside
in inverted commas we'll paste the
Twitter ID sorry tweet ID that
tweet we want to redo it so we have
pasted here we'll save this
and
execute it so it hits executed
successfully
we'll just refresh this
and you could see that there is a one
retweet and that is done by R command
now we will just comment it down
and move to
next thing that is replying to a tweet
now to reply to a tweet
we would write a command client Dot
create underscore
to it and inside parenthesis
we will write
in underscore reply to tweet underscore
ID
that is this and here we will paste the
Tweet ID
that we want to reply and we have pasted
the Tweet ID that is hello simply
learners
and now
we will pass the text we want to retweet
so we'll
write
keep learning simply Learners okay
so we will pass the text that would be
equal to
that would be in inverted commas keep
learning space
simply learners
okay
now we will save this
and run it
now you could see that the program has
been executed successfully we'll get
back to our Twitter
and just refresh it
you could see this retweet uh there's a
retweet there's a like and there's a
reply here and that reply is from
ourself only
and that is
keep learning simply learners so we have
seen the commands
to create a tweet
retweet
reply and like the tweet
now moving on
if you want to print timeline
what's your timeline that is your home
page
what are the tweets on your timeline so
for that
we have a simple command
for that we'll run a for Loop
or and create a variable tweet
in and use API
Dot
home underscore timeline
and after that
okay
instead of underscore
colon
and here we'll just write the command
print
tweet Dot
text now we save this
and run it for you guys
so here you can see that in the terminal
it will shows all the tweets that are on
our timeline
it is printing all the tweets here
so we'll just kill the terminal
now you have learned how to create sorry
how to print all the tweets that are
present on your timeline
and if you want what tweets a person has
done or you want to print all the tweets
from a user's timeline
for that we'll create a variable person
and write the command client
Dot
get user
and here we'll just
have the username of the particular
person
who's
timeline you want so we'll just
write the timeline of
Narendra Modi that is the prime minister
of India
will just paste the username here that
is Narendra Modi
and after that we'll just write load
data dot ID
and now we'll run a photo to print all
the tweets that would be present in his
timeline
in
client Dot
get underscore user underscore
tweets
and inside will pass person
Dot
data
and here we'll print
tweet Dot
text we'll save this
and run it for you guys
okay so we have an error here
that is traceback 926
okay uh
dot data
okay that would be get users yeah
notice okay now we will run it again
yeah you could see all the tweets that
are present on this timeline that has
been printed here
so we'll just
comment this down and now we will create
another file
for creating a board to retweet
for that we will
name the file as read
tweet Dot py
Now to create a retweet bot we will just
copy the
Authentication
Keys here and paste it here and we'll
import one another Library here that
would be import
time
and to start with the Tweet board
first we'll use a method that is called
streaming to receive tweets about
particular parameters that will pass
that is if we want to get tweets about a
particular keyword that is Virat Kohli
so pass this word and we'll get the
tweets that contains that word
now we'll stream for tweets containing
parameter and that would be
we can steam for python or Virat Kohli
so
for that we will write a command
class
My Stream
and inside
will pass
to EP Dot
streaming
client
so here we have created our stream class
and we have inherited the My Stream
class from my stream class from 3p dot
streaming client
and we'll have a colon here now inside
these classes we'll create functions
which would be the special functions for
example
we will first create a function that
would be
on underscore tweet and inside will pass
self and
tweet
so this tweet parameter that will
represent the tweet that the stream
detects now to retweet
so we will declare this variable to it I
will show you what it will hold on
and we will write a simple command to
print
all the tweets with the particular
keyword that we are searching
first we'll get all the tweets and then
we will retweet them okay
so print tweet Dot
text
now
outside this class
to retweet
we will create the accept and try block
but before that
outside this class we'll create the
stream instance
this will represent our actual stream
and will pass Bearer token in this so
for that we'll just write
My Stream
and inside will pass the beer token
and that is stored
in a br token only
it's showing error
stream is not even but we have defined
it here
that is my stream
so first before doing this we should
initialize a connection here also
we'll save this and run it
and it has executed successfully so
we have our connection with the API
now I will comment out
and
once again
yeah
okay we have the small s for my string
but we'll get it
Capital only
okay now we'll let you know that stream
this stream instance will let you know
what type of tweets we want for that
we'll create stream rule stream rules
are basically rules what stream needs to
follow and Twitter rule is actually
getting a string if I type hashtag
python then the stream will return all
recent tweets containing hashtag Python
and if we and if we want to add hashtag
programming in it then it will return
both of these hashtags but we want both
hashtags separately so for that we will
use logical operator you can add as many
parameters in the brackets as you want
for that
we'll just create an instance rule here
and inside this rule we will write
to EP
Dot
stream rule
and inside parenthesis
and inside the
rumors will just
uh we will search about Virat
okay Virat Kohli
and
will
have it in the brackets
okay
and now
it will get us all the tweets and the
retweets also mentioning these keywords
that would be Virat Kohli and the
replies also to avoid these tweets that
are the retweets and the reply tweets
what we need to do is
we will have another set of parentheses
and inside
we will have a command is
colon
retweet that is it will neglect and
space that is and
and is
colon
reply
so it will avoid all those that are
retweets and reply
now the space in between is that
indicates we do not want retweets and
replies in our stream
okay now if we want
first we will get Virat Kohli only
now we'll add rules and passing the
rules
for that we'll write a command stream
dot add underscore rules
and inside we will pass
the rule instance
and to start this stream we will just
write
stream
dot filter
now to get all the
tweets and retweet them we
have to make a
try and accept block
so for that
you will have a try and accept look here
that is
now to retweet we'll create the
acceptance try block and inside the try
block we will write the code to retweet
the tweet and pass the ID of the Tweet
to retweet that is tweet.id
what we have stored in the Tweet
parameter that we have passed here
now to do that
we'll create the try block
and inside the try block
we will write
client Dot
retweet
and inside will pass tweet Dot ID
and now we will have an accept block
so
accept
exception
as
error
so this accept blows uh
repeat so this accept block is just in
case if we get any error
so it will get a sprinted
error
now
we are ready with our Detroit board so
we'll save this
and run it
so we'll get all the retweets printed in
our terminal
foreign
retweeting
so we will get back to our
profile
and just see that
foreign
has already retweeted that have Virat
Kohli as a keyword in them
it has already retweeted them
so here we have created a retweeted
board
and now
we'll create a like board
how to
like a particular tweet
for that we will create another file and
named as like.py
and here
we will copy
all the authorization
and start with our light board we'll
kill the terminal here
and first we'll establish the connection
for this file
and we have import time here
Now to create a board that should like
our tweets
so first we'll get all the tweets data
that have the particular
#that would be Virat Kohli or the
particular keyword will get all those
tweets and like them and we'll avoid
retweets and the replies so to get all
the tweets we have seen in the date with
bot we will perform the same commands
here
and for that we'll start with
first we'll create a class
and name it as my stream
and inside will pass to EP
Dot
streaming
client
colon
and now we'll
ever functions here that is own
underscore
tweet
and inside will pass
self and
the variable tweet which will contain
the keyword that we want to search all
the tweets we want to get us liked
so here
now
we will write a command to print all the
tweets that would be print
tweet Dot
text
and for this also we will create try and
accept block but after defining the
stream keys
now what we could just
copy those
from our date with port
sorry
we'll copy this and inside our like
board
we will just
copy it
and inside our like board we'll just get
it pasted
so here also we have created a instance
team and inside that we have Cola class
that is my stream and pass the beer
token there and now we are adding rules
here
so we have rule that is 3p dot stream
rule that is Virat Kohli and if you want
to add another keyword
here we will use logical operator or
and we'll add
hashtag
python
now we will get all the tweets that have
Virat Kohli as a keyword in it and
hashtag python in it
and we have
that is is colon retweet and S colon
reply that is it will avoid all the
retweets and the replies
it will get us all the tweets with these
keywords that is the original tweets now
we will filter this first we'll add the
rules and we have added them
now we have all the commands now we'll
move back and get a try and accept block
to get a board working
now in that try block
we will get
the command to like the tweets
client
dot like
and inside will pass that tweet
dot ID
okay
that is land root light and then we are
passing tweet.id okay
now we will get the accept look here
that is accept exception as an error
as error
and here we will get printed error if
any error request
now here we'll use the time module
and
we will get the command sleep
for just one second as there would be so
many tweets so we just want a minimum
time
to get all the tweets
so we have set the time we'll save this
and run it
so we'll move back to our Twitter
and we'll refresh this
and wait for some time
as it will take time
okay till now we haven't quote
we will refresh it again
you could see that
okay we will just go into a profile
and go into our likes
okay we can see that about 58 seconds
ago we have light
okay
uh those tweets that contain Virat Kohli
that have been like and those contains
hashtag python those are being light
so our like Port is working very fine
so it will
keep liking this and if you want to kill
this program you just want to kill the
terminal here okay
and with that we have come to the end of
this session
