meeting you and thank you for having me
so I'm basically from jabalpur madha
Pradesh and I have done my schooling and
Bachelor from here jabalpur and then
after completing my bachelors I moved to
Mumbai and I started my career as a
developer there and after working for
two years as a developer I switched to
cyber security domain and currently I'm
working as a cyber security and
compliance analyst thank you pra thank
you for summarizing your life story in
such a nice way so first help me
understand right now also are you in
jabalpur yeah currently I'm working from
home got it so are there family members
who are also working as part of the Teck
industry in your family or you were the
first one who decided to do bachelors
and and get into the tech industry I was
the first one but my sisters they are
also now working in the tech industry so
they came after you so they saw you and
then they also decided to do it yeah
they are younger than me got it so when
did you decide like after your schooling
very clear that you want to you are
going to become an engineer and try to
work get into the tick industry or some
event in your life you saw someone in
your like neighborhood or someone in the
family that became your role model and
that's where you decided to pursue this
path yeah of course I was always up to
date with the new knows and what's going
around so I think that was the
motivation I took this career got it so
what I have seen especially about North
India parents and in general North India
like mindset that most parents want
their like girl child to become doctor
this has been like I saw this trend in
my family I saw in my wife's family I
also saw in in extended our our
community or society that we used to
live in so was there no such pressure
that okay why do you want to go get into
engineering and Tech because was that's
mostly dominated by male which has
changed now I'm sure the metrics and
tech industry is now very different
compared to what it used to be 10 15
years back so there was no as such
discussion in your family that do
medicine that's much that suits you as a
lady better than engineering Krishna my
father himself is a civil contractor
he's a civil engineer so yeah my parents
did discuss this with me when I was
about to uh choose the subject that what
I was going to take and so I said them
that I wanted this field I want to be an
engineer and not doctor and they
supported me yeah because given I have
my own father as a civil contractor so
how did you get into TCS that's that was
your first job so you got into TCS
through a campus placement or it was an
outof campus placement it was an out of
Campus placement I think they had that
off campus placement twice or twice uh
that time I think it was twice I'm not
sure I gave the test and I got selected
that I got into the interview and that's
how I get into this years got it good
see people get into comfort zone very
fast like being from jabalpur small
place first in the family completing
engineering getting a job in TCS very
well known everybody wants to work for
Tata like I know in North India doing a
job in tata is as good as working for a
government so there's a lot of respect
associated with being in a stable job
and so on and then they're taking
proactive approach of reaching out to
others figuring it out that okay can I
move from this project to another
project is not very natural most people
what they do okay let me first relax
enjoy this current role right and then
we think about what comes to me on its
own but you got your first break as a
fresher from outside campus as a good
achievement then once you are in the job
you started working then getting this
bug that okay now I'm not satisfied I'm
not happy with what where I am I can do
more tell us something that really
triggered you right because there's
always a trigger right people get
Comfort Z very soon so how did you
navigated that challenge that
engineering complete first job once in
the first job trying to get into
something else that is not given to me
but I want to go and grab that another
opportunity Krishna I was always excited
and I was always curious about cyber
security and I knew that I have to do
something in the cyber security field
itself but I got the job and I said to
myself okay let's see how this job goes
and once I was in the job I took a
little bit time to adjust just but then
I realized that this is not my thing and
I was always thinking back in my mind
while doing my job as a developer that
something is not right I'm not in the
correct place this is not where I belong
so I talked to many people in the
organization there are many great people
very helpful very courteous and I talked
to the like-minded people who are in
cyber security who are the leaders who
are working there who are uh running a
team and I I told them that I am working
as a developer and I want to switch I
want to change what would you suggest
many of them helped me many of them told
me what to do so I started Gathering all
the information I started doing online
courses online trainings over the
internet and then I asked to change me
into something into cyber security but
then it was also a difficult part to
change it because they generally don't
release you easily it took me almost one
year to change it and in that time span
I was in constantly touch with the new
team which I was going to join and they
helped me they told me do these testings
this will be helpful for your future in
cyber security I was in constant
communication with the my new security
team that I'll be going to join and then
when I joined it I saw a great
difference in the environment it was
extremely good the people were very
courteous very helpful and they showed
me how the things are done and they
taught me many things so now that you
moved from to your kind of project that
you wanted to do people learn on the
project you are you wanted to work in
cyber security you have seniors you have
Team lead you have managers you have so
many different expert who become part of
a real project right and people learn a
lot by working with people who who have
already done the same work for so many
years right and plus cyber security
again like any Technology field is fast
evolving newer things come every other
day and real project you need to work on
all those real things so you already are
were going through so much of learning
in real time what was the need for you
to decide that okay while I'm doing it
while I'm learning it maybe I should do
something else also to acquire more
knowledge what was the trigger for that
when I started with the course I was
still in the developer role so okay so
you started the taking a cyber security
course while you still a developer not a
cyber security team so when you started
applying for the cyber security role did
you mention to those respective project
leads that look I'm a developer but I
have interest in cyber security and I'm
also doing a course so hence you should
also consider me for a role did you
mention them or applying
for okay no I did I did not left any of
the chance to show them that I'm
passionate about what cyber security and
not what I'm doing right now so yeah so
you did mention that I'm doing a course
on completely on my own it's not funded
by the company I have decided and
initiative so that shows that I'm really
interested that's a good point so I
think that can be a good message to
others because there are so many people
who get into these large companies and I
see that majority of them are not happy
with what they're doing they're doing it
because it pays you monthly salary and
of course you need to earn money to
survive but I see people complaining a
lot about their current role their
current managers their current clients
there's so many when I connect with them
in my some of my offline connect I see
them they are unhappy but they don't
think that they can do anything about it
so your story is a good example that if
you're not happy with what you're doing
you should make a proactive effort of
trying to get into areas that might give
you more excitement and good news is
that all these big companies have all
kinds of work going on it's not that
they do only one work they are so large
that everything that you can think of
they're doing it it's just that you need
to be part of those projects that
interests you right yes absolutely 100%
people feel stuck in their jobs and yes
there are lots and lots and lots of
Technologies lots of tools in these big
companies you just have to do your own
research you don't want to be in your
comfort zone and sit there for your life
you want to get out of it and you want
to do research you want to reach out for
the people who are interested in and
communicate with them and try getting
the project which you really them so
tell me about your friends like you have
must have lot of friends who are became
part of your school college again many
of them are working in companies some of
them are doing well some of them are not
some of they are in that bracket of
doing something that they're not liking
have they reached out to you to speak
with you that how did you get into area
that you wanted to get in what has been
your advice what has been your your
peers experience both within the family
peers as well as your classmates who are
still very young and into different
roles yeah many people reach out to me
in person also and most of them are over
Lindon that I want to do this I have I
want to pursue cyber security what steps
can I take
and I always guide them that if you're a
beginner start with Linux start with
networking and try to apply try to be
very active try to write articles every
month bonly every week whatever is your
pace keep going just don't sit don't get
very comfortable where you you are get
up and do
things that's really really great to
know now let's talk about this journey
that you got your first break in TCS as
a first time job Seeker as well as your
dream job of cyber security then you did
a program so we'll talk about the
program later on as we speak further but
when you decided to move on from TCS how
was the experience like at what point of
time you decided that okay I learned
enough here but there's an opportunity
for me to move to another company and
apply what I've learned and maybe also
get a growth in my compensation and and
my designation for possibly yeah while
working as a s so analyst in DCS I
started applying for other companies
where I can upskill myself and I came to
this opening in my current company and I
right away applied to it and I can see
in the description what they have
mentioned it was very much aligning with
what I want to do I see there are many
challenges which I would like to pursue
if I would be selected in the company so
this is how I go there it's just the
hunger of upscaling yourself and not
satisfying with what you have right now
so you upskilled you had this hunger you
went to do a new role all that is great
you also got a very good salary hike
what I see in the note that sent by the
simply learn team so how was the impact
on your current co-workers because there
are many others also like you in your
current project right and when they saw
that okay you did a course and you got
another job at a very good hike how was
the reaction for them didn't it created
this thought in their mind also that why
we didn't started this journey or they
indeed started after looking at your
success they also started saying that
okay now we'll also do it just a matter
of time maybe in next few months it will
be our story and so on yeah most of my
former co-workers reached out to me to
switch domains in cyber security and
they say I want to be a part of cyber
security how you did it what you did
what are the important steps what will
you suggest me so I got asked a lot of
these questions but did people really
acted on it because see lot of people
take information but this inertia of not
doing something also stops a lot of
people to achieve their true potential
so out of so many people who reached out
to me what is your sense how many of
them really acted and how many of them
just took this information and then they
again went into their own life I think I
have this uh girl over reaching out to
me over Lyon and she was also from PCS
that time not in the cyber security
project I guided her uh to be how to get
to cyber security project uh she got it
she got actually to cyber security
project she changed it and now she is I
think working in any other company not
TCS but as a security
analyst so yeah she deded upon it but I
don't know about many one who acted on
it so you have satisfaction that
somebody listen to you and and they got
some some
desire let's talk a little bit about
when you decided to do a cyber security
program how did you went about selecting
it I know you you're a simply learn
student so finally you selected simply
learn but what is your process like on
what criterias you decided that okay
which program is suitable for you and
which provider should we go and take up
that program I searched for the course I
got many options but I would say the key
differentiators for selecting this
course were first of all it was online
and it was live I had some people coming
with the courses who had just
pre-recorded session
and I did not wanted that I wanted life
losses and I wanted my doubts to get
cleared away that time only rather than
I just put them and stock them so that
was the first and foremost thing second
thing I would say is the course is
during the weekends it really helped me
a lot because I was working on weekdays
and then I can have my full focus on
weekends for this
course uh third I would say if a person
wants to dive deep into cyber security
the course the curriculum it is best for
them and one thing while doing the
course I realized that the technical
support the guys provide is really good
once I remember between the class my lab
there was some lab issue I raised the
query and it got I think it got fixed in
five or 10 minutes so I think the tech
support is also great 515 for that
that's really great to know that you
liked it but let me understand this see
you had a full-time job 9 to5 weekend is
for generally for people to freshen up
and look forward to the next week and
spend their time to energize and and um
as young people you also have your
friend Circle to hang out and go out so
how did you decided to like work around
that I'm sure your friends must be
saying that you're already out of the
college why you're spending and doing
this again and you might have to miss
some of those Gatherings so how did you
went about managing that
I had a lot of distractions yes but I
believe that in your initial years of
career you should really be focusing on
upskilling yourself so this is what I
was thinking at that time only and this
is what I think right now also because
in my initial years of career I think
it's really important for me to uh focus
more and more on my skills and rather
than something else and the classes they
were conducted beautifully I think and I
always looked forward to attend the
classes actually I never felt bored I'll
tell you my own experience so when
people um start learning and taking up
courses while they have a job there
there's lot of perceptions on on what
you should do and what you should not do
so I'll give you an example of one of my
my own relatives right he was doing a
course um a similar kind of upskilling
program and then his Elder brother had
visited him to Bangalore and his comment
was so those they are not young like you
they are like in he's in mid 40s and he
has a kid kid going to school he also
does decent job at a very large company
so his brother he was like why are you
doing it we are here we have come here
let's go out let's do something else see
some s seeing who does course at this
age so I'm sure for young age also when
you're doing this kind of courses
there's always this feeling that you are
missing out on life
yeah there were lots of misdirections I
mean every weekend my friends call up
and say let's go here let's go there and
there were family functions there were
guests coming around so there were lots
and lots of distractions but it was
there in my mind that I have to do it I
have to learn I have to upskill myself
and also I believe that in your early
years you should uh really focus on the
skills which you are acquiring because
your whole career will depend on those
skills and this I consider these years
as my initial years so I was really
ready to devote my extra time on
weekends to the course and to the skills
and not to the distractions whatever
someone is saying I just I don't listen
to them I just I kept my focus into one
thing and did
it good so and the determination is
definitely help you so now till we
knowing you that you always you don't
settle for what you have and you're
always trying to achieve more so what is
next for you you did a program you got a
cyber security job you got a good hike
what's next for you what is that you're
looking
forward there are many plans which I
have in my mind for myself and my career
right now I'm enjoying what I'm doing in
my job I'm uh constantly learning here
and hopefully uh one day I'll be able to
execute all the plans that are up here
good that's really great to know so do
you have any message that you might like
to share with someone who is in who was
in your position or or a newer version
of you three years back you in final
year college you don't have a job yet
you don't know whether you are going to
get a job off campus or not especially
current year where companies have gone
very slow in hiring in India in
particular lot of kids from very good
colleges brilliant kids
either they they didn't get an offer or
their offer was delayed revoked and what
not what's going to be a message to
them okay so my message would be to not
get demotivated be
determined choose one thing choose one
skill which you like and read as much as
you can research as much as you can
there are everything you want available
over the net these days do it write
articles the very active on lynen
communicate with the people you want to
get into the field
and if you are feeling burned out rest
stop take many vacations meditate read
non-fiction books don't stress yourself
too much but also don't be in the
comfort zone get out of your comfort
zone and get things
done so thanks PR that's really great to
know that and thank you everyone for
joining as simple as that as you this is
how I spoke to pra today and you can see
from a story few things are very clear
first is that never accept status quo
she while she came out of the college
she didn't get a job she didn't accept
that and went out out of camp out of her
comfort zone to apply for off campus
drives to get a job and and she got an
excellent job while in the first job she
was she kept on looking for what more
she can do and and she always had
interest in cyber security she tried did
everything to get into that domain beat
speak with colleagues from those
projects within the company doing a
course that can give us more
foundational knowledge and in general
The credibility that she knows that
particular area so she did that now that
she's she changed her job to to grow
again in the career and it makes sense
for people time to to come out of her
comfort zone and do something else so
moving company also is is one such such
thing right because in the same company
many times if you you get very
comfortable with the players you very
com get comfortable with the colleagues
and projects and so on so she did that
and now she's enjoying that particular
role but again knowing her I'm sure
she's trying to think what more she can
do to continue to grow in her career and
her advice are also very practical that
it's not only about pushing yourself all
the time you should also keep a balance
of like doing something that interests
you outside the work also so that you
can you all can relate to her story and
I'm sure she's she's more than open to
help you out if anyone of you reaches to
her to get any specific advice that that
she can give it to you so thank you
everyone and hope you like this
conversation
