start the
streaming hello
everyone hello
hello
yeah yes yeah there is some internet
issue yeah okay so please share this on
your respective groups this link so that
we can continue with this okay the
internet also wants to go for a long
holiday I think it's creating a lot of
issue
today
yeah so I was
asking yeah it is live you can join this
uh Arpita Dr Arpita can you post this uh
YouTube link again on uh all your
groups
yeah shredda you can also do it okay
please help your friends because they
are messaging on the uh groups so I am
currently linked to YouTube
so yeah so my second question
is a peripheral ner facial nerve paly
will have everything
except okay I'll wait for your answers a
peripheral facial nerve paly will have
everything except
why see
a flat nasolabial fold means there is
loss of nasolabial fold that is
definitely seen in a facial nerve paly
read the options correctly loss of
wrinkles on the forhead yes nonclosure
of the eyes yes flat nasal labal fold
yes drooping of mouth on the opposite
side is wrong it is on the same side
right it is on the same side so that is
why that's why I have kept this question
right so if we have a look at the
different types of pales what is this
this is a central Legion here can you
see a central Legion okay this is a
upper motor neuron type of lesion okay
so this is also called as Central facial
paly what happens in central facial paly
okay so there is a crossing over that
occurs and which side is affected can
anybody tell me which side is
affected the same side or the opposite
side in a central
which side is
affected opposite side yeah whereas if
you consider this which is a lower motor
neural lesion this is a type of
peripheral lesion okay this is a type of
peripheral lesion okay so the same side
is affected right same side is affected
okay that was our question right so in a
peripheral neural peripheral IAL pal you
see same side being affected you don't
see opposite side I hope everybody got
it right I hope everybody got the answer
right so be very clear about what a
central and what a peripheral paly means
and what you can see on a central paly
and what you can see on a peripheral
paly
right clear everyone yeah let's go to
the next one which test is more
appropriate for ex extrinsic pathway
deficiency which test is more
appropriate for extrinsic pathway
deficiency prothombin time activated
partial thromboplastin time INR both A
and C
D you're correct it's both A and C so if
we have a look at the pathway I know
everybody knows the culation pathway so
the intrinsic pathway you have starting
with the hman factor and the extrinsic
pathway the only factor that is involved
is your Factor 7 right so if you look at
the test this is a very very important
table the test that measures your
extrinsic pathway is your Prothrombin
time okay and a ratio of Prothrombin
time to a control patient okay to a
standard patient is called as an INR
okay so your INR less than one is always
considered to be normal okay and your
proom in time normal is about 11 to 12
seconds okay so if you have to measure
whether your extrinsic pathway is
functioning properly or not you do a PT
INR okay and if the same thing has to be
done for the intrinsic pathway you do a
activated partial thromboplastin time
right right so this is clear okay so
everybody knows the list of calulation
factors right from Factor 1 to 13 it can
be asked as a match the following it can
be asked as a normal McQ question so
please please please everybody remember
the names okay one thing I want you all
to remember is here partial
thromboplastin component and partial
thromboplastin antecedent so component
is your Factor 9 and antecedent is your
Factor 11 okay please remember this
right next one a 9-year-old okay a
9-year-old child shows profuse bleeding
after tonsilectomy
okay blood shows that the platelet count
is normal right Prothrombin time is
normal but only apt is increased okay
apt is increased means it is which
pathway that we are talking
about talking about the intrinsic
pathway
right yeah what is the condition can
be the condition can
be a very good it can be War Vibrance
disease now if I ask you the question
why not
hemophilia why not hemophilia A and B
because they are also uh intrinsic
deficiency disorders right why not a and
why not hemophilia A and
B why only one Vin
why only one
willin there is a reason for this I'll
give you the reason here the gender is
not mentioned okay hemophilia is more
common in males right females are
usually carriers okay when the gender is
not mentioned it's always best to go for
War vibrin disease okay correct okay
it's always best to go for warin disease
okay I hope this is clear for you right
so if you talk about hemophilia right so
in
hemophilia I'm
sorry right so it's
a genetic disorder right where you have
excessive bleeding I hope everybody
knows this right so either because of
factor deficiency of factor 8 9 okay
there other factors also usually
intrinsic pathway factors which are
deficient cause hemophilia so you have
epistaxes you have bruises you have
perur sorry you don't have you don't
have purpura okay you have epistaxis you
have bruises you have bleeding from the
gingiva right for swollen joints you
have sys of Hemophilia so as everybody
knows right there is a what
happens the pattern of how hemophilia
transfer right so if you see here this
is
a a male that does not have the bleeding
disorder okay and she is the mother who
is a carrier okay so how many offsprings
are more prone to having the disorder
can anybody tell
me how many offsprings have the disorder
I'm just asking you how many offsprings
have the
disorder how tell me in percentage
you can see it on the screen okay 50%
that is one male and one female are
having the disease okay among those 50%
also 25% are carriers and 25% are
completely affected okay so this lineage
of transfer of genes of Hemophilia is
very very important okay so they can
give you a normal mother or they can
give you a carrier mother okay or an
affected mother okay with a normal
father or a carrier father so how much
is the percentage of offsprings that
tend to have the disease or that tend to
uh be the carriers okay so these sort of
genetic based questions can be
asked okay so these you have to remember
okay these you have to remember okay so
you know based on the percentages it's
either normal mild moderate or severe so
mild is somewhere between 40 to 5% of
clotting Factor
1 to 5% is moderate and less than one is
severe less than one is severe so the
same thing again we are discussing here
so in hemophilia A and B activated
partial thromboplastin time is prolonged
okay and in one vilian disease this can
be normal or prolong right one more
thing in hemophilia is your bleeding
time your platelet count and your proin
time are normal whereas when you come to
one
normal but bleeding time can be normal
or prolonged and platen count also can
be normal or reduced so we don't have a
per se saying that it's always normal in
warant so these can be these factors are
variable only your proin time can be
absolutely normal the other factors are
variable okay so these are your types
right everybody knows a and b so C is
deficiency of factor 11 okay and
hemophilia five is also called as parah
hemophilia okay parah hemophilia so
definitely it is an exlink recessive
okay the pattern of inheritance okay if
you come to hemophilia see it's
autosomal recessive and parah hemophilia
is also autosomal
recessive okay so we one Vin you know it
is a qualitative and a quantitative uh
Factor deficiency of factor eight okay
which leads to a bleeding disorder okay
it's also called as a warin disorder so
you have three types of warin type 1 2
and three okay they might ask you very
commonly which is the most common or
most common or most affected type of one
vant disease is your type one where
around 80% of cases are there okay 80%
Again The Inheritance is autoral
dominant here okay and it is a type of
quantitative defect that means enough
amount of one Vin factor is not
produced
okay so the same thing happens here so
easy bleeding skin uh easy bruising skin
bleeding okay all that can be seen and
here what is normal what is normal in uh
Vin
disease can anybody tell
me just now we saw what is normal what
is the only entity that is normal in
onein the bleeding time okay the
bleeding time
right so the same thing here again next
go to the next one which of the
following blood products can be
transfused in war Vibrance
disease are you able to see my screen
yeah so which of the following blood
products can be transfused in war wipin
disease ffp
cryoprecipitate both A and B none
C very good both A and B why both A and
B so here we come so in one vibrant
disease we have to give factor eight
right so which all have factor eight or
which all have one Vibrance Factor you
have fresh frozen plasma okay and you
have cryo preses which have okay one
Vance Factor so the compositions of all
these plasma products that is your fresh
frozen plasma your cry precipitate what
it has what it does not have all this is
very important so please go through the
various composition of all the plasma
products that are available okay for
blood transfusion in hemophilic and
onein disease patients last one rule of
10 is applicable
for rule of 10 is applicable
before see it's applicable for both foch
chromosoma and clef flip right so how in
clef flip so it's a milliard criteria
that is is used for clef lip repair so
when you do it you do it when the infant
is 10 lb in weight okay and 10 weeks old
and it he has or she has 10 G of
hemoglobin okay this is your milliards
criteria rule of 10 okay 10 lb in weight
10 weeks old and when the patient is
having 10 G of hemoglobin the same thing
can be seen in a foch
chromosoma okay what is this in a foch
chromosoma the rule of says that foch
chromosoma is a benign tumor okay of the
adrenal glands right so if it becomes
malignant only 10% chances are there
that it becomes malignant okay usually
it is unilateral okay 10% chances are
there that it can be bilateral okay it
can be present in other organs like
organ of zuka candle okay so that's why
10% can be extraadrenal okay 10% can be
multiple 10% can be familial and 10% a
seen in children okay so this is the
rule of 10 of foch
chromosoma okay foch chromosoma rule of
10 both in clef lip as well as foch
chromosoma okay let's go to the next one
late conial syphilis includes
saber Shin clutton joints radus all of
theer I'm waiting for your
answer I'm talking about late congenital
syphilis very good all of the above all
of the above is the answer so you know
the status of secondary mucocutaneous
patches and also condiloma latas okay
then you have tertiary which affects the
heart and your brain okay in the form of
gas right so if you come to congenital
syphilis you have two types that is your
early and late early is from the birth
till the second year of life and late is
after the first two years of life you
have congenital syphilis usually from
second year to Fourth or fifth year okay
so what do you have okay you can see you
have saber shins clutton joints okay and
you have radis radis is nothing but the
fissuring that you see perioral
fissuring that you see around the mouth
okay whereas in kital early kital cilis
you see hinson's Triad sorry you see uh
late in late congenital syphilis you see
Hutchinson's Triad which includes your
malberry MERS you are Tech shaped iners
or screwdriver shaped iners okay
interstitial keratitis sensory neural
deafness all that can be seen okay so
you have to be very clear about the
things that are concerned with syphilis
okay your primary secondary and tertiary
syphilis the characteristic features of
each and everything and what is
happening in early congenital and what
is happening in late congenital so all
symptoms that we saw all signs that we
saw right now are your saber shins
clutton joints all those are of late
contis syphilis okay what is this hiaki
sign it is the thickening of the
sternoclavicular portion okay of the of
the clavicles right which can be seen in
congenital syphilis again Bush Oland
sign okay this is in secondary syphilis
please remember this this is in
secondary syphilis where there is a deep
termal tenderness okay on pressing the
mucocutaneous rash that is present on
the body okay this is called as Bush olr
sign okay so and there's one more sign
apart from these two signs that that is
involved with syphilis can anybody tell
me that is also seen in kital syphilis
okay apart from hiaki sign apart from
Bush alandr sign there's another sign
can anybody tell
me it is the DU Boy sign okay it's the
duo sign where there
is where there is a little finger
shortening of the little finger that you
see in kital
syis right yes Dr supraja you're correct
Dupo
sign
okay so next going to the next question
the sequence of tongue changes seen in
scarlet fever is
what which tongue is followed by which
tongue in scarlet fever
I'm waiting for your
answers very good very good Dr
ranima yes it changes from a strawberry
to a raspberry
chop for
yeah so first you see a white coated
tongue
okay followed by a strawberry
tongue okay followed by a raspberry
tongue okay so in Strawberry tongue
there is artima of the tongue followed
by partial loss of Pap okay
which gives that typical strawberry kind
of
appearance okay then when there is
complete atrophy of the papill it
becomes a deep red raspberry tongue okay
so strawberry tongue is followed by
raspberry tongue
stop
the to see me now students
can you see me now
yeah yes yes yes so this was what we
were discussing uh so from a white
coated tongue it proceeds to a
strawberry tongue okay then the last one
will be your raspberry tongue okay so
these are your very very important
points about scarlet fever so apart from
that the other important points about
scarlet fever are
right so the Sandpaper rash okay then
your pastal lines okay which are your
linear p in the flexal areas okay then
your filos mass that is your circum oral
palor that you see in scarlet fever okay
so all these are important points about
scarlet
fever okay and intraorally you see the
for kimer spots okay you see the fora
spots which are nothing but palal P
usually that's seen in the hard pet and
the soft pallet region okay so let's go
to the so what are these SPS that you're
seeing associated with measles here you
see in the Buckle mucosa okay on the
palal mucosa what are these spots which
are seen in
measles called as are they coplex
spots yeah so they called as coplex
spots
okay they're called as coplex spots
right so you should know copx spots is
associated with measles and fora spots
are associated with German n okay and
the other one is scallet fever and also
you can see it in infectious
mononucleosis
okay right so what is this the next the
next question is cold absis is a type of
cold absis is a type
of TB intigo carbonal actom
micosis yeah it's a type of TV okay it's
a type of skin TV so if you can see here
okay there will be lympha denitis first
okay and all these discrete mat lymph
nodes that you see in TV they will
undergo they will come together okay and
they will undergo ad okay and the
central portion of that will form P okay
so that is called as a cold absis why is
it called as a cold absis because the
signs of inflammation are not present
okay then the it from the deep fasia
from the dermis it will extend through
the epidermal dermal Junction through
the epidermis and out outwards onto the
Skin So when it extent it forms a collar
like structure that is called as a
collapsis okay and externally it will
come out of the skin and rupture and P
will come out okay all these are stages
of your TB that is seen in skin okay
your lymphadenitis then matting of the
lymph nodes cold absis followed by CEST
followed by sinos formation so what is
TB of skin called
as what is TB of skin called as it's
called as lupus vulgaris please remember
very very important okay lupus
vulgaris okay so on a diascopy test you
see something called as a apple jelly
nules okay so when you press a glass
laab on the skin of a patient having TB
okay you see yellow brown spots in the
form of apple jelly nodules okay so
these are very very important these are
very very
important okay next one a 20 year old
female presented to the OPD with a
painless swelling of the left jaw with
some exudate okay now they're saying
that sulfur granules are found in this
exudate okay what is the most common
diagnosis can you tell me the most
common
diagnosis actinomycosis bom micosis both
a and b or is it TB
C yes it is a and b so when you see
sulfur granules in your question any
case history based question with sulfur
granules and saying that he has a jaw
swelling usually near the angle of the
jaw you're you have to close your eyes
and think about atino micosis okay
actino micosis but also there is another
infection called bom micosis in which
you can see sulfur granules so since
both are in the options both A and B B
will be the correct answer okay
extraoral spelling near the angle of the
jaw okay and then you can see as you can
see Sunray appearance of actino micosis
on the histopath and sulfur granules
which have the active bacterial baselite
okay it is nothing but active bacterial
peline okay so sulfur granules please go
for actino micosis okay 11th one CSF
glucose are normal in which type of
menitis CSF glucose levels are normal in
which type of
menitis viral pyogenic tubercular
carcinom
Mattis good
Priya yes any more answers
it is viral okay so please remember when
they say CSF glucose normal always think
of viral okay so if we see the
differences between viral and bacterial
menitis okay come to CSF glucose and
protein okay glucose levels are normal
or slightly reduced in viral okay where
there is where there are very much
reduced in bacterial okay very much
reduced in bacterial menitis
okay protein is elevated protein is
elevated but not too very much as
compared to bacterial menitis okay so
usually the glucose and protein of a
viral menitis is normal usually okay
even if you consider the elevation
elevation is very marginal compared to a
bacterial menitis where the elevation is
huge okay so this difference between
viral and bacterial you should
definitely remember okay you should
definitely
remember let's go to the next question
which of the following are long-term
complications of diabetes
mellitis peripheral neuropathy
non-healing ulcers retinopathy all of
the
above D all of the yes you're correct
okay so as you all know diabetes is of
two types one and two insulin dependent
insulin non- dependent okay so if we
come to the main main main major
complications of diabetes mtis you have
microvascular and macrovascular
complications so among that you have
retinopathy okay visual disturbances in
patients who are affected with long-term
diabetes then nephropathy what is
diabetic nephropathy also called as the
other name
the other name diabetic
nephropathy kimlin Wilson's disease
right kimlin Wilson's disease right
we'll be seeing about it in the next
slide okay then peripheral neuropathy
can be seen okay because of which the
patients are don't have Sensations in
the legs where they don't feel that even
after a trauma they do not feel that the
the they do not feel the pain sensation
because of the peripheral neuropathy so
nonhealing ulcers because of that okay
because of decreased immunity in
diabetic patients so all these are major
complications of diabetes okay and
intraorally if you see definitely you
will have uh the major complication that
is parodontitis okay the perodontal
health is affected apart from that you
also have zeria so which it can lead to
secondary cares formation there will be
taste abnormalities okay and you have
read that definitely in one syndrome
that is your greenpan syndrome which is
a Triad of like in planus diabetes mtis
and hypertension you see uh diabetes
mtis so also oral lyen planers you can
see diabetes in diabetes patients you
can see oral lyan planers and also in
patients who are taking anti- hypertens
and anti-diabetic drugs also you can see
uh uh oral lyan PLS okay so all these
are your presentations or all these are
your long-term complications of diabetes
malius okay so this was what I was
talking about where you have a cellular
Hine like deposition in the Mangia can
you see this this is called as kimlin
Wilson's disease kimlin Wilson's disease
okay next acute change okay mark my
words acute change in blood glucose is
best monitored by which of the following
parameter acute change is best monitored
by which of the following
parameter is it HBA A1C FBS RB is
fructosamine why
FBS why
hba1c nobody is getting the correct
answer the answer is fructosamine I'm
talking about an acute change HB a andc
will be will give me a chronic change
okay past 3
months okay FBS and RBS will be give me
the current
change okay whereas an acute change Less
Than 3 weeks change is given by a
fructose amine level please remember
this okay so when we talk about a
chronic when we talk about a long-term
management of patient having diabetes
mtis you do a glycosilated hemoglobin
levels So based on that usually a good
good level is between 7 to 9 okay so
anything less than seven is excellent
okay whereas anything more than nine
will be a
poor okay so this is how a patient uh
diabetic control is measured based on
hbc's level okay then you have
fructosamine serum fructosamine which is
a glycated protein again it will give
you an acute change please remember this
when they mention any anything less than
3 weeks of duration or when they say in
a case history saying that you have
given a anti-diabetic drug today and
after 3 weeks you want to see whether
the patient has improved or not posed
that anti-diabetic drug which test will
you do you will do a fructose amine test
you will do a fructose amine test next
which leukemia is associated with
Philadelphia
chromosome very easy question
Philadelphia chromosome which is
translocation
922 both long arms
right these are very very
important so where do you
see D definitely you see in CML you seen
anything else other than CML CML should
be your choice okay if this question is
given your answer will be D but can you
see in anything else other than
CML you can also see it in Al you can
also see it in Al so this is your
Philadelphia chromosome right
translocation 922 in both long arms okay
which is seen in CML okay but you can
also see Philadelphia chromosome in Al
please remember this okay please
remember this so uh summing up uh the
leukemias okay so uh as we saw CML okay
it is rare in children okay Al is common
in children it is common in children
okay so CML
Al both have Philadelphia chromosome CML
is rare in children whereas Al is common
in children okay most common leukemia of
adults will be CLL most common leukemia
of adults will be cln right okay and if
you look at the peripheral smar the
important things you have to remember RS
are seen in which type of leukemia C AML
they seen in AML type of leukemia okay
then uh one more thing where do you see
SMUD cells okay SMUD cells these are the
SMUD cells which lack any identifiable
cytoplasmic membrane or nuclear
structure can you see here okay these
are called as smart cells okay which are
characteristic of CLL they are also
called as basket cells please remember
that okay they also called as basket
cells okay so you see air rods in AML
you see CLL smut cells or basket cells
okay
right okay and intraorally definitely
you see gingival hypoplasia secondary to
the infiltration of the gingiva by the
leukemic cells okay by the leukemic
cells okay and this is another this is a
reputation of the discussion that we had
okay on the group so if if they give you
any case history based questions to
identify or diagnose the type of
leukemia how do you go about it okay how
do you go about it so if they think give
you any leukemia with adenopathy please
think about lymphocytic it can be either
acute or chronic okay and if they give
you about smom please think about
anything that is chronic okay either CML
CLL or hairy cell leukemia okay and the
leukemia which has nether is your AML
okay so this is how you go about
diagnosing it this is how you go about
diagnosing it okay so let's go to the
next question now yeah which cells of
the pancreas are hyper glycemic in
nature very very easy with cells of the
pancreas are hyper glycemic in
nature Alpha Beta Delta PP
hyperglycemic in nature I'm
saying that means release of hormone
from which cell will increase blood
glucose it is an alpha cell okay it's an
alpha cell
which releases glucagon right which
releases glucagon so that raises your
blood glucose levels okay so please
understand the question properly okay
the cell which is hyperglycemic is Alpha
cell okay which releases the glucon
whereas beta cell releases insulin which
lowers the blood glucose levels okay
then you have your Delta cell which
releases Stato Statin okay so it is a
inhibitory hormone for growth hormone
that is released from the anterior pitor
okay then you have pancreatic
polypeptide cell which releases
pancreatic peptide okay then one more
thing please remember an Epsilon cell
okay which releases an hormone called as
gerlin okay which releases an armone
called as
gin okay next question which is the only
lap parameter that is increased in iron
deficiency
anemia which is the only parameter that
is incre increased in iron deficiency
anemia iron fertin total iron binding
capacity transfer in saturation a very
very important question and a very very
frequently Asked
question very very frequently Asked
question and a quite an important
question very good total iron binding
capacity the only parameter that is the
only lab parameter that is increased in
iron deficiency rest all are decreased
rest all are decreased so you know the
common symptoms of iron deficiency
anemia you should remember Nika
okay te cardia all these are common
symptoms I'm not going to go into
details of it so if we look at the
Laboratory test here okay can you see
this which yeah the total iron binding
capacity is the only thing that is
increased rest everything is decreased
okay your hemoglobin okay your MCV MCH
MCC RBC reticulite okay then your serum
fertin serum iron transference
saturation everything is decreased okay
the only thing that is increased is
total iron binding capacity okay and
they will ask you very commonly what is
the syndrome associated with iron
deficiency anemia that is your patisen
Kelly syndrome or a cyrenic dysphasia
okay which is a Triad of microc chromic
hyp microtic hypochromic anemia with
glossitis and esophagal webs okay this
phasia is most common symptom of
presentation okay going to the next
question a patient presents to the OPD
with the chief complaint of dysphasia
and burning mouth okay her hemoglobin
levels are found to be 9 mg that means
the hemoglobin is less okay and we know
that she is complaining of uh and what
do you say dysphasia and burning mouth
so definitely there is some kind of
anemia we know okay the peripheral smear
such as microcytic hypochromic anemia
the possible diagnosis could
be iron deficiency talisia CLE cell
anemia A or
B everybody is saying iron deficiency
anemia
why can't it be a
talisia tmia also has microcytic
hypochromic right the answer is D I'll
tell you why it is D because here we
don't know the age of the patient okay
and we don't know the sex of the
patient these two are missing parameters
for us okay the only parameter that is
given is the patient is anemic and he's
having a microcytic hypochromic level
okay okay that means in that case it can
either be iron deficiency or talisia so
how will you differentiate okay you will
differentiate based on mener index okay
you will if if MCV and RBC are given in
that question in our question it was not
given if it was given in that question
okay
so please go for MCV by
RBC okay if it is more than 13 it will
be an iron deficiency anemia if it is
less than 13 it will be a
talisia very very
important okay very very
important
right yeah next one which of the
following is not not a radiographic
presentation of
talisia chicken wire Pepper Pot rib
within a rep hair on
end which is not radiographic
presentation of
talisia chicken wire Pepper Pot a rib
within a rib hairon
it I'm waiting for your
answers B very good Pepper Pot skull
where do you see Pepper Pot skull you
see it in multiple Myoma you see it in
multiple Myoma punch up multiple punched
out radiolucencies is called as a Pepper
Pot skull or a raindrop skull that you
see in multiple Myoma okay so if you're
talking about talisia you look at the
radiographic pictures you have a hairon
and appearance you have a rib within a
rib appearance and you have a fish mouth
vertebrae appearance okay and also you
can see there's a blurring or
disappearance of the
tracula okay near The Joint okay so this
type is called as a chicken wire
appearance okay chicken wire appearance
right okay so that was about radiograph
on a peripheral smar what do you see you
see Bullseye cells Okay bullseye cells
or target cells can you see here okay
which appear like Bullseye lesions okay
so these are called as cyes okay then
also you can see safety pin cells on the
smar okay and you see inclusion bodies
called as fessas bodies okay you see
inclusion bodies called as FAS bodies
okay next going to the next question
Zinger elisen syndrome includes
everything except it includes everything
except pancreatic tumor peptic ulcer
gastric hyp secretions
insulinoma very good Dr
ranima D okay the answer is D it does
not include an insulinoma it includes a
gastrinoma okay insulinoma is diagnosed
by vipp Triad okay vipp
Triad okay so if you look at the uh
Triad of zingalis syndrome okay you have
hyp secretion of gastrin okay then which
leads to a pancrea which is because of
excessive amount of pancreatic orinal
tumors okay so excessive secretion of
gas gastric causes ulceration in the
stomach okay so peptic ulcers okay this
is a diagnosic Triad of Zinger Elison
syndrome which is characteristically
seen in a
gastronoma okay next match the following
it's a very very important question okay
many times it has been asked okay uh the
ey presentation the eye signs that you
see in various amounts of diseases okay
so rot spots where do you see rot spots
match it where do you see Rock
spots Rod spots are seen
in very good it is seen in infective
endocarditis so Rod spots are seen in
infective endocarditis sorry two they're
seen in infective ocard where do you see
bot spots
where do you see B
spots a is two correct where do you see
bot
spots you see bot spots in vitamin A
deficiency right B is four right where
do you see K of fles or
rings ques of fler rings are seen in
Wilson's disease three and where do you
see field spots they are seen in Down
syndrome so it is a 2 4 3 1 so if you
look at each thing okay rot spots are
nothing but retinal hemorrhages seen in
infective endocarditis can you see this
okay these are rot spots seen in
infective
endocarditis okay next you see bot spots
which are hyper carotic plocks okay that
you see in vitamin A
deficiency okay that you see in vitamin
A deficiency which are called
as rot spots okay this is also seen in
retina okay your uh sorry sorry sorry
which are called as bot spots okay which
are called as bot spots are not seen in
retina they are seen in conjunctiva
sorry vitamin A deficiency these are
seen in
conjunctiva okay rot spots were seen in
retina these are seen in conjunctiva
okay these are seen in
conjuntiva okay next K of fleser rings
okay which is nothing but deposition of
copper in the form of a ring around the
eye okay now where do you see this is is
a orange brownish pigmentation okay seen
in Wilson's disease okay seen in
Wilson's disease this is seen in cornea
okay I'm just telling you the parts of
the eye this is seen in
cornea are you able to see my
screen
Vijay
Vijay black screen stop
yeah so we started again okay another 10
questions and we'll be done with the
session so we were talking about the eye
presentations
yeah it started uh people who are
joining please can you post the
link
okay are you able to see me
yes sria please post the link to
others okay I'll just wait for them to
join I'm really really sorry about the
net issues that we are having today okay
we have to like we are disconnecting
connecting disconnecting connecting
there's a lot of issue I'm really really
sorry for that okay this is not as
smooth as a pro live class but then we
try to do something that is useful for
everyone okay not only you as students
are students which can be helpful to
others also who are possible need MDS
aspirants okay that is the reason we
have kept a YouTube live so that
everybody can benefit okay but then
again we are having a lot of issues with
the connectivity okay so we had seen bot
spots we had seen uh rot spots okay then
uh we had seen qu fleser Rings okay the
next one is a brush field spot okay
brush field spot which is seen in down
spin room which is a whitish gray spot
that is seen in Iris okay so your rot
spots are retinal hemorrhages okay then
your Bot spots are seen in the
conjuntiva okay then your KES fleser
rings are seen in the cornea okay and
your brush field SPS are seen in the
iris okay so these different I spots
seen in different parts of the eye and
what are they characteristically
diagnostic of please remember the
disorders
okay going to the next question okay sat
grin is seen in which of the following
tetanus tetany deia infectious
mononucleosis Sardinian
green is seen
in tetanus tetany disia infectious
mononucleosis
very good it is seen in tetanus okay
seen in tetanus so it is because of
claustrum tetan infection okay which
causes hyper excitability of musles in
the face okay giving a log jaw kind of
an appearance which is called as saian
grein okay then you can also have
extreme arching of the batch that is
called back that is called as RIS
sardonicus okay so you have sorry Rises
opus okay which is the arching of the
the back okay this Rises sardonicus
which is the spasm of the muscles of the
face are called as Sardinian grein okay
so this Triad of Sardinian green which
is also called as Rises sardonicus and
Rises opon which is arching of the back
along with trismus is called as the
tetanic Triad this is called as the
tetanic
Triad okay so tetanus is a infection
from the cladium tetan whereas tetan is
due to hypocalcemia tany is due to
hypocalcemia next which of the following
is not a presentation of fancon
syndrome okay you should know what A
fancon syndrome is it is associated with
proximal tub
reabsorption hyper volumia acidosis
Ricketts
ostomia anybody
which is not a presentation of fany
syndrome aost Malaysia is
there it is hyper volia you don't see
hyperia you see
hypovolemia okay you see acidosis you
see rets you see osteomalacia but you
don't see hyper volia okay so Fanon
syndrome is nothing but proximal tubule
reabsorption dysfunction okay in which
you have phosphat Ora renal glyos Ora
okay there will be protein UA okay and
what are the causes it can be
theologically because of genetic
diseases like Vil's disease okay or it
can be secondary to duct CIS platin and
heavy metals okay so you see a hypo
volumia okay you see acidosis you see
rickets and Osteo malaia and you also
see constipation because of
hypokalemia so the answer for this is a
you don't see hyper volia you see hypo
volia okay you see hypo
volia next one excess iodine
intake causes hyper production hyper
production of thyroid hormones in which
of the following effects okay excess
iodine intake causes increase in
production of thyroid hormones in Wolf
Che off effect Jord baso effect both of
the above none of the
above it is B it is JW baso effect now
when we look at it when you give
excessive external iodine if there is
decrease in thyroid hormone production
it is called as a wolf cheoff effect it
is called as a wolf cheoff effect when
you give excessive iodine when there is
increase when there is increase in
thyroid hormone production it is called
as a JW baso effect so I asked
lymphocytic virus
hbv here here he is talking about
hepatocellular carcinoma
so which will be the most causitive
agent of hepatocellular
carcinoma among the given
options very good it is a hbv so your
hbv hcv are most commonly associated
with developing of Hep cellular
carcinoma
okay right so you should know the
different types of hepatitis virus okay
so enterate transmission is a and e
others are parentral transmission okay
the longest incubation period is for
Hepatitis C okay next uh chronic state
is not seen in A and E okay so uh the
genetic material is also very very
important okay so the genetic material
is a double standard DNA in Hepatitis B
okay rest all it is a single standard
RNA okay and this is also this double
standard DNA is also partial double
standard
DNA okay in Hepatitis B please remember
this okay next which of the following
markers indicates previous infection in
a hepatitis antihbs AG
antihbc both A and B HB e AG
he's asking about a previous
infection I will wait for your
answers very good Anusha
RI yes it is both A and B anti HBS Ag
and anti HBC now when you look at the
screen very very important okay so the
first marker to rise in a hepatitis B
infection is your HBS AG okay so it it
will be present for around 6 months of
exposure after that your anti HBS AG
will rise okay the second one to rise is
your HB AG okay then around 5 months of
after exposure you have your anti HP
okay after that the third marker to rise
is antihbc you don't have a HBC AG okay
core antigens are not present in the
serum of a patient okay so based on this
okay so he's asking about previous
infections how do you diagnose the
previous infection presence of antihbs
Ag and antihbc are diagnostic of
previous infection so you know acute
infection is by HBS AG this is very very
important very commonly they'll ask you
acute infection is by HBS AG active if
they ask you very active replication It
Is by hbe okay active replication is by
hbe okay so previous vaccination if they
ask you It Is by antihbs AG okay then
acute hbb infection also apart from HBS
AG you see antihbc IGM okay IGM is the
first imunoglobulin to increase followed
by IG okay so please remember if they
ask you acute it will be IGM if they ask
you chronic it will be IG okay so I hope
these are clear next all of the
following are symptoms of nephritic
syndrome
except all of the following are symptoms
of nephritic syndrome acute glom
nephritis
except oliguria hematuria hypertension
massive
proteinuria D very good massive protein
Ura is seen in ortic nephrotic syndrome
okay rest all are seen in nephritic
syndrome so if we if you see nephrotic
and nephritic okay so this is the
nephritic where you see definitely
glomular nephritis hypertension Cola
colored urine that is your hematuria
okay decreased production of urine which
is your olig UA most common causes your
bur's disease which is the IGN
andropathy coming to nephrotic okay you
see hypo albuminemia you see massive
protein Uria okay and also you see hyper
lipidia these are common causes okay so
if you see about nephrotic and nephritic
Okay so prot UA is marked in
nephrotic okay whereas it's less in
nephritic okay hematuria again is
present in nephritic but it is absent in
nephrotic so definitely you don't see a
RPC cast in nephrotic you see it in a
nephritic okay so these differences
between nephrotic and nephritic are very
very important okay one thing I want to
talk about is your re Sternberg cell
which are also called as aai cells which
are seen in Hotchkins Lymphoma can you
name any other the disease in which you
see a AI
cell apart from Hotchkins Lymphoma where
else do you see a AI
cell you see it in
CMV okay you also see it in CMV very
good Anar you see it in CMV so I was
talking about hypocalcemia right okay
which is a uh tetanus uh tetany or
tetanus tetanus is because of Clum
tetany okay tetany which is
hypocalcemia okay what are these two
signs just tell me the names of these
two
signs twitching of the facial nerve
facial nerve on application of pressure
near the angle of the jaw seen in
hypocalcemia is called as
schwat sex sign this is called as schw
sign okay and then on infl on
application of pressure on the spigo
manometer cuff there is flexing of the
hand okay this is a carpopedal spasm is
seen this is called as trous
sign it's called as trure sign okay so
these two signs are very very important
next par Aromas are seen in all of the
following
except men one Men 2 Men 2B men 4
why men
for very good it is
C men 2B which is also called as men 3
right which is also called as men 3 so
if you look at it
okay so parathyroid adomas are seen in
men one it is seen in Men 2 a it is seen
in men 4 but you don't see it in men
2B
okay so just have a look at these okay
so men one is called as wormer syndrome
Men 2 a is called as simple syndrome men
2B is also called as men 3 okay and Men
Four okay so men one is because of
chromosome 11 2 a and 2 B are because of
chromosome 10 and this is because of a
cycl dependent kyes inhibitor Gene 1B
Gene okay mutation of that Gene men 4
okay so you should know what are the
common symptoms in men one men to okay
these are very very
important okay next one the presence of
gamma gandi bodies is diagnostic of
which type of anemia it's a very easy
question gamma gandi body is a
diagnostic of which which type of
anemia I'm everybody all of you are
correct it is diagnostic of CLE cell
anemia so there is a sickling is because
because of a uh replacement of glutamin
by valon
okay amino acid so because the rbcs
assume that CLE shaped they go and block
the arteries okay and they lead to
excessive bouts of bone pain okay
retinopathy bacterial infection leg
ulcers 7:30 7:30 start 7:
730
7:4 okay probably the last streaming
hopefully for the
day so the presence of GMA gandi
bodies is characteristic of CLE cell
anemia we had seen okay so Cal cell
anemia okay so the radiographic features
are very very important again you see a
hairon and appearance on the skull okay
and you see a step ladder
pattern okay you see a step ladder
pattern on the iopa okay these are very
very
important the radiographic features
of s cell
anemia okay and on a peripheral smear
you see the presence of SLE shaped cells
these are called
as dpos sites these are called as dpos
sites
okay and in the spleen you see gamma
gandi Bodies Okay so this is the
question that I asked you presence of
gamma gandi bodies is diagnostic of
which anemia it is Cle cell Ania
yeah the next question progesterone
levels are maximum at what day in
menstrual cycle 11th 14th 21st
18th progesterone levels are maximum in
which
day
anybody yes an is correct it's 21st day
so if you look at the menstrual cycle
okay which is the first hormone to rise
you have both the fular phase and the
luteal phase follicular phase is between
1 to 14 days and between 14 to 28 days
is your luteal phase okay so where do
you see progesterone Rising the
progesterone is almost flat till the
follicular space face and once the
luteal phase starts it Peaks at around
21 days okay this is released by the
corus luum
okay so you should know that peing of
progesterone occurs in luteal phase
usually around the 21st day so the
answer for that is
21
okay next going to the next question all
of the following are features of acral
except all of the features are are
features of acral
except height is unaffected puberty is
unaffected hypogonadism it develops in
adulthood
anybody very good Supra it is
hypogonadism okay you don't see
hypogonadism in acromegaly so if you see
the differences between acromegaly and
gigantism okay so look at these three
parameters which are unaffected the
height the onset of puberty and the
gidal development are unaffected in
acrom whereas the height is increased in
gigantism onset of puberty is delayed
and hypogonadism is seen in gigantism
but it is not seen in acromegaly so
these three differences between
hypogonadism and acromegaly are very
very important okay so height onset of
puberty gonadal development are
unaffected and height is increased in
gigantism onset of puberty is delayed
and there is hypogonadism in
gigantism okay last question fetal
hemoglobin has which of the following
chains Epsilon beta Gamma
Delta Epsilon beta Gamma Delta I'm
talking about fetal hemog
yes Supra you're correct correct Mani it
is gamma okay so if you talk about a
normal adult hemoglobin it has Alpha 2
Beta 2 Chains okay now these beta 2
Chains can be replaced by Delta 2 Chains
okay in certain population then the
hemoglobin becomes hba2
okay hpa2 okay in fetus the hemoglobin
Al beta beta chains are replaced by
gamma chains okay Alpha 2 gamma 2 is
fetal hemoglobin so this fetal
hemoglobin can convert into either HBA
or
hba2 okay so these chains of different
types of hemoglobin are important okay
and in in HBS that is your CLE cell
anemia it is Alpha to bet 2 only but
there is glutamil is replaced by valon
in the sixth position in CLE cell
anemia okay in CLE cell
anemia
right yeah so as you can see I wanted to
discuss a lot of slides okay but there
is a lot of issue with the
uh there is a lot of issue with the
internet so we are not going about
discussing everything in detail so we
just wanted to have a rapid revision on
your general medicine physiology and
pharmacology before we uh go for the
grand exam which is on the 13th of uh
this month that is day after tomorrow so
uh it is going to be very very useful
for you so I will definitely ask you all
to come on the 13th and give the exam
okay please make it a matter to give
your grand exam on 13th you can assess
yourself how much you know how much you
don't know where you have to improve
okay this is a very very important uh
module which is very very important for
you all to understand okay so please we
have conducted so many pro live classes
so many offline classes and we try to
take YouTube lives and enormous amount
of discussions on WhatsApp so please do
attempt your exam on the 13th of this
month okay so all the very best I'm
really really sorry for the multiple
browsings that had to be done today okay
because of the uh internet issue we had
today okay so see you all have a very uh
nice weekend okay it's a long weekend
make maximum use of it and please study
well and all the very best for your exam
thank you so much see you all once again
bye-bye
