learning is a treasure that will follow
you everywhere I've always believed that
continuous learning should be part of
anyone's life continuous learning has
been an integral part of my life as well
I took the leading safe certification
from Simply learn and that helped me
grow from AVP to VP at oranization hi my
name is pravin Kumar pande I vice
president RIS technology at synchrony
and this is my
journey my professional background has
always been into technology I have
started my career with data consultancy
services uh where I was working as a
support engineer for do Bank client and
then I moved to Fidelity where I was
leading the entire support for risk
organization and later on I transitioned
my role into risk management product
side where I was also a developer and
also managing team later I joined
synchrony uh in 2018 and I have been
leading the entire RIS technology team
there
I have been good in studies at my school
but I was also a lot introvert during my
school days but something which really
drived me then was Sports I've been
always into team sports that really
helped me to learn about failures at
times you say failures but it is
actually what you are learning on the
ground so that has really helped me in
terms of learning uh do a lot of
learning from there as well work in a
team setting because whenever you want
to succeed in organization you canot do
alone it always has to be done in a team
setup in my initial career days there
were a lot of strong feedback coming in
from my managers I was putting in a lot
of effort but that was actually not
translating into what they were looking
at yes it was not a very happy moment
for me but then I certainly had a lot of
feedback session from them I also
learned a lot from there I in fact did
my first certification during my first
couple of years of my professional
journey and that really helped me to
grow in my career then as well so I
think it's very important to remain
focused understand what is like really
required for the job role understand
what skills are required and then in
order to become proficient in that it's
important to take certain certifications
as well that helps you really grow in
your professional
career so I have been playing the role
of a lead when I started my job in at my
current
organization and all of my experiences
have been from a practical knowledge
what I've going gained in the past but
at times it's very important that you
learn the topics or the skill from the
core and uh some of the theoretical
aspect of it as well so the
Certification did covered a lot of
topics which was very very synonymous to
what I've been doing in my current role
and the certification topics really
helped me to kind of go back and apply
those principles and learnings which
really helped me in to grow in my career
and in my role as well I think learning
is a continuous process and you should
upskill yourself looking at your current
environment and current setup of where
where your organization or where your
technology is mov my family has been
always supportive of me going ahead and
and putting in a lot of extra efforts
even in on weekends when I'm learning it
was really not new for them they
understood that I need to put in some
time learn and acquire these new skills
simply learn is one of our approved
learning vendors our organization
supports certification reimbursement for
all the employees
and that's where I came to NOA simply
learn but then I went onto the platform
I browsed through all the training
topics which it was covering and then I
took a decision the experience was
absolutely wonderful I would say the
gamut of people who joined in a training
they had very very vast experiences from
different organizations and it really
helped me to also understand what were
their problems once I completed the
certification I went ahead in fact we
spent fews with my team giving them the
download of everything which I learned
so I summarized the entire training for
them and I gave them the best practices
which I learned and that really helped
us to as a team improve the process
which we're doing and in turn solve a
lot of process problem which we had
internally as
[Music]
well I had a very very large impact
after this training on my career this
training really helped me to understand
about the scale agile terms and and the
processes which actually in turn help me
grow into a role of Vice President where
in my current role I'm actually managing
and leading multiple agile teams I love
playing tennis I started playing tennis
couple of years back and that has really
changed my entire routine as well even
even if I'm uh indoors with my son or
playing Outdoors that really helps me to
bond very very strongly with my son as
well Define your goals for the year in
fact make it more shorter make it more
half failly Orly and then you start
thinking about what are the skills or
what are the Technologies you want to
learn so that you can grow into that
role and that is where the certification
also comes into the picture because
learning and acquiring knowledge through
certification actually gains helps you
gain Master over that topic and that
really could help you in terms of
growing in your career
