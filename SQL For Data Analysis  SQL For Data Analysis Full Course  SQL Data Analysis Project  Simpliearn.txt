hey everyone welcome to Simply learns
YouTube channel today we will learn SQL
data analytics with my SQL workbench in
this tutorial we will be going through
the fundamentals of SQL that will cover
the basic Clauses of SQL to the advanced
Clauses like joins pattern matching and
much more for better understanding of
the importance of SQL let's consider a
simple use case for our realtime SQL
sales analysis for business growth so
the context in today's business
environment making datadriven decisions
is essential for growth imagine a car
dealer Keen to analyze sales performance
and customer Behavior to boost
profitability the dealer is eager to
understand which fuel types CNG diesel
petrol or hybrid are most popular among
customers the owner needs data to guide
inventory decisions and marketing
strategy
this is where SQL becomes a game changer
the dealership ddps holds the wealth of
information and through SQL queries the
owner can extract detailed insights
using SQL the owner gets the number of
cars sold segmented by fuel type with
secret functions they quickly generate a
report showing which fuel types are in
highest demand armed with this data the
dealership adjusts its marketing
strategies promotes high demand vehicles
and Alliance inventory with customer
preferences the SQL report streamlines
the analysis and also forecast future
Trends guiding investment in electric
and Hybrid models as the market shifts
towards
sustainability now that we understood
the importance of SQL in data analysis
let's proceed with a hands- on example

and description box below to find a data
science and data analytics program that
fits your experience and areas of
Interest now without further delay let's
get started with our demonstration on
SQL data analysis for today so we will
be having two different Excel files so
one Excel file will be having the
customer data set and another Excel file
will be having the dealership Excel file
or dealership data set right and along
with that we will get started with the
SQL workbench my SQL workbench tool to
run our queries I hope I made myself
clear with that now let's get started
now this is our customer data set so our
customer data set will be having uto ID
state where the uh customer belongs to
and the region of that particular State
and his customer ID and his name right
along with that we have another data set
known as dealership data set right
remember this order Ting the First
Column remember this right when we
performing joints this is the key based
on which we going to perform the joints
with two different data sets all right
now let's check out the second data set
so this is our second data set known as
the dealership data right so we we
having the first U audit ID and after
that we have audit date delivery date
delivery days and dealership name which
particular store is that and the
dealership spin code category of vehicle
bought and product name quantity fuel
type traffic leads orders Revenue profit
and basically profit is revenue Minus
cost to company right and the order stat
is is it in transit is the order
canceled or placed or is the order
delivered right so is it not delivered
yet so these are the order statuses so
we have four different of one of them
order in transit delivered canceled or
not delivered correct so these are the
two dates that we will be working on
today and let's also take a look on the
workbench that we will be executing
queries on so this is the SQL or my SQL
workbench where we will be executing our
queries right so currently it is using
data from a different data set so we
don't want that we can create a new
prompt and we can get started with our
data sets here so uh to get started with
the new file we might have to create a
new schema first so let's create a new
schema so you can just write down your
name car
dealership right so that that's the new
schema name just apply apply so you have
just created a new schema now let's open
the schema here and you have the tables
there and you don't have any data table
right so for that we might want to add a
new table so double click or right click
on that and here you can see a table
inut visit so browse the path and here
we have the delation data open and click
on next next and and if you go back here
you have an option called drop data
table if the table already exists right
if you already have a dealership data
table there then you can just drop it
off right and now let's try to make some
changes to it because we don't want the
confusion so either what you can do is
you can add an underscore or if you want
to keep the space or you can eliminate
that underscore I'd prefer to eliminate
that underscore and click on next and
there you have the data ypes right so if
you want to change some data types you
can do that over here and I think there
is some issue with the first one here
you have Auto with some extra thing
which you don't want here but we can
clear that down the line not a problem
and import the data file click on next
and there you go the data file should be
shortly imported it might take a little
while but it's all right there you go
click on next and th records have been
successfully included finish and we want
another table also to be included so
what you can do is use the import data
visit once again and browse and import
the customer data this time click on
next and the file name just make sure
that you don't have any spaces but if
you literally want the space use an
underscore but not the spacing right it
might cause some problem while you're
writing queries that's the reason for
which we should either eliminate or use
an underscore so go with next and here
we have the same order ID no worries we
can change the column name over here
right it's all right just import the
data go ahead with
it click on next and finish th records
have been
successfully uh imported now let's run
some basic queries like uh okay first we
might have to use the data set right so
so we want to use a car
dealership so car dealership press enter
or you can use control
enter okay there was some spelling
mistake so I think we have created uh
the schema with the wrong spelling but
it's okay uh all we have to do is just
change the uh name over here car
so we have added an extra R there but
not a problem so we are in the schema
now now let's try to run um okay I'll
not erase these names because we'll
create a document of it so we can select
uh any of the
tables select U let's look at all the
columns let's look at uh okay double
click Start
From yeah there you go we have refreshed
it so if you extend here you can see
customer data right so let's type in
customer data semicolon and there you go
when you run it you have the data right
so um since we have 1,000 rows we can go
with the current th000 rows or if you
want to extend it we can go 50,000 or if
you want the whole one lakh more than
right there might be data with more than
50,000 rows in those scenarios you can
also click on the don't limit option but
since we have thousand rows we can
continue with what we have th000 rows
right now let's um copy and paste the
same command and change the name of
customer data to
dealership so I'd like to uh pass a
small uh suggestion here so uh when
you're writing the queries use the
keywords in caps right so uppercase and
data tables or column names in lower
case so that whenever you pass your
queries or your document to your fellow
developers then they can easily identify
the difference between the keywords and
the column names or the data table names
this will help them to resolve an issue
if there is correct so we have the uh
table over here now uh we have discussed
some issue with the column name right
now we will proceed with the a quick
editing um query where we will change
the column name of this particular data
set or no not just the column right just
a moment so we will have take the help
of uh alter keyword so alter
table and our table name here is
customer Data before that let's copy
this particular keyword here or we can
do one thing describe table we can make
use of describe
word describe table customer
data enter okay let's find a way to at
least copy that column name I'm not
finding how to copy that okay we found a
way right click or double click and we
have an option of copy field name let's
copy the field name and here let's
continue with alter keyword alter table
customer data and and let's not use the
semicolon here now use the rename
keyword rename
column reing column paste
the okay all ID so there's the mistake
so uh we found a way to uh copy this uh
column name just double click or right
click here copy the field name so that
you get the format or you get the exact
data which is written as a column name
here there might be some mistake or
there might be some problem during the
input but that's not something to worry
about so we are renaming the colum name
from the existing name to order ID which
we want so just place it over there or
you can manually write it so that you
don't want to take any chances for any
more risks so order ID there you go just
run this
query and now let's select the data from
customer ID once again
and there you go you have a proper
functional working ID now let's rename
the order ID column from dealership data
as well so I want to rename customer
data to dealership data just copy the
name of the table and replace it over
here and yeah let's check the uh columns
first there you go you have a similar
problem here so let's uh change our R to
the name of the first column in
dealership data as well Now quickly run
the uh query and now let's select the
data from the dealership data there you
go so we have a fully functioning um or
fully corrected data set so we have
order data remember I you can see I'm
using a underscore symbol here whenever
or wherever I feel like having the space
you can eliminate the space uh and keep
it as order ID in a continuous form
without having a space or without having
a underscore but remember don't just
leave it as a simple space if you leave
it as a space then you might be having
deep trouble while you are writing a
query to fetch some data okay so SQL or
my SQL workbench might be confused to
have spaces in between the column names
or the entity names let's not uh make
that happen right now let's uh continue
with some queries so we are currently in
the order or um dealership data so here
we have some orders data so we have a
product quantity now let's build a you
know a kind of a problem statement where
we have to extract uh a couple of U data
sets or in a couple of uh results from
the data set that we have now let's make
use of we statement and uh try to find
some answers right now let's say uh the
dealer uh wants to know
uh one of the dealership names where it
is Prime Auto right so he wanted to know
how many number of orders Prime Auto
dealership has received now it's a
simple U where statement let's try to
answer the query answer the pro solution
to the problem just write down select
what you want to select I want to select
the dealership name right let's write
down or let's use the Autos suggest mode
so before that select leave space leave
space space from a table name which is
dealership data right now you can
proceed with um the column names what
happens here is when I wrote select from
dealership data it is automatically
giving me some recommendations here
right so the typing time will be less
right so I want to get back to
dealership name right
Dealer ship press
and underscore name I want this
dealership name from dealership data
where dealership
name is equals
to single
code Prime
Oro and I also want to know total number
of orders they received so you can
either use count or sum I'll go with sum
of
orders so for so good so let's run this
particular query control enter and there
you go so we have found that Prime Auto
dealership has received
546 number of orders so if you want to
uh if you don't want some of orders here
you can also alas it by typing
as total orders
received yeah so your column name has
been success successfully changed right
and if you don't use alas as it will
still
work there you go but in case if you
want to make the code clearer to your
fellow developers I would recommend to
use as right now let's proceed with the
some other similar wear commands so that
you have a good habit of how to use wear
clause in your realtime queries now
let's go back to our data and see what
else we can build as a problem statement
so here we have days to deliver now
let's say uh the client wants to know uh
how many uh cars if there is a premium
if it's a premium car then he wants to
know the premium cars which took more
than 10 days for delivery now let's
write a wear query for that place the
same query Here and Now name is where
Auto I'll use a and statement here
delivery
date or days to
deliver is greater than or equal to 10
or we just copy this and paste it over
here and we don't want the alas there
you go now let's run this query and why
don't we also write the product name
here right so we understand which is
that car which is taking so much of time
so some of the uh cars are BMW X3 voleno
so maybe some reason why these cars are
taking a long time for delivery right so
what happens here is he's able to
understand there are couple of cars from
couple of categories or couple of uh
manufacturers which are taking a lot of
time for delivering the
car so what he can do is he can write
down a request or an email to those
manufacturers to reduce the uh time they
are taking to manufacture the product so
that he can give an early delivery to
his clients right now let's run our
query back again to see some more uh
places where we can use the wear CLA
right now let's see uh we want to uh
categorize or we want to find out
specific cars from the segment sedan or
the category sedan where where uh the
dealership is Elite Automobiles and the
fuel type is diesel right let's try to
build a back command for that let's copy
the same Weare Clause
here paste it again here product
dealership name and instead of dat to
deliver let's type
category instead of Prime Auto we will
be using Elite
Automobiles and the category
is equals to since we're using character
data type we will be using single codes
or double
codes sit down control enter and there
you go so uh Elite automobiles is
selecting or or he is selling all the
siton class BMW Series and uh these are
the details right so if the dealership
wanted to know what are the cars or what
are the products this particular
dealership is selling in category sit
down he wants to know if he's focusing
on any other manufacturer or a specific
manufacturer so that he wants to make
sure that uh these type of cards or
these type of makers should be um you
know proceeding with giving more
deliveries of that particular category
now this is one way of doing it and now
let's identify since we have a couple of
and a few more other categories we want
to find out the total number of orders
received based on the category let's say
the uh business owner wants to
understand which type of category
vehicles are being sold a lot and he
wants to make sure that his inventory
has good number of such type of vehicles
for future deliveries or future orders
from the customers uh in such situations
you want to group by the category and
group by is also a keyword in my SQL
where you can use that and categorize
based on the category provided okay
let's build the query so that you can
understand it in a better way so U let's
copy paste the same query here and now
we will change a few terms here instead
of product we will write
category and instead of dealership name
and instead of uh category here again
okay we will write down
sum of
orders from dealership
data Group by category and order
by sum of
orders
descending now what does this query mean
it means I want to find out the category
so SUV category sedan class category and
hatchback category right so I want to
find find out which type of category is
getting the highest number of orders
right in that case what happens is if
you find out that SUV category is
getting a lot of sales then what you
will do you will buy a lot of SUV based
vehicles from the manufacturers and keep
them in in your inventory so that
whenever you receive an order for that
particular vehicle it can show the
options and make a sale right and why
are we using aut buy right so we want to
to find out the highest number of sales
right order by descending what it does
is it keeps the highest selling uh
category on top and the lowest selling
category on the bottom so if I run this
query you will understand what exactly I
meant so here you can see SUV category
is the one which is receiving the
highest number of orders followed by
hatchback sedan and M multi-purpose
vehicle MPV right now these are the
vehicles so what you will do is the next
business decision what you make is you
will try to order a couple of more SUVs
for your inventory and um it can be from
different manufacturers and then you
will provide multiple options when a
candidate or when a client comes for
buying SUV type Vehicles now to Deep
dive let's say since you've already
found out SUV is highest selling and now
you want to find out which is that one
single car in SUV category which is
getting those many high orders right so
that you want to make sure that you want
to understand this particular car is
getting highest number of sales from SUV
so I want to keep a little bigger number
of uh that particular car so that
whenever a client comes for that car I
have it ready right so if you if you
make uh slight modifications to this
query you can come up with that category
and I'll also include product and sum of
orders and uh order byct
product group by Group by product order
by sum of orders descending now I
expecting a small error here but it's
all
right there you go so we might have to
place category as
well okay let's try to run this query
once again there you go so now uh we
also might have to use um a where
command here where
category is equals to
SUV now run the query I guess you'll
find the answer there you go so BMW X3
series is that one SUV which is getting
a lot of orders right now if you scroll
down yeah these are the five top five U
SUV products for which we are receiving
total number of highest orders so what
we did here is we selecting the category
column product column and total number
of orders right so we are filtering
basically we are using where command to
filter down the data so wherever the
category is equals to SUV filter those
data alone and now we are grouping by
the product which is here Group by
product and category and order by sum of
orders descending keep the highest
orders on top and the lowest orders on
the bottom section where the category is
SUV so in in categories SUV the lowest
orders received are 130 for BMW X5
Series so what you can do is if you want
to cut down if your inventory is already
having a couple of BMW X5 series cars
then what you can do is you can cut down
the imports from for that category and
if you have less number of x3 series you
can increase a couple of more cars maybe
five to 10 more cars so that you have
your inventory ready with X3 series for
your clients right so this is how you
can use where Group by a Buy in your
query so let's say you wanted to
eliminate that particular one product
manufacturer which is receiving less
number of orders in sedan class so as C
ascending order and it is
sidan now if you run the query you will
find out sidan class
bmwx3 is the one which is receiving less
number of orders in the category sidan
and you can eliminate that and if you
want to specifically identify a
particular dealership name which is
having lowest sales then you can also do
that where category is equals to sedan
and dealership
name uncore name is equals to Elite
Motors Elite
automobiles you can also include the
dealership name in the column here and
group by category and dealership name
some of orders Su uh Su of orders
ascending and run this query and there
is some problem here in the query
dealership name category error unknown
dealership name in the field list okay
so Elite automobiles let's let's copy
this from here so we might have made a
spelling M stake in a query but not a
problem just place it here and there you
go now we must be getting the answer
okay dealership name okay we missed out
with the dealership name so we had a
spelling mistake when in case of
dealership name let's yeah that's the
one and now let's run the query there
you go so in Elite automobiles in sedan
class we have BMW 5 series in less
number of orders received right now
there might be some reason for it maybe
the location of the dealership where it
is so there might be chances right so
when um let's say you are in South India
or let's say you're in North India or
some part of a country where the roads
are really wonderful you don't have a g
uh section you don't if you're not
living in Western GS and you you're
having good longer highways in those
segments of Roads you would prefer
sedans but in case if you are in a a g
section or if you are in a you know
where we have a lot of mountains lot of
off Offroad roading tracking kind of
regions in those regions you might
prefer SUVs correct so there is a chance
now Elite Motors might be in a place
where there are some odd roads not good
roads they might be a hilly region they
might be it might be a region where you
don't have good roads right even if
you're not in the western GS or a g
region or even if you're not in a region
where you don't have any kind of hillies
or mountain regions but the roads are
not good or if you are are passionate
about it it might be a trend right it
might be some cult if you are coming
from a region where is a good cult for
SUVs right there might be multiple
reasons so I think that is one of the
reasons why uh there could be a high
demand for SUVs or sedams or specific
category of vles in a certain region now
let's proceed with the next remaining
queries or Clauses so far we have dealt
with the withd Clause uh the which where
clause and aut by Group by Clauses now
let's proceed with um case Clause right
now case is something like a switch case
where you have uh if you're familiar
with uh the switch cases in programming
then case is similar to that in SQL now
let's say the dealer wants to identify
or the business owner wants to identify
different dealership names based on the
profit they make right or uh the number
of the revenue they make he wants to uh
find out the highest uh uh profit making
category as high profit the medium
profit and the low profit so the
threshold is like 1 million if they're
making 1 million then they are under
highest category if they making in
between 50 to 1 million they're medium
and if they're making low than that then
they are least profiting and if they are
least profiting they might have to the
the business own
might have to take some decisions might
be like improving helping them improve
their sales or fixing their contracts or
if they want to collaborate or combine
that particular dealership the high
performing one right some business
decisions to make sure that everyone
everyone is breaking even in profits now
let's use the switch statement
here so as I discussed High profit so I
am going to
take uh two columns here so selecting
the dealership name of profit they are
making and case starts here when sum of
profit I'm calculating the profit here
Revenue minus the cost to company is
greater than 1 million rupees that is 10
lakh Rupees then it is considered as
high profit and if the profit is between
50,000 or 5 lakhs or 1 million then it
is moderate profit else low profit now
let's run this query and we're grouping
them by dealership let's run this query
and see the output then there you go so
we have profit categories here we have
high profit result okay let's minimize
this section
here yeah there you go so there are five
to six dealerships we have across uh the
country and most of them are in high
profit or all of them are in high profit
so if we increase the number to 10
million so far we had 1 million so if it
is between 5 million to 10 million now
let's run the query and see if we have
any uh yeah so most of them are making
good profits here there you go so far so
good now this is how you can use a
switch case statement now let's say I
also
want okay let's first use the uh uh
patter matching case here kind of uh
like statement we can use here like
clause now I I want to make sure to
identify a specific product okay let's
run this query once again where we have
the dealership data select all from
dealership data so now we have uh 8
series X8 Series right so some of the
premium Vehicles now I'd like to go with
X8 BMW X8 so I want to
identify the dealership names which are
selling X8 series now we can write down
the query as select dealership name what
you can do is just copy the dealership
name so that we don't make any spelling
mistakes I think we wrote dealership
yeah we can remove this dealership name
product from dealership
data
where
product
like or you can use
like I think we don't need to use equals
to them
codes percentage or mod x 8 and
percentage okay so what am I
specifically mentioning here is I don't
care if it is uh having anything in
front of X8 and after X8 so we are damn
sure that uh the series X8 will be
released only by BMW so in few scenarios
the BMW could be in small cases or there
might be no space in between BMW and and
X8 right so I don't want to take a
chance so I want the exact details so I
don't care if there is a space or not if
there is anything else U there might be
even spelling mistakes BM or BMA X8 or
um the full form of BMW right so and
after X8 I don't I don't want to take
any chances here as well it might be
series it might be cars right so I want
every detail the dealership name and the
product uh from the dealership data who
is having X8 car in their inventory
there you go so we have so many uh
dealerships here so if I have to take uh
the uh exact names if I don't want any
reputations then I can go with the
distinct
here so distinct of dealership names
where we can find out who is dealing
with X8 in their inventory so we have
five automakers here five dealerships
who are having X8 in their inventory now
let's also have a count right so we can
make sure that how many number of U x8s
they have uh count of
product so we can understand how many
number of uh okay so there is some query
mistake here aggregated without Group by
so here we can add another uh statement
Group
by dealership name or distinctive
dealership I I'll just go with
dealership name here and um order
by count of
product descending now let's try to run
this query by
product now let's run the
query there you go so we have City
Motors who has the highest count of BMW
X8 series and they have um uh the
biggest inventory I presume so in the
next upcoming physical year if there is
a requirement of importing X8 then you
can check out the numbers right if you
want to import a huge inventory or if
you want to reduce the number and you
can also if there is a good sale for
Asian dealership for BMW X8 series you
can also improvise your numbers as well
so that's how you can use um the pattern
matching statement and if you don't want
um if you want to exclude xit then what
you can do is just place an I here I
like or product not like X8 so if you're
filtering out X8 and running numbers of
codes for everything other every other
car but X8 you just want to run that
query and here you can see instead of X8
you can have details repeat and you can
see instead of X8 you have every other
detail on every other card that's how
you can go with
now now let's uh proceed with the joins
in our tutorial for today now let's
create a use case right you wanted to
identify all the customers who bought an
X8 right so um if you check the data if
we go back to our query here and uh run
the dealership uh query and you can see
here we have order ID order date
delivery date everything but we don't
have customer name but I want the
customer name but customer name is in
the table customer data right and here
we don't have the uh product detail what
they bought right so Vian Sai or
vhan it can be anyone who got an X5 or
X8 right but now I want to know the
exact customers who are or who have
already placed an order for X8 or you've
already delivered that X8 right or let's
say you wanted to know if they they have
placed an order for X8 now in this
situation you might want to make use of
joins which join two tables and give you
the results so there are basically
couple of joints that you can use left
join right join inner join outter join
cartisian join right so most of the
cases you would just go with the keyword
join so it will basically function like
a left join right you're choosing the
first table and you are choosing the
matching datas from the right table now
uh we want the order ID column we want
the customer name and also the product
name which is equals to X8 and we want
to run a join command based on order ID
so order ID happens to be the primary
key based on which you can perform the
join so it could be a little complicated
orally so I will write the query so that
you have a better understanding for it
so let's quickly run the query I'm going
to use the select statement here and we
wanted the customer name right so we
want the customer
name or we have it here right double
click copy the field name so that we
don't have any mistakes done and it is
from customer data right so customer
data Dot customer name okay let's also
copy the customer data table name as
well right
so that we don't have any mistakes in
our
query and bond dealership data table
name as well so
comma dealership data and what we want
from dealership data is uh
product and we also want dealership
data dot order Ting prob be the field
name come up from dealership data
join customer data to dealership
data on what terms so order ID is common
between customer data and Order data
right so we want order ID equals to
order ID but it will be confusing so
what we can do is join customer data on
customer data. order ID and dealership
data. order ID
right and we will also use a we Clause
we product
dealership.
product like again the same statement
which is here there you go now we are
selecting order ID from dealership Data
customer name from customer data and
product name from dealership data from
the table dealership data join customer
data table on customer data. ID is
equals to dealership data. ID which is
the order ID where dealership data.
product right the product details are in
dealership data table and the product is
like anything before exit anything after
exit because we want the details only
for X8 the customers who bought X8 right
now let's run this query and there you
go so these are the customers who bought
X8 so we have about 21 29 9 results 29
members are the premium customers who
got this premium vehicle X8 series now
that's how you can use joints in a SQL
table SQL data query and so far we have
covered joins we have covered case we
have covered pattern matching we have
covered we Clause group byy order bu and
U select and few others so we have also
made a complete documentation out of it
we now know how to create create a
schema how to import data and few
protocols to follow when you're
importing data like uh using an
underscore and we also have covered
alter table if you have some mistakes in
your column name how to alter the name
of that column right so these are the
fundamentals uh that you can know about
SQL and also some advanced concepts like
case and joints that you can know about
SQL so um so far we have covered
everything that you must know for a
beginner and also we have covered
something if you're an advanced level
SQL Developer it's like a brushing up
tutorial for you how to use some Clauses
like group by autoby and how to use
cases how to use joints right and that
calls for the end of this tutorial on
SQL data analysis and if you have any
queries regarding any of the topics
covered in this session or if you
