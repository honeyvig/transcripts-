and it needs continuous discovery and
development

product management is managing the
process of the product throughout the
life cycle from strategizing to design
and development to branding of the

feedback and finalizing the price of the
product
the product management depends on the
organizational structure and size of the
company the management can vary from
company to company depending upon the
organizational relationships with the
industries
this also looks after the branding and
launching of the product developed by
the company

management

resources required for the product
relevant the product must be appropriate
as per the product management goals

now let us move ahead and understand
what is project management
project management is defined as the
process of planning and organizing the
resources of the company to complete a
specific task
project management plays the same roles
irrespective of the belonging industry
it is a role that looks after the
specific product of an organization
the main objective of project management
is to determine the goals and objective
of the project
it also creates a quality assurance
check to ensure the standards of the
project
it is the approach of applying skills
and technique to complete a project as
per the customer's requirement
it also helps to get the predictable
project planning and execution process
the primary constraint of project
management are time scope quality and
cost
to understand more about project
management let us talk goals of project
management
the primary goals of project management
are
to optimize distributed potential
intakes to finish the project on time
to manage the performance of the team
to manage the proper communication and
coordination in the team
to achieve the goal and objective of the
project within the given time period
to meet the customer's requirement and
make them happy
let us move further and have a look
lifecycle of product management
so the life cycle of product management
has
product framing
this phase involves creating a visions
identifying problems and defining the
success of the product
the next phase is research
research means learn from the people
about the need and the values of the
product
the next phase is design
in this phase the team synthesizes
versions ideas and research into the
prototype of the product
the next phase is plotting
plotting means testing the solution in
the real time with real people
then the product is launched into the
market
launching means to send your product
into the y and let it flourish
in the last phase when the product is
launched into the market it is important
to do some measurements
measurements means using matrices and
data to measure the success of the
product and plan the improvements
now let us learn the life cycle of
project management
the life cycle of project management has
following phases
the first phase is initiating
initiating is the first phase of project
management where the management is
initiated by determining the visions of
the project
the next phase of project management is
planning
this phase involves planning for the
project by creating roadmaps for it
this phases also communicate roles and
responsibility with the teammates and
assemble the workflow
the next phase is executing
this is the phase where execution of
major part of the project is done
the execution phase holds on following
face scope
plan roles communication and project
required tools
the next phase is monitoring and control
this phase happens in pair with the
execution phase as both the phases occur
at the same time
as the team starts the execution of the
plan the tasks are constantly being
monitored by the managers
the last phase of project management is
closing
once the project is completed it is
delivered to the customers by
communicating with the stakeholders
once the project is delivered to the
customers the resources are allocated to
another project
in this stage the final project is
evaluated and the team finally moves on
to the other project
now let us understand the difference
between product management and project
management
the product management deals with the
planning of
the product plotting production and
branding of the product
whereas the project management deals
with the process of applying techniques
knowledge and skills to complete a
particular project
the main focus of product management is
to build up the value of the product
on the other hand project management
focuses on the breaking down of the
efforts and working with multiple
functional tasks
the product manager must be good at
market research strategic thinking and
business service whereas a project
manager must be good at planning and
budget organizing
product management leads to the external
market operations whereas project
management leads to the management of
internal operations of an organization
product management sets a trajectory for
the product by creating visions and
goals for it
on the other hand project management
brings this visions and goals into the
reality by working on the projects to
develop the product
product management focuses on a broader
view and manage the product till its
complete success
since a project has an end date the
project management focuses to deliver
the project on time
and once the project is delivered it is
no longer managed by the team
product management brings the idea
related to the product into the
marketplace
but project management is a role of
using specific skills and knowledge to
deliver a valuable service
product management is all about
developing a new product or enhancing an
existing one whereas project management
is all about applying techniques and
approaches to achieve a goal or intent
to know what to choose between product
management and project management you
must know what are the skills that are
required to start your career as a
product manager or as a project manager
so
let us move further and understand what
are the skills that are required to be a
product
manager a product manager must be good
at strategic thinking
leadership skill
time management
empathy skills communication skills
analytical skills and presentation
skills
the average salary of a product manager
is approximately 10 lakhs in india
whereas it is 90 000 dollars for a
fresher
to one lakh sixty thousand dollars for
an experienced person in use
on the other hand
operators have a good knowledge of
project management methodologies for
example waterfall agile scrum prince2
etc he must be good at risk management
and have some basic knowledge of project
management tools
