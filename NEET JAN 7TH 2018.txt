yeah hi everyone I hope many of you guys
are waiting for this video but I don't
want to eat much of your time because
this time is very very valuable time so
I just want to finish the things of Max
I'll just I'll just do the things within
5 minutes okay so of course tomorrow is
the study of our life as we are working
from past one year for this day to be
the best here for life right so it's
almost like before 7th and after 7th
like Jan 7th is a deciding factor so I
just want to discuss about four
important aspects regarding tomorrow's
examination so you have half a day right
so your examination is going to start at
3 o clock so what you need to do at 3 o
clock previously it used to be at M so
traveling exposure things like there is
no necessary gap for the brain to think
all right so by the time you start
thinking you will be in the examination
hall previously but the strategy now is
going to be totally different so you're
going to have your break first you are
going to have your lunch and then you
are going to enter the hall that's going
to be at 3 to 6 so it's going to be a
different strategy rather than the
strategy which we used to follow blindly
from past few years so your exam is at 3
right so 3 to 6 so before 3 what you
need to do I mean there are few people
giving different different idea on this
might but my ideology is like majority
of the questions what you are going to
encounter are memory based questions so
nothing wrong you can you can read this
stuff nothing nothing wrong you can you
can read the stuff but make sure at
least like one over before the
examination of all you need to enter the
examination hall right so before that
one hour before that I want you guys to
close the books and throw the book
survey right so until that means in and
around twelve up to one probably you
need to close at one 12:00 12:30 ok
close your books off so your target time
is
until 12:30 do whatever you want make
sure it should increase your confidence
cells don't don't open a new question
mapper and don't solve and don't
evaluate yourself which is going to
decrease your confidence levels just
probably concentrate on a single lineups
rather than going with XYZ single errors
question question also try to revise as
much as stuff as possible and try to
move as many pages as possible and try
to cover as many subjects as possible
right so this is what you are going to
do tomorrow and most of the stuff what
you are going to do is to increase your
confidence levels this is the topic one
that I am planning to do so topic one is
done so next one is topic to topic do is
how many questions you how to attempt
okay different strategy for aims and
different strategy for need don't go for
a parallel strategy because aims is like
do or die if you get a rank B if you get
a rank below 5 or 10 you will be in if
anything that whether it is 11 or
whether it is 111 or whether it is
thousand level you are out so further it
is very easy to take more risks more
more number of attempts but the need
strategy is totally different so what
you mean like how many questions you
have to attempt okay if the paper is too
easy and if you know everything if you
know 240 out of 240 attempt 239 and come
back because once the scores are tied
once the scores are tied then the next
thing what the need people are going to
see is the number of questions that you
have attempted okay two people getting
same score right somewhere around 850
850 and the number of questions
attempted are less in the second
individual he is going to get a better
rank rather than the first individual so
so if it is like you're planning to
attempt to forty of 240 because if you
know everything in 240 leave one
question attempt 239 and come back this
is the blind strategy 240 of 240 no one
can so how many you have to attempt
few people said 2:23 we will say 2:10
few men to say 2:30 and few men tested
2:35 I don't know how this strategy is
aims okay a predetermined strategy may
or may not but neat it's not going to be
like that so it's totally dependent upon
your your way of analysis in the
examination okay for example in a
question if you are able to eliminate
three options you are done you are going
to end up with right answer so no issue
you have to go for that question if you
are able to eliminate two options
definitely go for that question
if you are able to eliminate one option
you just you just you just you just see
how many questions are there where you
can invent only one option you need to
make a mark so this one option questions
are going to give you an idea about the
difficulty index of the paper if they
are too high the paper is difficult if
they're too low the paper can the paper
is easy and this difficulty index is
only for you not for the person who is
sitting beside you it's only for you
make a note it is only for you okay and
the next thing where you are not able to
eliminate leave such questions so must
new questions are where you are not able
to eliminate and you need to think
whether you have to go for these
questions or not
variable to eliminate two options just
go for those questions and always keep
keep a note that there is a strategy
that always which you which which hits
the first is is the right answer so if
you are able to eliminate one or two
options and if something hits in your
brain go for that and the second thing
is if something hits in your brain first
but after thinking for twice or thrice
you're able to church okay this is for
sure right answer first sure guarantee
for sure you can change your option
means even if something hits first
if you're sure that this is going to man
said you can go for that if you are not
sure among the rest of the options okay
can be these these third that go for the
first option what hits your brain first
go for that I hope this this is very
clear right so the number of questions
attempted is going to be dependent upon
the difficulty index one option
eliminated and difficulty index of zero
option eliminated so basing upon which
you have to decide in the exam that how
many questions you have to eliminate not
blindly 240 not blind a 235 not blindly
230 or somewhere around 220 is a
generalized statement that is given by
many mentors but it's not going to work
for the need because need is totally
illogical based exam where you need to
solve huge number of MCQs in a very
limited duration of time so next one is
time management right so that's that's
an important and how many rounds you
have to do aims and XYZ previous apcs
okay three rounds but now need it's just
two rounds because you can't spend more
than forty 45 seconds for every question
so it's very difficult to come back read
the same question go through the
question go through the options it's
very very difficult so if you find any
question more than two lines probably
more than three lines or if you feel
that okay I need I should read this
question twice or thrice to understand
for example like case discussion
questions where the question is to to to
to lengthy so such questions don't read
at all leave it leave in the first round
just go for the first round single
liners two lines max if it is crossing
three lines just leave it don't read
don't at all touch come back and you can
touch and once you are going for the
single line it's a double - don't don't
don't decide I think I'll come back and
I'll go and I'll read no coming back and
know nothing business like that because
it's going to be just 40 45 seconds you
will not have that lap of time it's very
difficult for you to manage the time so
there is no second option whatever you
want just keep and more if by mistake
you are left off with so much time then
you can have a
decent revision but it's all like okay
I'll decide this first answer is this
but I want to I want some time I will
decide in a second around what whether
to go for this sort of no no such
businesses in the need so it's going to
be two rounds in the first round you are
going to solve all the questions
majority of them were single liners
double liners and Landy questions you
are going to solve in the second round
and probably these lengthy questions may
also include the category like the
questions where you are able to
eliminate one option or the questions
where you are able telnet where you are
not able to eliminate options so such
questions can encounter in the second
routes where you can decide and where
you can understand and go ahead so this
is what the strategy number three and
strategy number four is the confidence
levels don't and attain anything that's
going to decrease your confidence levels
until you enter the examination hall so
this is very strict mode that we are
boosting you from the day one of MDS
from for all these strategies like what
to do before the exam how many questions
that you have to attempt to make to
minimize the negative marking that's
going to have a huge effect on your rank
and the number of rounds and the
confidence levels all these things we
are just putting every day as an
incremental way so I hope the things are
very fine the exam will be very cool
thing is you have to be cool this is
this is something that's going to decide
your life may not be a huge thing but
definitely it is going to decide your
life directly or indirectly so I want
you guys to give the most priority
importance for this at least tomorrow
keep your brain free it's all you that
you can control okay don't talk with too
many people don't talk with too many
strategies don't don't don't take too
many strategies into consideration just
if you trust someone just go ahead right
so have a faith whether it whether it's
like if you if you have a faith oh my
god
go ahead if you have a faith on your
parents go ahead if you have a faith on
your mentor go ahead whatever like if
you have a faith just go ahead talk to
them I mean it's not a top misdirect on
a phone or something explains
just disclose your eyes and talk with
them okay this is what my show this is
what just-just-just talk with your self
in fact okay the best mentor for you is
definitely you talk with your self okay
this is what my strategy this is what
definitely in the first and second want
like 10 to 20 minutes once you open the
pepper things you feel like make sure
that other things are just going out so
once it is like 20 minutes crossed or 15
minutes crossed the brain will settle
down it just closed for every question
please because once your brain settle
down you are going to do some magics in
the exam so just give some time to your
brain to settle down close your eyes
talk with your brain come on calm down
you have to do you have to do these
three of us or something like a cold a
nervous for your life so they are going
to decide everything every simple thing
so keep an eye
talk with your brain whenever you're
feeling low confident just talk with
your brain and don't decide okay
this is going to be the highest score of
the rapper and I will be like this I may
not be in the competition don't ever
keep a strategy while you're solving the
exam conquer so I am very sure I'm very
sure what can be the difficulty index of
the paper tomorrow what can be it can be
very hard it can be very easy it can be
anything
you are going to stand in the top it's
about the rank that is more important
note about the score so don't judge okay
these many questions I have attempted
this is what my level is because
majority of us like we used to solve
okay keep dekes okay 1 2 3 4 somewhere
around like 240 I have solved 160
questions you know where I am the
competition I am out so don't do that
because you may be in the halfway of
exam and if your strategical levels go
on the negative side it's definitely
going to hurt your score once the result
is out because definitely you will be in
the top but you spoil the exam one or
two questions so very conscious don't
don't like if you feel that paper is
tough if you peel the paper is hard it
is hard for everyone it is hard
Universal me and I am giving a note that
definitely I am Bria's conquer students
will perform better even in the hard
paper so for example if the highest
score is 1/6
tea was on the day of result of two to
40 definitely you will or anyone in the
group filled at this one sixty if the
highest score is to twenty out of two
forty at least one person for sure is
going to hit this goal so far sure you
will be something best even the paper is
worst even the paper is easy so if you
feel that the paper is worst
it is worse for everyone so everyone is
playing in the same ground whether the
ground favors whether the ground
unfairest
someone will be topper someone will get
GD sees the number of Jesus will not
change if the paper is tough the number
of geniuses will not increase if the
paper is easy so simple logic you have
to ground is same you have to play at
your best so the strategy is very simple
don't don't expect something easy to
come easy if it is easy it will be easy
for everyone pray that heart it should
be hard and make sure you should give
your best so that's all and the booster
doses for tomorrow's exam will be in the
groove itself I want you guys to carry
your phones
keep your headset down before you enter
your examination hall I want you to hear
the booster doses that's going to give
in the group for about five minutes
duration so once you're done with the
booster doses you need to enter the
examination hall once you enter the
examination hall you are going to have
at least like 1 hour or 45 minutes lap
don't don't don't don't do anything
abnormal and don't get anything don't
get panic basically ok you can just give
a random smile to everyone keep your
heart calm and just talk to your brain
just talk to your brain close your eyes
talk to your brain talk to your brain
and make your brain stabilized so that's
what you are going to do and once you
start the paper once you're about to
start the paper I want you to recap this
booster doses which you are going to
hear before you enter the examination
Hall all the best now you all we are
being working from past more than 365
days sleepless nights by working
together
definitely we are going to hit the best
on seventh and we are going to start the
best among India on Jan 31st all the
best keep working guys signing off
