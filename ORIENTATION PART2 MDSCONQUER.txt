yeah hi everyone I'm back here to go
with the part 2 of orientation so before
we start any topic before we go into any
topic okay we learn something related to
the history we should learn something
related to the background of that and
what your senior super seniors have done
it okay so what is difference between
your super senior and sweet and you've
seen here when compared to you and what
modifications that you have to do in
your preparation to make your
preparation better why I am stressing
super senior and super senior is because
they have underwent the same situation
like the same departments in which you
were posted and the same teachers and
the same background and the same sort of
positive energy around you okay so
that's just a comparison like you need
to get updated when when compared to
your senior and super senior to have a
better preparation so further I'm just
going to discuss about few backgrounders
history that you have to know before you
start the proceedings for the
preparation one is I put the number of
dental colleges or the dental college
seats that are there in India it is
somewhere around 250 to 270 seats are
there which includes everything which
includes categories which includes OBC
which includes sc/st and open category
okay so coming to the number of state
government dental college seeds that are
available it varies from state to state
okay but when you exclude few states
like Maharashtra Karnataka and few other
okay few other the number of state
government dental college seats are very
very less in most of the states so my
solution is always target for all
India's you don't have a target keep a
target for the state's it okay first
target for all India if you miss all
India by a chance then we can think of
the state because the rank is same for
both right you're just writing single
exam that is neat exam so the targeting
is almost same so why to bother about
state initially just target for your or
India then we will think about the state
depending upon your
situation and you're ranked the next
course is the best cutoff to get all
India's UDC last year it is somewhere
around 300 all India so if we get 300
all India ranked you will get GDC I'm
not sure about the department to get a
good department in a very good call as
mandatory rank should be somewhere
around 120 out maximum 150 but even if
you end up at 3 310 you will get gbc's
with a good stipend but Department you
need to get compromised so what is the
best cutoff to get state GDC so or India
is 300 so state may extend up to 400
call India and most of the states they
end up at for maximum few states they
extend up to 500 to 800 it depends upon
the competition of the people in your
particular state and depends upon the
number of government dental colleges as
well as dental college seats that are
available in your particular state and I
hope now some so much of Dentistry is
like showing fantasy or passion towards
army cops because Army Corp selections
the number of intakes of the vacancies
has all has increased a slight because
previously it used to be somewhere under
35 to 30 or 40 but now recent 2019
session like which was done three months
back the intake was increased to 60 so
so many of the crowd they're showing
positiveness towards this but make sure
it has two parts that is part 1 and part
2 part 1 is same that is need you need
to get a good new drink and if you are
in a meritless than you have to attend
an interview ok so that is part 2 so it
is divided into part 1 and part 2 and
the best cut of rank should not be more
than 1200 or India to be in the part 1
to clear the part 1 and get into part 2
and part 2 interview and everything will
plan the second half but basically now
the full focus even if you are targeting
for army cops is neat you need to crack
a NEET ranked at least below 1200 to be
in the safe margin for the second round
of army cops next course I am just going
to talk about the few best ranks
the last three years of need in a few
states
okay so exploring few states like
Maharashtra like Tamilnadu like Kerala
like Pondicherry few few states
excluding few States most of the states
they don't have great ranks of the don't
end up with great ranks even Jammu and
Kashmir also we can seek very good ranks
in the last two years of need but
excluding these three or four areas with
the number of people who are preparing
for the entrance are more the reason why
they have great ranks is they have more
crowd who write exam and second reason
is they're very serious about the
preparation they're very serious and
very confident and they're very
hard-working
compared to other states okay so I'm
just going to talk about the best ranks
in the last three years of need for
Android is all India third rank is the
best rank until now and that is for an
inter okay
so that's good and coming to the
Telangana the best rank until now is 68
All India okay and that is for a
repeater and if you take Jammu Jammu and
Kashmir the best rank is fourth All
India okay and if you take Tamilnadu
they got they got first Kerala okay they
got in the top five regularly okay and
if you take Pondicherry they got first
again a few areas of North Indian sides
they got single digits but not as
frequent as the four states that I
mentioned okay Maharashtra they were in
the top 10 list okay so these are the
ten a to best friends for a particular
state in the last three years of meat
and more than 50 percentage of Gd C's
that are occupied by three states those
three states means I'm just talking
about the states where the ranks they're
getting good ranks and great ranks that
is that is one is one is Tamilnadu
second one is Kerala and Maharashtra and
last but not the least they are not
included in the pool but you can see a
decent crowd getting great ranks from
Jammu and Kashmir
okay these are the areas where we can
see a plenty of rank holders occupying
more than 50 percentage of GD Z's in the
last three years why they get more G
disease the first reason is more number
of dental colleges they have because
they have more students okay more number
of dental colleges if you take if take
Maharashtra Maharashtra has 31 dental
colleges has 25 plus Kerala has little
less okay somewhere around 18 to 20 odd
okay they have very very less okay but
they got good ranks and the reason the
first reason is number of colleges and
second reason is the very serious
towards the preparation seriousness is
very very important and I feel these
three or four category of State people
they are very serious towards the
preparation and the best reason can they
want to they want to get into GD C's
they want to get into good colleges good
departments that's one and the second
one even if you want to join a private
college in these states JK you don't
have any private college having MDS so
it is mandatory that a JK student if
they want to do MDS the first option is
to get into GDC because they have only
ten seats and the second option what is
left out is they have to come anywhere
you know other other states and they
have to join for any mostly for an non
conveniens you do the pay I mean the
fees is very very high so they dedicated
is study and they get into the GDC
because even eleventh ranker in the
state will not or mostly will not get a
GDC in Jammu and Kashmir so they know
the value and they work hard from the
table and if you see coming out of
Kerala and Maharaja tall so most of the
once they're done with the government
and here colleges they go for private
colleges but it is not feasible for
every individual because I was stressing
in the part one that most of us most of
the people who are in the dentistry are
above you know middle class where it is
difficult for a parent to manage 6 to 8
lakhs per year so if they want to study
MDS more than 60 percentage of the crowd
the target is only government until
college they keep on repeating the exam
with lots of dedication and
finally of course they will be
successful so that's the particular
reason these are the four or five
reasons listed according to me okay
according to me why they are getting the
better ranks or good ranks when compared
to other state people is I can predict
this is the only reason but if you if
you I mean like if you take these people
into consideration and if we work in a
similar way with more seriousness as an
ingredient in your preparation I think
it is easily reachable these trends this
statistics can be easily modified in a
very very short duration of time so
coming to the plan of MDS concur so my
plan is totally different and the
approach is completely smart and what I
believe is nowadays people are doing
hard work okay previously if you take 10
years or 15 years back the very few
people who used to do hard work but now
hard work is normal atom captions for
everyone now what makes difference is
you're smart
smart work is going to make a difference
and MDS conquer is going to add that
smartness
to your preparation okay so hard work is
yours and smartness I'm going to add a
combination of hard work and smart work
will definitely healed a greater result
with this energy to do it and I hope and
I trust this because this is what we are
doing from the past five years and we
are having a wonderful results in
respective to the meet anywhere
particularly intense dominating the
field in in a particular zone okay and
that that is only because of the
smartness that is added to their
preparation so coming to the rough plan
of action okay so first I will be
talking about the plan of action so if
the first important thing is about
priorities how priority is your
preparation I can give just a best
example as most of your interns or
repeaters you may have some events you
may
have some vegan parties so you have two
options here a weekend party and a grand
exam or an offline class which is more
prior to you is going to decide your
success okay
so second one is setting goals I have
discussed already about setting goals
your goal should always be one don't
don't move from here to there
and it should always be static it should
not move so that you you'll be having
the best confidence to heat it at your
best and third one is your attitude
towards the preparation so previously
most of us we have we are done with the
first year second year third and the
final year more than 95% is the people
why they have done is because of the
pressure or the cutoff dates or are the
targets that are kept by the hedge
bodies or the staff people but
preparation is not like that no one is
going to force you to do this or do that
it's you how to do this because
preparation yields a result and that
result will be enjoyed by you throughout
your life and your family previously if
you need to finish a target in the
college like if you need to do a case or
if you need to present something or if
you need to finish your assignments or
anything it's just by a pressure maybe
not from your heart 100% is from your
heart whereas preparation should be
hundred percent is from your heart then
only you can achieve the best success in
this point to remember new things to be
learned so there are lots of new things
that you are going to learn from today
and you need to learn new things and you
need to revise the whole things you
already done lots of dentistry first
year second year third year and the
final year for years of dentistry so you
have learned so much you have to revise
them in the right way and you need to
learn new things so you need to carry
the new subject as well as the revision
of old subject hand-in-hand and you need
to move towards the preparation so these
five things are very very important to
be successful in any sort of competitive
entrance examination at this level
levan them told standard the strategy is
different ok now the strategy is
different because we are mature now we
know what we are doing we have so many
responsibilities ok
mental physical and
emotional imbalance okay and you have
some responsibility towards your family
better living than one standard you
don't have any responsibilities so there
are lots of things that are going to
happen with you because you are more
mature now okay so that is more
important balancing these things is all
about success so coming to the like the
rough rough schedule of MDS conquer okay
so it I mean the 14 months shuttle may
vary from individual to individual
because few people they start
immediately on the day one of their
internship few people they take time of
one or two months few people they may
take more time few people they start in
last six months of preparation last
three months of preparation last two
months of preparation okay we don't
bother about that but whoever starts
first they go first but even I have I
have some results where people who have
studied for last three months or last
six months they also got bank better
ranks they've got GD Z's and everything
can happen any magic can happen in the
examination hall or within you if you
have will to crack the things in a
possible time or in a limited time okay
so I'm going to give a rough schedule
that I am planning to go for three to
four rounds of revision okay probably it
may be considered as test mode where all
your basics will be brushed one day more
and the next next upcoming things can be
done t20 mode is for three months and
final boy it's a rough rough ideology
like how we approach the things how we
deal the pins okay so it may be at any
time you can be part of MBAs conquered
but make sure on the day from the day
when you are going to be part of this or
when you are planning to start the
preparation okay make sure you try to
give your best from that day to that
will in the date of example if you do
this you will be successful so the next
comes is the examinations that you are
eligible for as an intern okay so I feel
number Eames is the first exam that you
are going to give and PGA December 2020
I mean it's not for MDS and even if if
you are planning to give this exam I
think it will be like it may sync with
your need exam which is a main exam I
don't
I don't want you guys to get disturbed
with with this PJ exam so the second
exam that you are going to give is neat
2020 and mostly we will wind up the
things by need 2020 and enjoy the four
or five months before you get into the
college so this is the last rough
blueprint of aims that I am going to
discuss in the third part of orientation
thank you all be positive para dating
