hey everyone i welcome you all to
another session by simply learn in this
session we will learn about typescript
with node.js
typescript has grown in popularity among
javascript programmers
typescript will aid you in development
process ensuring that you are free of
bugs and small errors
it detects mistakes during compilation
and prior to the execution of code
typescript offers you a head start on
identifying and correcting runtime
issues
typescript provide faster development
especially if you are working on large
application
so let's get started with typescript
with node.js but before we begin make
sure you have subscribed to our youtube
channel and clicked on the bell icon so
you never miss an update from simply
learn
so we'll first look at what is
typescript
typescript is an object oriented and
strongly typed programming language
which is a superset of javascript
typescript was designed by anders
hegelsberg at microsoft
the limitations of javascript for
developing large-scale applications at
microsoft and among its external
customers led to the creation of
typescript
due to the difficulty of working with
complicated javascript code there was a
demand for custom tooling to make
development of javascript components
easier
typescript code is converted to
javascript which can be executed
anywhere
javascript is supported in a browser on
node.js or any other application
typescript is a javascript with some
additional features to support a more
robust interaction with your editor
typescript adds additional syntax to
javascript
typescript is a scripting language that
understands javascript and uses type
inference to provide powerful
capabilities with additional code
what is node.js
node.js is an open source server-side
execution platform for javascript code
node.js is a javascript runtime based on
the version 8 javascript engine from
chrome
node is an asynchronous event-driven
javascript runtime for building scalable
network applications
although node.js is excellent for
developing server-side apps it lacks
several current features such as type
checking it can also be difficult to
manage a node.js code base
node is commonly used for real-time
applications like chat
news feeds and web push notifications
because it allows for a persistent
connection from the browser to the
server
the current coding method such as static
typing and type checking are supported
by typescript
it's designed to create complex and high
level applications that's why having
typescript as a primary language
for supporting node.js capabilities
would be idle
this also allows us to develop server
side apps with rigorous type checking
avoiding run type errors and other
typescript benefits while maximizing
node.js capabilities
now let us see how to set up the
development environment for typescript
with node.js
the prerequisites are we need to have
typescript installed in our device and
node.js
to install node.js go to the official
website
go to
nodejs.org and go to downloads
so here you can see
we have node.js for different browsers
for windows mac os
and source code
so go to windows if you have windows pc
and click on install
click on windows and here you can see it
is getting installed since i have
already installed in my device i'll
cancel it
so once you have installed go to the
command prompt
and just enter
node.v to check if node is installed
properly
so here you can see the node is
installed in my
system
to install typescript just run the
command npm
node package manager
install
globally
typescript
run this command and typescript will be
installed since i have already installed
typescript in my device
we'll cancel this so once you have
installed typescript to check if
typescript is installed or not to see if
the compiler is installed just run the
command
typescript compiler space
version
here you can see it will show the
version of typescript compiler
so now that we have installed both
typescript and
node.js let's see
our example program for typescript with
node.js
so let's jump into visual studio code
one more prerequisite is we need to have
visual studio code installed
so create a new folder and create a new
project
so we'll run an example program we'll
create a function
we'll write a program to add two numbers
so sum
number one
comma number two
will return number one and number two
console.log
we'll call the function sum
and we'll provide the arguments
so we'll provide the value
9 comma
5
so let's save
and run this program
first we'll run
typescript.cmd
type.ts command
then we'll hit that
then we'll run node and the file name
here you can see
it's showing the value showing the
output as 49 plus 5 the sum of 9 plus 5
is 40. so we'll delete this
and
write another program
to show a hello message or a welcome
message
so we'll create a function
we'll name the function as welcome
message
and will return
that user
is equal to
simply learn
console log
we'll call the function
welcome
and pass
so here we go we'll save this and check
whether we have an error
so here we go showing welcome to simply
learn
so with that we have reached the end of
this video thank you so much for being
here keep learning and stay tuned to
simply
