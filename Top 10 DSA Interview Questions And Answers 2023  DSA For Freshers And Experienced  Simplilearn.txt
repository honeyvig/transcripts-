hey guys welcome to Simply learn today
we'll be learning the top 10 DSA
interview questions and answers and
while we are at it please leave us a
like if you find our content helpful and
a sub to the channel would be
appreciated so without any further delay
let's get started
and the top 10 question is
consider a text file interrupted by a
perk and all the text has been reversed
due to this bug so which data structure
would you choose to implement a program
to revert the text file to its original
the solution is stack data structure
let's look at the problem we must read
an existing element by element in
reverse order sounds something like last
to first as we all know stack follows
first in last out principle in order to
reverse a string we must create an empty
stack to push all the string characters
one by one
and then what about the character one
after the another
so once performing the pop operations on
a string all the string characters would
be reversed and form into the original
string
now let's try to implement the program
using stack data structure
so as you can see here we have a reverse
function which is declared and
going to the function here we have a
structure of Stack where we have top
sides and array variables
and we have a function called structure
creation sorry stack creation
so first we are allocating memory to a
stack using mlog function and this size
is assigned to stack of size and
initially stack of top is equal to -1
and then allocating memory to the stack
of array
then coming to is full function where it
checks whether the stack is full so if
we'll return stack of top is equal to
stack of size -1 and checking if the
stack is empty that is is empty written
stack of top is equal to -1
and then coming to the push function
which is used to insert the item into
the stack so it checks if is full if the
stack is full of written where the item
is assigned to stack of top
and pop to delete the item from a stack
so it checks it is empty then return
intimate as written stack of array that
is of stack of top minus minus that
means stack is empty
is decrementing a top by -1 and then
coming to the reverse function here we
have string length of string which is
assigned to n and then calling this
stack creation function to create an
empty stack and from I is equal to 0 to
n
push all the stack or whatever is there
in the string of I is pushed to the
stack and for I is equal to 0 to I less
than n Pop All the
items to back to this string of I and
then coming to the main function here we
have a reverse string
and here
we are reversing a string so we are
calling the reverse function which is
this and it tries to reverse this string
and get back to its original form
so it prints the reverse string
so let's try to execute it
so as you can see here reverse string is
simply long
the top ninth question is
consider you have been assigned a task a
task in which you are given an array of
numbers to be arranged in ascending
order so with sorting algorithm would
you choose to place the numbers most
efficiently
and the solution is quick sort algorithm
quicksort algorithm helps research the
information faster than any other
sorting algorithm it is widely used to
sort the elements faster also memory
storage is utilized efficiently since no
additional storage is required if the
array size is small then the quick sort
algorithm Works faster to sort the
elements
so now let's consider array of elements
3 5 2 4 and 1 and let the pivot element
be 3.
so
why are we taking private as a 3 because
the left hand side element is greater
than the right hand side element so if
the right side element is lesser than
the pivot element
then swap out the elements
next comparing the next left element
with a pivot element and it checks
whether 5 is lesser than the element 3.
so if it's lesser than it will swipe
with each other
similarly comparing the next element to
and since 2 is less than 5 it will
remain in the same position next
comparing the element 4 width 5. again 4
is lesser than 5 so it will remain in
the same position
so now as you can see the left hand side
elements are not at the proper position
so considering the left hand side
elements
we will swap the elements
so here it compiles 1 and 2. since 1 is
less than 2 it will remain in the same
position
next compare 3 and 2 here 3 is greater
than 2 so it will swap out the elements
now let's have a look at the program
implementation
so here as you can see we have a quick
sort algorithm function declaration and
then going to quick sort algorithm
function here we have array of size 24
into left and into right so initializing
the variables i j p and temp so if left
is lesser than right then assign the
left element to P that is Pivot element
and
assign all the left element to I and
right element to J so while I lesser
than J while array of I lesser or equal
to array of p and I less than right then
increment I by 1. while array of J is
greater than array of P then decrement J
by 1. so if I is lesser than J then we
are doing swap so we are swapping the
elements that means array of I is given
to the or temp variable and whatever is
there in Array of J is assigned to array
of I and the temp variable is assigned
to array of J and then changing the p
that means the array of p is assigned
are stored in temp variable and whatever
is there in Array of J is given to RFP
and whatever is then temp is given to
array of J and then calling the quick
sort orbital
so coming to the main function here we
have I count and array of size 25.
so it's first asking to enter the number
of elements so suppose you want to enter
five elements to arrange in the
ascending order then enter 5. so once
you enter 5 it will ask to enter one
element by element
so from 0 to count it will last one by
one
so then we are calling the quick sort
algorithm to sort the elements and then
it will printed elements from I is equal
to 0 to I less than count and we'll sort
the elements one by one so let's execute
the program
so here enter the number of elements so
let's enter 5
and enter the elements one by one five
so we have 2 5 6 3 and 1.
so the elements are sorted one two five
six and Thirty One
of eighth question is
you are given a list of numbers to find
the minimum and maximum numbers
Implement a c program using the
appropriate type of data structure
and the solution is array data structure
the array data structure is used to
store multiple data of the same type
easily allowing random access to an
element using the index number it also
improves performance remarkably as it
stores the element consecutively next
the array use less memory space as there
is no usage of pointer variables
so now let's Implement a program to find
the smallest and largest element
so here we have array of size 50 then
variable i n and
variable to find the largest element and
a variable to find the smallest element
so first enter the number of elements
input the array elements so one after
the other from I is equal to 0 to n it
will take the array element
and initially the largest element and
smallest element is assigned to array of
0.
and then coming to for Loop wherefore I
is equal to 1 till I less than n if area
of I is greater than array of L M uh
sorry large element
then assign array of I to the largest
element
if array of I is lesser than smallest
element then assign array of I to the
smallest element and then print the
smallest element and largest element
so let's execute it
so enter the number of elements let's
enter 5. and input the elements let's
enter two
five
ten
six
one
so as you can see the smallest element
is 1 and the largest element of an
arraylist is 10.
the next top seventh question is
assume you are given a task to store a
set of elements with two conditions
first memory resources drawn should be
conscious second the data structure
should be dynamically stable when new
elements are added or existing elements
are deleted from the data structure
irrespective of the location
and the solution is singly linked list
s are not predefined data structures
they are dynamically programmed data
structures and utilize the memory blocks
from the Heap storage this makes them
available alternative to the array as
the memory needed is judiciously used
also whenever an element is deleted its
memory block will be returned to the hip
in a single linked list we can access
the element easily because of the point
of variable that points to the address
of the next node in the list
so here let's understand the program
implementation so here we have a
structure of a node where we have a data
variable and a pointer variable called
Next PDR
we have a function Declaration of a node
creation node count and print list
so going to the node creation function
here we are creating a new node where we
are allocating memory for it
we have a variable called data and I
so it first checks if node is equal
equal to null then memory cannot be
allocated else enter the data for the
node one so it takes the data
so data is assigned to nodes data part
and initially the node's next pointer is
assigned to null so the node is assigned
to PTR
next for I is equal to 2 to I lesser or
equal to n
which whatever it creates a new node
allocate memory for it and check if new
node is equal to null then memory cannot
be allocated so break is
enter the data for the node
that means the data is assigned to the
new nodes data and in our new notes next
pointer is equal to null and then new
node is assigned to pointers next PTR
and next point is next PTR is assigned
to PTR
then coming back to node count
so this function is used to count the
number of nodes in a list so initially
the count value is equal to zero and we
have a pointer PTR
so point that node is assigned to PTR
while PTR not equal to null increment
count by 1 and PTR next pointer is
assigned to PTR and return the count
next coming to the print list that means
it lists out all the nodes so we have a
pointer and if node is equal equal to
null that means no data found in the
list else the node is assigned to PTR
while it checks the condition PTR not
equal to none then print all the node
data
so ptr's next PTR is assigned to PTR so
now let's try to execute it
so enter the number of nodes so if you
want five nodes so enter the data so let
us enter one two three four and five so
as you can see
the singly linked list elements are one
two three four and five and the total
number of nodes are
five
executing in this session and the
question and answers we are discussing
will be attached in the description box
below so you can have a look at it and
execute the code for a better
understanding and if you face any issues
while executing the programs then please
let us know in the comment section below
and our team of experts will be happier
to resolve all your queries at the
earliest
the top sixth question is
assume you have stored the elements
randomly in the memory that means not
contagious the memory elements are not
stored in adjacent location memory
blocks and suppose you want to remove
the elements from a given position which
type of data structure would you
recommend for such a task considering
minimum traversal to save time
the doubly linked list is the clear
solution as the question clearly
mentions the memory blocks located are
not adjacent now the second puzzle is
about the minimum traversal out of all
the variants in the linked list the
doubly linked list is a variable option
as it has the bi-directional traversal
feature a w linked list allows you to
traversal in both Direction since it
uses two pointers to point to the
address of the previous and next node it
is easy to access the node using the
previous pointer and delete the node
from the list and here we have the
memory representation
so here let's understand the working of
programs implementation
so we have a structure of node and we
have a variable called data and a
pointer variable previous and next
so first coming to the insertion and
beginning so we are inserting the
element so we are creating a new node
and allocating memory using mlog
function and then we are assigning our
data to a new node and the new next part
is holding the head and initially the
new previous is assigned to null so if
head is not equal to null then heads
previous is equal to Nu and Nu is
assigned to hit
then coming to the void insertion at n
so inserting an element at the end of
the list
so here we are creating a new node and
allocating memory to it using m-log
function and the last note is equal to
head that means head is assigned to the
last node and then the new data that
means a new data is assigned to a new
nodes data part and the next is assigned
to none
and we are creating a temporary variable
where it is assigned to Temporary
variable and checks the condition if
head is equal equal to none then is
assigned to new nodes previous part and
new is assigned to that means a new node
is assigned to head written and here we
are using a temporary variable while
temp next is not equal to null then
temporary variable nodes like next part
is assigned to Temp and new is assigned
to attempts next and temp is assigned to
news previous
and coming to insertion at sorry
insertion of the node
so we are specifying the position here
so if previous node is equal equal to
null then the given previous node cannot
be run
again creating a new node and assigning
a value to it and now previous notes
next is assigned to new next and new
node is assigned to previous notes next
the new previous is equal to previous
node so if new new nodes next part is
equal to null then new nodes next next
notes previous is assigned to new
and then coming to the deletion of a
node that means how to delete a node
so first if head is equal equal to null
or node to be deleted is equal equal to
null then return if head is equal equal
to node to be deleted then
not to be deleted next part is assigned
to head
this if condition not to be deleted next
part is not equal to null then assign
node to be deleted previous to node to
be deleted next node previous
and then if node to be deleted previous
is not equal to null then assign node of
next to the node to be deleted previous
notes next and free the node to be
deleted
and this display function will display
all the elements in a list
and then coming to the main function we
are inserting value to a node that is
five two one five and three sorry four
two one five three it print the linked
list element that it display all the
elements and then after deleting an
element so we are deleting a element
heads uh next to next next that means
fourth element and display the head
I also we are displaying the element of
the deletion so let's execute it
so as you can see we have inserted the
elements one two three four and five
into the list so after deleting an
element that is we are deleting the
fourth element
so after deleting fourth element we got
the list is one two three and five
fifth question is
you are given a problem and you need to
devise a solution the task is to build a
job portal website and the problem is
that the portal needs to pick the latest
profile listed on the website so which
data structure could fit in and solve
this puzzle and how
solution to this problem is stag data
structure
we can use stack as it follows last in
first out and the latest profile would
obviously be the last item to get in and
the first item to get out of this stack
in a linear data structure the items in
a stack are stored in the order of the
first in last out or last in first out
so stack performs operations like push
and power where push is used to insert
the item into the stack when a swap is
used to delete the item from the stack
operations like insertion and deletion
of an items are possible only from the
one end of the stack that is on top of
the stack
so this program is to insert items into
the stack and then delete the top item
from the stack so here we have a
structure of stack and we have a
variable called top size and array
we have a function declaration at the
top
then going to the stack creation
so this is stack creation function where
we are creating a stack and allocating
memory to it using analog function and
assign size to the stack of size and
initially stack of top is equal to -1
that means stack is empty and then the
stack of array is assigned that means a
memory is allocated
and written stack then check whether the
stack is full so using is is4 check a
return stack of top is equal to stack of
size minus 1 that means the stack is
full if the stack is empty
then return stack of top is equal to -1
that means stack is empty
then push function is used to insert
item into the stack so it checks if it
is full written else stack of a that
means the item is assigned to the top of
Stack and then pop is used to delete the
item from a stack so it checks if the
stack is empty already empty then
written as
decrement the stack of top by -1
and coming to the main function here we
have we are calling the stack creation
so we create a stack and then push the
items into the stack we are pushing the
item 10 20 and 30. so the last element
to get in is 13 so the first element
will be popped out is 30. so now let's
run the program and see the output
so as you can see
the first element was 30 so it is popped
out
the top fourth question is
given a tray you have to find the prefix
expression of a tree so which order of
traversal would use those
solution is pre-order traversal of a
tree data structure
so basically in pre-order traversal we
Travis a tree from the root note to the
left sub tree
followed by the right substring so it is
a quick way of searching and can easily
get the prefix expression
so as you can see this program is to
perform the pre-order traversal of a
tree data structure so here we have a
structure of a node and we have a data
variable
then we have a pointer to the left node
and right node
first going to the creation of a new
node we are creating a node and
initializing memory for it that means
allocating memory using M lock function
and assigning data to a nodes data part
and initially the nodes left node and
right node is null
then return the node
then coming to display pre-order
function
here it tells how to do the travel so
that is from first from the left node
and then going to the right node so it
checks the condition if node is equal
equal to none then return
and print the node data
so first display pre-order we are
calling the display pre-order function
to display for a left node first and
then the right node so coming to the
main function here we have a root node
values assigned 10
and Roots left node values assign 20 and
root right now right node is assigned
the value 30.
and then put s left notes left node is
assigned 40 and Roots left notes right
node is assigned 50.
next print the pre-order traversal of a
binary tree so calling the display
pre-order function to display all the
nodes
so let's execute it
so as you can see the pre-order
traversal of a binary tree is 10 20 40
50 and then 30 because 30 is the right
time
and uh 10 is the root child
whereas these are the left chart
the top third question is
let's assume that you receive a software
requirement that offers ticket booking
services
your job is to devise a solution that
stores all the booking requests and
response to the request based on the
first come first serve approach which is
the most variable and dynamically stable
data structure
the solution is Q data structure
the queue is a linear data structure
that follows the FIFA order and it also
a dynamically designed data structure
queue follows fifo which stands for
first scene first out or in other words
first come first serve
in queue the elements are inserted from
the back of the queue called NQ
and the elements can be removed from the
front of the queue called DQ
as shown in the pillow diagram
so in this function we have a size of 50
and we have a function called NQ display
and the variables area of size and
initially rare and front is interest to
-1 that means the queue is empty
and next we have a wild condition so we
print for the choice options that is
first is NQ operation
second option is display the queue list
and third operation is exit
and then enter your choice of operations
to perform so it's asking you to enter
the choice so if you enter one case one
that means it calls the enqueue function
uh if you enter case 2 that means it's
calling the display function and in case
the it calls the exit function by
default uh if you print any other option
then it will be it will display
incorrect Choice return 0. so coming to
the NQ function which is used to insert
the item in or element into the queue so
creating a new item
so if rare is equal equal to size of
minus 1 that means the Q is Overflow is
if front is equal equal to minus 1 that
means Q is empty then assigned front is
equal to 0. and it's asking to enter the
element to insert the insert into the
queue
so if you enter the new
item then it will increment to rare by 1
that means rare is equal to red plus 1
so now new item is inserted into the
array I mean list of Q and then coming
to the display function we have the
condition if front is equal equal to -1
that means the queue is empty else
from I is equal to 0 till I laser is
lesser or equal to right it will display
all the array elements
so now let's run the program
so here enter the choice let's enter one
and enter the item 20.
and enter the second choice that is 1
enter the item 13. and now enter two and
as you can see the list of items are 20
and 30.
third second question is
Rahul has a large army he arranges them
in an arbitrary order and everyone is
given an integer ID so now Rahul wants
to add one Army in the picnic now use a
single pointer variable and it should be
possible to traversal in both Direction
Implement a program to solve the problem
statement
and the solution to this problem
statement is circular signaling list
a circular singly linked list is to
perform a reverse table with less memory
uses than a doubly linked list we
require extra memory for the previous
pointer in a doubling list so when we
compare the circular linked list to
where the both single linked list and
developing list we don't find a null in
any of the nodes instead the last note's
next pointer holds the address of the
first node so basically there is only
one point of variable in the Surplus
singly linked list
so in this program
we have a structure of node and then
variable data and we have a single point
pointer variable called next
so to insert to the empty list
we have we are checking the condition if
it is not equal to null then return head
let's create a new node allocate memory
for it and assign a data to the new
nodes data part and new is assigned to
head
and hit is assigned to hits next written
hit
and then insert at beginning so if head
is equal to null written insert to empty
list so again create a new node
allocate memory and assign data to the
new nodes data part and hits next is
assigned to new next and new is assigned
to head next
and return head and coming to the void
display function so it display the list
of elements
so it checks we have a pointer variable
PTR and it checks if head is equal to
null that means the list is empty so it
will return
and then the heads next is assigned to
pointer
and here we are using do while condition
first it prints the data part
so pointer next is assigned to PTR and
then checks the condition y that is
pointer not equal to head of next and
coming to the main function
uh we have assigned null to the Head
and we are inserting element at the
beginning of the list 30 then 40 and 10
so then print listed elements a linked
list elements are and we are calling the
display function so this function will
display all the elements so let's run it
so as you can see the linked list
elements are 10 14 and 30.
the top first question is
given a tree you have to count the
number of nodes in a tree create a
function and try to call the function
inside the same function
and the solution is tree data structure
a tree consists of a root node followed
by Panic node and a child node
so this program is to count the number
of nodes in a tray so here we have a
structure of a node and we have a data
variable and a pointer to left note and
right node
and then coming to creation of a new
node so here we are creating a new node
and allocating memory for it using mlog
function and assign data to a nodes data
part and initially the nodes left node
and nodes a right node are assigned to
null
function to find the left height of a
binary tree so this function is to find
the height of a left height of a binary
tree so initially the height is equal to
0 so while node
incrementing the height by 1
so the notes left node is assigned to
node so return height
and then this function is to find the
right height of the binary tree so again
initially the height is equal to 0 while
a node height increment height by 1
when the nodes a right node is assigned
to node so return the height
next total load so this function is to
count the number of nodes in a binary
tree
so if root is equal equal to none that
means written 0. else we are assigning
left height of a root to the LH and
right height of a root 2 RH
and checking if the left and right
Heights are equal if they are equal that
means a return to the power of height
minus 1.
else we are having a recursive call so
we are calling a
1 plus total node function
plus the total node
coming to the main function here we are
assigning values to the node so root
node is holding a value 10 15 is
assigned to left node 20 is assigned to
Roots right node and 25 is assigned to
Roots left nodes and left node
and we have Roots left notes right node
is equal to 30. and root right snow left
node is having 35 and Roots right notes
right node is having 40. so now
it will print the total number of nodes
in a tree so let's check
so as you can see the total number of
nodes are 7.
so here I have two bonus questions for
you guys please try to find out the
answers and let us know which data
structure would you prefer to solve the
problem statement and the first question
is John has moved to a small village and
likes visiting one of his best friend he
wants to take this shortage route
because he is in hurry to meet the best
friend so now he has decided to take
this shortage path John starts at
intersection 1 and his friend is at
intersection here each Road Links to an
intersection from the start to its
destination point so using which data
structure would you solve this problem
statement
and the second question is let's
consider there is a class of 25 students
and we want to store the grades for each
of their five courses is there a way we
can keep all the information
