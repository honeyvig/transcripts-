hello everyone this is sarvani sisla
third year postgraduate student in the
department of pediatric and preventive
dentistry
from panini institute of dental sciences
today i am here to discuss the process
of physiological route resorption
it is one of the most common terms we
concurrently use at a drop of a hat
while conversing about primary teeth
but the main question here is to what
extent do we understand the actual
process
my motive today here is to throw some
light on this process
in depth
can be understood under few headings
which include
the introduction the key cells involved
in the process
the actual process that occurs in the
primary teeth which present with the
successor
and which present without one
lastly few related articles and summary
coming to the introduction the term
physiology means
the branch that deals with the functions
and activities of life
in short these are those processes which
occur naturally within the body
on the other hand resorption means
destruction or disappearance
generally the mineralized structures of
the teeth are protected
against resorption by the pre-dentine
and the orientoplast within the pulp
cavity and the pre-cementum and the
cemento glass on the root surface
both these layers form a barrier that
prevents resorption
and osteoclasts from adhering or
resolving the unmineralized matrix
because of the inhibitory effects of the
organic pre-cementum and pre-dentine
even in the presence of inflammation an
intact root can be appreciated which is
resistant to resorption
in situations where these protected
structures are damaged or removed
either physiologically or pathologically
multinucleated giant cells that is the
osteoclasts colonize on the root surface
and cause resorption key cells
which include osteoclast class
monocytes and macrophages these cells
are of crucial importance
for the process of resorption to occur
osteoclast is a greek gum where osteos
means bone
and clast means to break it is basically
a type of cell
that breaks down the bone tissue they
are motile and multinucleated
with nuclei ranging from 2 to 12 percent
they are derived from the hematopoietic
cells of monocyte macrophage lineage
with the life span of two weeks they
recruited to the site of injury with the
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
to perform their function osteoclasts
must attach themselves to the bone
surface
they have a ruffled border which helps
them to bind to the matrix adhesion
proteins
and produce the resorption pits called
the house should slack you name
they can be differentiated
histologically by the
immunohistochemical stains
for the tartarate resistant acid
phosphatase
coming to osteoclast formation numerous
cytokines have been shown to regulate
osteoclasts formation and function
out of all of them these are the five
important cytokines
the first three that is the opg rankle
and rank
will be dealt in detail in the later
part of the presentation but for now
rankil and rank are two important
cytokines which positively regulate the
osteoclastogenesis
leading to the increased expression of
new osteoclasts eventually increasing
the resorption rate
while on contrary opg negatively affects
this process
leading to decreased expression of new
osteoclasts
m csf is a macrophage colony stimulating
factor
while cfms is its receptor coming to the
process
once the osteoclast precursor cell is
formed from the
hematopoietic linear cells they express
uh colony stimulating factor receptors
as well as
rank these uh this cfms and rank
bind to the stromal or the osteoblastic
cells eventually leading to the
expression of
rankine opg and macrophage colony
stimulating factor
this process is mediated by a few
factors such as
a parathyroid hormone vitamin d
interleukin 1 6 11
and thermo necrosis factor at this stage
if the expression of rankine is greater
than opg
the osteoclasts are formed leading to
the increased bond absorption
while uh in contrary if the stomach
cells produce opg in greater amounts
when compared to that of the rankine
the opg binds to the available ranking
and the new osteoclast formation is
prevented
also in cases of inflammation there is
uh increased
activation of p lymphocytes which
produce both membrane bound and free
rankl leading to the osteoclast mediated
bone resorption
also in cases of inflammation when there
is increased expression of interlocan
one and tnf alpha
these two factors directly stimulate the
osteoclast precursor cells to get
converted into osteoclast
increasing the rate of resorption
coming to the functional elements of
fully differentiated osteoclast
generally the osteoclasts attach the
bone via podosomes which
contain v3 integral podosomes are motile
organelles of few cells such as
osteoclasts and certain immune cells
while integrin is a transmembrane
protein which is involved in the
adhesion of cells
basically the complex of cordosomes
allows the osteoclast to attach itself
to the bone
inside the cell the h plus ions are
produced by the carbonic anhydrase ii
enzyme these h plus ions are transported
to the resorption site
via the h-plus atps pump this h-plus
atps pump
coupled with the chloride channel
maintains the trans-membrane neutrality
also there is excessive production of
bicarbonate
by the carbonic anhydrase to enzyme this
bicarbonate is exchanged passively for
chloride
uh which uh is the chloride and the
bicarbonate exchanger here
the chloride ions as well as the h plus
ions present in the inside the cell
are transported to the resorption site
where they create an acidic environment
in this acidic environment the enzyme
cathepsin
k is activated which is vital for the
removal of the organic components of the
bone
leading to the resorption
various cytokines are involved in the
formation of osteoclasts
but here we'll be discussing three
important cytokines out of which the
first one is rank
it is a receptor activator of nuclear
factor kappa b
it consists of 616 amino acid peptides
uh it is a member of the tnf
receptor super family its potent
stimulators are the macrophage quality
stimulating factor transforming growth
factor beta
vitamin d3 and dexamethasone its
inhibitors are interleukin 4 and
interlocan 6.
mine is the rankle it is a receptor
activator of the nuclear factor kappa b
ligand
it is again a member of the tnf receptor
super family
it is produced by the marrow stromal as
well as the osteoblastic cells
uh it is selectively expressed in the
actively resolving primary teeth
periodontal ligament but not seen in the
permanent counterparts its uh potent
activity is that it is a stimulator
in the formation of osteoclasts from the
precursor cells
also the bone resolving activity of
mature osteoclasts is altered by them
osteoprotectin it is again a member of
the dnf
receptor superfamily it consists of 380
uh
amino acids it is produced by the marrow
stromal as well as the osteoblastic
cells
it is its activity is that it's a potent
inhibitor for of the formation of
osteoclasts
that is it acts as a decoy for the rankl
the it binds to the available rankl and
inhibits its function of forming new
osteoclasts
a few factors such as a tnf
alpha interleukin-1 tnf beta
bone morphogenic protein and few steroid
hormones upregulate the expression of
opg
while glucocorticoids immunosuppressant
drugs
parathyroid hormone prostaglandin e2
suppress the expression of opg
the important point here to note is when
there is lack of opg osteoborosis
is seen and there is increased number of
osteoglass
while overexpression of opg results in
osteopetrosis and decreased number of
osteoclasts
coming to the resorptive process which
is mediated by the osteoclasts it can be
easily termed as a bimodal process
that is initially there is dissolution
of the inorganic crystal structure
followed by the degradation of the
organic collagen principally type 1.
coming to the dissolution of the
inorganic crystal structure when the ph
is below 5 at the resorptive site there
is rapid dissolution of the
hydroxyapatite crystals
a polarized proton pump along the ruffle
border is formed
and the enzyme carbonic anhydrase 2
plays an important role here
as already discussed in the functional
elements of the osteoclasts
inside the osteoclast the carbonic
anhydrase
ii enzyme forms h plus ions and these h
plus ions are transported to the
resorption site through the polarized
proton pump
coming to the degradation of the organic
structure
uh three groups of proteases are
involved here
which include the collagenases
the matrix for metalloproteinases and as
well as the cysteine proteases
the collagenases the collagenases and
the matrix protala proteinases act at a
neutral ph
while the cysteine proteases act at the
acidic ph
uh as discussed cysteine proteases
appear to work closer to the ruffle
border because it is acidic
here that is in the resorptive area
while
collagenases appear to be active at the
resorting site
because the ph is closer to neutral here
because of the buffering capacity of the
dissolving bone salts
and to summarize the whole process once
there is proliferation and
differentiation of mononuclear precursor
cells from the blood
there is production of osteoclast
precursor cells these cells
fuse eventually forming the osteoclast
this is the formation of osteoclast
coming through coming to its function it
is its function is mediated by
rank rankle and opg if there is more
production of rankine there is
osteoclast activation
while if there is more production of opg
there is no osteoclast activation and
there is suppression
coming to its attachment to the bone the
osteoclast attaches itself to the bone
by the podosomes forming a sealing zone
within the cell by the action of
carbonic anhydrase 2 there is production
of h plus which are transported to the
to the resultive site forming the acidic
medium here
once they are transported to the
resorptive site there is degradation of
the organic matrix as well as the
destruction of the inorganic crystal
structure
eventually leading to resorption
now let's learn about the second
important k cell which is the
odintoclast
odentos means tooth while classed means
to destruct
these are the cells which destruct the
mineralized structures of the tooth
eventually leading to the resorption
odento class are thought to
differentiate from the circulating
procedure cells
such progenitor cells reside in the
dental pulp and periodontal ligament
they share many similar characteristics
with that of the osteoclasts in the
expression of
cathepsin k cathepsin d tatara resistant
acid phosphatase h plus atps pump and
formation of a clear zone and ruffle
border
in the physiological primary tooth
resorption mature or under classed
formation only occurs after the
attachment
to the resorption site
the cells from the pulp pdl cementum and
dental follicle
mediate the formation of osteoclast or
underclass and eventually the root
resorption
they are involved in the orchestration
of the essential molecule in the opg
rank and rankle system
apart from this pdl cells also mediate
the systemic regulation of osteoclast
formation
through paracarity hormone and also by
increasing the expression of frankly
all these factors eventually induce not
signaling promoting the
cluster genesis now
let's understand the process of root
resorption caused by odentoclasts
once there is a stimulus either
physiological or pathological
there is a local increase of cytokines
as well as the oriental glass and
fibroblasts are activated
with the local increase of cytokines the
t cells get activated eventually
expressing
rankl these lead to the differentiation
and activation of the preodento class
eventually converting into odentoclasts
with the activation of odentoblasts and
fibroblasts there is expression of
wrangle and interaction with the
mononuclear progenitor cells
they lead to vasoactive chemotactic and
cellular effects
with the recruitment of active ordinator
class both these processes
result in root resorption
of cells which play a crucial role in
the resorptive process
include the monocytes and macrophages
they are in similar structure to the
osteoclasts
they can also become multi-nucleated
giant cells but they lack a ruffled
border
and do not they do not create any
lacunae
once the monocytes are recreated to the
site of injury by the release of
pro-inflammatory cytokines
there the monocytes get differentiated
into macrophages
these uh macrophages get migrated and
recruited by the action of the
macrophagic chemotactic factor which is
derived from the bone and the tissue
breakdown products
we all are well aware that physiological
root resorption is one of the basic
features of primary teeth which is not
exhibited by the permanent teeth
but how many of us know the exact reason
for this to happen
now let's discuss a few reasons for this
to occur
the first one could be the extracellular
matrix protein distribution pattern
which is different in primary and
permanent lee at all in 2004 stated that
osteoclast and neutral class activation
may be extracellular depend
dependent the second possible reason
could be the expression of the rankine
which is seen
more in the periodontal ligament cells
of the actively resolving primary teeth
and not
by the permanent teeth the third
possible
reason could be the colony stimulating
factor which are significantly expressed
in the primary dental pulps and not by
the pulp tissues of the permanent teeth
coming to the fourth possible reason it
could be because of the wrangle
expression which is also high
in the pulse of the fibroblast
orientoblast cementoblast and
aminoblasts of the primary teeth and not
by the permanently
the consistency and symmetry between the
right and left sides of the mouth
regarding the exfoliation timing of the
primary teeth and the emergence of the
permanent successors
are indeed fascinating this suggests
that the shedding of these primary teeth
as well as the eruption of the permanent
teeth are coupled events which could be
programmed
the pressure from the erupting permanent
tooth is believed to play a contributory
role in setting of the resorption
but the presence of a permanent
successor is not a prerequisite
for this process to occur the primary
teeth without a successor
do resolve eventually although their
exfoliation timing is a little later
than usual
now let's understand the difference
between the resorptive process in teeth
which present with a permanent successor
and those
which present without one
root resorption of primary teeth starts
at the root that is closest to the
permanent successor for example in case
of anterior teeth the completed crown is
found
lingual to the apical third of the
primary predecessor
the adaptive force here is labial and
incisal in direction and thus it causes
resorption of the lingual surface of the
arbitral one third of the primary tooth
root
that is here the lingual surface of the
root is first resolved
once there is progression and the
resorption of the labial surface of the
root the permanent crown is found
underneath the primary tooth root and it
then
extends its resorption in incisal
direction until
the primary tooth exfoliates and there
is eruption of the permanent tooth into
the oral cavity
in some instances permanent mandibular
polars will not move
forward that is labially enough and this
causes
the failure of absorption of primary
teeth eventually leading to retained
primary teeth and the permanent incisors
are erupted
lingually in cases of primary molars
the developing permanent teeth are found
lingually
initially to the predecessors and as the
growth proceeds the developing tooth
moves under the divergent roots of the
primary tooth root and causes resorption
the position and size of the follicle
affects the pattern of root resorption
more than 36 percent of the primary
mandibular second molars
show uneven root resorption this could
be because of the highly
curved and divergent roots and also the
inter-root distance is often larger
than the size of the follicle of the
successor depending on the position of
the follicle of the successor unequal
influences may be applied on the tooth
roots
this can explain the reason for more
than one-third
teeth of the primary mandibular second
molars showing uneven root resorption
this is even appreciated in the upper
primary second molars
where the highly divergent palatal roots
the highly divergent palatal roots
show more than 56 percent of uneven root
resorption
this uneven root resorption is shown
more by the primary
second molars when compared to that of
the primary first molars
this could be because of the smaller
differences between the inter root
distance and also the size of the crown
of the permanent successor
although never proven it was believed
and is still assumed that the pressure
from the erupting permanent tooth causes
differentiation and activation of the
odentoclasts
among the components of the erupting
permanent tooth the dental follicle and
stellate reticulum
seem to play important roles in the
absorption of the deciduous roots
since 1930s cronfield suggested that the
dental follicle
is responsible for the resorption of the
roots of the primary teeth elegant
studies conducted by mark and cahill
stated that
dental follicle of the permanent tooth
is responsible for the root resorption
rather than the permanent tooth itself
in their studies the developing tooth
crown was removed and
inert substitutes of teeth such as
silicone and metal replicas were placed
in the dental follicles
the tooth erupted successfully that is
the tooth substitutes erupted
successfully into the mouth indicating
that the dental follicle regulates
and coordinates the resorptive process
in cases where the dental follicle was
removed
the teeth were prevented from eruption
it can be noted that the development of
the eruption pathway
which involves resorption of the bone
and absorption of the primary teeth is a
genetically
programmed event and it does not depend
upon the pressure from the erupting
tooth part
the dental follicle cells and the bone
stromal cells adjacent to the dental
follicle
express rankle the expression of rankle
is also
upregulated by the expression of the
parathyroid hormone related protein
it upregulates the expression of rankl
and down regulates the expression of opg
this indicates that the dental follicle
cells can replace the osteoblasts in the
tooth
micro environment and coordinate the
differentiation and activation of
monocytes to
osteoclasts in order to class basically
it
says that the dental follicle cells can
express rankine and eventually
form osteoclasts and no dental classes
out of it this
happens in both the dental follicle
cells as well as the pdl cells
it doesn't come as a surprise of this
happening in the period cells because
pdl is anyways a derivative of a dental
follicle and it acts according to it
at a critical time of the eruption
process the cells of the stellate
reticulum secrete parathyroid hormone
related protein
it is a developmental regulatory
molecule which is required
for the tooth eruption this binds in a
paracrine function to the neighbor
parathyroid hormone
related protein receptors expressed by
the cells in the dental follicle
similarly stellar reticulum also
secretes interlocal 1a
this binds in a similar fashion to the
adjacent receptors found on the dental
follicle
now these stimulated dental follicle
cells secrete a few receptors
that is the monocyte uh recruiting
factors such as
colony stimulating factor one monocyte
chemotactic factor and vascular
endothelial factor
under the influence of these monocyte
recruiting factors
monocytes arrange themselves adjacent to
the rich vasculature
mostly in the coronal region once the
environment is favorable in the dental
follicle monocytes fuse and subsequently
differentiate into heart tissue
resolving cells
that is the osteoclasts or the
odentoclasts
once as they come in contact with the
wrangle expressing cells is about the
action of
a dental follicle and stellate reticular
on the formation of oriental clusters
but recently even cementoblasts have
shown to express
levels of rankl and opg which is
modulated by parathyroid hormone related
protein
interestingly under non resolving
conditions cementoblasts seem to
secrete a larger amounts of opg this
could
be one of the possible mechanisms by
which the cementum is protected against
the resorption
when compared to that of the bone also
sahara at all observed and individual
cell relationship between the
cementoblasts and the preodento clusters
this can trigger a cytodifferentiation
of the pre-order class
into active and mature autonomous class
which allows their attachment and fusion
to the root surface
coming to the pulp status during
resorption
during the resorption of primary roots
the pulp remains in normal condition
at least initially it does not seem to
participate in the process of resorption
the oriental class are usually not found
inside the pulp
or at least until the root resorption is
close to completion and not before the
resorption level has reached
approximately 1 mm below the cement
enamel junction
during this phase chronic inflammatory
cells that is the t
and b lymphocytes infiltrate the coronal
pulse and
the odentoblasts begin to degenerate
along with this
there is bacterial incursion through the
gingivo dental junction
and accumulation of inflammatory cells
into the pulp tissue
following the degeneration of the
odentoblast
the odento class cells start resolving
uh the exposed dentine and
both the dentine as well as the
pre-dentine from the inner surface
initially the resorption process starts
at the pulpal floor uh
then towards the pulpal walls and then
it
resolves the pulpal horns also the
activated t lymphocytes odentoblast and
the pulp
of fibroblasts express rankine
they interact with the ankle receptor
eventually forming the active oriento
class
these odento class resort and remove a
dentine and enamel
leaving the crown of the primary tooth
thin and fragile
like a shell which breaks and eventually
exfoliates into pieces
finally let's understand the fate of the
gingival epithelium and the dentino
gingival junction
once the root resorption advances due to
inflammation
uh the dentino gingival junction and the
gingival epithelium
migrate apically they move under the
crown of the resolving tooth
protecting the developing tooth bud from
the inflammation of the remaining pulp
tissue of the primary tooth
events described above are initiated and
coordinated by dental follicle of the
permanent tooth germ
however even the roots of the primary
teeth
that do not have a permanent successor
eventually resolve
how this happens and why it happens
faster in some cases and much
later in others is largely unknown
ordinarily
the root as earlier mentioned is
protected by
a pdl layer against the resorption the
pdl is mainly composed of collagen
fibers
fibroblasts and cementoblasts
the degradation of the pdl preser
precedes the root resorption and
specifically
removal of collagen fibers of the pdl is
considered a main step in the initiation
process
of the resorption
interestingly differences have been
noted uh in the composition of the pdl
cells of the primary and the permanent
teeth which may explain in part at least
the increased susceptibility of primary
teeth to resorption
the main differences include the pdl
cells of the primary teeth produce a
more
matrix metalloproteinases 9 when
compared to that of their permanent
counterparts
also these pdl cells respond more to
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
interleukin-1 and tnf alpha
which eventually enhance the mmps
but not the tissue inhibitors of mmps
once
these matrix metalloproteinases act on
the pdl they cause
a collagen digestion which is considered
one of the main step in the initiation
process of resorption
also these matrix metalloproteinases are
produced by osteoblasts
pdl cells oriented class and osteoclasts
as well
this which can explain the resorption in
such teeth is that
as the phase grows in size muscles of
mastication enlarge
once they enlarge the forces that are
applied on the deciduous teeth become
heavier than the primary tooth pdl can
withstand
eventually they weaken the primary tooth
pdl causing necrosis
this induces localized production of
cytokines which
recruit macrophages and monocytes there
under the influence of few factors
these are get differentiated and
activated into
active oriento clusters
once the oriental cluster formed they
damage the pdl layer
which protects the tooth and the process
of resorption eventually starts
well etiology for mechanical trauma
could be abnormal
occlusion which occurs during the mixed
dentition phase
that is a permanent teeth in one arch
occluding with the primary tooth of the
other arch
and one more etiology could be the
composition of the uh
extracellular matrix proteins the two
main proteins include
the osteoportin and bone cellar protein
they are associated with the authentic
last adhesion and activation
and they were found to be heavily
expressed imperial cells that surrounds
the primary teeth when compared to that
of the permanent teeth
they promote selective binding of the
audento class leading to the resorption
of deciduous roots
clearly there are no accurate predictors
for
the survival of primary teeth without a
successor
in some cases they can be well
maintained into the adulthood whereas in
other cases they may exfoliate much
faster
if a primary molars remains in the
dental arch without no significant
changes
for 20 years of age it is considered
favorable prognosis for long-term
there is an survival which was published
in the european journal
of oral science there an experimental
study was conducted in legal talk
to see the resorption rate in the
primary molars without a successor
the main aim was to investigate the
mechanisms of the root resorption in
primary molars without successors
uh the result showed that the resorption
in such teeth began much later when
compared to that of the physiological
resorption
also the pulp showed odento class and
immune cells
are nearing to the resorption site there
were few immune cells
which were noted in the periodontal
ligament area
they concluded saying that the dental
pulp of primary molars as well as the
immune cells may play a role in the
resorption
of such teeth
summarize the whole process the first
important point to remember is that it
is a genetically determined programmed
event
the second point to remember is the key
cells involved in this process
are the osteoclasts odento class
monocytes as well as the macrophages
the third take home point is that the
whole process is an interplay between
the rank rankle and opg system
where the rank and wrangle increases the
resorption rate while opg suppresses it
the fourth point is that in case of
primary teeth with a permanent successor
the structures which play an important
role are the dental follicles stellar
reticulum and the cementoblasts
while in primary teeth without a
permanent successor the pdl and pulp
cells of the primary teeth as well as
the extracellular matrix proteins play
an important role
the final and the most important point
to remember is that
the pressure from the erupting permanent
tooth just has a contributory role and
it is not a prerequisite
for the resorption process to occur
i hope my effort helps you to dispel the
myths you have about this basic process
thank you
