with every passing year a dependence on
digital technology increases 10-4
we book transport via mobiles and shop
clothes on our laptops
among all these nitty-gritty day-to-day
activities information such as payment
authentication personal data and private
credentials are transported over the
internet with various website partners
with this reliance on the internet as
gradual
its impact has been every bit as
definite
this statistic represents the daily time
spent online by internet users worldwide
starting from 2011 all the way up to
2021 sorted by device
according to zenith optimedia
in 2018 the average daily minutes of
desktop internet consumption per capita
amounted to 39 minutes and it is slowly
projected to decline until 2020.
however the daily mobile internet
consumption is set to increase to 155
minutes in 2021.
if our current lifestyle is any
indication of the future these
statistics are just a window into what
is going to be a future full of
artificial intelligence and its
derivatives
as observed by researchers around the
world this level of dependability has
made us vulnerable to the worst of the
internet
according to the forbes magazine in 2019
the cumulative damage and cost of cyber
effect are far more significant than
those inflicted by natural disasters in
a year
every 11 seconds a business falls victim
to a ransomware attack
the average cost of a data breach in
2020 is 3.86 million dollars
the huge increase in cyber crimes is a
major contributor to the 12 annual
growth rate of cybersecurity spending
the united states has the world's
highest average data breach crossed at
6.84 million dollars as per 2020 records
opportunities breed innovation and this
has been observed in the cyber security
domain as well
to safeguard against such threats the
ssl protocol was developed
hey everyone this is biaber from simply
learn and welcome to this video on the
ssl handshake let's look at the topics
we have to cover today
we first take a look at the origin and
the basics of the ssl protocol in the
networking segment
we understand the core values of the
secure ssl layer and the protection it
provides against various malicious
attacks and domains
next we learn about the four distinct
sub-protocols to be found under the ssl
flag
all the way up to a step-by-step
explanation on how the ssl handshake is
initiated until its completion
finally we learn about the future of ssl
and the implications it may have on the
immediate generation of internet
security
we also have a quiz in between the
topics so stay focused and let's see if
you can answer the question
let us learn about the ssl protocol
first
ssl or secure sockets layer is an
encryption based internet security
protocol
it was first developed by netscape in
1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy
authentication and data integrity in
internet communication
ssl is the predecessor to the modern tls
encryption news today
it acts as a cryptographic layer
protocol that provides privacy and
security to communication between a
client and a web server
a website that implements ssl
authentication has https in its url
instead of http
in order to provide a high degree of
privacy ssl encrypts data that is
transmitted across the web this means
that anyone who tries to intercept this
data will only see a garbled mix of
characters that is nearly impossible to
decrypt
ssl initiates an authentication process
called a handshake between two
communicating devices to ensure that
both of them are really who they claim
to be
ssl also digitally signs data in order
to provide data integrity
the internet we use today follows an osi
model or even systems interconnections
model it is a priority system that
characterizes and standardizes the
communication on the internet among its
multiple layers the ssl layer functions
between the application layer
and the transport layer
the application layer provides services
for an application to ensure that
effective communication with another
applic program is possible
the transport layer is responsible for
error-free end-to-end delivery of data
from the source host to the destination
host
since the ssl protocol functions in
between these two layers the data is
encrypted and is authenticated after
being passed through the application and
before it is transmitted over the
network
to further understand this priority
table let us look at the table of how it
works
hypertext transfer protocol http is an
application layer protocol that is used
for transmitting information between
computers on the world wide web
http is based on a request response
standard between a client and server
once the data is ready to be shared we
can pass it on to the ssl layers
as you can notice the protocol being
used right now is http which signifies
that the data is unencrypted and hence
vulnerable to malicious attacks
the data is then passed on to the ssl
where we have the record protocol for
the confidentiality protection and the
handshake protocol for the
authentication of client and server the
sub-protocols of the ssl will be later
discussed in detail
after the data is encrypted and ready to
be transmitted it is moved on to the
transport layer where we use the tcp
packets to send their data along to the
internet layer and from that point
forward the data can move to its
destination using the internet protocol
or ip addressing tables
with so many sub-protocols and
sub-variants of the ssl protocol the
work is divided into multiple layers and
aspects
let's have a look at some of the ways
the ssl layer make the internet safe and
secure
for server authentication the client
uses the server's public key to encrypt
the data which is used to complete the
secret key
the server can generate the secret key
only if it can decrypt the information
with the correct private key
for client authentication the server
uses the public key in the client
certificate
if any of the authentication steps fail
the handshake fails and the session
terminates
this exchange of digital certificates
during the ssl handshake is a part of
the authentication process
ssl provides data integrity by
calculating a message digest or a hash
use of ssl does ensure integrity
provided that the cipher spec in your
channel definition uses a hash algorithm
in the ssl record protocol the hash
value is generated for the data to be
transmitted hence providing a necessary
way to verify data corruption
ssl uses a combination of symmetric and
asymmetric encryption to ensure message
privacy
during the ssl handshake the ssl client
and server agree to an encryption
algorithm and a shared secret key is
used for that particular session
all the messages transmitted between the
client and server are then encrypted
using the same algorithm and key that
ensure that the message will remain
private even if it is intercepted
regarding the multiple layers in the ssl
protocol we have many sub protocols that
ensure the three protection aspects of
security let us learn more about these
the ssl record protocol provides two
services to the ssl connection
confidentiality and message integrity
in ssl record protocol the data is
divided into fragments
the fragment comprises of the encrypted
sha code and the md5 code after the
encryption of the data is done the last
ssl header is also appended to the data
the handshake protocol is used to
establish sessions this protocol allows
the client and server to authenticate
each other by sending a series of
messages
handshake protocol uses four phase
system to complete its cycle
in phase one both the client and server
send hello packets to each other
in phase two they exchange the
certificates with the correct private
and public keys
in phase three they reply to each other
with the encryption algorithms and the
secret keys while in phase 4 the
handshake is completed
for the chain cipher spec protocol we
use a part of the ssl record protocol
unless handshake is completed the ssl
record output will be in a pending state
after handshake the pending state is
converted into a current state
the chain cipher protocol consists of a
single message which is a one byte inlet
and can hold only one value
the ssl alert protocol is used to convey
ssl related alerts to the peer entity
each message in this protocol contains
only two bytes
let's take a small quiz to check if the
older topics are clearly understood
once the data is encrypted in the ssl
layer where is the data being passed on
to
is it a the application layer
b transport layer see the internet layer
or the presentation layer
take a few seconds to recall our last
topic and be sure to leave your answer
in the comments section of this video
let's move on with our topic
now that we understand the entire
protocol and it's working
let's see how the ssl handshake works in
a step-by-step format
we have divided the handshake into four
distinct phases
in phase one the client and server get
acquainted with the hello signal message
from each site
the client sends the ssl version cipher
suit and the session id
the server returns an encryption
algorithm which is chosen from the
cipher suit and a compression algorithm
which is sent from the client hello
signal each
this helps in setting up a common
encryption algorithm and a common hash
value to be used throughout the
handshake process
in phase 2
the server sends it authentication
certificate and requests for client
authentication
the server also sends its public
encryption key
and the phrase with the server hello
done message
once the server sends its public key the
client can use it to encrypt its own
private key which will be later used to
encrypt the data being exchanged between
the client and a server
in phase 3
the client sends its authentication
certificate after verifying the server
with the respective certificate
authorities
the client now send a private key which
is encrypted using the server's
previously sent public key
in phase 4 the client sends the status
of the cipher functions along with a
finished message to end the handshake
from its side
the server also sends the status of the
cipher algorithm and ends with a
finished signal
the data is now encrypted with a
symmetric key client sent in phase 3.
with the end of phase 4 authentication
is complete and the ssl handshake has
maintained the authenticity of the
entire session between the client and
server
to reiterate the entire process
let's go through each step one more time
the client sends a hello request to the
server
the server responds with its own hello
message and sends the server
authentication certificate for
verification
at this point the server's hello signal
is complete
the client exchanges a secret key with
the server to encrypt the data and the
cipher spec parameters are changed
accordingly
the client has now finished its own
handshake activities
the server uses the secret key provided
by the client to encrypt the data and
alters its own cipher spec parameters as
a final step before it sends a finished
signal
at this point the ssl handshake is
complete with an encryption algorithm
and a secure data channel to transmit
information
with ssl protocol being developed in the
early 90s it was bound to be a little
underpowered when pitted against the
current day computers and hackers
let's see its future implications and
replacements
ssl encryption has been depreciated now
with its version 2 and version 3 being
docked by the internet engineering task
force in 2011 and 2015 respectively
there had been far too many security
vulnerabilities to carry on official
activities during the ssl prayer
to further enhance the security the
transport layer security or tls has been
developed as a successor to the ssl
protocol
tls is a proposed ietf standard first
developed in 1999 and the current
version is tls 1.3 which was defined in
august 2018.
even though a major part of the internet
is still using tls 1.2 as a safety net
the transition to the latest version
should be completed before any security
deficiencies are exploited
