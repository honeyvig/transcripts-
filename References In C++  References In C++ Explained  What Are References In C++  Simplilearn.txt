hello everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn
in this video we will learn about
references in c plus
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we'll be covering today
so we will learn what are references in
c plus
then the creation of references
after that we will learn about reference
in the function and returning the
reference from the function
next we will have a look at the
applications of references and
understand the difference between
reference and pointer
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and press the
bell icon to never miss an update
so first is what are references in c
plus plus
a reference can be defined as an
alternative name of the variable
as the name suggests it is used to refer
to an existing variable
it is basically used to store the
reference of the variable and is stored
using an ampersand sign
although the reference and address are
the same thing but their context is
different
when we are talking about reference
variable then we will call it reference
rather than address
the variable can either be accessed with
the help of variable name or by the
reference name
so as we have understood about
references in c plus plus so now let's
learn how to create reference in c plus
let's suppose we have a variable named
data
and we know how to declare a variable
first its data type then the variable
name and then we will assign the value
to the variable
here int is the data type
data is the variable name and 10 is the
value that is assigned to the variable
if we want to declare a reference
variable for the variable data then it
would be like this
first is the data type
with ampersand sign then the name of the
reference variable equals to the
variable name of which we are storing
the reference of
as you can see int ampersand ref
which is the name of the reference
variable equals to data which is the
name of the variable
so we can say ref is the reference
variable for the data variable and it
can be used instead of the variable name
now
coming to reference in the function
we can pass the reference to the
function as a parameter
it is similar to passing the pointers to
the function but it is safer
while passing the reference to the
function the changes made inside the
function will also be reflected outside
because after passing the reference to
the function the past reference will
access the actual argument
so the changes that are done to the
parameter inside the function will
affect the arguments
in addition it is safer and provides a
cleaner code
to pass the value as reference all we
need to do is to change the function
parameter as reference type as you can
see in the calculation function int
ampersand a
now let's learn about returning the
reference in c plus
similar to pointers references can also
be returned
while returning the reference an
implicit pointer is also returned
in return by reference
no local variable is returned and no
constant is returned
only the global variable is returned in
return by reference function calling is
done on the left hand side of the
assignment operator
as you can see in the example
n is returned from the function but it
is not the value that we are returning
but the address of the variable
when this variable is returned then the
value 15 is assigned to it
which is then printed as we can see in
the example
now coming to applications of references
in c plus
so first is
references helps in modifying or
changing the values inside the function
without actually passing the actual
arguments
because we can easily pass the reference
instead of variable and if we pass the
reference to the function then also it
can modify or change the values
second is
references helps with operator
overloading because unlike pointers they
work with references and values
rather than pointer variables
third is
references helps with writing less error
prone code and by replacing values with
references while calling avoids the
unnecessary copy of data
so these were some applications of
references in c plus
now let's understand the difference
between reference and pointer
the reference can be defined as an alias
of the variable
here the word alias means additional
name or we can say
also known for the name
on the other hand a pointer is used to
store the memory address of the variable
reference cannot have a null value
whereas pointers can have a null value
references cannot be reassigned to other
values
whereas pointers can be reassigned to
other values
it returns the reference of the variable
on the other hand pointer returns the
value located at the address of the
variable
reference can be initialized during its
creation only it cannot be
re-initialized
whereas
pointer can be initialized as many times
as required
so these were some differences between
reference and pointer
now let's go ahead and do some examples
of reference in c plus plus in our code
editor that is vs code
all right so here we will do an example
of return by reference in c plus
we all know how to return a value from a
function
so now we will understand how can we
return a reference from the function
all right so let's start
first of all create a new folder and
let's save it
and name it as
ref1
dot cpp
now we will save it
all right so first of all we'll include
the header files and then we'll start
with the main function
hash include iostream
and then the name space standard
now let's start with the main function
inside the main function
first of all like normally we'll do for
the functions we will call
let's name the function as club
so this is how we normally call a
function
and
after that we create a function like
this
like
int
club
and
then
this is how normal calling works but in
this case we want this function to
return the reference
and for that we have to use the
ampersand sign
so we have used this ampersand sign
and this is a syntax int which is the
data type then the ampersand sign then
the name of the function and if we want
to pass any arguments then we can do
that and keep in mind that inside this
function we cannot return any local
variable or any constant like we cannot
return we cannot create a variable
inside this function assign it some
value and then return it we can't do
that and we can only return the global
variable
let me show you that we cannot return
this return
8 as this is a constant and we can't do
like this like
int
p equals to nine
and then we will return it
return p we can't do like this as well
all we need to do is to create a global
variable and then we will return
all right
so let's create a global variable
let's say the global variable is
n
and so we'll return
n
now if we want to assign
some
value to this global variable we have to
call this club function
and we have to make this calling on the
left hand side of the assignment
operator
like this
and now we have to assign the value
like
let's say the value is 75
so here we are assigning the value and
calling this reference operator we are
assigning the value to this global
variable this n global variable and in
this part we are actually assigning this
75 value to this global variable n
now we can print this n variable which
is global and check if its value is 75
or not
all right so let's save it and let's try
to run this
as you can see 75
so this is an example of return by
reference in z plus plus
now let's move on to another example
all right now
all right we know a reference cannot be
reassigned that also means a single
reference cannot refer to two different
values
but two different references can have a
single value
or in other words a value can have two
different references
so in this example we'll show
how a value can have two different
references
so let's start doing this example first
of all we'll include the header files
hash include iostream
now the namespace standard
all right
now inside the main function
we will create a variable
and two different references the
variable is num and we will assign it a
value let's say 70
and
we will create two different references
in
num1 and n1
and
we will assign it to num
and
n2 which is also signing to the same
variable so there are two references n 1
and n 2 which are referring to the same
variable num
so now we will print this variable num
and both of these reference variable
that is n1 and n2 to check if they are
pointing to the same value
so let's do this
we will write
c out
value of
num is
all right now
again
value of
reference
n1
is
and one
handle
similarly
value
of
reference
and 2 is
and 2
and l
all right
so we have printed all of
these variables and references
and now return
0. and let's check if they're
running fine or not
as you can see value of num is 70 value
of reference n1 is 70 and n2
reference is 70. so we can say all of
these
references and variables are pointing to
the same value and the value of num can
also be accessed by this reference
variable n1 and n2
all right now let's do another example
let's name it ref
two dot cpp
so here we will do an example of
references in c plus plus in which we
will pass the reference into the
function to swap the actual values
basically we don't pass the actual
arguments we only pass the references
and swap the values
so
let's start
so let's include the header files
now we will create the main function and
inside the main function we will declare
two variables and assign the values
and y
17 let's say
now we'll print first of all we'll print
before swapping right
you
all right
so
now we will
call
the function swap we will create a
functions web afterwards
and we'll pass not the values but the
references
and then we can similarly
copy this one
and just paste it again
and we'll do that
after
swiping here we have to do before
swiping right
so first of all we'll print the value of
x and y before swapping then
we will print the values of x and y
after swiping
so now we have to create the definition
or write the definition of swap function
so
let's write void swap
and do remember that here we are passing
the references not the values so we have
to write like this and ampersand
n1
this is how when we are passing the
values we have to write like this
and
hint ampersand
n2
here this n1 is referring to x
and this n2 is referring to y
and inside this swap function will
simply
swap as we
know how to swap into temp equals n1
then we'll do
n1 equals n2
we all know how to swap
to here we haven't passed the values
actually we have passed the reference
and using those references we are
swiping the values
so now let's try to run this
save it and
let's run this
as you can see before swiping x value is
12 and y value was 17 after swiping 17
and 12
so as we can see clearly that the value
is swept
so we can say using the references or by
passing the references to a function we
can actually swap the values so this
also proves that references can access
the values
so these were some examples of
references in c plus plus
references in c plus plus is a very
simple topic and there are very limited
examples on this topic and if you find
some more examples please do try them
all right guys with that we have come to
