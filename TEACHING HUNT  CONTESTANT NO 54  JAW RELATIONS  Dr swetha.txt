hello everyone
i'm dr shweta from narendra dental
college
uh i'm here to discuss on a topic of jaw
relations
that is mostly a troubleshooting jaw
relations mostly the mcqs
so uh why i've selected this topic is
that
during my entrance preparation i used to
have difficulty solving them secures on
this
topic because most of the options are
nearly close and seems to be very the
correct answers
but mostly i used to go wrong in this
particular topic so i've tried to
present the solution
in a simple way as possible only by
knowing the definitions of
certain jaw relation things okay
so without much delay let's get started
so what is a jaw relation it is a
maxillomandibular relationship
that is a spatial relationship of
maxilla
to the mandible it means that the
mandible and maxilla
is related in all the three different
planes
whatever irrespective of the plane it is
related in all the planes and we are
capturing
all this uh into a relationship that is
in all the
three different planes we are capturing
the relationship of
maxilla to the mandible that is nothing
but a
jaw relation so
we have different or three types of jaw
relations that is
in three manners we calculated one is
the horizontal jaw relation
other is the vertical and other is the
orientation as you already know
so the horizontal relation is the
centered relation
now let's get into it see uh the
definition
itself says many things about centric
relation
see ones have a look at the definition
it's a maxillomander
relationship that means it's a
relationship in which
it is independent of tooth contact since
we are not
considering the tooth here it is a bone
to bone relation
relation in the sense it's a bone to
bone occlusion in a sense is the two to
tooth relation
okay so in which the condyles articulate
in the
anterosuperior position so whereas this
relationship is establishing is
it is a relation between the condyle to
the cranium
okay that is at which place
in the along the slides of the posterior
slopes of
articular eminence okay in which
position
it is in the anterior superior position
previously the definition used to be in
the
posterior most position when you look
into the books of hartwell and voucher
it used to be in the posterior most
recruited position
but since the position is found to be
the strained position
so or strained or unstrained but the
centric relations is always
proved to be the unstrained position so
there is a slight change in the
definition
and the more revised version of the
definition evolved in the gpt-9
that it is an anterior superior
relationship and anterior superior
positioning of the condyle with respect
to the
articular eminence okay and uh
let's continue with the definition the
mandible is restricted to
purely rotary movement it means
purely hinge movement usually the lower
compartment of the mandible is
completely related to the hinge moment
which is a pure rotation moment
that is possible only to a certain
degree okay so
220 to 25 mm it is possible and that
particular position
where it is relating in in this position
that is called as centric relation and
this
relation should be an unstrained
physiologic
relationship and strain in the sense all
the muscles which are
keeping this relationship should be in
an unstrained position
and also the patient can make a
vertical lateral and protrusive moments
that means
it is the cornell is free to move in
all the three different planes that is
protrusive lateral
as well as the vertical motion is
possible and
here so we have got five different terms
one is
where is the relationship established it
is in between the
condyle and the posterior slope what is
the position
it is a anterior superior position and
how how should be the muscle it should
be a
physiologic as well as the unstrained uh
unstrained manner they should be okay
and
we are able to that is the condyle is
able to
uh rotate freely in all the three
different planes and also only the pure
hinge moment is possible
and there is a slight uh addition to
this definition
in gpth8 that does at an established
vertical dimension this is very very
important because
i'll tell you why in the next previous
slide okay at an established vertical
dimension because in a vertical height
is established then
only one should go with the center
relation because for
every established vertical height there
is difference in the centric
relation position okay so if you
calculate
more that is a 3mm or 4mm beyond the
vertical height you have calculated
previously
this intercalation changes according to
the vertical height of the
[Music]
patient
now coming to the physiologic rest
position
uh this is somewhat similar to the
centric relation don't get confused
just go through the technician it is a
postural jaw relation
postural in the sense it is dependent on
the patient position that's why the
patient
patient should be positioned in an
upright condition see the postural
relation when the patient is
resting comfortably in an upright
position and
the muscles are an equilibrium and tonic
contraction
and tonic contraction equilibrium means
every muscle is fired to the same
resting potential okay
and the condyles are in the neutral
unstrained position in the glenoid fossa
that is the relationship
it doesn't specify either it is anterior
superior or posterior
but it is compulsory that the condyles
are in unstrained position it means
rest it means zero so you can say the
muscle should be at rest as well as the
condyle should be addressed
this is only taken away by the muscles
and
centriculation the muscles has nothing
to do with it
even though the muscle is guiding its
center relation but
uh the muscle need not be in a
unstrained position but here
all the muscles are in a unstrained eq
sorry tonic contraction
or equilibrium position okay and the
condyles are in the unstrained position
so this physiological responsion is
dictated by the muscle rest potential
so for every individual the rest
potential of the muscle is
fixed and it is fixed throughout the
life that is why
irrespective of the presence of teeth or
not the physiological responsion
for the individual remains same
throughout the life
it doesn't change unless until you will
have a muscle pathology
so that is why when you establish a
physiological risk position in a dentate
patients or ridiculous patients
it reminds same almost same and it is
recordable and repeatable also this is
also called as the
vertical dimension at rest don't get
confused this is a rest position
and the dimension that is established at
the physiological rise position
is a vertical dimension at rest
usually in the vertical which is called
as bdr
okay vertical dimension at rest in this
position usually what happens is the
patient
uh will have in case of i'm talking
about the dentite patients
usually will have uh if if the position
is uh
if the patient is in physiological risk
position then the teeth will be slightly
separated
you'll find a space that is that is
called as a freeway space which we'll
discuss it in the later slides
but never ever this in the vdr
the teeth will upload because the muzzle
it has to be in a
unstrained position so since it is
attaining the unstrained position
there will be a small amount of gap in
the dentite patients
so that gap has to be replicated even in
the complete denture also
so what happens if it is not replicated
we'll see in the
further slides okay
see here uh the picture uh it is
depicting the
the dotted lines indicates the when the
teeth are in occlusion
but the vd occlusion occlusion that is a
vertical dimension and occlusion
and rest is different rest there is a
space that is present
two to three mm which is called as a
three-way freeway space
okay and that position is called as a
physiological
rest position and the height that is
established is called as
vdr that is vertical dimension at rest
now the vertical dimension of occlusion
it is the vertical
separation of the jaws when the teeth
are an occlusion or maximum
intercuspation you you know what is
maximum intercuspation
that is every cusp coincides with the
corresponding rows or the forces okay
so in that case if uh the vertical
dimension that is established when the
teeth are in occlusion is called as
vertical dimension at occlusion
so you we already told that in the vdr
position there is slight cap
so what you consider is more vdr is more
than
vdo so if you subtract the vdr
minus vdo it gives the freeway space
that is
normally 2 to 3 mm okay that is called
as the
freeway space and there is one more
point in this
there is another space that is also
considered
which is called as freeways which is
freeway space discussed here
the other space is called as the
silverman's closest speaking space
that is around 1 to 2 mm and that space
is established when the patient is
at speech while pronouncing certain uh
sentences you will find an active space
present between the teeth that is called
as
silverman's closed speaking space don't
get confused with the freeway space and
the silverman space
silverman's space is when the uh the
patient is peaking
and it is around 1 to 2 mm and in the
space
usually the muscles are active not in
unstrained positions uh sorry not in
tonic equilibrium that is not in resting
potential they are active that means
they are in contraction
okay so the difference between these two
spaces is
one is the active one one in one the
muscles are active in one the muscles
are passive
or press position
so whenever the freeway space so now you
know the difference between the two
spaces
so what happens if the vertical
dimension is not established properly or
you are
if you are increasing or decreasing it
how do you measure it usually you will
take a distance between the tip of the
nose and the chin
okay that will give the vertical
dimension of the patient but if it is
increased ah which means you are
encroaching on the freeway space you are
using up the gap between the
teeth uh that is supposed to be present
that is that two to four mm so what
happens
you are firing the muscle you are not
allowing the muscle to get into rest
so the muscle will be in continuous
firing so in order to
uh overcome that obstacle uh the muscle
tries to
uh resolve the supporting tissue that is
present so eventually it will leads to
more
absorption of the supporting tissues
that is the mucosa as well as the moon
so in that and along with that there
will be some unpleasant sound in the
dangers because of continuous clicking
and premature contacts
and there will be exaggerated facial
expressions
and there will also be facial distortion
and difficulty in closing of the lips
difficulty in swallowing so many things
will happen when there is an increased
vertical dimension
the same is also found with decreased
vertical
dimension here what happens there will
be over closure in the occlusion
so you are not using the gap you are
creating excessive freeway space
more than two to four mm so there is no
proper vertical
height that is established so there will
be over closure of the muscle
so in that case the most probable the
first choice is the temporomandibular
joint will get affected
so whenever an mcq is given the first
shortest temporomandibular
joint a symptom is present then you have
to mark it because the over closure will
only effect mostly affect the
temporomandibular joint first
and followed by the appearance where
the chin appears to be very close to the
nose and the commissure of the
lips turns down and
the lips usually they lost their
fullness uh
so because of losing of the tonicity of
the
muscles okay um and
mostly you'll have angular gelitis at
the corners of the
uh mount so now what will you see you
you'll have in certain mcqs there are
certain terminology which will be very
uh confusing so i've tried to put it up
see here
uh this interclassial distance versus
interact space
mostly will get confused okay this
interclassial distance
is the distance between the occlusion
rims
or the occluding surfaces that is the
teeth indented individuals
and occlusal rims in complete denture
patients
or the artificial teeth okay so
indirectly the interclassial distance is
nothing but
the freeway space okay whereas the
inter-art spaces
the distance between the arches that is
from one bridge to the another ridge
irrespective of the presence of teeth or
not it is an interrupt space
is it clear now so
next just look into the next point that
is this failure to provide
adequate intercrucial distance or
excessive interact
distance means the same
failure to provide adequate interrupt
crucial distance
means you are not giving
enough freeway space excessive interact
distance means you are increasing the
vertical dimension both mean the same
and many of the mcqs have seen that
these two are used alternatively to
confuse
us so don't get confused just
think to the point interclusion distance
is
related to the freeway space interact is
something related to the vertical
dimension
so here failure to provide that is
inadequate inter occlusal distance means
you are encroaching on the freeway space
and you are increasing the vertical
height
that's it so okay next coming to the
next point which is an
excessive interrupt crucial distance it
means interrupt crucial distance is a
freeway space so you are giving
excessive that means you are not
uh get giving the enough vertical
dimension that is you are decreasing the
vdr okay video you are decreasing the
vertical dimension at occlusion so both
of it is dangerous but
usually the book says that increasing is
a bit better than the
decreasing okay
so now coming to orientation your
relation
so there are two terminologies which you
have to know in orientation jaw relation
one is the hinge axis
so what is hinge axis it is when the
mandible opens and closes the rotation
occurs around the transverse axis
so the rotation will takes place around
an point
that is called as a hinge axis the axis
the plane is called as the
hinge axis so the rotation we have
already learned that in center relation
also
there will be a purely uh rotation that
is happening in the
uh condyle okay so if it is at the
centric relation
position then it is called as a terminal
hinge axis
okay and there is another terminology
also called as transverse horizontal
axis
almost all means the same but to be
specific if it is
the rotation or the axis is calculated
at or the rotation axis is calculated in
the center relation portion it is called
as a
terminal hinge axis okay what is
transverse horizontal axis
it is imaginary axis around which the
mandible may rotate within a
sagittal plane the same thing
almost equal to the hinge axis or hinge
axis what we have discussed
it is nothing but if you are connecting
a line uh passing from one condyle
to the another condyle and calculating
the
rotating axis of the condyle in sagittal
plane that means mid sagittal is
it will divide the body into right and
left parts isn't it so
when you are calculating this opening
and closing rotating axis in that
plane then it is called as a transverse
horizontal
axis and uh when you are calculating it
you will take the mean of this
and that is called as the transverse
horizontal
axis so so
tr what is this orientation your
relation means
you are orienting the mandible to the
cranium so you are transferring
this transverse horizontal axis so that
you are able to replicate the same
moment
in the uh in the articulator also
so the device which we used for this
which we use for this orientation your
relation is the
facebook see here you are recording this
you are you are trying to record this uh
thc or the hinge axis
and you are trying to replicate it to
the
via the facebook transfer to the
articulator
so that the articulator will simulate
this axis
this kind of relationship where you will
orient the maxilla to the cranium in
certain angle
by indirectly knowing the dha is known
as the
orientation jaw relationship okay
see here if you're mounting this to the
car
at cast to the articulator the maxilla
is oriented to an
angle so that angulation where it is
oriented you can't record it
without a facebook so in order to record
it we use a device called as a phase bar
and this relationship
in the patient is called as the
orientation jaw relationship that is how
angulated it is to the cranium that is
maxilla how it is angulated to the
cranium
and how is this terminal hinge axis so
the main
important uh device that is used is a
face pop so this is the face pump
you will have different face
just get into it see this flowchart the
face bow
if you know about the phase bur you will
get to know about the orientation john
relation completely
so it orients the condyle maxilla
relationship
that is maxillary tooth condylar axis
relation
okay so and it transfers it to the
articulator
so there are different types of facebook
one is the arbitrary phase buff
and other is a kinematic or actual
access facebook
there is not much of difference
arbitrary in the sense you are
calculating the um hinge axis
arbitrarily
okay so that is why it is called as
arbitrary it is not the exact hinge axis
if the kinematic in the kinematic phase
buff it is the exact hinge axis
you are recording and transferring but
in arbitrary you are
taking a arbitrary axis
almost near near near similarly
so in order to calculate it arbitrary
you should have certain land maxes in it
that is why you will have the post theta
reference points and the anterior
reference points
so this posterior reference points
usually we know what we'll read as the
variance point bugs from points
all these are uh this posterior
reference points that means they'll
indic they'll indicate where this
caliper has to be inserted to record the
arbitrary hinge axis
okay ah whereas in kinematic there is no
such
problem you are calculating the true
hinge axis so there won't be any problem
for this you will have some pantographs
tracings everything so they'll record
the true hinge axis in a
exact manner and in this arbitrary also
other than posterior reference points
you should also have the anterior
reference point there should be a three
point standardization isn't it
so in the anterior reference you will
have an ac on point orbital point
all these things okay so that is why in
that also you will have two types
fascia type and the ear bow type uh
in earbud type you will get this uh
ear pose which can be inserted into the
external uh
auditory miatas so in that case you are
able to record it
in that position the posterior reference
is the ear points
and in fascia type there will be certain
points
uh as i said variance points or bugs
from points where you will mark it
and then you will place the uh exact
facebook in that particular position
so here there will be ear rods in that
the rods will be inserted near to that
particular point
so that is the difference between an
arbitrary and kinematic facebook
so usually in all the complete ninja
cases we'll use the arbitrary
uh kind of earbuds only
so look into this picture this is a ear
bow uh
that is the posterior reference points
is into the external acoustic
meters that is ear rods are inserted
into it
and the next this is
uh kinematic what we are talking is
the exact kinematic location is captured
here
other than this there will be another
condylar rods will also be there where
the posterior reference point will be
the condyle or the behrens point which
is 13mm anterior to the outer can this
line between that there you will insert
the condylar rods
uh same like what i have shown in the
previous picture the your rods
instead of that you will call there it
is called as a condyle a rod
here this is called as a kinematic bow
where see
the difference you can appreciate it in
the kinematic phase bow
uh this bite fork will be inserted into
the mandible the clutches will be
inserted to the mandible
whereas in arbitrary it is positioned to
the maxilla
the only difference which we could make
with the picture is this one
the kinematic is more precise whereas
this arbitrary it is not less precise
okay so that is why we use it in
complete danger cases
arbitrary cases okay
so by now you should be thorough with
all the definitions
it almost covers the entire topic but
there are
a few questions uh that are present in
the topic which are very weak
so after knowing all this one may get a
doubt which is the first one you'll do
in a jar relation
first always orient the jordan
orientation jaw relation is the first
thing
that is you have to orient the maxillar
to the transverse injections of the
mandible or the maxilla to the cranium
either way it is correct
okay after orienting or angulating at a
particular position
then you have to establish the vertical
jaw relation that is the rest position
and after that you have to go for the
center relation why is that how to
remember it
because in centric relation it is given
at an established vertical dimension
that means you
are supposed to do a vertical dimension
before the center relation if it is not
established
then for every vertical dimension
increase there will be change in the
relationship
centric relation so that is why you are
supposed to do a vertical jaw relation
before to the center collision so the
sequence is
orientation followed by vertical
followed by centric
so this almost covers the entire
mcqs in the jaw relation topic
so as we completed the topic now let's
troubleshoot it
so here are a few mcqs the first one is
hinge axis facebook records
relationship of t to the axis of
rotation of the jaw
so this may be a correct but see uh the
correct answer is one because you are
supposed to
relate the maxillary teeth or maxilla to
the
tha or the hinge axis of the mandible
that is the thing we have learnt
but see the second one you may have a
doubt with other two options
relationship of mandible to maxilla or
maxilla to mandible which is a centric
relation so that can't be correct
third one is relationship of mandible to
cranium
how can you relate a mandible directly
to a cranium dha is relating
mandible to the maxilla so maxilla you
are relating it to the
mandible so in that case the first
option that is relationship of teeth
that
in that means a maxillary key to the
axis of the rotation of the jaw is
correct
so uh by knowing the definitions itself
you are able to solve this
and so next time secure the interact
distance measured when the crucial rims
are in uniform contact
is usually when you have an inter arch
distance or interclassial distance
terminology
we'll usually get confused with the
freeway space or something like that
you'll first mark the freeway space but
uh just read carefully the inter arch
distance which means the
distance between the two ridges as i
said so two ridges in the sense
it is giving the height okay so and
uh look into the cue clue that is given
in the question measured when the
crucial terms are in contact
contact means occlusion so to height at
occlusion
indirectly the question itself is giving
the answer that is the vertical
dimension of occlusion
okay so the next question
most accurate reproducible relationship
for recording jaw relation
one is physiological responsion centric
occlusion center collision all of the
epo
so it is jaw relation never ever he has
mentioned about the teeth
so it can't be a occlusion so it is not
centric occlusion
and uh it is in between centric relation
and physiologic centriculation is a
point
which is repeatable and reproducible and
from which all the motions are
carried out easily like vertical lateral
protrusive
so in that case it should be the answer
centric relation
is the answer most accurate reproducible
relationship okay
so next is only being pure hinge moments
of the mandible occur at
so uh moments nothing to relate with
centric occlusion
uh so first option centric calculation
is rolled out second option centric
relation
later excursions later excursions is
ruled out because in later exclusive or
eccentric moments
always there will be translation
followed with
rotation so both will be there so that
is rolled out
and second center relation and terminal
hinge position it can be both
because in centric relation also pure
hinge moment is present
but if it is given like only pure hinge
moments of
mandible the first to go with this
terminal in position if it
if it is given if there is no option
uh telling you about uh dha or hinge
axis then you should
go with centric relation because that is
the sequence we are following
first is orientation vertical and
centric the same way
if the option is given like this if the
question would have been
a pure hinge movement of the condyle
is present at a position then it is a
centric relation
okay so the answer is terminal hinge
position
next is centric relation is between a
maxillar to cranium mandible to cranium
mandible to condyle two to tooth
so two tooth can't be the option so
mandible to condyle it is in the same
jar so it can't be option
maxilla to the cranium uh
maxilla to the cranium is orientation
generation and mandible to the cranium
how
is this option given just look into the
definition here also the basic
what is given in the definition it is a
condylar relationship
along the posterior slopes of articular
eminence articular remnants is related
to the
cranial part so that cranium base of the
cranium so that is why
he is relating the mandible to the
cranium that is indirect option
so you have to rule out the options like
this in every possible questionnaire
so here's the end of all the
troubleshooting issues only a few of
them are discussed here so i hope you
understand
understood everything
and sorry one last question facebook
measures relationship of maxilla 2
opening and closing access mandible
zygomatic bone men
so now it is very clear it is dha
whenever a dha is given that is opening
and closing access
then it should be marked okay facebook
measures relationship of maxillar to the
opening and closing axis so now it's
clear
we have dealt with all the mcq parts
only few of them have been dropped so
thank you for your patience listening
