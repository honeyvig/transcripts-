foreign
what are its features what are the basic
advantages of using a visualization tool
like power bi and we will talk about how
to install powerboat bi and other
features it provides and the basic setup
so let's discuss what's in it for us
today
now we will first talk about why power
bi you know why it's a popular tool and
what problem it solves what is power bi
uh and what are the primary features of
power VI which you can use in your
day-to-day data analytics visualizations
creating fancy reports creating
meaningful intelligent reports uh for
your organization for your personal use
for crunching numbers for generating
reports real time Etc
now the most popular tool for power bi
is the power bi desktop uh I'll show you
certain uh aspects of power bi desktop
and then I'll show you the steps how to
install power bi desktop on your machine
and then definitely power bi desktop is
a free tool provided by Microsoft but
then you can also subscribe for an
Enterprise version which is primarily
used by Enterprises for publishing their
data so we'll see the difference and
then overview of our dashboards which
can be created uh you know what kind of
dashboards can be created in power pi
so this is the agenda for us today
now why power bi so generally uh you
know visualization tools reporting tools
are required in order to create and
prepare
and analyze meaningful data it could be
a data for an organization it could be a
social media platform data it could be a
data from iot devices but something
which needs to be analyzed and some
intelligent inferences and data mining
has to be done on top of it now imagine
there is today we are in a world where
terabytes of data and information is
getting generated on an instantaneous
basis on minute-by-minute basis so it
becomes very essential to churn out
something meaningful something
intelligent out of it in the market
there are a lot of other tools which are
available like clicks all tricks Tableau
and power bi so power bi is a Microsoft
product which is one of the most popular
products and it comes as a free to
download product Microsoft power bi
desktop which is available and I'll show
you a couple of ways how you can install
it on your machine but why power bi is
popular is because it provides a lot of
out of the box features drag and drop
features which we will talk about in our
subsequent sessions and you know classes
but today's session is primarily focused
on giving you guys an introduction on
what what is the purpose of power bi and
what all problems it solve uh in the in
the real world so power bi allows you to
view analyze and visualize huge
quantities of data and the data could be
in any format Excel CSV text or it could
be a direct connection to a database
like SQL MySQL Azure Oracle anyone IBM
db2 so it supports n number of uh you
know data types or data sets and it's
very powerful in terms of data
connectivity so it uses powerful
compression algorithms to import and
cache the data within the dot pbix file
so it's as convenient as a simple
software if suppose you import a data
and then you prepare a report and then
you can easily share the reports uh with
your peers or someone who's
co-developing with you either through
Power bi cloud services or even you can
share the pbix file in an email
or through any other means and you can
share the data set with the concern and
they can then work on the report
independently so there are different
ways there is no uh kind of a limitation
for you know working on power bi there
are multiple ways and it is very fast it
is the most fast uh tool to work with
Excel because definitely Excel is also a
Microsoft Technology so it works very
fast on Excel based data and gives you
numbers and Reporting at a very high
speed
so now once you have imported the data
power bi allows you to model the data
allows you to work intelligently on the
data it allows you to model data in a
way that if you are importing data from
multiple Excel sheets importing data
from multiple tables you can easily
create a relationship between those
tables or data sets in power bi and then
create visually appealing reports
meaningful reports as I've been
emphasizing and make sense out of the
data no data in silos is of any use data
in Silo means a single worksheet or a
single data set will not churn out any
meaningful information until unless you
basically join it clubbit merge it Union
it append it with some other data sets
because a single data set will never be
able to hold that much amount of
information which is generally required
for a you know important report
so it has easy drag and drop
functionality with features that allow
you to copy all formatting across
similar visualizations so just like in
Microsoft Excel we use format painter to
copy the format of one cell to another
similar features very very similar to
excel products or Microsoft product they
have provided that if you have applied
uh a particular thing on a report you
can easily replicate that on any other
report the font uh the header size the
background color you don't need to do it
again and again so there's a lot of
reusable features which are also
available
okay now as I said Excel is a Microsoft
product power bi is a Microsoft product
so they have intercompatibility you can
publish data from Excel to power bi now
with the latest developments and
enhancements
as of today Excel has also plugged in a
new feature called Power pivot which
I'll uh show you later down the line but
that also allows you to do a quick
analysis no you can't create of course
complex reports or
fancy reports like power bi but Power
pivot allows you to create you know
quick measures quick functions quick
calculations on your data quickly only
in Excel so it's an Excel plugin but
whereas you know you can power bi is
also compatible with Excel so when you
create a report in power bi it gives you
inbuilt feature to export your power bi
report into Excel format directly you
don't need to do any programming for it
also
uh you can easily publish when you
publish your power bi reports it allows
you to give some inbuilt intelligence of
analyzing your reports in Excel and it
gives you all those of all those
features of exporting your power bi
reports into Excel which is not
available in any other tool or otherwise
those tools have to create plugins
create add-ins and probably they might
charge for it but Power bi comes with
lot of out of the box features which are
very very helpful for analyzing data in
Excel and vice versa
Azure Cloud now Azure itself again is a
Microsoft cloud Tech stack so using
power bi with Azure allows you to
analyze and share large volumes of data
so Azure basically Azure database or
Azure Cloud servers are meant to hold
huge amount of data and power bi allows
you to have seamless connection you can
easily connect to Azure data Lake
you can reduce the time it takes to get
insights and increase collaboration
between business analysts data engineers
and data scientists so azure
data Lake becomes the central focal
point where all your analysts Engineers
can keep working on on the centralized
piece of data and churn out their
reports data scientists primarily job is
to keep the data in a structured way
optimized way optimize the input output
operations disk operations and memory
utilization so that the reports also get
churned out in a faster manner so every
uh you know every person has their own
role in order to give a quick
refreshable report a quick rendered
report any report which is taking huge
amount of time to get rendered will not
eventually be used by the business users
because then it does not solve the
purpose the report should be fast
reports should have uh you know
appropriate filters slices and dices you
should be able to you know create the
reports or dynamically or you should be
able to analyze visualize the data
dynamically so all those visualization
features are available in power bi and
it works seamlessly either it is small
data or huge data uh it allows that you
to work on those kind of data in a
seamless fashion
right so this is just a very uh quick uh
example of how a typical dashboard looks
like dashboard is nothing but you know
you have clubbed couple of multiple
reports on a single page and you know if
you change a filter a single filter on
the page all the reports will honor that
filter and the numbers will change
accordingly so if you see the in this
example there is a filter or a drop down
or product ID product name employee name
or supervisor or a date range so
whatever date range or filter you will
apply all the reports on this dashboard
will get changed based on the filter you
have selected so power bi allows you to
get insights from data and turn insights
into action to take data driven business
decision and that is the ultimate goal
of any visualization tool that is the
purpose for which visualization tools
are bought
uh and purchased by the organizations
and data is fed into them
Now power bi fetches data from Factory
sensors social media sources to get
access to real-time analytics so that
you are always ready to make timely
business decisions so so basically there
is a feature of live connection or cut
off data connection so either you can
work on data which is deciding on a
machine and you can just work on the
cutoff data like for example it's
there's a data which is available for
sales 2017 2018 and you're just working
on a historical data it's a cut off data
or it could be possible that you want to
be connected live uh to a real-time iot
based sensor based data or social media
data like Twitter Facebook feeds or you
know you're connected to live Google
worksheets that is also possible you
just need to publish your Google sheet
for a public domain embed that you are
in into Power bi and then whoever
updates that Google sheet automatically
the power bi report will also start
honoring and consuming the new data
which is added in the Google sheet so
all those kind of real-time streaming
analytics is also possible and that is
one big feature and very important
feature of power bi which is widely used
and has a very huge uh you know Market
acceptance and Market utilization
now what is power bi
power bi is a business analytics service
provided by Microsoft that lets you
visualize your data and share insights
right so earlier
you know uh uh Microsoft used to have a
technology called ssas now they have
replaced actually ssas and SSRS with
power bi so basically you can use power
bi on the data which is there in your
Excel or any other data source and the
power bi service or power bi desktop
basically creates a connection to those
data sets and uh imported cache it and
give you a handle to it in order to work
with it so you can create these fancy
meaningful visualizations like for
example there's a geographical map if
you are importing data for a country or
a continent or a region power bi will
automatically detect that it's a
geographical information and give you a
map with latitude longitude information
and you just need to plot uh your uh
your numbers on the map either you can
use bubbles or either you can use
triangles or whatever data structure you
want to use but all the mapping will be
available geographically then you can
create pie charts which is shown in this
visualization you can create dream apps
you can create cards where you know you
can highlight the most important numbers
like sales total sales of your company
across all the regions or the growth
chart or the month on month uh you know
sales of your organization or number of
total number of products or units sold
so whatever is important and to be
highlighted for the management to take
any meaningful decision or any insights
you want to share power bi visualization
tool the power bi visualization uh
chart allows you to drag and drop and
create wonderful reports okay
so what are the features of power bi so
power bi desktop is something a
standalone tool which you need to
install on your machine it allows you to
build reports by accessing data easily
you do not need Advanced report
designing or query skills to build a
report though yes it is beneficial that
if you know some SQL programming
analytical programming or you are aware
of advanced features of any analytical
tool that might help you but that's not
a showstopper you can easily build
reports in quick turnaround time without
needing any technical background you
just need to have some analytical
mindset and you can create uh Savvy
visualization and you know analytical
reports
stream analytics as I mentioned you can
create a live connection uh with any
kind of data it could be iot it could be
media social media it could be Google
Docs it could be uh you know any other
kind of uh you know live connection it
could be a live database connection
itself so any insertions or updations or
deletions happening will automatically
reflect in your report
yes multiple data sources and that has
to be the primary criteria for any tool
to be popular if any visualization tool
is limited to certain data sets then you
know it will not be highly acceptable in
the market
and custom visualizations right so as I
showed you certain uh examples in the
past in the previous presentation uh
that feature is very important because
someone might want to look the kpis look
at the kpis from a different perspective
some management might want to look at
the kpis from a different perspective so
you need to you need to have that
capability to create different
visualization from the same data set now
let's take a look at how
to install power bi desktop on your
machine
so basically what you need to do is
you need to go to this URL
power bi Dot microsoft.com en US desktop
okay
and you need to just
enter this
now you can download it for free so just
click over here
and
it will open Microsoft store so
basically now what Microsoft have done
in the latest operating systems is that
when you are trying to download you can
actually directly go to the Microsoft
store
and search for Power bi
so let's wait for a couple of seconds
right here so power bi desktop in
Microsoft store for me it's already
installed so it's asking me to open it
I'll open it in a while but for you for
anyone who is not installed he will see
the button of install over here and it
will automatically install in your
machine and then you can easily go and
open power bi desktop now if I click
open over here
now this is the
uh UI of the power bi desktop
I'm not going to go right now in
creating reports right away we will talk
about that in a subsequent session with
sample data sets and we will cover the
features of power bi desktop one by one
but this is what it is this is the whole
tool of power bi which is having the
visualization pane all the different
visualizations are you know can be
created from this pane
then this is the pane which allows you
to select the data data fields then
there is a report view data View and
relationship view the data model view
where multiple relationships you can
create you can view the data in the grid
of the tables which you will create and
the reports so you can create multiple
reports on multiple Pages you can keep
adding pages either you can create
multiple reports on a single page and it
will become a dashboard or you can
create separate independent reports on
the single page
and these are the menu options which we
will talk about how you can change color
scheming you can do data modeling you
can create new reports and you can also
transform data which is the biggest
feature extract transform and load the
data apply different logic changing data
types massaging the information creating
new joins appending the data you know
adding new columns etc etc uh we that is
what you can do in transform data so
this itself is a whole different world
it's a dedicated topic so we will talk
about that in our subsequent sessions so
what's in it for us today we will be
learning how to connect to data
different data types data files like
Excel PDF then what are the different
data importing modes and then I will
also show you practically different sets
how to import them in power bi and use
it for your visualization purpose now
what are the steps to connect to data so
now we will go directly into Power bi
and try to import one by one few most
commonly and popularly used data sets
which are most commonly used in a
day-to-day activity rest of course there
are power bi supports n number of data
sources but we will do something
practical on the most popular ones so
let's let's open our power bi
now this is my power bi and first I want
to show you that how can I import data
directly from a web page and import the
data now it is asking for a URL in order
to import data
so what I have done is I have created a
Google Excel sheet with simple data with
rows and columns and what I have done is
I have shared this sheet as published to
web
okay so you just need to say publish to
the web the link as web page and
say done it's it's automatically
published and say link so copy the link
which you have published on the web copy
this link
and then go back to your tableau
paste that link over here and click ok
Now power bi will try to establish a
connection with this Google doc sheet
because it's published on the web
thank you
need to wait for a while while it is
reading
okay now it has read one of the HTML
tables I'll select this one now you can
see it has it is showing me a preview of
the table which is there on my
Google sheet right it has 11 rows so it
has all showed all the 11 rows so now I
can go and transform this data because I
can see my headers are there starting
from the second row so there's an
opportunity for me to transform the data
so I'll go and transform it so that it
looks clean
okay so first is I need to remove the
first row which is the
null row remove the top rows
okay and then I need to use the first
row now as a header so you just click
this option use first row as headers
that's it so now if you see my row ID
order ID order date shifted all my data
is now ready so I can say close and
apply
click apply changes
now this is an example of web data
import
you can go and preview your data
right now the biggest advantage of this
data connection is that it's a live data
so for example I insert another row
let me change the order ID
some some I've seen some basic stuff and
I
it's Auto saved Ctrl s now I'll go to my
tableau and I'll refresh
now you can see as I refreshed my
power query editor I click refresh all
and I got my new row which is there in
the live data I got that fetched from my
foreign
number 12 so I have to say close and
apply
now you can see the new row the row
number 12 is now available in my new
data set in the data set because it's a
live connection it's a live connection
with the web-based Google sheet okay so
this is one important way in which you
can import data
now let's try to import data from a text
file
now I have already prepared our text
file called
sub categories Dot txt
now let me just open it in a notepad now
it's a very plain simple file tab
separated file in which you have product
subcategory ID subcategory name and
product category key so basically to
which product category this particular
sub product belongs to right so what I
am going to do is I'm going to go back
to my get data option
and I'm gonna select text slash CSV
option
and I'm gonna select option mod product
subcategories.txt
okay so now power bi has identified that
it's a tab delimited file it has
recognized the headers
Etc right and I can now directly load
this file
okay so now once the data is imported in
power bi
it is like
irrelevant to me it's a composite data
in in Port I'm doing right so in my
presentation when I'm talking about
importing data there are different
importing modes right import our data
import can happen through different ways
okay
one is direct query mode in which I
create a live connection to the database
which I'll also show you uh using MySQL
and Ms SQL server and also you can do a
composite mode in which you can have
data imported from Excel plus you can
have direct query modes so you can have
multiple uh modes to connect and create
a composite data model and that's what
we are doing right now in our practical
so what we are doing over here is one we
have imported data from the web second
we have imported data from a text table
now after doing text now our next task
is to import from CSV let's try another
one so now I have imported product
subcategory
now I'll import
a CSV file so again I'll choose the
option Text slash CSV and now in this
CSV file let me open this CSV file and
show you what it is it
so this is a list of all my products
product key product sub category Key
Products uh stock keeping unit Etc a
simple CSV file and I'm gonna import
that
okay so now it is identified the
delimiter is comma rather than a tab and
it has already recognized the headers
correctly so I load it
okay so now my products are there
product subcategories are there for
product categories now what I have done
is I have created a Excel mode now so
now Excel I am using to import my
product category
so now I have to click on the option of
import data from Excel and I'll say
product categories
select the sheet load
and now so my products product
categories product subcategories do with
different uh data storage types but
still now the data is imported into
Power bi it is a composite data model
now another very important data type
which you can import is the PDF also
right so what I have done is I have
created a PDF called customers my
customers data is lying in a PDF so what
I've done is I've created a PDF
which has data for some columns are
there like you know customer key prefix
first name last name birthdate marital
status gender email address annual
income total children etc etc so this is
the data set
which I have created in PDF so what I'm
gonna do is
I'm going to select PDF now
and import customers.pdf
and see it has recognized my table on
page one which I'm gonna load
okay
you can rename this as PDF
table
okay so this basically these are the
different type of
data
types we have imported PDF Excel text
CSV and web page
now let's take a look at another
interesting data set which you want to
import is the my SQL Server data set
so what I have done is I've already
installed MySQL server on my local
instance and there's already a schema of
SQL live tutorial over there and I have
certain tables already
prepared over there like Department
employee Etc so my goal is now to import
this data or create a live connection
with this data set
now in order to import
my SQL database Connection in power bi
you need to First
download a
connector MySQL power bi connector so
you need to go to this link
and then click on download and install
the MySQL connector based on the
operating system you have you click on
download and install it
after you have done this go back to
Power bi
and then give
the IP address of the database in my
case it's there in this local machine
and the schema which I want to import is
SQL live tutorial so I'll give the name
click connect
okay now it's connected so now it is
asking me which particular tables you
want to create a connection with I am
choosing department and employee
and I'm just loading them
okay so now this is the exact data which
is there in the employee and Department
in MySQL okay so this is one example of
how to create connectivity between power
bi and MySQL now I want to do the same
thing using
SQL Server Microsoft SQL Server so I
have also installed Microsoft SQL server
on my machine
and I have used the SQL Express so this
is the name of my server so which I'll
copy the server name
and
go to get data
select SQL Server
and for now database is optional I can
say direct query click ok
okay now it is showing me what all
tables I can import so in my SQL Server
tutorial
in my SQL Server I have
I have these three tables customers
employee tuition Olympic events so I can
use probably the customers one which is
now you can see this is the data the
customer's data which is lying in my SQL
Server okay so I can preview it and load
it
so now you can you can preview the data
in uh
power bi that is this is the data so I
can rename his customers from
mssql
and this is from
MySQL
and
okay so now
this is not the only data
sets you can import now if you take a
look at the options which power bi gave
what different type and variations of
data it can it has compatibility to
import from
okay so we can just take a look at the
categorization on the left hand side
first there are file based like Excel
text XML Json is also possible you can
evenly directly import an entire folder
and within the folder whatever uh data
types of files are there it will detect
it PDF power key or even SharePoint
folder which is itself Microsoft uh
technology then different kind of
databases SQL server and MySQL we just
saw but it's not only limited to this
you can connect to Microsoft Access
ssas Oracle database IBM db2 postgres
SCI base teradata and then sap
databases Amazon redshift Impala vertica
Snowflake and N number of databases
which are there in the market today
Amazon
Etc
then it also allows you to connect with
its own power platforms power bi
platforms data mods power bi data flows
data boards Etc Azure there are
different kind of storage
mechanisms in Azure and Azure itself is
a Microsoft Technology so it has a
compatibility of a lot of azure uh based
data storages like Azure SQL database
blob storage uh Azure data breaks right
Azure HD insights path so if you have
those kind of services running on your
observed cloud services you can even
import them over here
now online services like you know you
have erps running uh or some data which
is shared on the internet if you want to
import it uh that is also possible
through certain products uh Dynamics 365
Microsoft Exchange online Salesforce
Google analytics Adobe analytics GitHub
LinkedIn sales if you want to do some
analysis of some social networking uh
you know feeds that also you can import
and then other miscellaneous are also
their web-based hive R script python
script if there's something to import
get data from uh Google Sheets like we
saw one example in our video right now
so there are multiple options available
now once you have imported the data
which is relevant to you
um in our subsequent sessions we will
see how to create relationships but just
giving you a glimpse that whatever data
you are importing power bi Auto detect
certain relationships and it will create
for you but then you can go and manually
also change so this is the composite
data model which is getting created in
the back end while you are importing the
data you can easily go and manage these
relationships either keep them as is you
can delete and create new ones manually
so there is no limitation in that
so this is what we have witnessed we
have imported data from different files
types data types and then you know we
have tried once it is imported into uh
Power bi then there is no limitation of
how you use it you can create
visualization across different data sets
and then create your
standard reports
so this is the example of importing data
from web importing data from a database
from a PDF
and then once you have data you can
shape and combine data you can basically
do what whatever transformation you want
to do you want to uh make joins merge
the data so for example if we go back to
our power bi and if I go back to my
transform data section
now as I have now different data sets
available with me I have I can do any
kind of you know operation
transformation on the data right uh
so like I showed you I uh upgraded the
header row because one of the imported
data was not showing the header
correctly uh or this columns like this
exact one column is extra I can remove
the column
right all those Transformations whatever
I do in the back end gets captured in
the applied steps section right
this is the customer data you can create
uh you can merge it you can append it uh
you know with other data sets right
let's for example I want to create a
merge data set of my categories and
subcategories so I can say mer selectors
two data sets and say merge queries as
new
and
I can select product categories and
product subcategories select
product category key on both the side
and then they do a left autogen so
whatever product categories are there
I'll get the subcategories associated
with it and I'll create a new
table
which will have
now I have the table which has the
category and the subcategory and
subcategory in one table itself so I can
rename it now to as
category
sub category
table it's a it's a merge basically it's
a join between category and subcategory
now I have a common table right and I
can close and apply
so imagine I have created a new table
which is imported created from one data
set is which is Excel page another data
set which is text based
see this category subcategory table so
now I can use it
the way I want in my visualization
reports so that's what the presentation
says right that once you have uh the
imported data you can shape you can
combine you can adjust you can do
whatever transformation you want to do
and create your visualization okay so
what topics we are going to cover today
we are going to talk about different
types of data modeling and the most
important part
and aspect of data modeling is the
cardinality the cardinality which you
basically decide after reviewing the
nature of data and after we've imported
it what kind of cardinality you have to
basically highlight right and there are
different type of cardinalities which
you might have heard earlier also if you
are from PL SQL background like one is
to one one is too many Etc we will we
will talk about that
now what are the different types of data
modeling now dimensional data modeling
is one of the most popular and most uh
you know widely used uh modeling in
dimensional data modeling you have
Master data uh like for example customer
data date store data product data so
these are like you know uh less
frequently changing data sets so there
is an organization right and you have
set of customers their email ID phone
numbers
Etc that will change less frequently as
compared to the sales transactions
because transactions are happening every
day every minute so sales is a more fast
changing data set in dimensional
modeling which is in the terminology of
data uh is also called as a fact and
customer store product which are like
more of static data and less changeable
data is sometimes called a diamond
so this is a typical dimensional data
model which is typically used uh
sometimes right and then there is
another model which is relational model
this is a typical model which we have
been using in database design like you
know primary key foreign key
relationships so for example you have a
customer who has purchased a product so
probably he might have the customer
might have the details of the product
which is processed and you will make a
join between customer and product table
and even you can make a join between
product or product type or customer or
product types customer table will also
have a key to the product type so this
is less conducive for reporting but it
is more of a transactional relational
model but of course this is also
feasible but from the power bi
perspective when we talk about reporting
and visualization this is the most
extensively used dimensional data model
and this is what we are going to see in
our example now so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you certain data
sets first we will prepare and create
certain offer data sets and then we will
Import in our sample power bi file and
then slowly slowly we will create the
relationships
now one important thing which you need
to understand that in power bi if you go
to Power bi there is an option that that
power bi Auto detect new relationships
after data is loaded and import
relations from the data source on first
load so for example if you are importing
the data from a database where you have
already defined the primary keys and the
foreign key relationships so uh that is
the first option which power bi will
Auto detect and secondly if suppose you
are importing two different kind of data
sets one is Excel one is csb and if
power bi detects a common column key
columns it will auto detect a
relationship which you can go and later
change modify manage in your
relationship
menu manage relationship menu in power
bi which I'm going to show you okay so
if I open a power bi and this is where
the option lies go to file
go to options and setting options
data load
and these are the two options which are
by default check you can uncheck it and
auto and manually prepare relationships
there's no limitation to that but if you
uh keep it checked then power bi will do
its job to detect the relationships okay
now coming to the next important factor
cardinality
now before I start playing around with
my data and start showing you certain
relationships it's very important to
understand these four types of
cardinalities one is many to one right
so basically
many to one means that many orders
contain data of One customer so per
order one customer is there so from
customer to order or product or delivery
address it's a one-to-many relationship
and from the other side from order to
customer perspective it's a many-to-one
relationship
okay
second other cardinality is one is to
one one is to one relationship is only
applicable when you are saying it's an
extension of the current table so for
example in one table you have employee
details and you are extending the
details of the employee in another table
like employee address employee ID so
that is like one is to one there is no
multiple records of a single employee in
the address table only one employee ID
exists right
now one is too many as I said is the
reverse side of Venice to one okay so in
customer table only one customer record
exists per customer and one customer can
place many orders for multiple products
and can also have multiple delivery
addresses so that way this is a typical
one is too many relationship we will be
seeing this example also in our sample
data set
and last is the many-to-many
relationship now many to many is a very
typical example so which I'm going to
show you practice practically and in our
case we will see that like for example
you have placed an order for a
particular product uh you know but there
are multiple fulfillments which has
happened so suppose you made order for
10 products but at the back end when the
company is fulfilling it is first
fulfilling the first two products then
the rest three so basically you the
Fulfillment is happening in batches so
one order
ID might have a multiple fulfillments
for the same order ID so there will be a
multi many to many relationship which
I'll show you practically so now with
this background let's
start importing our data now the first
important thing which we need to import
is the Master data so first I'll import
all my master Dimensions which are which
I'm going to you know use in my example
so first is the customers table
customers data
so this is the customer details the
customer key prefix first name last name
birth date marital status and gender
some redundant columns are also present
but we'll remove it
so my customer data is loaded now
today's session is all about this
section of modeling so we will keep our
Focus over here
okay now some columns probably some
blank columns are there I can select
them and say delete from model
yes
okay so now this is my customers data
with the relevant columns and the key
per customer customer key
now there's no relationship in this
model right now right because only
single table is there and the associate
data is only imported now let me also
import my another important master table
is the products
select the products data product key
product subcategory product SKU product
name model name product description
color size so just see all the relevant
information only specific to the product
is available so I'll import it
okay now see there's no relationship
between product and customers directly
because until unless a customer makes an
order places an order for a particular
product there is no join right so now
between these two tables the most
important now another table which will
now make sense is the sales order table
sales table
now I am assuming that power bi have
Auto detected the relationship now you
can see that because I've already uh
ticked that check box now let's see what
power bi what relations power bi has
Auto detected let's first say check the
relation between customer and sales I'll
double click this
uh joint now what it has done is it has
created a join of many to one
between sales and customer so what does
that mean is that one customer has can
place many orders right and that is that
it is detected by the quality of the
data and the data sampling which power
bi has done you can also reverse this
relationship here I can select customers
and I can select sales now it has become
one too many so that you can also do
manually so that is what I said whatever
power bi is detected it is up to the
description of power bi internal
configuration and algorithm but you can
go and change it so this is now you can
this is by default active so we want to
keep it active One customer many sales
orders cross filter Direction means that
only from customers to sales is the
filter applicable not reverse I'll come
to this with my another example but
first let's
change the relationship so one is to
many means from One customer and many
sales orders
similarly let's see what has happened at
the product side
of the relationship
similarly power bi many sales orders for
one product you can for simplicity's
sake you can say products
sales
product key is the join now just focus
one more thing please also see the the
column on which the join is is the grade
column grade out column product key is
also here and product key is also there
and it is what we wanted so one is too
many relationship from product to sales
table and act
now looks fine this is something which
is looking logical and probably now we
can
proceed further to create a report
now let me explain the cross filtering
with an example
now for example I want to check in a
report
that what is the count of products which
uh which a particular customer has
ordered
okay so what I'll do is I'll select the
product count of product name
now if you see
and for each customer in front of each
customer name the count is coming as 293
293 it is getting repetitive because
because there is a one-way filter
Direction filter between customers and
sales and sales and products right so
this join
is single sided it means that from
customer to product you can't find a
relationship because it's a single side
cross filter right what does this if I
change it to both it means that it is
equal to a join between product and
sales and every product detail now is
appended to the sales table so if I want
to make you visualize this you need to
go here
I'll first open my sales table
we can also open it here let's make
click it is okay now if I click OK you
can see the single arrow is changed to
Double Arrow it means it's a it's a both
site filter
So when you say a both site filter it
means that implicitly within power bi
you can imagine that all the product
columns now will get appended because of
both ways filter you have applied and if
you go to your report now see the change
of the numbers now for T20 so the total
count of products across all my
customers come out to be 293 now the
report looks uh correct if I change the
relationship from back to single between
product and sales then you can't make a
join between customers and products
basically you can't derive the product
count from the product table see this
if you have to live with it then you
would have to go to the sales table get
the product key and get the value of
count of product key but that is not
correct
okay
so if you want a report in which you
want the count of product name
and even if you want a count of distinct
product name so this will not come
correctly you would have to go and
change the
direction of the filter which is from
single to both so this is a typical
example there where you want to use a
two-directional filter
now let's proceed further and import
other data set in order to give show you
another example
now I want to show you an example of
1 is to
1.
so I have another table which is called
customer details so the key in this
table is again customer key but only
email address annual income total
children education level Etc other
details of the customer is there
so I'm loading the customer details now
you see it has Auto detected a one is to
one relationship
what is the meaning of one is to one
means One customer key only has one
entry in customer details there is no
multiple entry so if you click this
button
it's a one is to one and the cross
filter can be both or single doesn't
matter because one customer will have
only one value you can make this as
active okay and if you go to the
customer report table you can now easily
associate a
email address with the first name you
will get one is to one
record
so now you can see that with one is to
one relationship
with the first name I have Associated
the email ID and for each email ID
there is a Associated first name method
so this is an example of
one is to one relationship so in this
example what we have explained is that
for each customer there is an Associated
customer detail right uh so you have the
first name email address education level
homeowner occupation and total children
count
so in this report what we have done is
uh if you click over here so the first
name and the email address okay so
there's a one is to one relationship
and then
and if you drag
the customer key
report takes time to render and even if
you can
so this is the reporting output you have
the customer key first name associated
email address and the count of product
names uh which the customer has ordered
now this is an example of 1 is to 1.
now I want to show you an example of
many too many now for that I'll import
my
fulfillment data set
okay now in my fulfillment data set
there is a column for
order number so basically what I'll do
is I'll drag order number from here to
here
okay so now what has
um
uh Power bi detected
I'll do one thing I'll select sales over
here
fulfillment over here and order number
to odd number
okay so it's a many-to-many relationship
so it means that per order I have
created multiple batches to fulfill that
particular order now
many to many relationship is a
definitely a candidate for both ways
cross filter detection uh a Direction
but you can you can check that but
definitely uh Power bi shows a warning
that this relationship has cardinality
to many to many and this should only be
used if it is expected that neither
column contains unique values okay so we
know that fact that's why we are
accepting this relationship as many to
many because we know there are multiple
order numbers over here in the sales
table which are mapped to the multiple
order numbers in the Fulfillment table
we'll click ok
now you want to keep the uh
uh direction as both ways or One
Direction that is up to you the way you
want to map the report so I can double
click over here
and you can even click so now you can
select from which way single filter you
want from fulfillment to sales or sales
to fulfillment I'll prefer sales to
fulfillment and click ok
okay now we have our all our different
kind of relationships over here uh which
we have tried to shortlist one to many
many to one one to one which is uh this
example and many too many
now if I show you further relationships
which you can keep on adding like for
example I have a uh the example of
territories
now in which particular territory the
sales was done
map it over here
okay so now it's a typical one is too
many relationship because territory is
my master table uh where I have a static
list of continent country region and it
is mapped to the uh territories which
are for in which my orders have been
placed so it's a typical one is too many
so that way you know you can keep on
adding data then you have
uh details of returns
now this is another transactional table
which is about the orders which have
been returned rather than being you know
returned by the customers so you have a
product key
and so automatically power bi has
detected a relationship between the
product key and the product uh table
right and even if you can join the
territory key in which territory the
return has happened
right so mostly the most common
relationship which you will observe is
the one is too many because
as I told earlier the most common
relational model is the dimensional
model uh the static data the slow
changing Dimensions the scds are the
master tables and the most frequent
changing are the fact tables so if I
talk about a typical dimensional model
the Fulfillment table sales table and
the territory stable sorry the
Fulfillment table sales table and my
returns table are the fact tables of my
data model now so far what we have done
as per our last session is that we did
data modeling on the different data sets
which we had imported in power bi like
products sales data returns fulfillment
customer details uh and customer Master
data calendar details Etc so in the last
session we prepared a data model and
established the relationships between
these different data sets like one is to
one one is to many many to one one is to
one Etc and we saw the examples now once
our relational model is prepared our
data model is prepared now our next
activity is to create certain additional
columns which we want to derive basis
the data which we have imported
so for example I'll start with my
product data set now in my product data
set I want to introduce a column which
basically
categorizes that if any product which
has a color uh you know red black or
gray I am going to tag it as a colored
product rest I'm gonna say not a colored
product right so all these are like
example of byte type product skus so for
that now in order to introduce a new
column you just need to do what you need
to select the table in the data grid go
to the table tools and say new column
okay so column will get appended to the
rightmost part and you will start seeing
a uh formula section typical to like you
get in your Excel now I'm gonna say that
the name of my column is going to be
byte type color okay and I'm just
creating a if condition if
product
color
is equal to
black
okay
or
or if it is equal to red
or if it is equal to
Gray
then
say yes it's a colored product I'll say
no
okay so now you can see this is the
product color red and black they are
saying bike type color Yes blue is no
multi is no etc etc so this is a classic
example of an if and else condition
based conditional column
okay so you can create such columns now
second column custom column which I want
to create is I'm going to call as
discount
now this is the pricing of my products I
want to associate certain discounts
which I am ready to give to my customers
this is the product category like what
is the pricing of the category again I'm
going to use make use of if else but in
a nested way so if I am saying if my
product
price is less than 100
then I will give
zero percent of
uh zero percentage of discount so 0 into
product price just to keep it consistent
now I'm saying
else
if less than 100 and 0 else I'll check
again that
if
the price is
less than
500 then I'm ready ready to give one
percent discount
on the
product price
else
I'll move further so like this I have
created a formula
so what I'm saying is if product price
is less than 100 give zero percent if it
is less than 500 then give one percent
less than 2 000 then 1.5 percent less
than three thousand then two percent and
otherwise
else less than three thousand if a two
percent else three percent right now
after this column is created
now you can check right so this C the
product price for this particular
product it is less than 100 so that's
why there is no discount it is
uh between 100 to 200 then this has been
given a one percent discount so like
this all the discount call up is now
calculated now this column is available
just like a regular column in my product
table
now after this I'll go to my sales table
now in sales table I want to
identify a
create a column called as cost
there is no product cost column over
here so that will be derived
so let's create a column
called as cost
and it is derived by order quantity
into now the cost of the product
is in the product table and I know I
have already created a relationship
between product and sales table
so I just need to select the product
cost column now only keyword which I
have to use in power bi is the related
keyword so this will pick up the
relation
and now for this particular sale order
the cost has already been derived so
this order number this is the cost for
which uh the product has is the costing
of the product for this particular order
thank you
okay
now I'm gonna create another conditional
column over here called as
order status
I am saying if
any order whose order quantity is
greater than 2
then for my organization it's an urgent
order
else it is a
normal order
so this is my
order status column and I have my order
quantity
urgent or normal
so any order which has order quantity
one is normal any order which is having
order quantity as greater than
2 is
urgent you can see this
so there's a this whole power bi
uh tabs and sheets allow you to also
review the data what you're doing so
it's very convenient
now
I have my sales data now what I want to
bring within the sales is my discount
column so here also I want to bring the
discount which I have created
so I'll say discount
[Music]
discount will be order quantity
into
related
product discount right so the discount
calculated column which I had created
under products I'll bring over here
now I am creating the order level
discount so if you see for this
particular order these are 25 uh
uh you know for 25 rupee discount at the
cost is 100 000 rupees okay
and what is the order price now so I
have taken the order cost the discount
now I have to create a column call as
price order price so that will be
again order quantity
into related
price which is per product
price enter
okay so now I have the cost the discount
and the price right available with me
now I want to
calculate the total
uh
total revenue total profit and loss
right
per order how much
so first I'll calculate per order how
much revenue I am generating so now I
have to generate a column called as
Revenue
revenue is price
minus discount
so 1700 minus 25
1700 minus 25 2071 minus 42 and if I
want to calculate the profit per order
then it is
Revenue
Minus cost
okay so now you can see you know typical
custom columns calculated columns which
we have created are all playing around
with the number numeric values numeric
data primarily and trying to give
inferences into per order cost discount
per order price revenue and profit so
typical calculation columns which I have
prepared in front of you
foreign
variations of custom columns
I'll create certain columns for text
based custom columns calculated columns
using Text data so I'm now moving
towards my customer table in which I
have customer key prefix first name last
name birth date marital status and
gender
now I want to create a new column in
which I want to derive the age of each
customer as of today right so I'll use
another function a date function called
as
date div
now date div so I want the difference
between the birth date of the customer
and as of today
in years
okay so this customer as of today 68
year old one is 74 68 57 Etc so this is
one derivation of uh calculated column
of age
let's take another example now this is a
text based column where I want to
derive the full name of the customer
now here I'll say first
lowercase in lower case I'll concatenate
the prefix
then ampersand
peace
ampersand
first name
ampersand
space
ampersand
last name
and closing brackets
Etc
full name
okay so this is an example of full name
in low cases
now another calculated column
conditional column at the customer level
I want to identify a flag which says who
is my Target customer base is the
demographics shared over here Target
customer
so I'll say
if
the marital status is equal to
m
and
total children
hurry
and total children annual income
so okay so let me change the logic a bit
so marital status is M and
age
is
less than
50.
these customers are my Target customers
okay so I would say
yes
else no
see this
he's a marital status is married Logan
Diaz and age is less than 50 else
everyone so if I try to filter
so these are the my Target customers
69 out of 1178 so this is just a
conditional column but a logical
condition an example which I'm trying to
highlight over here
okay now
let's look at certain calendar
date oriented columns calculated columns
very typical like now I have a simple
date column now I'll keep adding certain
columns which are you know which help
you which will help you understand how
we can uh
you know do some calculations on the
dates so like for example I want a date
which is 12 days after the current date
the date in the column so just simple 12
Days After
select the date and add 12.
now if you see the date format you can
go and change the format at the top
and if whatever you feel like like this
now see 12 days after first gen 2015 is
13 Jan 2005. you can go and change the
format and other details
let me also show you if I go to my cost
and other columns I can go and change
the format this is like a currency cost
is currency so I can go and
select the
change the currency type and
you can even show the dollar value or
whatever currency type it is
so for numbers you can do currency or
text or dates you can select the format
so this is available at the column tools
level
now in customers
like we had our
column of full name so now what all
things are available format as text okay
data type text so very minimal options
are there with date you have options of
the date format
now next
I want a column which defines the expiry
date okay so eight months prior
to the
expiry date with this which is coming up
in eight months so I'll create a column
called as eight months expiry
and then there is a e date function I'll
use that I'll use my
date in the data set
comma I'll say eight so now this date
column will append eight months to my
actual date and again I can go and
change the format
correct
now another important column like I want
to know the date name
so I'll use a function called as
format
and I'll select my calendar date column
and I'll say give me the DDD
format of it
so it will give me the day name the day
the day name of on that particular date
next
years in between
so I want the ears in between the
today's date and the date of my calendar
so equal to
date diff
the calendar date
comma today
comma year
end
seven years 2015 to 2022
then last date of the month
so if I want what is the last date of
this particular calendar month
I need to use a function EO month which
is there and label in the
power bi so I'll say
last date of the month
equal to
EO month
then
just select the calendar CSV date
comma
0 in months and enter
change the format
then similarly start of the month
so I'll use a function called start of
month
so for for all January dates end of the
month is 31st Jan and start of the month
will remain 1st of Jan
change the format
next I want to know what is the week
number of that particular date so now
there is an inbuilt function called
week number week num and just pass the
date and you will get
the weak number first week of the year
second week of the year Etc
now another very
good example is whether the weak
day is a weekday or a weekend right so
what is it's a weak type okay
so I'll check I'll put a if condition
and there is a function called weekday
and I'll pass the calendar
if it is less than 6
it means it's a weekday else it's a
weekend
so all Saturday
and Sunday Day news will come as
weekends or else everything else will
come as weekly
so these are very different variations
of different column types calculated
columns which is a very important
utility and uh and any Bravo bi project
you will definitely be ending up
creating n number of calculated columns
to derive your numbers to prepare your
reports but it's important to understand
what all things we can do yes there are
n number of functions available in power
bi but what I have tried to Showcase
over here is some important functions
but basis your utility basis your
problem statement you can look up for a
relevant function in the power bi
dictionary
now with this
introduction to calculated column this
is the base for us to now get into our
next session where we'll be talk we will
be talking about creating Dax measures
and Dax functions we will be using power
bi Dax functions which is much more
powerful than simple uh calculated
columns where you can do more uh complex
calculations uh you can calculate totals
and then use them in the reports so for
that we will look up into our next
session
so I hope you guys had a great learning
session and I'll meet you in my next
session thank you
