hey everyone welcome to another session
by simply learn in this session we will
learn about typescript generics
generics is the ability to design a
component that can work over several
types rather than a single one it is one
of the critical tools in the toolkit for
creating reusable components in c sharp
and java languages
this enables users to use these
components while also allowing them to
utilize their kinds
let's see what's in it for you in this
session
in this session we will first start with
understanding what is typescript
generics followed by which we will look
at why to use typescript generics
proceeding further we will understand
the typescript generic types generic
classes and generic constraints
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
click down the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn
so without wasting any further time
let's get started
what is typescript generics
typescript generics is a tool for
creating reusable components in
typescript
rather than working with a single data
type it builds a component that can
interact with various data kinds it
enables users to consume these
components while also using their own
kinds
generics ensure that the software is
both adaptable and scalable over time
type safety is provided via generics
without sacrificing performance or
efficiency
the type variable in typescript is used
to denote types and uses generics
generic functions have the same type as
non-generic functions with type
arguments specified first as in function
declarations
why use typescript generics
consider the below code without generics
the identity function is a function that
returns whatever is sent in as a
parameter we could either provide the
identity function with the specific type
or identity function with any type
while the use of any is generic when we
use any the function accepts any kind
for the type of argument as a result
when function returns we lose
information about what the type was the
only information we have is that any
type could be produced if we pass in a
string
we need the means to capture the
argument type in such a way that we can
use it to signify what is been returned
as well we will utilize a type variable
here which is a form of variable that
deals with types rather than values
the identity function now has a type
variable called time this type allows us
to capture the type of data the user
supplies for example a number or a
string so that we can use it later we
are going to utilize the type as a
return type once more
we can use two methods to invoke generic
identity function after writing it one
method is to pass all the parameters to
the function including the type argument
the other method is to utilize type
argument inference
now let us look at the typescript
generic types
generic functions have the same type
parameters as non-generic functions with
the type parameters listed first as in
the function declarations
we can call the generic type parameter
in the type by whatever name we like as
long as the number of type variables and
how they have utilized match
the generic type can also be written as
a call signature of an object literal
type
typescript generic classes
a generic class resembles a generic
interface in appearance
following the name of class generic
classes contain a generic type parameter
list enclosed in angular brackets
although this is relatively literal use
of the generic number class you will
notice that nothing restricts it to
using only the number type instead we
may have used string or even more
complicated objects
a class type has two sides a static side
and an instant side generic classes are
only generic on the instant side not on
the static side hence static members
can't use the class type parameters
while working with them
although this is relatively literal use
of the generic number class you will
notice that nothing restricts it to
using only the number type
instead we may have used string or even
more complicated objects
putting the type parameter on the class
itself like the interface ensures that
all of the classes property functions
with the same type
typescript generic constraints
typescript generic types allow you to
work with any data type we can however
use constraints to limit it to a
specific types
a type parameter can be declared that is
limited by another type parameter for
instance in this case we would like to
retrieve a property from an object based
on its name we'll put a constraint
between two types to ensure that we are
not obtaining a property that does not
exist on the object
now let us jump into visual studio code
and understand typescript generics more
better so here we are in visual studio
code the prerequisite is we need to
install node.js
and we need to install typescript
so let's get started
let's call the function
function identity
identity function is a function that
returns whatever is sent in as a
parameter we could either provide the
identity function with a specific type
or with any type
so this is the identity function with
specific type so if we had to write the
same
in the identity function with the
specific type so what we'll do
we'll write it with the specific type
so to write it with any type
what we have to do is we'll write any
in place of string
so while the use of n is generic when we
use any the function accepts any kind of
the type of the argument as a result
when the function returns we lose the
information about what that type was the
only information we have is that any
type could have produced if we pass in a
string
so we are passing up the type string
here and maybe we can pass this type as
number as well instead of string
so i can make this function generic by
passing the type any but this will lose
information about what type was passed
so for that we need the means to capture
the argument type in such a way that we
can use it to signify what is being
returned as well so we will utilize a
type variable here which is of the form
variable that deals with the types
rather than the values
so for that we will write the code as
we'll create a function
identity
so here the identity function now has a
type variable called the type
this type allows us to capture the type
of data the user supplies for example a
number or a string so that we can use it
later we are going to utilize a type as
a return type once more so we can use
one of the two methods to invoke the
generic identity function after writing
it
so i have written a few lines of code
with generic type function
so here i have written a few lines of
code in this example the type variable t
is specified with the function in the
angle brackets get array
so the type variable t also is used to
specify the type of the arguments and
then return the value
this means that the data type which will
be specified at the time of a function
call will also be the data type of the
arguments and of the return value
so we call generic function getarray
and the pass numbers array the strings
array for example calling the function
as get array number and we have passed
the numbers as 16 and decimal number 2.0
and 55
this will replace t with the number and
so the type of the arguments and the
return value will be the number array in
the same way for get array string we
have passed the values as hello world
the type arguments and the return value
will be a string array so now the
compiler will show an error if you try
to add a string in number array or a
number in string array thus we get the
type checking advantage
so it is not recommended but we can also
call a generic function without
specifying the type variable the
compiler will use the inference to set
the value of t on the function based on
the data type of the argument values
now let us run this code and check
so let us go to the terminal and let us
first run the command
typescript.cmd and the file name type.ts
enter
now let us run the file
nodetype.js
and here we go
it's showing the number array as
1.5 to 36 and 400 we have pushed two new
values one for the number array that is
value 400 and for the string array hello
typescript
so with that we have reached the end of
