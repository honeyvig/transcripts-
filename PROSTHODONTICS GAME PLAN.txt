yeah hi - so now I'm just going to give
you a brief idea of how we are going to
tackle this prosthodontics okay so
according to Nate blueprint it is going
to carry 14 marks which includes a part
of dental materials also because prosto
will have dental materials in it prosto
will have implants in it okay even other
areas of other subjects are also covered
in pro so here and there but the primary
focus is on prosthodontics and secondary
you can add dental materials and
implants which are slightly going to be
part of this so in the broad sense I am
going to divide this into four or five
parts so of course you are very good at
complete denture then the RPD then the
fpd then fpd
is going to include your implants and
it's going to Mac so facial processes
and of course you want you can add
dental materials part of prosthetics
also okay so this is a rough area and I
feel most of we are good at CD because
we do run okay we know the steps we know
everything in detail of course we are
going to have a better idea but I feel
complete denture we are good at I feel
fpd
and our PD is the areas where you need
to focus more and compared to our PDF PD
is easy in preparation point of view for
MCQs and everything FPD is a bit easy
okay so you need to be more focused on
implants in specific because implants is
what the modern dentistry is more
focused of and of course I agree
implants is again and very very
important topic which is missing in our
books it is missing in our books if you
see your the basic and secure books what
you are going through implants was not
at best implants is not
properly and of course if you see in the
examination hall you will have a decent
number of new questions or new areas in
the implants and of course even Maxo
facial processes word we know but the
latest advances and everything goes to
max of facial processes and again your
basic mcq books are lagging in this
particular area where you need to give
more importance and for example
particularly exams like aims ok Ames and
PGA they're more focused on implants and
Max of facial processes compared to any
other areas in frost or of course dental
materials part of process already
covered but we are going to discuss
again few important areas which were not
covered properly when we are going with
the dental materials discussion so this
is a moral view of prosthetics the books
what you need to carry or you need to
handle is according to the order of
importance according to the order you
need to carry this book because few
people they have more time few people
they have less time okay so but make a
note whether you have good time or
whether you have less time in handling
this particular subject make sure you
follow this order okay the first and
foremost important thing that you need
to handle is one is your that can be
either your dental pulse or get that can
be either your dentist prosthetic part
okay and the second important thing that
you need to handle is your daily
discussions and your videos and few
people who are attending the offline
centres of course your offline classes
are very very important maybe these are
going to and these two things are going
to nullify the competition between the
competitors because most of the
competitors they read these two books
and once you want to have an upper hand
when compared with your competitor these
three things are going to make you stand
better in heavy computation okay so the
third preference is of course once you
receive your PP books probably in this
month so these are going to be the third
like once you are done with this part
and this part then you can easily sit
and solve your PP books part of
prosthetics which is going to be
something like a revision something like
a catalyst or something like something
like a power play in the in the word of
cricket okay you they're going to
enhance your preparation at the best
okay so this is the primary requirement
along with you need to carry the books
or the things that what you have done in
your final year okay so hopefully most
of you have read an ALICE for me it's
not bad okay it's not bad to keep it as
a reference for the preparation point
also so whatever you have done please do
the same don't don't get extraordinary
things like rosensteil or schellenberg
or some XYZ books into your preparation
which is going to be a difficult task
just focus on what you are if you have
any doubts related to this particular
topic if you want more clarity then go
back to your nas for me if you have done
a lot for me okay the few people who are
extraordinary have done other books
whatever it is just go back and just
have a recap but make a note once you're
going back to the textbook for a
particular topic to have a glance make a
notes of it and stick on and stick on to
your respective topics either in the in
your basic mcq books or either in your
regular notes what you are going through
okay so there is one more thing that I
want to add to this that is the fourth
one okay
not at regularly I advised for an
intense but I regularly advise the same
book for the repeaters there is one one
swapna publications book was recently
released two years back which includes
both dental materials and prosthetics
part I'm going to post the pic of that
particular book on your whatsapp groups
and I feel this is the only official
book which is available for the
particular subjects like dental material
and prosthetics right now in the in the
market okay so you can carry this book
as a fourth reference and this is more
than sufficient to crack any sort of
MCQs that given in the final exam of
aims need Jigme and PGA okay hope you
have a better clarity and now I'm going
to give a good idea that what we
are going to do in the upcoming few days
in handling this particular subject so
the first task is okay if you if you
open your schedule and just have a quick
glance okay the first task is I have
given four days for complete denture
plus one day revision and if you go to
the next part maxillofacial which is
again a part of your CD I have given one
day and if you add FPD I have given
three days plus one day revision and if
you go ahead with your RP d have given
four days implants I have given two days
and overall revision I have given two
days so I have given one to four days
for revision so I have given five 8 10
14 days for the subjects totally so it
is 18 days tasks we need to handle this
at the best okay so coming to the first
part that is complete denture where I
have splitted into four parts one two
three four so in the first day
my suggestion is there is 12 pages of
synopsis in your dental pulse please to
finish it first like in this continuity
in the synopsis if you feel any
difficulty or if you are noble not able
to understand any concept make sure you
get back to your textbook okay and
please write down the notes that you
have I mean the information that you
have collected from the textbook please
do convert that information into notes
and add on to this synopsis space in
your prosthetic part so that is the
first today task what you need to do so
along with this things along with these
things of 12 pages plus some textbook
reading and make your make make your
subject more configurated the next
important thing on the first day is you
need to cover the impression procedures
ok the impressions procedures has to be
covered on the first day so coming to
the second day a second day
you need to cover the water modeling
posterior palatal seal all those things
you should cover which are relationships
also okay then you need to cover teeth
setting and articulate us this is the
task for the second day and coming to
the third day the third day tasks are
your special techniques the other
techniques and all the miscellaneous
things okay and various other aspects
that you need to cover okay there there
other small small topics here and there
where we are going to cover on the third
day and fourth day is all like you need
to finish and polish your subject
related to the complete denture along
with the recent MC cues that are given
in all sort of examinations like Eames
neat PGA okay and you need to finish it
properly from all the areas of both
dental pulse as well as dentist along
with the discussions and whatever the
notes and the mock ups whatever you are
doing okay
so then you'll have one more revision
where you can invest and do some MC cues
the daily discussion daily tests or your
weekly tests some MC Q part will be done
along with the discussion of some
controversial questions and XY chatter
some acts of facial part I want you guys
to go with the textbook okay one
important area in this particular aspect
is first you need to learn about the
materials that are used and next you
need to learn about the different types
of maxillofacial processes and their
indications contraindications XY that
stuff of course I'm going to discuss on
the group but make a note you prepare
you try to get your own notes so that
you have six days of CD that includes
both maxillofacial processes as well as
the regular things so the X come for the
next comes for the FPD okay FPD I have
given three plus one where the initial
stuff was try to cover the synopsis that
are present in the dental pulse along
with the notes is preferably from the
book what you have done in the final
year if you have not done from any book
and if your prep if you feel you are not
up to the mark you can take a that or
since
steel or Shulman has a choice of
reference don't go very deep just go
with the topic specific if you are not
clear with the particular topic just go
with the topic if you are not clear with
the finish line's go for it if you're
not if you are not clear with the
impression techniques for the fixed
partial denture just go with that so you
just make your preparation very topic
specific for the textbook reading okay
so the next here you have many many
aspects like FPD one okay I try to
include principles of tooth preparation
different types of crowns you can go for
all this metal ceramic ceramic all 3/4
grounds 7/8 grounds mesial half crowns
and everything even you can cover
laminates you can cover your resin
bridges ok on all the indications
contraindications even you can cover
isolation gingerol retraction all these
aspects on the table okay so on the day
one you can split this and you can cover
this topics I mean you can cover up to
this level for the day one that includes
the synopsis tooth preparation crowns
and laminates okay so you know the
second day you can cover the resin
bonded bridges in isolation along with
that you can cover for ticks and finish
lines and FPD third day you can go with
the finishing and polishing work of the
FPD okay covering all the repeats
aspects in every aspect of the fixed
partial denture okay the next course is
your RP d so our PT we have given four
days so day one you cover synopsis and a
- I mean day one you cover synopsis
along with the synopsis you do
classification parts you have many
classifications okay so all the
classifications modifications
Applegate's rules and everything has to
be done
okay along with this you need to cover
major connectors and the minor
connectors okay and day two you need to
cover the rest seeds direct
direct retainers and you need to cover
the surveying area and all these things
has to be done okay day three there is
some miscellaneous work of some small
small topics here and there will be
discussed on the group day four is all
about your finishing and polishing okay
so this is what the things that you need
to do okay
implants the group is going to help you
okay we don't have a specific reading
for implants topic in your basic mcq
books so the group is going to help you
by providing few pdfs and notices so
it's like you need to do more group
stuff and have some textbook reading for
this particular book and I hope this
task for the prosthodontics in this
upcoming 20 odd days is done and I hope
you can see the rest of the things from
the schedule so keep plowing and learn
at your best and always try to be
