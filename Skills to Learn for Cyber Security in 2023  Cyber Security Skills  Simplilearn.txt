secure the best job opportunity it is
cyber Security Experts need to acquire
Advanced skills and knowledge and now
let's explore the top sort after cyber
security skills for 2023 and cyber
security is a complex field that
involves protecting networks systems and
applications as well as recovering data
after cyber attacks so by acquiring the
following highly desired cyber security
skills that will be covering and that
are the 10 skills we will be covering so
motivated individuals can pursue a
rewarding career in this field so
starting with the first skill that is
Proficiency in network and system
administration a strong grasp of
networking exclusion including knowledge
of data transmission protocols and
services that Safeguard and
organizations data familiarity with
network protocols like TCP UCP HTTP icmp
DNS and SMTP as well as network security
devices such as firewalls and load
balancers is essential additionally
understanding Technologies like ndr EDM
here xdr NAC and sasc is valuable
familiarize yourself with network and
point extended detection and response
systems that is ndl EDR XTR network
access control NAC and secure access
Services
Technologies and practical experience
through labs and certifications can help
reinforce your understanding and the
next skills you should have expertise in
Cloud security so building secure
architectures that facilitate
interactions between applications and
the cloud is in high demand companies
seek professionals skilled in securing
public and hybrid Cloud platforms like
Azure AWS and gcp to master Cloud
security start by gaining expertise in
popular Cloud platforms like Azure AWS
and gcp understand their security
features including identity and access
management data protection and
encryption knowledge of containerization
Technologies like kubernetes is also
desirable Proficiency in web application
firewall Waf and identity and access
management IEM is crucial for protecting
Cloud infrastructure hands-on experience
with Cloud platforms practical projects
and relevance certifications will
enhance your skills and now we'll see
another skill that is the third skill
application security skills so with the
increasing number of applications
targeted by hackers organizations need
professionals who can design Implement
and maintain secure applications
knowledge of software and application
development processes as well as the
ability to identify and mitigate common
security threads is vital learn about
secure coding practices vulnerability
assessment and threat modeling
understand common security threats to
web and software applications such as
injection attacks and cross-site
scripting explore tools and Frameworks
like owasb top 10 and learn how to
mitigate these vulnerabilities
practicing secure coding techniques and
contributing to open source projects can
help Define your skills and now we'll
see the fourth skill that is a
penetration testing alongside Network
operating system and application
security expertise familiarity with
standard hacking tools and techniques is
important understand how hackers think
and work and develop knowledge of common
vulnerabilities penetration testers
stimulate real world attacks to identify
vulnerabilities and develop strategies
for mitigation Proficiency in
penetration testing tools like nessus
Metasploit SQL map and Joe Fish is
valuable engage in Hands-On Labs Capture
the Flag challenges and Bug Bounty
programs to gain practical experience
and sharpen your skills now we'll talk
about the another skill that is risk
assessment and management so the ability
to assess and mitigate risk is an
integral part of a cyber security skill
set understanding security incident and
event monitoring Siem Technologies can
actively facilitating risk assessments
and security operations are significant
skills in this domain learn how to
proactively identify and access security
risk acquire knowledge of risk
mitigation strategies and incident
response processes practical experience
through simulated scenarios case studies
and Industry standard Frameworks like
nist can enhance your risk assessment
skills now we'll talk about another
skill that is digital forensic and
incident response so skilled
professionals who can investigate cyber
attacks recover and lost data identify
the origins of attacks and strengthen
cyber security defenses are sought after
learn forensic investigation techniques
manual analysis and incident response
procedures Proficiency in networking
programming critical thinking and
forensic software tools such as encase
Helix xry nftx is necessary hands-on
experience with simulated incident
response exercises and participating in
cyber security competitions can
