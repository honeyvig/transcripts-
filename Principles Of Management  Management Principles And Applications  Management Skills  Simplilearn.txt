as your career grows you may find
yourself doing less technical work and
spending more time directing or
strategizing a team
well this is generally taken for granted
nowadays throughout the 19th century
most corporations encouraged tech
experts to take charge of management but
one famous branch engineer and economist
suggested that the talents that made
employees good at their occupation did
not necessarily make them good managers
that is why every manager and leadership
team should implement rules and
regulations to run the organization
efficiently and principles of management
are nothing but the universal rules or
truths which enables manager to decide
what should be done to accomplish given
tasks and to handle situations that may
arise in management
these principles can be applied to
different industries and sizes of
enterprises
and all these were given by sir henry
fyol
initially he started as an engineer and
rose through the ranks of decasville
mining firm in france towards the tail
end of industrial revolution
the faltering company thrived under his
leadership he wrote when i took the duty
for the restoration of as well i did not
rely on my technical supremacy i rely on
my abilities as an organizer and my
expertise in dealing with others
so in today's session we'll look at 14
principles of management given by sir
henry fayol in his book general and
industrial management but before we

a comment with mba topics you'd like us
to cover in upcoming videos
now coming back to the principles of
management the first principle we have
is division of work
this principle states that as far as
possible the entire task should be
divided into segments and each
individual should be assigned only one
part of the work based on his aptitude
and preference rather than assigning the
entire work to one person when a person
does the same task over and over again
he becomes an expert in that particular
aspect of the profession as a result the
advantages of specialization will become
available
consider a software company that
receives a project they have also been
urged to supply it in a shorter amount
of time
it would now be extremely inefficient to
assign the entire project to the single
software engineer
also if he encounters an error that is
unsure how to resolve then it will be
nearly impossible to finish a project
before the deadline thus rather than
giving the whole project to the single
specialist companies should assign it to
the entire developer team
by applying this division of work
principle the companies will be able to
finish their projects within the given
amount of time
next up is authority and responsibility
fayol believes that the authority and
accountability to issue instructions
should be placed in the hands of few
people and should not be delegated one
of the most typical mistakes made by
major corporation is that their
management consists of too many people
thereby creating conflicts
when a few hand-picked persons have the
power to vote this authority gets
transferred down the chain and the
process gets executed
with such authority comes a great deal
of responsibility
assume you are the marketing director of
a corporation and you make a decision to
sell a specific product
if the product fails you must accept
responsibility for the failure you can't
blame someone else as a result when a
person accepts responsibility he also
makes good decisions
that is why fails suggest authority and
responsibility should go hand in hand
it means that when a particular
individual is given a particular work
then he will be responsible for the
results this is only possible when he is
given sufficient authority to discharge
his responsibility the right to give
instructions is denoted by authority
whereas responsibility denotes
accountability for the obligations
delegated to the person
the third principle on our list is
discipline
according to this principle management
is accountable for how an organization's
discipline is maintained and this
discipline percolates all the way to the
bottom of employee chain
every employee must respect the
organization's norms and terms of the
employment agreement and the validation
of this should be done by a manager at
each level
a manager can set a positive example for
his staff by disciplining himself at
first
ad agencies are a good illustration of
this as they encourage informal meetings
and chats in order to create better ties
with their consumers although these ad
companies are known to retain discipline
in the way ad executives engage with
customers or carry out their business
discipline is part of the organization's
mission and ideas thus it should be
preserved and followed
next up is unity of command
when we examined authority in the
previous principle we stated that
authority should be limited to a few
people similarly authority travels down
the chain only when the authority
individual is affiliated with the small
number of people
if everyone in a political party
reported directly to the prime minister
then he would be in hospital soon due to
the high amount of stress
as a result there is a hierarchy in
place to sustain a command one person
should only report to one leader not two
three or four thus most firms maintain
the usual structure of national managers
regional managers group managers and
team leaders
this ensures that managers and
executives know who they report to at
all times as well as their
responsibilities and the performance
expected from them
when you have achieved unity of command
and a unified hierarchy where everyone
knows who they report to and is ready to
perform the leader's bidding it is time
to adopt unity of direction
the term unity of direction refers to
the presence of one person in charge of
one plan to attain the organization's
score
in other words there should be one plan
of action for a set of activities with
the same goal and one manager to oversee
them
for example consider an automobile firm
that manufactures two items namely bikes
and cars
hence it has two divisions
since each product has its own market
and difficulties each division must have
its own set of goals to get positive
benefits each division must now plan its
targets depending on its environment
factors it is vital to distinguish
between the meanings of unity of command
and unity of direction the term unity of
command refers to the fact that only one
manager should be giving orders to an
employee at any given time
and unity of direction refers to the
fact that only one manager should be
exerting control over all the operations
with the same goal
next on our list is the subordination of
individual interest to general interest
this principle can also be named as
priority to general interest or
individual interest
according to this principle the general
interest or the interest of the
organization should take precedence over
anything else
many times a person is fired from
cooperation because he is moonlighting
or performing to complete his own agenda
this is because the corporation wants to
ensure that everyone who works for them
is fully committed to the organization
the organization's focus is on
individuals who give their all to the
enterprise that is why fails suggest
that the company's interest should taken
precedence over the individuals
for example suppose a manager makes a
decision that hurts him personally but
results in significant profit for the
firm in that case he should undoubtedly
prioritize the company's interest and
make the decision appropriately on the
contrary if a decision benefits the
manager personally but results in
significant loss for the company then it
should never be made
the seven file principle of management
is remuneration
when you expect your staff to be
disciplined and want a unity of
direction and command you must
compensate them so that they are less
inclined to ship to the competition and
more likely to focus on the
responsibilities at hand
fayol believes that employees should be
paid fairly to have the same level of
pleasure between employees and owners
the manager is responsible for ensuring
that employees receive pay for their
efforts but if they are not
appropriately rewarded for their work
they will not do their work with perfect
dedication integrity and capacity
poyol believes that some monetary and
non-monetary incentives should be
provided to inspire employees other than
basic compensation
assume for example the market is getting
dearer and dearer to the organization
and it is making high profits
in such case the employees pay should be
increased even if they do not request it
if this is not done the staff will quit
the firm as soon as possible
and the expenses for new hires will be
incurred resulting in loss for the firm
the next principle of management is
centralization and decentralization
according to this theory superiors
should use effective centralization
rather than total centralization or
total decentralization
firm does not intend that authority
should be entirely centralized when he
says effective centralization
the degree of power that people in the
organization have is referred to as
centralization centralization occurs
when a small group of people exercise
power over larger group of people and
decentralization on other hand occurs
when a bigger percentage of people in
the organization have a control
for example decisions on objectives and
policies business expansion and so on
should remain in the hands of superiors
on the other hand authority for
purchasing raw materials allowing staff
leave should be interested to the
subordinates or managers
the ninth principle of management is
scalar chain
many people are confused by scalar chain
but let me simplify it for you
when discussing command and control i
stated that one employee should only
report to single manager higher up the
chain hence an executive reports to a
team manager who reports to the regional
manager who reports to the national
manager and so on if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
skill up by simply learn click on the
link in the description
to know more
according to the scalar chain there
should be a clear line of authority in
the firm so that when time comes to
escalate things you know who to call
if your direct supervisor does not
respond to your question in an emergency
or calamity you should know who to
contact
the scalar chain is set to a dot in
popular firms like samsung and others
in such forms if a customer service
issue is not handled within 3 days it
gets powered to the local manager and in
5 days to the regional head
and this is how a scalar chain appears
it resembles a pumps wireframe with the
whole architecture and hierarchy of the
organization
the 10 principle of management is order
according to this principle the right
person should be assigned to the
appropriate task and the right object
should be assigned to the proper
location
henry fayol suggested that every
organization should have two orders one
for physical resources and one for human
resources
keeping physical resources in order
entails having an appropriate place for
everything and everything in its correct
place
similarly maintaining human resources in
order entails having a place for
everyone and everyone in his or her
allotted position maintaining these two
orders properly will ensure that
everyone is aware of the workplace
what they are supposed to do and where
they can obtain the required materials
this is one of the essential management
principles that every firm has embrace
next stop is equity
this principle states that all employees
must be treated fairly and impartially
every manager must treat their employees
fairly so that they acquire a sense of
devotion and attachment to their work
employees frequently claim that a
different employee was preferred over
them for advancement or higher
compensation
a peer organization on the other hand is
one that maintains equity for all
having the proper culture in an
organization is critical for this
equity will be automatically preserved
if the firm is highly ethical
moving forward we have stability of
personnel as the next management
principle
this principle is also known as the
attrition of employees
henry fayol wrote that if an
organization staff or personnel are
steady it has a higher chance of growing
faster
naturally if the company has a high
attrition rate there will be a lot of
time lost in training and development
thus the expenditures will rise and
tenure stability will not be observed
most major corporations take attrition
and stop turnover extremely serious
there are numerous processes in place to
guarantee that employee do not quit the
firm and if they do management should be
aware of the reason for their
resignation similarly additional methods
such as work rotation to fight boredom
incentives to drive aggressiveness and
other such tactics can be used to
guarantee tenure stability
the 13 principle on our list is
initiative
when we hear that a firm has innovated
and introduced a new product to the
market it sounds too wonderful to be
true
however we frequently wonder why firms
aren't innovating on a regular basis if
you look at it the most innovative
organizations are those that empower
both new and old employees to come up
with their own ideas they also show
interest and involvement to encourage
such professionals
according to fayol it is the manager's
responsibility to foster a sense of
initiative in his workers when it comes
to completing work or making decisions
but only within the bonds of authority
and discipline
it will be only conceivable if the
manager welcomes the ideas of his or her
colleagues support nets will
continuously propose their fresh and
beneficial ideas as a result and they
will eventually become an essential part
of an organization
to make this procedure a success a
manager must let go of his false failing
or grandeur
google apple and facebook are just few
of the firms that have successfully
applied this concept amongst the protein
management of principles
developers and engineers at google are
allowed their own sweet time to find out
creative approaches that can be
implemented as products in google
the same is true for facebook and apple
because employees are encouraged to take
the initiative these businesses have
high degree of creativity
the last henry file principle is spirit
the corpse the term spirit the corpse
refers to a sense of pride and mutual
devotion felt by members of a group and
it is just what you must strive towards
if you want to attain success while
employing the 14 principles of
management
spirit the corpse is the ultimate union
of management and employees inside an
organization resulting in a company that
is proud of what it does and has a lot
of loyalty from its employees and
customers
only a few firms have been able to do
this few of them are intel apple amazon
and samsung if a firm become able to
implement esprit de corps then it
provides it a legitimate competitive age
since it indicates that the employees
are passionate driven and willing to go
above or beyond for the firm or
management
overall these protein management
principles are evergreen in nature no
matter how quickly technology catches up
with us these protein management
principles will matter to even the
smallest of businesses and help them
become enormous
there are even easier ways to keep track
of some of the subjects included in the
14 management principles
however the ultimate aim is to create an
organization that is efficiently managed
productive and delivers the best
outcomes possible in accordance with the
company's goals
i hope these basic principles of
management are clear to all of you out
