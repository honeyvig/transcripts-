yeah hi everyone so good evening now
we'll be discussing few important recent
advances which are not covered in basic
mcq books but which are very important
in examination Bountiful okay
I've seen many questions either in the
aims or either in the need I don't know
why the purpose is there really now to
ask these recent modifications so we'll
be covering one or two recent
modifications which are very important
in examination pontiff I will be
discussing questions relevant to these
important aspects also so going in
detail so what is the net what is the
treatment plan for the neck rhotic teeth
so the treatment plan for the necrotic
treat traditional endodontics generally
goes with it is based upon the open
epics or closed FX whether it is FX is
matured or whether FX is closed for
example if it is like in matured and it
is necrotic so there is no chance for
the epics of Genesis to takes place so
the treatment plan is a pacification
whereas for the mature epics we can go
for a regular traditional treatment
right so the that is what so that
traditional endodontics is going and
majority of your questions will be on
the traditional endodontics side but the
major disadvantage of this specification
because FX if equation does not lead to
thickening of the tentacle walls it may
create an apical barrier where you with
GP or your root canal filling material
can be condensed but it does not
increases the thickness of the tentacle
walls of an image should tape which is
the major disadvantage of traditional
endodontics but now the trend has moved
towards the regenerative endodontics the
regenerate endodontics helps in
increasing the thickness of the tentacle
wall helps in increasing the strength of
the teeth and prevents the faction right
so if it is in matured FX you can go for
a revascularization procedure if it is a
matured FX I think majority of time we
will go with the traditional neutron
tricks but there are few other things
where the pulp can be regenerated there
are the stem cell therapy there the pulp
plantation that the scaffold implant
gene therapy there are many other things
by which you can continue the deposition
of the Tenten you can continue the
deposition of the Tenten around the road
walls by increasing the thickness of the
root walls you can increase the fracture
resistance of a particular team so
that's what the Reis regenerative
endodontics is more concerned about and
even seen many questions like towards
the region ability when you don't it's
in the best treatment option for an open
FX these revascularization it's not like
apex application we regularly go for
pacification as an answer according to
many mcq books but now the best
treatment option will be
revascularization it's not a Pacific
ation you find revascularization option
go for revascularization the second best
option can be a pacification so of
course you know that the golden standard
material further effects implication or
for epic so genesis long back that is
called asthma golden standard is your
calcium hydroxide okay but nowadays
they're not using calcium hydroxide is a
golden standard so if a question is
asked what is the golden standard
material for a pexif occasionally peg so
Genesis or for direct cult capping you
can directly go for the calcium
hydroxide is an answer but now the plan
moves towards that empty a empty is an
alternative material of choice to
increase the dentin hard tissue barrier
at the apex you can you can use MTA
which has excellent sealing properties
and the main disadvantage associated
with this is the remaining two internal
thickness won't fail you to induce the
this is exception case but you need to
make a move because they can ask you a
question so now is all about the
regeneration I have already discussed
how the regeneration is important and
and which option you need to go for when
you find a question like a necrotic open
FX case what is the best treatment
option is regeneration which is nothing
but to regrow so for this regeneration
you need to learn a basic stuff about
okapi RP okay protein rich plasma which
can be categorized into four types there
are pure protein rich plasma
PRP leukocyte protein rich plasma that
is el PRP and pure protein rich fibrin
that is P P RF and leukocyte 500 fibers
okay so these are the four aspects that
you have to make a note okay and how
this is collected okay and it's very
simple you need to collect the blood
from the patient and you need to keep in
the tube so that the because of the
difference in the specific gravity or
the density there will be
differentiation of this RBC WBC and
plasma and the platelet cells so how the
case selection should be interesting
with chart which is very important and
maturity of the purpose it is mostly
they will ask question on this float
that's all
so we'll be learning each and every line
that is given in this flow chart first
is about the case selection the case
selection was already discussed truth
with necrotic pulp and enumerate in
immature epics is the best option
the second important aspect is the pulp
space which does not need any post and
core or a pulp space which does not need
any final registration grossly decayed
is not it's contraindicated for this
regeneration procedure and the next one
is the cooperation of the patient and
the parent because they need to come for
the follow-ups they need to come for the
second visit so there should be a good
cooperation from the patients as well as
from the parents okay so and the fourth
aspect is the patient should not be a
legit ik to the medications and
antibiotics that are necessary to
complete the procedure there are few
aspects which are very important few
material which are very important for
the regeneration process and the patient
should not be allergic to these so these
must included factors for the case
selection the first appointment what you
need to do is give local anesthesia
apply rubberdam open the axis irrigate
remove the pulp and irrigate the I mean
necrotic pulp and remove remove all the
remove with the irrigation solution
that's 20 ml of any Owoh CL you know
that is given ok 1.5% is 20 ml per
channel for five minutes so once you're
done with this drive the powerpoints
place calcium hydroxide later you can
place calcium hydroxide or either you
can place a low concentration of triple
antibiotic paste seal with dentinal bow
engages and the main intention of
keeping a dent in bonding isn't because
you know cycling is the one that's going
to cause the discoloration of the teeth
right you know you know the
tetracyclines are going to cost
discrimination as the triple antibiotic
paste is a combination of 1 is to 1 is
to 1 ratio of cipro flaxen metronidazole
and minocycline to a concentration of
0.1 milligrams per ml it's going to
cause the minocycline ingredient which
is going to cause the discoloration of
the teeth so to prevent the
discoloration you need to seal the pulp
chamber with dentin bondage and so that
amino cycle will not move above the
cementoenamel junction and cause
discoloration but if that's the main
intention of keeping the dentin bonding
yes and the xnm cqr can by painting
bonding should be applied when you're
using triple ante by defense the answer
is it is due to the discoloration that
is caused by Meno cycle and so once
you're done with this you need to seal
with 3 to 4 mm of temporary register 2
material and make a note Cabot or any
temporary mr. 2 material should have a
minimum thickness of three point five
millimeters to prevent the micro leakage
okay so it should be three point five
the ideal answer is three point five
ranges from three to four millimeters
that's nice again an MC cube so this is
what we do in the first appointment
second appointment is done after one to
four weeks after the first visit access
to the initial treatment any response
and in the second appointment you will
go with three percent as mu paper kind
without vasoconstrictor the main reason
of going without vasoconstrictor is you
know what are the uses of adding a
vasoconstrictor to only you know what
are the uses of adding it Vasso
construct into Enya so it prevents the
systemic toxicity it it decreases the
blood flow it increases the activity of
not as difficult a particular drug so
here we are we are planning to induce
bleeding so we want bleeding so bleep we
want bleeding there shouldn't be no
massive constraints so that's the reason
why we lose three percentage of new
people kind without massive functions
they can ask you a question why three
percentage of new paper can be thought
of as a constrictor is used while you
are going for the regenerative
Precision's because we need blood supply
so we don't want any vasoconstrictor to
stop stop the blood supply so that's a
perfect answer
so then you need to use 20 ml of 17
percentage of PDD of I by 30% is 20 ml
of 17 percentage of EDTA is used
particularly in regenerative processes
because EDTA has some growth factors
which aggravate the periapical cells to
produce the dainty okay that's the
reason so drive with powerpoints and
create our instrumentation you need to
create our instrumentation for example
if the working length is 20 you need to
go for 22 and you need to do our
instrumentation and induce bleeding so
the bleeding will come into the open
punch
open chamber and it should be filled at
least to allow 3 to 4 millimeters of
registrate of material and place an
absorbent matrix over the blood clot of
the necessary and then go with an MTA
and forward by you need to you need to
you need to fill with the calcium
hydroxide then you need to go for the
follow the follow up can be either two
follow-ups that is the clinical
examination and radiographic examination
clinical examination is simple that if
there is no pain no swelling no sinus
tract the treatment is successful and
after few days the pulp can be
regenerated it may show a positive
powerful response whereas coming to the
radiographic science there will be
decreasing in the radial lucency that is
the periodic of the admissions it can be
decreased
if the dental thickening is increased so
there will be increasing in the width of
the root walls they can be increasing in
the root length too okay so these are
the these are the follow-up aspects that
you have to check both clinically as
radiographic and so that's what the
regenerative topic is about I feel like
these are the aspects that they may ask
you because I mean according to me it is
not a level of ug student but nowadays
the Basset is the loud-ass question of
regeneration so just just go ahead with
this video this video is going to cover
different different important aspects
which are very important to answer few
pedo and endo related questions thank
