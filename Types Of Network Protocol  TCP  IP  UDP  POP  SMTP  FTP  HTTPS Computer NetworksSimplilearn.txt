Network Protocols are needed to enable
communication over a network which
allows different devices to communicate
with each other and share resources
without network protocols networks would
not be able to transfer data between
different devices making the internet as
we know it today impossible when two
devices connect to a network they need a
way to communicate with each other
network protocols provide this method of
communication by establishing rules and
protocols they must be followed when
transmitting data they Define how data
should be formatted how it should be
transmitted and how it should be
interpreted among other things in fact
the history of network protocols is a
fascinating one too that stretches back
to the earliest days of computers and
the internet one of the earliest efforts
to address this problem was the
development of transmission control
protocol TCP and the Internet Protocol
IP back in the late 1970s these
protocols were designed by a team of
Engineers at the University of
California Berkeley led by Vince kuff
and Bob Khan and they quickly became the
de facto standard for networking on the
internet since then there have been many
advances and improvements to network
protocols and in this video we will be
discussing all of the important
networking protocols and their
functionality so grab onto your seats
and stay tuned till the end to learn
everything there is to know about
networking protocols all right so in
this video we will cover topics like
introduction to network protocols need
of network protocols what is ethernet
then types of network protocols like TCP
UDP IP post office protocol pop and smtv
and much more now before moving forward
let me ask you a quick question so
ethernet is commonly used in which type
of network option is Lan local linear
Network option b is w-a-n wide area
network options C is pan personal area
network and option D is m a n
metropolitan area network now you can
pause this video and answer in the
comment section below so let's start
with the first topic which is
Introduction to network protocol a
network protocol is like a set of rules
that govern how devices in a network
communicate with each other these rules
are like instructions that specify how
data should be sent received and
understood by the devices Network
Protocols are formalized requirements
and plans that consist of rules and
procedures that describe how devices
should interact with each other over a
network they provide a communication
system to exchange information using
various physical means such as cables or
wireless connections just like humans
follow certain protocols when they
interact with each other network
protocols Define a specific steps and
guidelines for devices to follow these
rules ensure that information is sent
and received correctly and that all
devices involved understand each other
in essence Network Protocols are a way
for devices to speak the same language
and follow a common set of guidelines so
that they can successfully share
information and work together
effectively now let's understand the
need of network protocols all right so
let me explain this to you in simple
terms Network Protocols are like
guidelines that devices follow when they
communicate with each other over a
network these Protocols are needed for
several reasons firstly Network
protocols ensure that devices understand
each other imagine if you and your
friend were speaking different languages
and had no way to understand each other
communication would be impossible
similarly devices from different
manufacturers and with different
functions need a Common Language or
protocol to understand each other's
signals and data secondly Network
protocols ensure that data is
transmitted reliably when you send a
message or a browser a website you want
to make sure that the information
reaches its destination accurately and
without errors Network protocols help in
breaking down data into smaller packets
sending them across the network and
reassembling them correctly at the
receiving end thirdly Network protocols
provide security they include measures
to protect data from unauthorized access
and ensure that sensitive information
remains confidential this is
particularly important when you make
online transactions or share personal
information over the Internet lastly
Network protocols allow for
interoperability this means that devices
from different manufacturers and with
different functions can work together
seamlessly for example your computer can
connect to a printer and your smartphone
can access a Wi-Fi network because they
follow the same protocols so these were
some of the needs of network protocols
now before understanding the types of
network protocols we must to understand
about ethernet so ethernet is a type of
network protocol that helps devices
connect and communicate with each other
in a local area network Lan it is like a
highway that allows data to travel
between devices such as computers
printers and routers ethernet uses a set
of rules and procedures to transmit data
in the form of packets these packets are
like small packages of information that
are sent from one device to another
ethernet ensures that these packets are
delivered to the right destination and
in the correct order think of ethernet
as the road system that connects all the
devices in our Network it ensures that
data can flow smoothly between devices
enabling them to share information and
work together efficiently now let's have
a look at the types of network protocols
here we will cover some of the types of
network protocols we'll start with the
first one which is TCP that is
transmission control protocol TCP is a
network protocol that ensures reliable
and order delivery of data between
devices it breaks down data into smaller
packets sends them across the network
and ensures that they are reassembled
correctly to the receiving end TCP also
handles error detection and
re-transmission if any packets are lost
or corrupted during transmission so this
was about TCP or transmission control
protocol now second is IP that is
Internet Protocol IP is another Network
protocol that handles the addressing and
routing of packets across the internet
it assigns unique IB addresses to
devices and determines how data is sent
from The Source device to the
destination device IP ensures that the
data packets reach the right destination
by routing them through various network
devices like routers third is UDP or
user datagram protocol you UDP is a
network protocol that provides a faster
but less reliable method of data
transmission compared to TCP it does not
establish a connection or guarantee
packet delivery or order
UDP is commonly used for time sensitive
applications like video streaming or
online gaming where a small amount of
data loss is acceptable next is pop that
is post office protocol pop is a network
protocol used for retrieving emails from
a mail server to a client device it
allows users to download emails from the
server onto their device and manage them
locally pup is typically used by email
clients like Outlook or Thunderbird next
we have is SMTP or simple mail transfer
protocol SMTP is a network protocol used
for sending emails from a client device
to a mail server it handles the
transmission of email messages and
ensure that they are delivered to the
appropriate recipients mail server SMTP
is responsible for the reliable transfer
of email across different mail Reserves
so this was about simple make transfer
protocol now let's understand the sixth
one which is file transfer protocol or
FTP FTP is a network protocol used for
transferring files between devices over
a network it provides a standard method
for uploading and downloading files to
and from a remote server FTP allows
users to navigate directories transfer
files and manage file permissions now
coming to the next which is hypertext
transfer protocol secure that is https
HTTP is a secure version of HTTP that
provides encryption and authentication
it ensures that the data transmitted
between a web browser and a web server
is encrypted and protected from
unauthorized access http
s is commonly used for secure online
transactions sensitive data transfers
and protecting users privacy so these
were some of the types of network
protocols so basically Network protocols
play a crucial role in enabling
communication and data transfer across
various computer networks we have
explored several types of network
protocols each serving specific purpose
and operating at different layers of
networking model so if you are someone
