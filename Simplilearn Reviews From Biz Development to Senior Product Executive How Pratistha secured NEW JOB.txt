I was always passionate about creativity
and designing so I chose a tech
background that had something to do with
designing but when my professional
Journey took me from an engineering
background to a business development
role that was the time when I realized
that I needed to Pivot and upskill
myself to truly Excel I chose to pursue
a product management course with simply
learn this turned out to be extremely
rewarding as I was able to secure a job
through the simply learns job assistance
program at first cry.com hi my name is
pratia takur and I am a senior product
executive and this is my journey I come
from a small town jamshedpur also known
as tatan nagar you know when it was time
to actually choose a stream uh in 11th
and 12th I went with pure science back
in the days people used to basically uh
mostly go for becoming doctors or
Engineers my father somewhat wanted me
on also to be an engineer so that was
his dream and I was always a more
creative person uh wanted to do maybe
something related to business or
designing or Interiors but he wanted me
to become an engineer I shifted to
Bangalore pursued my electrical and
electronics Engineering in uh Bangalore
once I completed my engineering I was
definitely not doing a job that was you
know related to my field so that is when
I understood that definitely if I wanted
to move move uh you know ahead on the
ladder I needed to upskill or acquire
skills that would basically help me
stabilize my career in a position in the
industry and while MBA was always on the
table was always an option and that was
the next option that people you usually
you know suggest you that hey you know
you've done your engineering uh do your
MBA and uh MBA was again something that
would have taken a 2 years time and then
a financial dependency on my
parents online courses that I saw in the
Market at that particular time were
courses that were being offered for 5 to
6 months and you could do it while still
working so that was one of the great
points so I didn't have to be you know
leave my job and do it I could basically
take out time from my schedule u a
Sunday or a Saturday maybe sit down and
you know complete these courses I
searched on Google about different
product management courses that were
available you know to do on online and
uh simply learn had popped up then and
simply learn had basically partnered
with spj uh in this particular program
so I basically filled out the form I
went on to like a lot of mentors because
of how they taught and interacted uh you
know with us during the classes of how
they talked about case studies of how
they actually shared their personal
experience of you know instances that
they have gone through in their
workplaces so that gave us a sense and
idea about how the product Industries
once we completed our course and we
submitted our Capstone projects and we
received the results so that was the
time when our placement assistance
program began so uh ruhan was someone
who was basically taking care of my uh
placements he always you know uh tried
to push me to complete the simply learn
placement assistance program while also
getting me uh interviews on the site he
also gave me feedback uh feedbacks about
you know my interview rounds that I
basically gave and both Rohan and ji
have been in touch with me throughout
the placement process uh for first cry
also I've already decided that you know
product is something that I want to do
and a major reason for this has always
been because I am a pet lover and uh I
empathize a lot uh you know with the
street dogs that I see across I really
want to actually come up with a product
in the future my own own product uh
where I can actually help out our
treaties out there and while I am in the
process of understanding The Product
Industry and how businesses work I'm
definitely sure that in the future uh I
will actually come up with a product of
my own where I will be able to help out
uh you know our pets out
there so any industry that you look into
you will always see that there is
someone who will always be better than
you so for for you to be again three to
four steps ahead of that particular
person you need to always keep learning
you need to always understand and
analyze the trends of the industry you
need to always you know upscale yourself
so that you can be the best version of
yourself
