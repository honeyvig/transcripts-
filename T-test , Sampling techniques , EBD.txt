hi Venus back here with few more stuff
related to your community and welcome
you all to mt s conquer online finish
line for first MDS students for paper
one okay now I'm going to discuss few
more important things to relate it to
your community in Papillon first and
foremost thing is about t-test I hope
you know the basic information related
to the t-test which will be directly
posted from textbook on to your groups
you can read that t-test also called a
student T it has some basic information
but make a note please try to drop this
flow chart the t-test is of two types a
t-test unpaid readers first sure you
need to drop this table okay which gives
the basic information at a good idea to
the PAP person who is cutting your
pepper so paid t-test is on paid t-test
okay the definition of paid t-test is
basically it is it is it is a comparison
between the two dependent samples where
as unpaid t-test
it is a samples are independent there is
a strong relationship between the
samples bins before and after a
particular period or particular thing
okay so there are some petite as there
is no relationship I'm just going to
give a dental example so if you are
calculating the flow rate that is if you
are calculating the salivary flow rate
of boys and girls and in other to
another study you are calculating the
salivary flow rate in only one group
before and after giving a particular
drug so in the first study you have
calculate the saliva flow rate between
two groups twenty five boys and twenty
five girls and you ha you are comparing
that is called as unpaid t-test okay
means the two groups are different boys
and girls are different group and the
second one you are calculating the
flow rate in only one group before and
after giving a particular drug means
before giving a drug you how calculated
after giving a drug you have calculated
so this is called a spade there is a
relationship between the two groups
before and after where there is no
relationship between the two groups that
is boys and girls so apart from
describing or giving some description it
is better you code some example clearly
so that the perpetrator will the pepper
evaluator will get a better idea over
the content what you are writing so this
is more than sufficient or paid and
unpaid deduced okay I'm just going to
post few more textbook related stuff on
to the groups if you want to make your
question question lengthy or if you
won't expect you can go ahead the next
one is as already mentioned sampling and
sampling technique is again a most
commonly technique are types is a most
commonly asked question so make a note I
mean like before you take before you
take over the definition of sample okay
there are some basic things you have to
write the definition of sample it is
mandatory that you please try to
represent because all these the
importance of sampling you can you can
write them as 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 5 & 6
you can write all these six points and
it's going to occupy some space and even
if you draw this diagram by creating
some circles and everything even that is
going to occupy the same space but
definitely this type of presentation
will get an extra score in your in your
final exam for sure so try to improve
your presentation skills that's what
that is primarily required for the
theory purpose of the universities so
before used once you're done with the
definition of a sample sample and sample
size I want you guys to write this total
target population or total population
source population this is a study
population and where we are where your
sample will be in this study population
so this sort of things which are
directly taken from a textbook is going
to give some more clarity over your
subjects right so try to include this
also and this flow chart okay is the
target population and
yoyoyo your van before your selecting
the sample you need to you need to
arrange your framework like qualities to
be taken into consideration when you
want to pick a sample then determine
whether it's whether you are planning
for a probability sampling or a
non-profit e sampling then plan the
sampling unit determine the sample size
I in sample size is again again a
question for you I hope you have done
your basic things for your thesis right
so determining of sample sizes are gonna
again a question that has to be done for
the proper one
okay selection of sampling units and so
try to include this flowchart which is
which is again going to be an important
thing for this particular question so
once you're done with the sampling and
everything and all the basics your
sampling things can be divided into two
types that is probable sampling and
non-probability just go through the
basics of this the difference between
the probable and non probable sample
sampling techniques once you are done
with this the probable samplings are
again of I mean many types but basically
I want but to make a note that there
five types one is simple random sampling
one is simple random sampling the second
one is stratified random sampling the
third one is cluster sampling technique
the fourth one is sistemics sampling
fifth one is multi-phase sampling okay
so you need to mention all the sampling
at least like you need to drop one or
two lines related to each sampling
technically okay and non probable
samplings you have accidental sampling
accidental or is also called as
incidental sampling the second one is
convenient sampling the third one is
quater sampling a snowball and other
types of samplings are also there you
can even pick them from the textbook but
basically the framework is very very
important you need to write one or two
important points related to each
sampling technique and just try to move
on because you need to manage the time
also basing upon the time how many
points you have to write about each
sampling you have to decide okay so this
is all about sampling the next question
is evidence-based industry
my suggestion is apart from this
particular question of evidence-based
dentistry or evidence-based medicine for
example if you are taking a 20 max
question not regular ten marks or seven
marks questions but for 20 months
question and 475 marks question I want
you guys to add one more heading apart
from the regular framework what we have
learned
okay I want you guys to add extra
heading that is evidence-based dentistry
for every question which is carrying
twenty twenty plus or seventy five marks
which is the tool and the question where
you need to write and number of pages
make sure you drop evidence-based
dentistry and try to code few evidences
and the studies apart from the regular
references you drop another heading like
evidence-based industry which is going
to give more impression to the person
who is correcting the paper so so we
will go deep into the evidence-based
dentistry first of all I want you guys
to write down the definition definitions
are important apart from the framework I
hope most of us will start the question
either by describing the title that is
evidence-based dentistry is better right
definition but I want you guys to try to
try to like catch up the definitions for
everything for example there is a
question make sure the definition should
be perfect and the definition should be
coded right references according to this
particular gtp according to this
particular a DEA or this particular
textbook okay on this particular
conference of periodontics conference of
prosthodontics the number and everything
are important so please try to code
first of all the definition of
evidence-based industry I'll be sharing
one to the group and few things like
father of evidence medicine how the
evidence medicine has first evidence
made is evidence based medicine has came
into existence then the dental people
has adapted it when it was that after
some basic history background once
you're done with the history bronze the
main important things is this triad ok
this triad of evidence-based dentistry
is important so please try to include
this triad ok with this or circles and
everything let's make a diagram ok so
once you're done with the evidence base
triad evidence base triangle they can
ask the same question evidence based
triangle is again important this is
evidence based triangle ok you need to
draw this triangle with different color
codings I mean preferable if your paper
is corrected in black and white that is
difference in audio give some try to
give some shades if not try to try to
code with some colors ok so so what is
this evidence based triangle or evidence
based dentistry related triangle chords
ok so it's if you start from bottom and
if you go to high ok the evidence or the
comfortability ok the evidence or the
ethical allowance of a particular study
increases means the most commonly
accepted now the most accepted or most
to 8a studies are systemic reviews and
meta-analysis right so if you take this
this is the background if the least one
the bottom one the base one is the
background information and experts open
it means the opinion that is given by a
teacher for a opinion that is given by a
person who is experienced his friend
considered as the bottom most according
to the evidence ok followed by case
control studies case series reports and
everything at the bottom followed by
quiet studies followed by randomized
trial control studies followed by
critical applies a lot
and everything okay and followed by this
the last but no but the the top proper
of the table is system in creepiest and
the meta-analysis so if you want to
elaborate you can elaborate each and
everything right one point and just try
to code okay
so this is these two important one is
triad of evidence-based dentistry and
the triangle of evidence-based industry
is more important apart from that you
need to write some basics I am going to
share a simple article which gives some
more information to write more material
related to this but make sure these two
are very very important and apart from
this I have already shared a conclusion
a generalized conclusion slide on the
group ok so whatever the question is but
make sure you try to conclude with the
same manner I have given some matter
some decent three or four lines
so how evidence-based dentistry is
supportive further okay so how sampling
technique is of every for every question
how detest is supportive for you but TT
tests are important in in our techniques
in our studies which helps in
determining the exact result something
you write some beautiful conclusion
slide I have already showed on the group
so please try to drop those conclusion
slide for everything now the discussion
is about evidence-based medicine or
evidence-based industry however it is
based dentistry is helping you out same
conclusion okay so references are
important specifically for
evidence-based liking these are the best
coded and easily you can easily handle
handle these references right so this
one American Dental Association easy
references you can easily code American
Dental Association Center for
evidence-based dentistry and policy of
evidence base to industry and Goldstein
gr which is what is evidence-based
dentistry so please try to code these
for apart from your shop unpaid you can
you can quote shobun pet or also but i
feel like these are more preferred
references right okay so these are the
references for this particular question
and these are the common references for
all the community based question okay so
hope you are doing good i feel like most
of your exams
well I have to get updated your dates
were noted announced okay so anyways
stay positive I will try to learn as
much as we can and we'll be coming up
with few more videos in one or two days
