hi everyone this is dr saithi team mds
conquer
now let's continue with the pharmacology
quick revision part two
so i'm going to first discuss the
anti-diabetic drugs
so already you must have gone through
all these videos
but just is going to be a quick revision
okay so what are the alpha glucosidase
inhibitors those come
those drugs which come under alpha
glycosidase inhibitors are the carbons
magetol
and vogliboz and the side effect is a
flatulence
diarrhea and less absorption of the at
the drugs and its contra indicated in
the renal failure
okay next the glp one agonist so all the
tights come under that and the drug of
choice
for obesity is a lyrocrate okay and
it's side effect is nausea and wanting
and it causes
weight loss so that's the reason it can
be given as a drug of choice
okay and also one of the other side
effect is a pancreatitis
and it's contraindicated in the renal
failure again so next dpp
four inhibitors where the glyptons come
under that
so here the lingar guptin
can be given in the chronic renal
failure
and vindagliptin causes hepatitis and
the saxagliptin has a risk of heart
failure
and this can be given orally and there's
no nausea vomiting or weight loss
and they can cause infections and
pancreatitis as well
next myelin analogues uh pramblin tight
where you can see the type 1 and type 2
dabbit is
it can be given and it is under trial
for obesity okay remember the drug of
choice is a
lara glutate by the trial for obesity
you have to go for bramlen tide
okay and this can be given as a
subcutaneous route and again it has
weight loss and nausea and vomiting
so these is the main area to be
emphasized okay so the types of
insulin and the names what are the rapid
what is the short what is intermediate
and what is long and the onset of action
in the duration of action so quite
important and the insulin
which can be given iv is a crystalline
zinc
okay so this is regarding the insulin
and very important table related to that
so next intermediate acting so just have
a look that is isofane
and the lenti so what is the composition
of plenty again can be asked
then the insulin the so most commonly it
is given as
subcutaneous site is abdomen followed by
anterita and upper arm
and regular insulin can be given as iv
in diabetic ketostosis so if there is a
complication of diabetes and if
immediately it has to be
treated then have can give the regular
insulin as iv
okay then inhalational powder is a
africa again it's a very important point
afrisa which is an inhalational powder
side effects so it is lipoglycemia
lipodustrophilip hypertrophy all these
are the side effects of the insulin
next anti-hyperglycemic drug so this the
classification
note it down so quite important what are
the sulfonylureas what is the
megalithinites
first and second generation what are the
bygrinides so most commonly they are
given as a metformin
right so what all comes under
the antihyperglycemic agents do have a
look so sulfur and urease
so they release more incident for a
longer period of time
okay they cause a maximum decrease in
the hba1c and they are metabolized in
the liver and excreted by the
kidney okay so here they can cause
weight gain and hypoglycemia so these
are the drugs which can cause
weight gain okay next the first
generation
which includes acetohexamite oblutamide
and chlor
propamide and second generation
glybineclamide glycoside and the
glybuside okay so what are the important
points related to the here
these specific drugs are clearly given
here to have a look of
it okay next the megalithinites so
this can be used only with those
adjustment
in renal failure okay so they can be
given with little dose adjustment
next thiazoli dyndiones so
these are the important points related
to that
okay so they can decrease the insulin
resistance they increase the
transcription factor they increase the
adipose proliferation
and increase the glute for production so
all these are the important points
related to it
and the side effects again the macular
edema sodium and water retention and
bone fracture in females
by grenades they decrease hepatic
glucose production and they can be used
both for treatment as well as
prophylaxis
for the pre-diabetic patients and the
pcos and non alcoholic fatty liver
disease those these are the two drugs
which come under that okay so side
effects the weight loss the nausea
vomiting lactic acidosis
and the absolute contraindications are
clearly given here note them out
okay next sgl2 inhibitors
are these drugs okay and these are not
given as monotherapy they are given in
combination with the others
okay so next effect of
anti-diabetic drugs on weight so if you
see
those drugs which increase the weight
and those drugs decrease the weight so
it's clearly given here
have a look so these are the summary of
all the anti-diabetic drugs so just you
can have an idea so
first thing is the classification and
the important points later each and
every drug
do not in doubt okay that's with the
anti-diabetic now comes the antithyroid
so
here it's clearly given so where the
iodides act
okay so it's important for you to have
an idea of this particular chart
so what are the sodium and the iodine
simple inhibitors are these doctors
thiocyanate percolate and the
fluborate okay so next what are the
thyroid peroxidase inhibitors these are
the profile thyroid uracil and they are
it is short acting and but it is
hepatotoxic
but it is a drug of choice in pregnancy
for
hyperthyroidism whereas carbamazole
being teratogenic it cannot be given in
pregnancy but it is a drug of choice for
hyperthyroidism but in pregnancy you
have to give
propel thyroid uracil okay next side
effects aggrandy cytosis gi upset and
allergic dermatitis next thio
endopeptidase inhibitors
these through their fastest acting they
decrease the vascular genesis and reduce
the size of the
thyroid side effects are not that
important
next five di io dnase inhibitors so
propyl thyroid cell has multiple mechans
of action so even it can
inhibit 5d iodines and besides that beta
blocker steroids and
amiodarone next iodine 131
again okay for hyperthyroidism for
graves and thyroid cancer
so it's important related to iron 131
okay absolute contra indications and all
are quite important for each and every
drug
next ah hypothyroidism the levothyroxine
and leothyronine
so this levothyroxine can be used for
replacement whereas lyothyrone is not
for replacement okay
so this is regarding the antithyroid
drugs now comes the anticoagulant so
these are the broad classification
direct thrombin
10 inhibitors indirect thrombin
inhibitors and vitamin k inhibitors
so direct thrombin so that is
these drugs which have been clearly
given here which are orally apparently
apparently lipid and desired in
other drugs that are given so they can
be given in dvt and prophylaxis for
thrombosis they can be given okay
and this drug causes hepatotoxicity okay
next ten hain bitters and antidotes are
again quite important so if you see this
is the antinode then antidote for derby
actress
okay next inhibitors you have 10 a in
that
so the name has 10a if you see okay
so these drugs do not require monitoring
okay so they don't require monitoring
this is important point
next indirect thrombin inhibitors that
is unfractionated heparin
lm head wh and fonda pavronex
so the mechanism of action it's pretty
clear so unfractionated apparent both
on 10 a and on thrombin whereas the
low molecular weight heparin okay so it
predominantly much much predominantly on
factor
10a okay so this is how the difference
between unfractionated low molecular
weight and ultra low molecular weight or
the phantom parallel next
difference it how it looks so just have
a look
next unfractionated parents so it can be
given as subcutaneous for profile access
but less bioavailability but iv it can
be used for treatment
for as qid okay short acting safe in
renal failure and antidotes are quite
important okay so protamine sulphate is
antidote
okay side effect is again hepatin
induced heparin induced thrombocytopenia
so whenever
the patient is having a parent-induced
thrombocytopenia you can treat with
direct thrombin inhibitors or
fonda pavlinx so low molecular weight
paren and fonda pavlinx
so adjust the differences so the this is
the longer acting and that is the
longest acting
okay so here there is less effect of
antidote and here there is no effect of
antidote and there is less
heparin thrombocytopenia here there is
no hit
okay so this is the main differences the
uses okay so uses
unfractionated for catheter induced
thrombosis
and concurrent anticoagulant with
thrombolysis whereas no molecular weight
apparent
for mi for dvt embolisms unstable angina
is all that and side effects is hota
that is hemorrhage osteoporosis
thrombocytopine alopecia and
contraindications
is her capped that is hit
endocarditis renal failure except
unfractionated heparin cirrhosis
alcoholics peptic ulcer thrombocytopenia
so all these are the important points
next warfarin which is a vitamin k
inhibitor
okay so dependent factors two seven nine
and ten
and uh next uses for dvt profile access
and treatment for
thrombosis prophylaxis and
anti-phospholipid antibody
syndrome okay side effects obviously all
this anticoagulants main side effect is
bleeding
so it worsens the hit alopecia blue
discoloration of feed skin necrosis and
it's again teratogenic
because it causes nasal hypoplasia and
it crosses the blood-brain barrier
okay so this is the side effects okay
with this we are done with the
anticoagulants now comes the
anti-epileptics so
calcium and potassium channel blockers
sorry calcium and sodium channel
blockers are for the
generalized stony clonic caesars okay so
myoclonic seizures for calcium
and the sodium channel blockers except
carbon is a pain and phenytoin
okay whereas absence uses the calcium
channel blockers okay so
already we have discussed why that is
being given
in generalized partial chooses there is
a concept behind that
so if you for if you missed or if you
want to have a look you can go back and
just
give a look to that okay next the
through the sodium channel blockers
carbamazepine so calcium channel
blockers are the valproate and ethoxy
succinate so drug of choice for gtcs
absences and all that okay even for
prophylaxis of migraine but being the
last option
side effects just the normal side
effects so it is hepatotoxic
pancreatitis can cause grammars and
hyper ammonia
and sodium channel blockers is as the
list of the sodium channel blockers
and the phenytoin the usages okay and it
follows zero order kinetics
the phenytoin side effects so hydrant on
itself is a
other name and that's again the side
effects so hyperplasia of becomes i
think you know it so lymphadenopathy
diplopia taxi nystagmus stereotogenic
and osteomalacia inducer of enzymes and
neutropenia so all these are the side
effects
carbomozapine the bipolar disorders the
generalized stony clonic ceases
acute mania so side effects is
heads okay that is hyponatremia
hypersensitivity is no phylloxitosis
diplopia
aplastic enemy attacks uh stevenson
johnson syndrome spleenomegaly so all
these other side effects
lamotrigan so it blocks both sodium
and calcium channels and relatively safe
in pregnancy
okay so it is it is
starting at a low dose and it is never
to be given in emergency
okay topiramate these are the important
points so just have a look of it
okay next the potassium channel openers
okay so this is a drug
that is azogabine okay side effects
include the retinal deposits and
pigmentation
and decreased glutamate effect okay so
these
are the important uh drugs that is given
the felbamate
okay and other drugs like apma
antagonists that is the drugs that is
stellar panel and all that so just
just give a glance to it next increase
the gaba pre-gablin and gabapentin
inhibit the reuptake by a taya garbine
and in
inhibit the gaba transaminases of vega
bacteria
okay so these are the nothing but the
anti-epileptics next comes the
opioids so mu kappa and delta receptors
and the effects
so we have already discussed this before
okay
so with mu meiosis urine retention
sedation constipation
analgesia respiratory repression negate
the bile flow and euphoria kappa is for
constipation analgesic and dysphoria
okay
so euphoria is with mu and kappa is for
dysphoria
right so what what are the pure agonists
morphine
codeine trimethol pathogen methadone and
loperamide
okay so morphine being the important
alkaloid of opium
soluble in water so uses for severe pain
like labor pain bone pain
mi pain okay it's an anti-toxic as well
and side effect is it increases
intracranial pressure so avoid in head
trauma underlying
increases the histamine so it can cause
bronchoconstriction and pinpoint pupil
so which is a diagnostic for the opioid
poisoning so very important side effects
related to morphine do underline them
codeine this is naturally pure again is
less potent less adverse effects
it is also given as a analgesic
anti-toxic and anti-diarrhoeal
tramadol so analgesic action by
inhibiting the non-adeline
and serotonin uptake and methadone
and other point yeah it doesn't other
drugs like the loperamide doesn't cross
the blood vein barrier and it's given a
non-secretory
diarrhea okay whereas diphenoxylate
causes a blood-brain barrier
next a methadone it blocks nmda
receptors prevent the withdrawal
symptoms
maintenance of drug in opioid dependence
pathadin so the important points that
can be given in a post of pain labor
pain and
drug of choice for chills after
anesthesia so that is an important point
again
so next heroin it has the withdrawal
symptoms and it's converted to morphine
in the body
those signs of being high heroin it's
clearly clearly given here
no demo the watery eyes the small pupils
runny nose itchy skin and all that
next fentanyl it is synthetic okay it's
hundred times more potent than morphine
and sue fentanyl is thousand times more
potent so which is the falling is the
most pattern then you have to go for
so fentanyl okay so mixed are these
drugs the pentose again dizokine
null we're fine okay butyrphenol
and group nephrine okay bupinephrine
okay so these are the antagonists so
naloxone
nalframin and um nalprexon so where all
they are used and what is the side
effect side effects for hypertension
cardiac arrhythmia
they are used for opioid toxicity okay
so these are used for maintenance of
opioid poisoning so what is for toxicity
what is the maintenance
you have to have an idea so note the
important points
next antagonist peripheral are these
okay where they can be used for the
opioid induced constipation
next coming the diuretics so the first
group of drugs
which come in the dielectrics are the
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors most
potent is
acetozolamide okay and uh
it can be used for glaucoma for motion
sickness for catamenial epilepsy
right so all these are the uses right
and uh these are the important points
related to it
okay so it causes metabolic acidosis so
that's the reason it can be used to
treat alkalosis
okay so minimum loss of water so it's
not a very good aerotic
and it blocks excretion of
ammonium so it's contraindicated in
liver failure
it decreases the aqueous humor
productions as the reason used in
glaucoma
okay so very important points related to
the acetazolamide
next loop gyrotex loop loses calcium
very important point furosemide is a
common
drug which is used okay and
cyanic acid is auto toxic very important
most potent is bumatinide
so these are the again important points
related to it
so it causes hypercalceuria
nephrolithiasis
it causes hypermagnesemia it causes
metabolic alkalosis
they are weak inhibitors as well except
lumetanide
okay and there is maximum loss of water
and solute
okay so they are the drug of choice in
emergency like pulmonary or cerebral
edema
next osmotic diuretics up manitol is the
example for that
and the side effects pulmonary edema
renal like dehydration hypernitremia
and hyperkalemia okay so contraindicated
in pulmonary edema acute renal failure
and active cerebral bleeding thiazides
that's clothing hydrochlorothiazide
endopmite
so all these are the important points
again related to that
note it out okay so these are the
important points again
okay so what are the all the mechanics
of actions related to
the thighs that's a clear clearly given
here note them out
next the aldosterone antagonist so
spironolactone many times they have as
what's the exact methods of
action of it so uses resistant edema
hypertension
and it decreases the mortality in mi and
congestive heart
failure okay so enact inhibitors
includes a diametrine and amyloid okay
so all these is already
you have come across in your regular
discussion right so you can just open
your nodes
while going through this okay so it will
be like a easy revision for you so this
in a summary all the important points
are again given here
related to diuretic so just have a look
okay so with this the
part two of your pharmacology is done so
i made it very quick for you
what i suggest is so for a glance just
listen to what i am saying
and put your nodes in front of you okay
i already told you
you need notes for pharma it is like
mandatory right so for pharmacology if
you have your nodes
so while going through this class or
this entire quick revision it will be
like
a very quick so it is half an hour not
more than one hour
you will be done with your important
system wise
in your pharma ok so just give a glance
that's enough
thank you
