foreign
of the oldest programming languages and
is still going strong more than 37 years
after it first appeared on the scene
many other programming languages
including C sharp and Java have been
influenced by C plus plus and is still
used in various applications of software
for example Spotify Amazon Bloomberg and
YouTube are a few examples of that
so hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn in this video
session we will be creating a c plus
project this project will be a security
system in C plus plus here we will
create a system in which we can register
login and if we wish to change the
password then also we can do that
we will try to keep things easy and
basic so that each and every one of you
can understand the security system in C
plus project
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our YouTube channel and
press the Bell icon to never miss an
update from Simply learn before moving
forward let me ask you a quick question
what was the previous name of C plus
plus option A C option b c with classes
option C C plus or option D C with
objects
please leave your answers in the comment
section below and stay tuned to find the
correct answer
now let's switch to our code editor
which is Dev C plus plus
so this is our code editor now let's
save this file first of all
let's name this file as
system
dot CPP
all right so we have named this file now
we'll start with header files so first
of all we'll add the header files so
we'll write hash include
IO stream for input output operations
all right now we'll add another header
file which is
hash include fstring
now
the third header file which we will be
adding that would be S string
so this fstream Library the f-stream
library is used because we have to work
on files and this Library allows us to
do so it is used for file handling
operations
now the second one that is the S stream
Library this header file provides
templates and types that enable
interoperation between stream buffers
and string object
so this was it now we will have to add
another header file
all right and let's do that
hash include
string all right
so iostream F stream as stream and
string we have added the added files Now
using namespace STD
all right now we will create the main
function that is int Main
now inside the main first of all we will
be creating variables so let's do that
and a let's say now we'll initialize I
with 0
now we will be creating some strings
let's say
string text all these variables we will
be using it later in the project so
let's create them
password let's say password one
password to
let's name it pass
name
password 0
h
uge
word and
word one
so we will be using these variables
later in our project
all right now
let's create some string array
so
creds that is credentials
will make an array
right CP
2.
all right
now we'll display
an interface and in that interface we
will show uh four options like register
login change password and end program
so let's just do that
all right
so let's name it security system
foreign
so as we are creating a interface so
let's make it look good like we can do
some things like that
and I'll for extra space now
here we can do one thing like
can do like this
it's up to you how you want to beautify
your interface that's all upon you
so I'm basically doing that
register
foreign
ly we will do
for others
that we can just copy paste it will save
our time
so basically
first would be register
second would be login
and third would be change password and
fourth would be end program
and we can do one more thing
all right now let's make it two
this would be login
3 would be change password
foreign
would be
end program
all right so register login change
password and end program
so we have created four of these
so we have created the four choices now
after this we will be asking the user to
enter any choice like if you want to
register login or change password or end
the program so he can select one two
three or four for that we have to take
an input from the user
so we will do that first of all to add
some space we can do handle
all right
yeah
so now we will use a do while loop so
inside the do
we will again use handle twice so that
there would be some difference between
this register login interface and the
choice that we will be asking
right now C out
enter
your choice
so here we are asking the user to enter
one two three or four
as per his or her choice
all right
all right
so C in
here we will be taking the input let's
say a is the input
now we'll use a switch case
right switch and inside the choice that
the user will enter
all right now
case one would be there first of all
case one
and inside case one let's scroll it a
bit all right so inside case one
first of all we will be printing
something like register as as the user
has pressed one so he want to register
first of all so we'll create an
interface over here as well so let's do
that okay
out
like we previously did it's your choice
like how you want to do it
right now we can
write
foreign
all right
after that again
let's leave some space here
or we can do it above as well like
here also we can do this
and let's do this here
foreign
so register here we have created
now we'll use two Vandal because we want
to create some Gap in between enter your
choice and this interface so right
so we will print a message enter your
username it's like please
enter
username
all right so after that the user will
enter the username
so we'll take the input of that
so here we will write
name
all right now the user
will have to enter password also so
right please
enter the
password
so after this the user will enter the
password so we will be taking the input
of that
so
we have already created these variables
as you can see name we have created and
password 0 so we have created so we'll
use that password zero
all right now we'll ask the user to
enter his or her age
so will I please
enter
your age and whatever credentials you
want them to enter you can do that you
can also take the input of the address
or something personal that you want to
store you can also do that
so all right
so please enter your age
see in
age all right this name password 0 and
age we have already created these
variables we have initialized these
variables all right now
now we will store these details that is
now name password 0 and age
into some file and for that we have to
use the file handling operations
so we'll used those like we will create
off stream class we'll create an object
of offstream of one
and
to F1
so we will use of1 as it is the object
of offstain class
and why we have used the offstream class
because it is used to open a file to
write something in it so here we want to
store name password H in that file so
basically we have to use off stream only
and if stream class is used when we want
to open a file for reading purpose but
now we want to open the file for writing
purpose so that because of that we have
used offstream Class
so here we will write of1 that is the
object of Hosting class dot open
so
inside this we will write the name like
that file dot txt it will open the file
all right
now inside the if block we'll write o f
1
dot is
open
underscore open this is a function
all right
we have one notices open it will keep on
moving till
all the details will be entered in the
file
so we'll write of1
so here basically we are writing the
details inside the file
we'll use slashing because we want the
username and password in different lines
so that is why we have used slash in
here
all right of one
password
all right password zero it was sorry
now
we have stored the name and password
only
now we'll write
registration
successful
all right registration successful
now as we can see break statement we
have already written
all right
so basically everything is done in this
case here we have taken the input of
username password age and stored all
these details in the file
so that we can use it later
now this was the case one registration
is done in case one now we can move on
to case two
similarly we'll create a case too
now inside this case two
all right now inside this case two first
of all we'll initialize I with 0 why we
are doing this I'll explain that later
so similarly we will create
the interface that we previously created
in registration so let's do that
foreign
so we have created this
now here we will use if stream because
we want to read
so as I previously told that if stream
is used to read from files open and read
phone files so we'll create if stream
class and object if stream
if one or let's say of of2
so this is the object of if stream class
Now using this object we will open the
file of2 dot open
now of
sorry here we will write file Dot txt
all right so here we have opened this
file and now
we'll take the input like we'll have to
match it whether it is the same personal
node so we'll take the input we'll write
please
enter the username
see in
user the other variable that we have
created
now see out
please enter the password
all right so
here also we'll take the input from the
user we'll write the other variable that
is pass that's why we have created so
many variables
all right now
let's roll it a bit
now if
similarly that we have done previously
of2 dot is underscore open
so it will check all the files basically
if 2 is open then
here we will use a while loop
dot o f
2
dot end of file so here we are using the
end file function
from this eof or end of file function we
can detect when the Endo file is reached
it returns non-zero when the end of file
has been reached otherwise it will
return 0.
all right inside it now we will create
another while loop
while
get line
of2 that is the object
and text that is a variable
all right
now inside it we will write
I String
string
ISS
text
all right now I'll explain the part
so here in this part get line part so a
while loop together with the get line
function is used here to read the file
line by line
so using this the getline function the
file will be red line by line and this I
String stream object so I String stream
object is used to stream the string and
store it using the extraction operator
after this we will be using an
extraction operator where we will store
the string
all right
here we have used the extraction
operator and here we are storing
now in the grids array that we have
created
we will be using
here we were
all right so in credits array
we have already declared this
we will store the word first of all
and then we will increment because one
by one
the in the zeroth position first of all
first username will be stored then
the password will be stored in the
second position so we need to increment
that
all right
now
we will match if the
registered username matches with this
username or not and similarly we'll do
for password so we can do like if user
equals to creds at zeroth position that
is the username username the user has
entered first so it must be at the
zeroth position
and the password would be at the first
position
and index one so for that we can use if
password equals to
grids at index one
then
we can print a message
saying that login
successful
all right
now to add some space we can use handle
now after displaying this login
successful sign we can print the details
like
we can write
details
we can write C out
username
name
handle
all right similarly for the password
will do
foreign
so here we will show the username
password age details to the user now in
the else block so where the password and
login credential will not match in that
case now we'll do
so for that case we will write first of
all let's create some distance
so that it looks nice
all right so first of all we will write
incorrect credentials
all right incorrect credentials
after that we can do one more thing
so
he will write
press
two
let me just do this press 2
to login
S2 to login
and
here similarly we'll write
change password
so
press three
to change
password
so here we go
so if the details are incorrect so the
user can log in again try or
he or she can try to change the password
now we'll add the break statement also
so here we have added the break
statement now
as you can see our case 3 is also done
so what we have done in case three is
like
we have taken the input of username and
password and then we tried to store it
at credentials that is an array
so at credentials zeroth position that
is index 0 the username will be stored
and at credential first index the
password will be stored then we will try
to match the username that the user has
entered while registering with the creds
at zeroth position and password with the
password
so if it matches the login will be
successful and the details will be shown
and if it will no it if the details are
not matched then it will
show an error in correct credentials and
press 2 to login and press C to change
password
so this was the case too
now let's move on to case three
from here we will create the case three
foreign
again we will first of all initialize I
with 0
now here let's scroll it a bit
yeah so here we can write like
change password so
let's do this
change
password
so
now after displaying this again we will
open the file using that if stream here
if stream
of0
Now using this object of 0 will open the
file.txt
file Dot txt
all right so here we will write
file Dot txt
after opening this file we will display
a message to enter the old password so
because we are changing the password so
first of all we'll ask them to enter the
old password
so
enter the
old password
now we'll take the input fold this is
the variable
now we'll use an if condition
that similar to that that we have
previously used os0 dot is open
this file will remain open
now again we'll use end of operation
function
is underscore
end of file
all right now inside this while loop
again second while loop will be used
similarly that we have done previously
get line function again
all right
I String stream
ISS
text
ISS
word one here basically we are storing
the data in word one
then CP another array
so we'll store word one at the zeroth
position
then we'll increment
CP
by mistake we wrote Co
all right
now we'll increment so that the password
will also get stored
all right
now
we'll use if condition
if if old password is equal to cp1 as we
know at cp0
the username is there but we have to
compare the password so if old password
is equal to cp1 that is the new password
that the user has entered then
first of all we'll close the previous
file
to free up the memory space
all right now we will open another file
with off stream object of one
because off stream is used when we want
to write something
open and write so now we'll use
of one object
dot is underscore open
now
double actually
all right now C out
enter your new password we are basically
asking them to enter the new password
we will take the input of the password
one
then we again display another message
saying that enter your password again
so enter your password
again
again we'll take the input
saying that password to
now if
password 1
equals to
password to
then
we will overwrite
p
0
that is we are storing the zeroth index
of CP at of1 we will basically
overwriting this slash and so that the
username and the password
displays in different lines in the file
that is being created
of one
password one here we are basically
overwriting now
will display the message after this that
password
changed successfully
all right
now in else block that is if password
one is not equal to password 2 in that
case what we will be doing is of1
CP 0 after cp0
will again use slash n
all right of one
old that is the old password
so it doesn't get override here
so now we'll display
password
do not
match
now for the previous if
we'll create else condition
in this else we will print
please enter valid password
that is if the old password entered by
the user is wrong please enter a valid
password
all right once this is done we can use a
break here
all right
now the break statement is already there
now
as we can see there were four
things like four options login change
password and end program fourth one is
and program now we'll have to create
case number four
and inside that case we can do one thing
like we'll
just print one thing and use the break
statement we can write like thank you
so that it'll look nice
all right so the fourth case is also
done
now we can also create a default case
in the default case we can write like
enter a valid Choice like if the user by
chance entered five six seven other than
one two three four then this message
will be displayed
all right now we'll use a while loop
not equals to 4
so
so this is the while loop of this dude
do that we have created as you can see
this do we have used the do by Loop so
it keeps on repeating until a that is
the choice is not equal to 4 Once the
user entered four that is the end
program
then it will not show the options so
that's why we have used
a this while
return
0.
all right our code is done let's try
to run this program
I believe some errors must be there
let's see
so
it is showing some error over here
so we have used
level codes with endl which we can't use
all right now let's save this one
and now let's try to run this
we forgot to close this one there must
be some errors
again so again we'll have to
make it double equal to
and one more energy is there I figured
that out a not equal to 4. forgot to add
equal to sign
now I'm sure that
I'm pretty sure that all the errors are
resolved let's try to run this again
all right as you can see
one for register two for login three for
change password four four and program
all right so
first of all we'll register let's say
we want to register enter your choice
one
let's say AK
one at the red Gmail
so this is the username
let's set the password AK
123
right age 24
registration successful now we have to
press 2 to login
again the username we will have to enter
we'll write AK
1 at the rate Gmail
now the password is
ak123 As We Know
so as you can see the details are here
username is this password is this and
age is 24.
now let's say we want to change the
password we'll click on 3 as it is
measured to change the password you'll
have to click on 3.
so we have clicked on three
so first we'll have to enter the old
password which was ak12
3.
now the new password
ak321 let's say
for the confirmation we will have to
enter the password again ak321
as you can see password change
successfully now just to check that
if this password is really changed or
not we'll log in again
we'll press 2 to login and enter the
username ak1
at the rate Gmail and try to log in with
the new password which is ak321
as we can see the login is successful
username is this password is ak3221
three to one age is 24.
now let's say
if we try to login with the wrong
password
so let's say AK one at the rate Gmail
this was our username
now the password let's say
ak456 let's try to login with the wrong
password
as you can see incorrect credentials
press 2 to login press 3 to change the
password
so now it's your choice if you want to
login again
then you can do that if you want to
change the password you have to click on
three
and as we know that
we know the right password so will not
do that
password change thing
all right now
we'll click on four to
end program as you can see thank you
message is displayed
now we can also try one more thing like
let's try to run this again
as you can see uh first of all let's
register
let's see
Sam
at the rate Gmail
this is the username the password is
sam123
and age is 24.
so as you can see the registration is
successful
now we'll try to login
so while logging in we'll put the wrong
password
so let's see
Sam
at the rate
Gmail
Sam
three to one
so as you can see incorrect credentials
again press 2 to login and press 3 to
change password
so you can click on two or three if you
want to
if you want to login or change password
respectively
I don't want to do that so I'll simply
click on 4
2 and the program so thank you message
will be displayed
so guys this was about this
security system in C plus plus it is
quite basic topic and all the concepts
that are being used is intermediate
level you can create this on your own
you can add some functionality some more
functionality to this security system
also and doing projects like this will
enhance your knowledge in C plus plus
and will give you
or show you the Practical aspect of C
plus plus
you can try this project on your own
and with that we have come to the end of
this video on security system in C plus
plus so previously a question was asked
about what C plus plus previous name was
the correct option was C with glasses
