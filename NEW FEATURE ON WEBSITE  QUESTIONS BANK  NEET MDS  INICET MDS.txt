yeah hi V uh good evening one and all uh
this video is basically uh to give an
information about the new future that is
being added on the website to make your
preparation more
comfortable so as most of you are
familiar about uh take exam in take exam
you have different sessions uh image
based neat and in and subject specific
so for example examp you jump into NE
and inct you have all the subjects and
every subject is going to have many
subtopics you can see there are many
subtopics individual so how you give
these questions is a regular based
questions what is the regular based
questions it's very simple that you are
going
to attempt all the questions submit all
the questions and you get the result of
all the questions and you can check the
explanations of each and every
individual question so now in the
dashbox we worked and we added a new
future called as question bank so what
is this question Bank it is how you
solve a question Bank like you have many
question Banks available in the market
okay Dental pulse is there dentist is
there lots of books are available how
you
solve uh these books is most of us solve
question by question so you read the
first question understand the first
question okay you think the answer is B
then you'll check the answer or for
example Dentistry is given below you
check the answer you check the
explanation and move to the second
second question this is how you solve a
question Bank based question so
similarly we have came out with a
strategy of this question bank for
example you want to solve the questions
of a particular Topic in
arthor for example I want to solve
orthodontic material and its environment
so I'm starting the question Bank of
that particular topic
okay so it will be same like you're uh
solving a question in your pulse so the
first question is which of the following
are the primary chemical reactions
involving in the corrosion of a material
in the oral cavity and you can see an
auto submit button is clearly showing
the timeline so we are left over with 15
seconds of time okay so before that we
need to answer this question for example
I know the answer of this question so
for example the answer is redox
reactions okay so I know the answer and
I'm submitting it okay now what is the
next step in your uh McQ solving in your
regular question bankses you know the
answer you think the answer you check
the answer now the answer is
automatically you got the answer the
answer is redox reaction you have a
beautiful explanation here you're going
to read the explanation okay I read the
explanation understand the explanation
now after reading and understanding what
I do I go to the next question similarly
in the question back now I'll go to the
next question I have one more question
okay so the question is in front of you
option is in front of you and the
timeline is also I kept a timeline
basically why I kept a timeline is so
that you rush fast you think fast okay
you move fast fast and you finish Fast
this is this feature is not there when
solving regular McQ books now my
timeline is clearly showing that I'm
left over with 10 seconds if I don't
answer in 10 seconds what happens it
automatically submits means the question
you have not answered but it
automatically submits it will show you
the answer okay yeah now it's
automatically submitted now it is
showing you the answer along with the
explanation so now I'm once I'm clear
with the explanation I'll be going to
the next question similarly I'm going to
finish the question mark so for example
this topic of orth material and its
reactions with the surrounding
environment you have 25 questions okay
so finish it similarly how you finish
how you solve the mcqs that are
regularly available on your McQ books
okay right I hope this future is very
very clear and I know that most of you
are enjoying this new pattern which is
implemented in last few days and uh and
we we had a meeting we have a we had a
team meeting a few days back and the
team is working on providing as much
content as possible as in many mcqs as
possible uh to solve in this pattern so
that you can understand the subject well
analyze the subject well and uh your
mind will not go for the answer for
example when you're solving questions
from dentists or dental pulse for
example you solve questions from Dental
pulse what is going to happen the answer
is there at the corner of the pace and
in dentist the answer is given
immediately so unintentionally your I
will automatically move to the question
to check the answer but here I have kept
a timeline of 30 for few subjects okay
and uh 45 seconds for few subjects for
example like a case based questions
lengthy questions I have kept the
timeline of 1 minute I don't uh I I
don't I don't prefer to have the same
timel for all mode of questions for
example a memory based
question it hits fast so you require
less time diagram based questions very
specific less time okay case-based
questions you need to think lengthy
questions you need to think more time
like so I I personally have taken the
privilege to decide what time is
necessary for a particular uh group of
questions according to that I have
planned okay so just do do enjoy this
pattern of uh the new future of course
there is one more future that's being
added that is your timeline based exam
so inic already implemented and be
people has given a notification before
neat PG for the medical nbbs students
that from this round they are going to
have this timeline based exam similar to
inic but this implementation for MDS is
yes it is Paka but it will be probably
uh for the next examination that is neat
MDS
2025 okay right uh but how many
questions how many sessions how it will
be whether it is uh they're going to
split the first two parts into clinicals
last two parts into non-cl clinicals or
they may come up with a strategy May
different strategies first year subject
second year subjects third year subjects
we don't know exactly or there is a
mixed pattern of exam we don't know
exactly what they are going to implement
we need to wait for the notification of
need MDS 2025 for that okay of course
this software is already implemented on
the website my next video will be on
this software and of course students has
given the recent Grand examination on
this mode and they have enjoyed this new
pattern okay so study well take care uh
see you very very soon with a few more
uh website based features like how you
need to effectively use the website of
MDS conquer how this MDS conquer website
is unique and different from the rest of
the websites how it's going to make your
preparation more comfortable how the
access will be uh this permit the
screenshots how to take them how to
preserve them okay there are lots of
Futures uh which will which we are
planning to uh post them as a videos so
that you can effectively use the website
and effectively use the access to make
your preparation more smooth and
comfortable okay take care study well
see you
