box and in the pin comments so let's get
started what is python python is a
highlevel objectoriented programming
language developed by Guido van rosom in
1989 and was first released in
1991 python is often called A batteries
included language due to its
comprehensive standard Library a fun
fact about python is that the name
python was actually taken from the
popular BBC comedy show of that time
Monty Python's Flying Circus now let's
look at the top features of
python first so python has a simple
structure and a clearly defined syntax
this allows the Learners to pick up the
language quickly so it is easy to learn
and
use Python can run on different
operating systems such as Windows Linux
and Mac making it a portable language it
enables programmers to develop the
software for several competing platforms
by writing a program only
once third python is freely available at
the official website since it is open
source this means that source code is
also available to the public
now python uses an objectoriented
approach that encapsulates code within
objects python provides a collection of
libraries for various tasks such as
machine learning web development and
data analysis and finally in Python you
don't need to assign the data type of
the variable when you assign some value
to the variable it automatically
allocates the memory to the variable at
runtime now with that let's move on to
the uses of Python programming
so Python programming language is used
to develop desktop applications and
build web applications too it is
popularly used in the field of data
science machine learning and artificial
intelligence to analyze data build
predictive models and make business
decisions python is also widely used in
game development now let's see some of
the popular python Frameworks and
libraries python can be used for web
development using Frameworks like Zango
flask pyramid and cherrypy
now you can build graphical user
interfaces using libraries and
Frameworks such as tter or just kter you
can also use Pi gtk Pi qt or pygs or
python
JavaScript now python is also used to
perform machine learning tasks using
libraries such as tensorflow P torch
psychic learn matplot Li and
scipi you can also perform mathematical
computations using numpy and pandas
now let's look at the best IDs that you
can use to write programs in Python and
perform specific tasks so we have
Jupiter notebook which is part of the
Anaconda distribution that is widely
used these days even for our demo in
this video we'll be using jupyter
notebook I'll show you in a while then
we have the visual code editor from
Microsoft this is also one of the
preferred ID by Learners and companies
then we also have the popular text
editor called Sublime Text editor then
we also have pyam followed by python
idle and spider as our top IDs now let's
look at the top companies that are using
python in our day-to-day
work so we have Google Kora Facebook
even Netflix Spotify and Instagram now
there are other top product based
service based and startups that also use
Python Programming so what really is
Python programming
language python is an object-oriented
highlevel programming language that
supports built-in data structures and
dynamic
semantics it supports multiple
programming paradigms such as structured
objectoriented and functional
programming python is often described as
batteries included language because it
has a comprehensive collection of
standard libraries python supports
different modules and packages which
allows program modularity and code
reuse python was developed by Guido van
Ro
and its implementation started In
December
1989 python 1.0 version was released in
the year
1994 python 2.0 came out in October 2000
while python 3.0 was released in
December
2008 now that you have got an
understanding of the Python programming
language let's now look at the top 10
reasons why you should learn
python so at number 10 we have ease of
use
one of the most common reasons to like
python is that it is quite easy to learn
and code it provides a simple syntax
that improves datability and makes it
easier to understand so developers can
create any desktop or machine based
application using this language python
is very versatile and is instrumental in
artificial intelligence and machine
learning we will talk about this later
in the session compared to Java or cc++
it has fewer lines of codes
in the example here we are printing a
hello world program in Java as you can
see if you have to write a program in
Java you first have to declare the class
name along with its
scope next using curly braces you need
to pass the main method along with its
arguments and then using
system.out.println method you can print
hello world that's quite a tedious task
isn't
it the same task of printing hello world
can be done using just one line of code
in python as shown here you can write
the print function and pass whatever you
want to display inside the brackets and
that will print the output it is so
simple that is why python is considered
as a high level language and its open
source you can just download it from the
website and start using it
at 9 we have active
Community you need a community to learn
new technology and friends are your best
asset when it comes to learning a
programming language python has large
community
support it has an extensive and active
Community to assist Engineers developers
analysts and data scientists with expert
support in case of programming errors or
issues with the software you can just go
ahead and put your queries in the
community Forum the community members
will address your queries in real quick
time communities like stack Overflow
also brings many python experts together
to help
Learners python enhancement proposals or
p is where the proposals and the
improvements are announced also there
are a set of recommendations or core
values called the Zen of python written
by Tim Peters that represents the
guiding principles for python
development up next at eight we have
portable and
extensible multiple cross- language
operations can be performed effectively
because python is portable and
extensible in nature for example if the
users have a python code written on
Windows and they want to execute on a
Mac operating system or Linux operating
system or Solaris they can easily do it
without any Amendment they can also run
this code on any platform flawlessly and
without any
interrupt due to its extensibility
feature you can integrate other
programming languages such as Java net C
and C++ quotes with python the
components of other programming
languages can be used with python and
thus it can be used to make a
crossplatform suitable application too
so it is a really good feature that
python provides
the next Reason To Learn Python is
testing
Frameworks python supports several
built-in Flawless testing tools and
Frameworks that help in debugging and
speeding of
workflows some of the tools and
Frameworks supported by python are py
test selenium and Splinter this is the
reason for which every tester tries to
use Python based tools and Frameworks to
test any application or code or to
validate it in an easier manner P test
is the most recommended testing
framework for functional integrational
and unit testing you can run selenium
test scripts using Python programming
language to automate various tasks and
Splinter is an open source tool for
testing web applications using python it
lets you automate browser actions such
as visiting URLs and interacting with
their
items at number six we have libraries
and
packages another reason why python has
become so popular in the industry these
days is that it has a massive collection
of libraries and packages that make your
task simple and
easy it has a range of libraries
packages Frameworks and modules for data
manipulation statistical calculation web
development machine learning and data
science python programmers have
developed tons of free and open source
libraries that you can use you can find
many of them via python package index
the repository of python software python
provides the default package called pip
Anaconda is a third party python
ecosystem other examples include numpy
scipi and
Zango then we have scripting and
automation python is not just a
programming language it can also be used
for writing scripts for automating tasks
and workflows without human intervention
the code can be written in the form of
scripts and executed later further it is
interpreted by the machine and checked
for errors at runtime the machine is
used to read and interpret the code once
the developer checks the code it can
further run or be used several times
without any
Interruption this allows you to automate
a set of certain task within a program
or the same code can be used with other
applications as well
at number four we have web
development another reason to Learn
Python is that it makes the web
development process so much
easier it provides a wide collection of
Frameworks that make it easier for
developers to develop web
applications some of the examples are
Zango flask pyramid turbo gears cherryi
Etc these Frameworks are written in
Python which makes the code a lot faster
and
stable the task which used to take hours
in PHP can be finished in minutes using
python python is also used for web
scraping D Jango offers many elements of
intricate programs such as template
design management panel signing in
signing up signing out URL routing
Etc once the user establishes the
framework all these features become
ready to use flask is a microwave
framework written in
Python of all the components that are
part of this module they're all ready to
execute in the server
context Pinterest and Linkedin use flask
pyramid offers more attributes than
flask it will assist users with URL
routing and authentication support turbo
gears is a highly recommended and
scalable framework that supports
features such as Authentication
caching identification management of
sessions and plugable
applications up next at number three we
have machine
learning the growth of machine learning
has been phenomenal in The Last 5 Years
and it's rapidly changing the world
around us python is one of the most
preferred programming languages for
machine learning because of its simple
syntax and support for several machine
learning libraries
using different libraries and functions
in Python the system can learn and train
itself from past
data once the system is trained it can
then learn to adjust itself to new
inputs finally it can make predictions
and perform humanlike tasks
automatically at number two we have data
science machine learning and data
science go hand in hand python is robust
scalable and provides extensible
visualization and Graphics options hence
it is widely used in data
science python has libraries such as
numpy for numerical computation of data
pandas for operations to manipulate data
on numerical tables and time series it
also provides simpai for symbolic
computation and scipi for Technical and
scientific
computations it has another Library
called pyin which is sought for python
based reinforcement learning artificial
intelligence and neural network library
psyit learn is a machine learning
library for creating classification
regression and clustering algorithms and
finally it provides spy torch and
tensorflow for deep
learning finally coming to the most
important and the top reason to Learn
Python which is career opportunities and
salary Python language provides a
variety of job opportunities and
Promises a high growth graph with huge
salary prospects it is being used by
most of the tech
Giants industry leaders using python are
Amazon Google Facebook IBM NASA Netflix
and
YouTube next you can see the Google
Trends but I have considered three
programming languages python Java and
C++ I have compared them for the past 12
months you can see it clearly on your
screens that python has become a front
runner in terms of popularity and web
search point volume it means people are
interested in Python they want to learn
it and use it in their work you can also
check for the YouTube
search there also you will find that
Python programming language is the most
searched language on
YouTube now on your screens you can see
the report of pypl which is popularity
of programming language index it is
created by analyzing how often language
tutorials are searched on Google
it is a leading indicator the raw data
comes from Google Trends the bar graph
depicts that python is the most popular
and widely used programming language
across the globe followed by Java then
JavaScript and
C the popularity of programming language
index can help you decide which language
to study or which one to use in a new
software
project the next graph shows the
popularity of python and Java over the
years starting from 2004 till the
current period which is 2020 worldwide
python is the most popular language
python grew the most in the Last 5 Years
by
19.4% and Java lost the most by-
7.2% now let's talk about the different
career opportunities and the job roles
that you can get into If You Learn
Python language first first you can
become a python
developer where you will be asked to
write and test codes debug programs and
integrate applications with thirdparty
web
services second you can become a web
developer here you will be responsible
for writing serers side web application
logic python web developers usually
develop backend components connect the
application with third party services
and support the front-end developers by
integrating their work with the python
application
you can also become a data analyst if
you know python as a data analyst you
have to gather data from multiple
sources using scripts analyze that data
develop and Implement databases and data
collection
systems you can become a data scientist
as a data scientist you need to
understand the challenges in business
and come up with the best Solutions
using modern tools and techniques to
analyze visualize and build prediction
models to make business
decisions lastly you can be a machine
learning engineer where you can develop
intelligent machines that can learn from
vast volumes of data and apply knowledge
without human
intervention so there's a lot of Scopes
If You Learn
Python now let's have a look at the
salaries of some of these job
roles so if you become a python
developer you can earn an average salary
of
7652 $6 perom in the United States while
in India you can earn an average of
498,000 rupees
perom
also if You Learn Python and become a
data scientist you can expect an average
salary of $113,000 per year in the
United States while in India you can
earn an average of 10 lakh 28,000 rupees
perom let me go ahead and call out the
10 reasons for learning python once
again at number 10 we had ease of use at
number nine we had active community at 8
we had the portable and extensible
feature of python at number seven we saw
the testing
Frameworks at six we had libraries and
packages then at five we saw scripting
and automation followed by web
development then we had machine learning
and data sense at number three and
number two
respectively and finally at number one
we had career opportunities and salary
but before we move on let's understand
first what is Jupiter notebook so guys
as you can see all over here that
jupyter notebook is a popular open-
Source tool that basically allows you to
create and share documents which
contains codes equations we can have
visualizations also basically it is used
for data analysis machine learning and
scientific research which makes it a
very essential tools for developers like
data scientists and researchers alike
now now before installing jupyter
notebook I request you that you have
python installed in your system so the
requirement should be python 3.6 or
greater so now let us officially
navigate to the Python's website so guys
as you can see all over here so on
python.org if I click on download python
so we're going to see that all over here
download python 3.125 so as I already
told you that the requirement of python
should be greater than 3.6 so just you
can click all over here and you can see
the download has
started so guys as you can see all over
here that we have installed the python
now let us open the file so you can see
the given software is going to installed
on this directory okay so just click all
over here so guys as you can see all
over here the python installation of
3.125 is in progress let's wait for some
time till it gets installed
so as you can see guys all over here
that we have successfully installed our
python now let us open our terminal and
let us check whether python is correctly
installed so we are going to type
python
slver so as you can see all over here we
have successfully installed our python
so guys that was our prerequisite now
there are two ways to install Jupiter
notebook the first one can be pip okay
pip is a package manager
or using Ananda distribution so let us
see with Pip first so guys pip is a
package manager which is used to install
and manage software packages libraries
written in Python so you can see all
over here that the python with version
greater than 3.6 have default pip
install in them okay so we can use pip
command to install our jupyter notebook
so guys as you can see all over here we
have come to the official documentation
of jupiter. org and it is saying that
installing Jupiter lab with Pip command
so what you can do guys you can just
copy all over here you can go right all
over here and click on this now as you
can see all over here it has started
downloading the Jupiter lab
so guys we are going to install our
Jupiter lab with the PIP command so this
is the official documentation of Jupiter
notebook okay and just all you have to
do is copy this and type on your
terminal so as you can see all over here
it has started downloading the packages
which is required to download the
Jupiter notebook let us wait for some
time okay guys so we have successfully
completed this step now let us move on
to our next step so as you can see all
over here so we have installed okay then
what we have to do then you can type
this you can launch the Jupiter lab with
this command on the terminal now let us
wait so as you can see all over here
guys we have successfully installed our
jupyter notebook so you can go all over
here and just create a new notebook and
you can also choose your kernel and you
can start working on your a notebook
suppose I'll show you one snippet so 3 +
5 let us try to run this notebook so as
you can see it is giving us the 8 as
answer so it is following the python
syntax and in this way we have
successfully installed our Jupiter
notebook using the pep command so now as
you can also see all over here you can
also install Jupiter notebook with this
command pip install notebook and then
you can just open it this is also an
another alternative
similarly you can install with via also
same command and just open the Via now
if you are using any other operating
system like Mac OS or Linux then you can
install by bre install Jupiter lab so
home bre will be the package manager for
macx and Linux so I hope so you are
pretty clear with how to install Jupiter
notebook with the pep command now I have
downloaded anacondas from this official
website so as as you can see all over
here this is the official website of
anaconda okay now just type your email
and you can just download it so
similarly as you can see after
installing I'm going to launch my
installer and let us click next okay let
us click agree okay and let us install
this on the given
directory let us wait for some time till
the installation gets complete
so guys as you can see all over here we
have completed our installation of
Ananda so just click on finish and you
can say we have successfully installed
our Ananda now let us open our anakonda
Navigator so just click
on so as you can see all over here just
right click on this and our anoc Canda
Navigator will be opened so as you can
see all over here this is our Ananda
Navigator and it loading the packages
and for us to install the Jupiter
notebook so as you can see all over here
just click on launch so guys if you
click on launch it is going to open our
Jupiter notebook so as you can see all
over here it is saying launching the
Jupiter notebook and it is hosted on
Local Host 8889 so this is our hosted
Jupiter notebook and similarly you can
create a new notebook all way here and
in this way you can start working uh now
that we have gotten all the
introductions and the basics and the
installations uh regarding python aside
uh let's get right let's get down to
actually creating our first script so
now the question is uh how do we
actually start doing this task of
creating our first python script how do
we how do we realize uh now that we've
installed uh python like uh now let's
how do we start doing something so the
answer to that question is that
typically when you're working on python
the one of the most basic things that
you can do is create a python script and
execute a script a script is essentially
a sequence of commands and instructions
that you give for python to run and
execute to give you a certain result so
I will show you how you can create a
python script now there are multiple
ways of creating a python script you can
create it directly from command line
which is obviously something I would not
recommend because it is not convenient
and easy and it's not very useful for
the beginner another way is using a text
editor such as the one I have opened
right now which is the notepad++ text
editor now it's very important to not
get confused uh between notepad++ and
the standard notepad that comes with
your windows uh or word pad for that
matter in fact text editors such as
notepad and wordpad um that you are more
familiar with create text and files in a
a form that is called Rich Text Now Rich
Text is something is text that uh
contains formatting and fonts which is
actually a hindrance when it comes to
creating actual code so what we need is
a text editor that creates or writes
text in what we call as plain text uh
plain text is obviously text which does
not contain these fonts and these
formattings uh and it only respects
white spaces and indentation
those two being actually useful towards
creating code unlike fonts and
formatting which are only a visual thing
so notepad++ is obviously a text editor
that creates uh plain text documents uh
that is very that was actually created
with programming in mind obviously you
can use a bunch of other text editors
such as whim and atom and you can Google
for these there are plenty of them so uh
without any further Ado let's create our
first python script so one of the most
common one of the most famous examples
of a first program in any program for
that matter not just python is creating
a print statement that gives us a
statement saying hello world so in in
Python this is how you would go about or
this is the syntax you would use to
create the statement all right now it is
very important when you are saving your
Python program that you use the py
prefix so so if I were to save this I
can choose whatever folder I am going to
choose yeah this folder seems fine so
now I give the file name over here as
say I want to keep it as test I need to
prefix this withp and this uh tells any
uh sort of interpreter or anytime we
need to read the script to know that
it's a python script we need to add a py
otherwise it will not be treated as a
python script it will be treated as some
normal do doucment sort of a thing so
now that I have stored it aspy uh I have
created my first python script now uh
obviously the next question is I need to
see uh what happens when I execute this
line when I run this script essentially
so to see that um there are multiple
ways the first way that I will show you
is a command line method which is
obviously again before we get into it
it's not something that I will be using
to teach you it's not something I would
recommend you to start immediately start
using um but for the sake of uh showing
I will show you how to execute a script
in command line well to do this you go
since I have installed anaconda in my
system and I will be using Anaconda to
uh work in Python what I will look for
is something called the Anaconda prompt
as you can see this is the option that I
get Anaconda prompt uh this will
essentially open you a command line uh
under the environment of anaconda or
python so in this now I'm already in the
folder I believe believe that had my
script so uh how do I call this script
or how do I run the script well the
command is python space the name of my
file which was test of course the prefix
is very important so I enter test.py if
you if this was in a different folder
you would have to change your folders in
command line which is again something
that I might uh show you later but since
my file is already in the folder that I
in in my command line I would just have
to enter this Command right now so if I
execute this as you can see it's given
me an output of hello world which is
which is what I wanted I wanted it to
print this uh these two words and of
course the command line is now waiting
for the next command for me so this is
uh one of the most simple ways of or the
most rudimentary ways of executing a
python script now another question would
be well this isn't the most visually
appealing or uh not the easy to read or
easy to use way of um executing scripts
and I would agree and that's why I'm
going to introduce a another technology
or a software called the IDE so the IDE
in python or in any programming language
stands for integrated development
environment it's essentially a software
that not only allows us to run scripts
but it allows us to create the scripts
it allows us to debug it allows us to
see outputs it allows us to see
intermediary outputs uh it allows us to
do a wide variety of tools and tasks and
uh it comes with a bunch of robust
features to enhance server Python
programming experience so let's let's
see so I will show you a an IDE called
spider which comes bundled along with
the Anaconda distribution that I had
mentioned earlier so if I open the
Anaconda Navigator as you can see the
anacon Navigator shows me a bunch of
Technologies and options and I'm looking
for something called the spider IDE
which is over here as you can see here
it's a Scientific Python development
environment uh this is exactly what I'm
looking for so I'm I am looking to
launch this so now that I've launched it
you can see out here this is what an IDE
looks like now this looks very
sophisticated and it's it's a one and
any almost any IDE is a wonderful
software that where you can create your
code you can debug your code you can
check the results you can make
adjustments changes and you can do a
wide variety of tasks and functions with
relation to your programming so this is
the spider ID in particular and this is
how it looks don't worry about the exact
details just know that on this left hand
pane is our current script that is open
out here and out here we will get the
results in this this what we call a
console console essentially so now that
we we have already created our script in
notepad++ and I want to open that script
and I want to see uh how an i how it
would the result of that script would
look in an IDE so let's just open it so
we can browse for our file and as I had
uh named it test this is the file over
here I open this and as you can see out
here in the left hand pane my script has
opened and the command that I had given
or had written is out over here now if I
want to run this application I press
this green button and as you can see the
result of my my execution essentially is
over here it's in slightly small font
but as you can see over here uh it says
hello world and it's wait and the next
line is essentially it's it's waiting
for me to do another execution of the
script and then it will give me new
results so let's actually give this
system new results so now that I have
printed something called hello world
let's let's change what's written over
here let's say I will perform basic
maths all right and let's actually
perform the basic maths again don't
worry about the details the syntax what
I'm exactly doing these are things that
we will actually cover in the in
upcoming videos and modules so let's
create a variable called a let's store a
a number number three let's create a
variable B Store a number five all right
let's create another variable C uh which
will store the result of what's in a and
b in the addition of A and B all right
and let's print the result or print
what's in uh this variable C or what's
the result of a plus b I will print a
statement saying the result of the
addition of three and five is all right
right and I will put my result over here
as you can see uh I should get the
result in this pan so let's execute this
and you can see uh my first line is
executed saying I will perform basic
maths and the next line says the result
of the addition of three and five is
eight so uh this in this script what
I've done is I have performed uh two
print statements and I performed a basic
expression some variable assignments all
of these things we will be doing later
this is what I'm what I'm essentially to
show you is that idees are a very
convenient way of not only creating the
scripts but actually seeing the results
and then making adjustments as well we
can uh we can create a completely new
script we don't need to create a script
from some special file or text editor uh
I can just create a new file here and
this is my new script essentially so I
can start working on with this new
script right over here from the GetGo so
idees are very powerful spider IDE comes
uh bundled with Anaconda there are other
idees such as the I idle IDE it stands
for um integrated uh development and
learning environment so the ID uh IDE
comes uh as part of the uh basic python
implementation that I had shown you in
the previous video where if you just
installed a basic uh python uh
implementation it would come along with
a basic IDE known as Idle or integrated
development and learning environment but
of course since we are using Python and
that's what I would recommend uh it
comes with a more robust IDE called
spider uh which is actually very very
helpful for scientific uh and numeric
applications um and was designed
specifically with that in mind now uh
this is not the only way we can actually
work with python there's another very
interesting and uh a very educative
method of creating python let's say
python programs and it's something that
I will be using extensively throughout
this course to explain different
concepts so this technology is called or
this software is called uh notebooks now
before I get into the details I will
straight I will just open not a basic
notebook so the notebook that comes as
part of anaconda is called the Jupiter
notebook and when I open or when I
launch the jupyter notebook this is what
I get now a very important feature or a
a feature of notebooks is that notebooks
are a web browser or a web based
application so you it's not something
that you can use if you are offline or
disconnected basically if you're
disconnected from the internet it is
something where which for which you
would need an active uh internet
connection uh however it is way more
robust and it has very very good uh
properties that allow it to be used in
education or for presentations and such
so as you can see this is my jupyter
notebook these are a bunch of folders
don't need to worry about about what
these are right now I will show you how
to create a fresh notebook so if you go
here you go to new and you select under
notebook the Python 3 option it will
open you your first notebook as you can
see um this line is essentially waiting
for me to enter some sort of a command
or a statement that I would give in a
normal python thing now if you would
have noticed the diff in uh until now
everything that we were doing involved
as uh creating a script which was the
whole series of commands and functions
so if I go back to my spider ID as you
can see like this is a whole script and
the script contains multiple different
uh tasks and functions that are
individually uh being performed so this
is a separate print function this is a
separate Edition another separate print
function and for longer uh programs or
larger programs you like you'll have
multiple different tasks being done and
if you were using a script you can only
see the result of something like this by
executing the whole thing at once you
cannot see exactly like uh what is the
result of just this print statement or
just this uh it's not typically uh what
an IDE is used for and this is where
notebooks come in super handy uh if I
had to break down my previous script
essentially where I first did a print
statement where I said some random thing
say
hello yeah so if I execute this
particular line you can see it it gives
me the result now I want to do what is 5
+ 3 it should give me the result over
here 8 now the next another part of your
program might be storing five and three
into variables so I can do this and I
can do this so now this line will store
the variables now I want to do the
addition of what is 5 + 3 but I want to
use the variables and I want to see
what's the result as you can see A+ b
means 5 + 3 which is 8 and I've
essentially broken down various
different parts of my previous script
into into its individual tasks and I'm
able to see what each part of that
script does and this is very good when
it comes to making presentations or uh
trying to teach a class so I will
personally be using notebooks a lot to
explain different different concepts of
um different concepts when it comes to
Python and I would recommend that you
get used to uh notebooks in general
because uh it's an amazing way to Learn
Python Programming or programming in
general in fact and again as I had
mentioned earlier notebooks are
something that it's an online
application it's a web- based
application so I will have to need a
active internet connection to be able to
work on a notebook which could be a
disadvantage if you do not have a
consistent internet connection and in
that case you would probably use your
idees or text editors which can be used
offline as well in this video we will be
introduced to the concept of variables
and expressions let's start with
Expressions well an expression in Python
is anything that results in a value it's
difference or the difference between an
expression and a standard statement in
Python is that a statement in Python is
something that results in an action or
an execution of a command there is no
calculation per se or any sort of
manipulation or as I said earlier
calculation resulting in between two
different say numbers or other objects
that results in a value and this happens
in the case of an expression so for
example if I were to add two num say 5 +
10 this is an expression which should
where two objects 5 and 10 are being
added and a result is being given to me
which is 15 now let's see an example of
a statement well a statement could be
something like a print statement so when
I ask python to print something for me
it's not calculating anything it's it's
not evaluating anything it's simply
performing an action that I have or a
command that I have given the system
which is to print whatever I have
entered over here as you can see so this
is a statement similarly there are uh
another type of statement known as
assignment statements which we will
learn actually right in the next section
well let's move on to variables right
now now earlier you might have learned
about objects in Python so objects are
essentially data uh that we can work
with a manipulate in Python now
variables are a place to store these
different objects um usually uh it's
much easier to store objects in Python
instead of using the objects explicitly
themselves because objects may be very
comp complicated whereas variables are
very simple to use and very simply uh
very named in a very simple manner so
that we can use them quite often in our
programs now it's important to note that
in Python we do not have to explicitly
declare or Define a variable to create
them in fact variables are created in
the same statement where we assign some
object to that variable in Python the
assignment of variables happens using
the assignment operator which is the
equals to sign so if I were to if I
wanted to assign a number say 100 to a
variable say B well it would be as
simple as doing this now anytime I want
to know what is stored in B I just have
to enter B and I will get the value that
is stored in it and we can store
different types of objects inside a any
variable let's say I store I want to
store this particular word in the form
of a string now this is stored in X and
if I want to know what is an X I can
just see what is here and it's a string
hello which I had stored earlier now
it's very important that we follow
certain naming rules when it comes to
naming our variables in python or else
we may be thrown errors or we might get
some problems in our program so the
first rule is is that you cannot start
your variable name with a number so if I
were to give a variable name like for
Num is equal to something say the same
string hello this would be an illegal
variable name and I will get an error
when I try this so if I were to choose
in Num for is equal to hello this would
be perfectly fine I won't get an error
the second rule is we are not allowed to
use any non-alpha numeric characters
except the underscore character while
naming our variable so for example if I
were to name my variable numor 4 and I
stay I said random some random string
this is perfectly fine however if I
changed numor 4 to num hyen for this
will throw me an error as you can see
over here next the third rule is that
variable names are case sensitive so if
if I have a variable called num or say
nuum if this was one of my variables and
I stored say the value 50 this is not
the same as me writing nuum all in
capitals and say storing some other
value 60 these are two different
variables so it's very important that
when you name your variables you are
aware of what case you are writing them
in because python variables are case
sensitive now the final and probably one
of the most important rules in Python is
that you're not allowed to use what we
call Reserve words in Python now python
has a bunch of reserved words these
words essentially are performed or they
are used to perform certain special
functions and are used as identifiers
for certain special functions in Python
that we that have a special purpose like
that particular word has a special
purpose within the Python programming
language and we cannot use them to name
our variables so a list of them are you
can see over here some of them are like
false def if uh D rays and there are
like there are around 33 of them and uh
some Sometimes some of these words are
taken out sometimes there are more words
added as python gets updated now let's
let's move on to a concept uh where we
try to really understand what do we mean
by storing data inside a variable now
when I say that we are storing something
inside a variable you get an image or
you get an idea in your head that this
variable is like a container where we
store or we put a particular object
inside it so does this mean that
variables have a place in the memory are
they also an object that is placed in
the memory where we can put other
objects inside of well I'll show you an
example where this idea is kind of
disproven or where I'll show you that
the idea of variable is kind of
different than what we understand by
storing something inside a variable now
let's say I'm storing the same object uh
I will take this object as some random
number let's say 100 and I'm going to
store it into two different variables so
I take X is equal to 100 over here and
in the next line I will store 100 in y
as well now if objects were I mean if
variables were objects that we placed in
our system then X and Y should have two
different IDs but let's see what happens
when I check the ID of X and the ID of Y
they should be different in case
variables were their own objects however
as you can see the ID of X and the ID of
Y are exactly the same so well obviously
we know that two different object
objects in Python cannot have the same
ID so does this so what does this mean
when it comes to the nature of a
variable well the the fact is that
variables are not actually objects in
Python in fact variables are more like
pointers or references to the actual
object so when I said X is equal to 100
and Y is equal to 100 what I'm actually
telling the system is that there is this
variable name called X that I want to
ref refer or Point towards the actual
object that is in my memory called 100
and I do the same thing with another
another variable y so I am not exactly
creating a different space in my system
for these variables these variables are
more like placeholders or references
that point to a particular place in the
memory where this object is located and
that is what happens when I do ID of X
and ID of Y it's not giving me the idea
of something called X or the ID of
something called y it's giving me the ID
of 100 each each time because 100 is
stored in X and Y so as you can see this
is something like a V visual
representation of what I'm trying to say
and similarly if if I were to so in this
example on the left as you can see I've
used the uh value of 50 to explain my
point so as you can see initially X and
Y are pointing towards this value 50
because I have stored 50 and 50 in both
X and Y now what if I changed the object
that is stored in X well that means X is
now pointing towards this new object and
I have stored this new object called
hello this string called hello as you
can see here so now X is pointing to a
new object in the system and it's called
hello and I haven't changed anything
with respect to Y so y will Point
towards the same thing and I can also
make the pointer of Y different or what
I'm trying to say is I can store
something else in y see I stored this
list in y 50 60 and 100 when I do that
now Y is pointing towards a different
object in Python and X is also pointing
towards something else so what happens
to this object 50 well now that there's
no variable referring to this object 50
it becomes what we call an orend object
and we can actually see that when we do
the ID of X now let's go back to my
example on the right where I stored x
equal to 100 so as you can see it it
gives me some ID represented by this
number now let's say I stored x i stored
something different in X say 200 now if
I do the ID of X it should give me a
different ID because as you can see the
values are different and this is because
this object 200 is what is stored in X
and when I do the ID of X I'm actually
getting the ID of this new object now
200 so as you can see Point as you can
see variables are they should be and
they are treated more like references or
pointers uh instead of containers for a
particular object in this video you will
be introduced to the concept of objects
in Python now what are objects in Python
well all the data that we manipulate or
use in our operations in our code are
represented as objects or relations
between objects so if you want an
example two numbers that you add in your
code well both of them are objects and
they're usually numeric type objects
similarly if you want to store someone's
name or an address of your hometown in
your code you usually store it in a form
of text and that text is also an object
usually a string similarly you might
want to create a container of different
smaller objects inside them and that big
container is also a type of an object
and one of those containers are called
lists and similarly we have many
different types of objects which we will
be covering during the duration of this
course the following pictorial
representation gives us a broad
classification of different python data
types and objects as we can see there
are five broad classifications numeric
which contains integers complex numbers
and floats we have the dictionary data
type we have the Boolean which
essentially consists of objects that
have only two valid values true or false
then we have sets and we have sequence
data types such as strings lists and
tupal every object in Python has three
important properties that kind of Define
that particular object they are its
identity its type Tye and its value the
identity of an object is it can be
considered as a place in the memory or
it's address in the memory where an
object is stored an object's identity
does not change one once it has been
created so for example if I took an
example of say a string called hello I
can use the ID function which is this is
how you use the ID function to find out
the ID of this object and it should be
uh the answer should be in the form of
uh a particular long integer so as you
can see the ID of hello is this integer
23264 766 23024 similarly all objects in
Python have an identity we have another
operation with uh regarding the identity
of an object is the is operator and the
is operator compares the identity of two
objects so if two objects have the same
identity it should give the answer true
otherwise false now the next property of
objects is the type type of an object is
essentially uh what defines what kind of
values and operations that that object
can have so for example a numeric data
type in Python such as an integer would
allow us to do arithmetic operations and
similarly string object type in Python
will allow us to do concatenation
operations much like its identity the
type of an object cannot be changed as
well now let's see what's the type of
that particular object that I had shown
you above as you can see it should be
string St Str stands for string
similarly if I did a type for a number
say 50 it should give me int as you can
see now the third property of an object
in Python is its value now the value is
the actual data that is contained in the
object it's the thing that we use that
we display that we can manipulate and
that we can perform operations on so for
example if I were to talk about this
string the string is hello so the value
of the string is the word or the
sequence of letters that spell out hello
and similarly this particular object is
a numeric object with the value 50 let's
see in this in this pictorial
representation I have shown you that you
can assume this dge blue area as the
memory of the system within this memory
we have objects created called 50 and
hello and this list containing smaller
object objects called cat pen and 40 now
what I'm trying to show you here is each
of these objects have a type an ID and a
value and let's see what they are so if
I wanted to see as we had already seen
the type of 50 now let's find the ID of
50 as you can see we get this unique ID
for the object 50 which is obviously not
the same as the ID of the object hello
above and the value of this object is
the valuable 50 itself so that was a
brief introduction into objects in
Python in this video we will cover the
topics of numeric object types and type
conversions in Python now let's get
started numeric object types in Python
are a broad classification of objects
plenty of common real life applications
that we associate with numerals such as
arithmetic operations and calculus are
done in Python using numeric object data
types there are three main types of
numerals or numeric data types in Python
they are integers float and complex
integers as a name suggests represent
all integer values in Python these can
be such as 100 - 3 305 and so on floats
are used to represent numerals that
contain decimal points such as 100.3 3.9
4.8 - 6.8 and so on then there is the
complex object type which is used to
represent complex numbers in Python and
this is an example of a complex number 3
+ 7 J this is is a complex number 3 + 7
J where the real component is three and
the imaginary component is 7 all complex
numbers have a real and an imaginary
component and this is how we denote them
now it's important to note that this J
is a very common symbol in maths and
Engineering used to denote the IM
imaginary portion of a complex number
and it's the same in python as well so
moving on let's talk about type
conversion in Python type conversion
refers to the conversion of of an object
from one data type to another for
example from sting to an integer and
there are different types of conversions
and let's go through some of them first
of all let's consider the conversion of
something to an integer and more
specifically let's consider the example
where we convert a string to an integer
so let's consider my example string to
be some something called 145 and I'm
sewing this within a string for a reason
because I want to convert a string to an
so as you can see I have stored this 145
within my uh within a variable X and if
I were to confirm that is actually an
integer I can use the type function and
see that it is actually an integer St
Str now let's convert this into an
integer using the int function so how
would we use it is simply passing the
int uh simp by passing the variable that
we want to convert into the int function
and as you can see this is what I've
done over here but before this I will
also store it into another variable all
right now let's see what's in y well y
gives us45 but are we sure that it's an
INT we can just check it by using the
type function and as you can see the
type gives us uh the answer int that
means that we've converted the string to
an INT interestingly we can convert
something and also specify what base we
have to treat the number as by default
when we pass something in the in
function the program or python will
treat whatever we have passed uh within
the string as something in base of
decimal but what if we were to pass
something that is well not in a decimal
we could do it like this now let's store
Y and in y let's store let's do this and
I will show you what this means X and I
will give a comma and8 what this tells
python is well I want to convert the
string in X into an integer but I want
to treat whatever is in X as a number of
Base 8 so 145 is actually 145 in the
base 8 now when we see what's in y we
get 101 which is different to 145
because well 101 is actually the decimal
equivalent of 145 in the base 8
similarly if we were to give it in the
base 2 we would just replace 8 with two
over here now next let's talk about
converting something to a float now as
we know float is just simply something
that has a decimal point so let's
convert an integer into a float how
would we do that simply by using the
float function so if I give 120 and I
pass this integer through the float
function I should get
120.0 and these two are not the same
though they may mean the same things to
us but in for python 120 is an integer
and 120.0 is a different object which is
a float and this is how we convert
something to a float now what if we
wanted to convert an integer to a string
well we can use the St Str function we
can also use the hex and the O function
if we want to convert a particular
number to a hexa decimal or an octal
string respectively let's look at all
three examples say I have a number 688
and I want to convert this into a string
I just use the Str Str function around
this so as we know just to confirm let's
see what the type of 688 is this is this
should be an INT as we can see but when
we pass when we let's say uh we convert
it into a string 688 and let's store it
into some variable let's call it a all
right now let's see what's an a it gives
us 688 in the form of a string but we
can confirm by checking the type of a it
is an Str Str so it is a string
similarly we can use hex if we wanted to
convert an integer into its hexad
decimal equivalent in the in in in as an
output of a string as you can see this
comp this sort of this sort of
complicated thing is actually telling us
that we have converted 688 in terms of
hexa decimals now how do we read this
output this zero should not be treated
as anything it's more like a an
identifier which says that the letter
after this first zero is the base of
this whole number so it's saying that XX
stands for hexadecimal so it's saying
that 2 b0 is to be treated as a
hexadecimal number and if you did basic
maths uh you would find that the decimal
equivalent of 2 B 0 is 688 similarly if
I did O if I use the O function for 688
it will give me the result something
like this so again how to read this the
first zero is to be treated as an
identifier and not part of the number
what it's saying is the letter after the
first or after this zero is the base of
the number following these two uh
following these two characters so as you
can see as you can see what's this
saying is that this whole number is an
OCT represented by this letter O and the
number itself that we are dealing with
is 1 1260 and 1 12 60 in octal system is
the equivalent of 688 in the decimal
system so this is how we've converted a
an integer in uh an integer into a hexa
decimal or a an octal string now what if
we wanted to convert two uh numeric
objects into a complex data object well
for that we can use the complex function
as you can see here if I passed complex
5 and say um say something like 3 1
let's see what this gives us as you can
see it gives us an uh a complex object
where our real part is five and our
imaginary part is 3.1 so what this does
is essentially uh you pass two numbers
the first one is the real component and
the second is the uh imaginary component
it combines to give you a complex number
as you can see here now let's look at
some other type conversions the next
type we will be talking about is
converting something to a tuple or a set
or a list so what if I wanted to convert
a string into a tuple I will use the
Tuple function and uh as you can see
over here so let's say I have a string
called random let's call it random all
right now if I want to convert this to a
tuple I will use the Tuple function as
you can see over here the output will
give me tuples where each individual
component of this duple are the
individual components or the individual
characters of my string random similarly
if I wanted to convert the string to a
list I would use the list function and
this will give me a list of the
individual characters of the word or the
the string random and I could do the
same thing with the set function to
create a set of individual characters of
uh the string random as you can see here
so yeah these were some of the basic
python uh type conversions that I have
shown you as we learn about more complex
data types and different object types in
Python we will learn different uh type
conversions and functions associated
with them in this video you will be
introduced to the concept of strings
strings are an object type in Python
used to store textual data this textual
data could be something like for example
someone's name it could be an address of
a place or it could be something like a
word or a sentence now strings in Python
are an object type that is actually a
subtype of a broader classification of
objects called sequences sequences are
objects in Python which contain
components placed one after the other
where each component is given what we
call an index a numeric Index this
numeric index identifies the component
in the sequence and its position within
the sequence now since python is a zero
index based language the first object of
any sequence is always index zero the
second is index one the third is index 2
and so on now let's move on to defining
strings how do we Define them well
strings are defined using what we call D
limiters and D limitors occur in pairs
an opening and a closing delimiter in
Python these delimiters are pairs of
single or double codes so for example if
I were to use single quotes to define a
string I could I would do it like this
this is a string as you can see this is
a string is printed over here this is
delimited using single codes similarly
if I were to define a string using
double codes it's as simple as doing
this this is
also as you can see now a valid question
arises what if I wanted to include a
single code within my string well if I
try to let's see what happens if I try
to print a statement with a single code
naturally inside it so say I'm saying
it's my birthday all right let's see
what happens if I try to print this
statement it says an invalid syntax and
this is because as I had mentioned in
Python single quotes and double quotes
are D limiters so they have a special
function in Python and we cannot simply
just use them within a string because
python will treat them specially for a
special purpose so what python will do
is it will pair this and this delimiter
a single codes and say okay this looks
like a string to me and it's not going
to understand the rest of this and and
then it'll find a random single code and
it won't find its spare and it will
basically throw us an error because of
this so one way or one workaround to
introduce single codes into a string is
simply to delimit our string itself
using the other type of DM or double
codes so if I want to include a single
code I will close my string using double
codes so if I did this instead of what I
had done earlier this is a perfectly
valid and legal of defining my string
and I could I would do the opposite if I
had to introduce say double quotes
within my string I would use single
Cotes to close it so if I were to write
a speech statement she said I am hungry
all right I have I want these two double
codes to essentially show that this is a
speech and I'm going to close the string
using single Cotes and this is a valid
way of doing it as you can see my string
has this two double codes now I had
mentioned that strings are sequences
well let's describe how are they
sequences so first of all all sequences
in Python are a um it's a essentially a
sequence of smaller objects that form
the sequence right so let's try to
understand like how do how are strings
to be treated as sequences some
sequences that we will learn later are
like lists or tuples and in all
sequences we can retrieve any particular
object or component in that sequence
using its index and how do we use
indexes in Python well we enclose a
numeric index within square brackets now
let's see what I'm trying to talk about
by this example now say I'm storing a
particular string called say random
within now my variable name here is test
and I'm storing the string random within
it all right and this is a way of
retrieving a particular uh index from
test I write the variable name and then
next to it I put the square brackets now
I'm supposed to put um a numeral within
the square brackets to uh tell python
like what particular index I'm looking
for so let's try zero now as I said
python is zero index based language so
the zero index essentially means the
first part of or the first component of
a sequence so let's see what happens
when I ask python to retrieve the first
part of uh what is stored in test it
gives me the string R in fact is just
one character R and it's a string so as
you can see it has given me the first
character of the string random which is
R so what this shows is that this string
random is essentially a collection or a
sequence of one character strings so
this is so Random is essentially a
collection of the string R the string a
the string n and so on together combined
to form the whole string that we call
random similarly if I wanted the
character at the third position of this
thing I would use well since the third
position and since we're working in
Python I would use the index 2 and it
should give me the letter n as you can
see it's given me the letter N so this
is how we can show that uh strings are
also sequences in Python well now let's
move on to um certain string operations
and functions that we can perform well
as you have seen already that we can
retrieve any particular character within
a uh within a string using numeric
indexes well what if we wanted to know
what index is a particular character at
and we can do it like this we use the
index function so let's say my test and
I want to know where or what position
the character D is in my string random
so this is how I would use the index
function index and within the index say
I'm looking for the character D and now
I it should give me the answer 0 1 2 it
should give me the answer three so if I
execute this it gives me the index 3 so
this is uh the index function that we
can use for our strings now what if we
want to um say slice a string into a
into its uh into a smaller part we want
to slice it and we want to retrieve only
that particular sice well here is an
example say I'm going to I'm going to
use the same string called random and
it's stored in test right so let's so
one way of uh so the way of doing this
is like this now let's see what this
let's just see what this does first as
you can see it's given me a and d and if
I went to my string random A and D is
this particular slice now let's try to
understand what I have done by entering
one colon 4 well what this has done is
it's retrieved a slice from the first
position uh the first index which is the
character a up until the fourth position
which is the character o but it has not
included o so it's very important when I
index like this every every time I put
something to the right of this colon I
not including this itself all right so
it's essentially one when I say uh one
colon for what I'm telling python is
give me the first the second and the
third character but not the fourth one
so it's given me a n and d and it's
that's this is how we do a slicing
operation in Python similarly if I were
to say slice from the first if I wanted
only the first and the second character
I would do this is what I would do if I
wanted the first and the second
character I would do one 2 three so this
way it says python that I want the first
I want the second but not the third of
so as you can see I get a and N now so
this is a basic slicing what if I wanted
the portion of a string from a
particular Point all the way to the
right or all the way to the left well
let's consider the example of where I
want the portion of the string random
from the say for character until the
left well the way I would do this is
test now since I want it all the way to
the left I don't enter any index to the
left of my colon sign and since I want
everything to the left of the fourth
character I enter four here so as you
can see it gives me A R A and D which is
everything from the fourth character of
my string random to the left similarly
if I wanted something to the right of it
I would just do it like this I would
enter some index here and I would leave
the portion to the right of the colon
blank so this will give me everything
including the third character since this
is how we treat the uh indexing in
Python everything including the third
character all the way to the right so
this is Doom as you can see now another
perfectly valid um slicing is say I want
to slice or take out uh different
characters from the string but I want to
skip certain characters like I want this
one then I want to skip one and I want
to take the next one and then I want to
skip one well in that case we have to
introduce a step so one way of doing
this is now how do we read this so as
you can see I've have written 0 colon 6
colon 2 so what this is telling python
is I want every character from my string
test uh starting from the zeroth
character up until the sixth but not
including the sixth after skipping or
taking two at a time taking two at a
time can also be assumed as uh skipping
one at each step or skipping one
character at each step so what this will
do is it will go to random it will take
the zeroth one it'll take R and then it
will skip the next one so it will not
consider a and then it will pick n and
then it will not consider D and then it
will consider o up until the sixth
character whichever that may whichever
that may be and if you see the output it
gives us r n o which is exactly what we
wanted we wanted R we wanted n we wanted
o where we skipped uh A and D or we
skipped the every second character
essentially so this is a way of um
slicing strings while also skipping
certain characters or skipping
characters in steps now python is also
an uh there's another interesting
technique that we can use in Python to
uh where we can start retrieving
characters from the rightmost side of a
sequence or a string we can use negative
indexes so if I were to for example show
you let's see what this what this gives
me test what what is a minus one index
it gives me the character M now remember
a string Is Random so minus1 gave us the
last character of the string uh random
which was m so this is a way of using
negative indexes and similarly if I used
test Min -2 it would give me the second
last character which should be the
character o as you can see here now
there are some other important functions
that uh you may use in Python for that
let's create another let's create
another string let call it upper lower
all right now I'm storing it again in
the same variable test let's see what
happens when I use the upper function
and what happens when I use the lower
function now I'm going to use the lower
function for this so these two functions
will respectively give or give us the
result or give us our string in upper
case and lower case respectively so as
you can see the upper function created
the first string in full uppercase and
the second one created this this string
in full lower case now another important
and probably one of the most important
methods that we use for Strings
especially when it comes to data science
is the split function so let's see what
I mean by the split function let me
create another string let's call it
hello world all right and I'm going to
use a split function and I'm going to
see what happens when I use this
function essentially so what I'm doing
in these in this these three lines is
I'm creating this string hello world I
am storing it in test and then I am
using the split function on the test and
whatever result I get I'm storing
another variable called slice and then
I'm just going to show you what is in
sliced as you can see what's happened to
the string hello world is that I have
broken it into its components or its
component words if that makes any sense
into hello and world and I've stored
both of these into what we call a list
now you might ask well how does python
know that it has to separate at a blank
space well the split function by default
will uh break up a string at its blank
spaces but if we wanted we could break
it up using or at every comma so for
example if I wrote hello world using
comma and if I put a comma inside over
here and now if I try to execute this
like for example I'm going to find I'm
going to look for commas in the string
and then I'm going to try to split it as
you can see there's no splitting
happening I have one list with my
original string itself because it's not
found a comma what if I introduced a
comma over here now let's see what
happens as you can see the splitting has
happened it's found this comma and it's
caused a split between hello and World
similarly if I in my string if I put a
comma again and I put something else it
should give me the split over there
again so we can Define our split using
some whatever we put in between these uh
Circle brackets after the split function
it's just important to note that by
default if in case we do not enter
anything over here it will use blank
spaces to do the splitting uh another
very important operation and very common
operation in strings is what we call
concatenation so if I have two strings
first and say another string second and
I want to join these together well the
operator I would use to do this is
called the plus symbol this is the
concatenating operator when it comes to
Strings so what is the result of this
let's see let's print this out let's
print this whole thing and let's see
what is the result as you can see what
uh this has done is it has combined the
F string first and the string second
into one string called first second so
this is the concatenate concatenation
operator now finally uh the last Topic
in this lesson is the topic of Escape
sequences now Escape sequences are
special commands that tell python to
either suppress special meaning
of some character or symbol in a string
or give or give the special or give some
special meaning to an otherwise ordinary
character um in a string so let's look
at the first example now remember my in
my for earlier in this video where I was
I was telling you like uh what what is
the way of writing or how do we
introduce single quotes or double quotes
into a string and I had told you the
trick if I want to use a single quote in
my string uh I just close it using
double quotes or if I want to use a
double quote I CL it using single well
another way of doing this is using what
we call an escape sequence and an escape
sequence in Python is the backs slash
character all right so let's see what
happens when I use the back slash
character where I want to introduce my
single code so if I use my previous
example where I wanted to introduce a
single quote and say uh I'm going to
close it using single quotes say uh as
well so I'm going to go back to my error
example so as to speak now this would
throw me an error error right as you can
see it has thrown me an error so what if
I used the escape sequence that I
mentioned the escape sequence is just
back slash character now this is the
point of the string where I want my my
single code so I introduce a back slash
now I have my single code and I continue
writing the rest of my statement let's
close the string now will this work as
you can see this has worked so what this
has done is this backs slash character
has told python um to not treade this uh
special character or this the single
code to not treat it specially and let
it be as a part of the string so as you
can see that's what's happened here now
the next case or the other uh use case
of Escape sequences is when we want to
give a particular character that is
otherwise just ordinary some special
meaning so um let's take the example of
the character T and the character n we
use the character T to introduce tab
space um and we use the character n to
introduce what we call line bre well
let's see by an example so normally the
character T has no special function so
the character T within a string will
just uh be outputed as the character T
itself however as you can see here I'm
going to introduce a backs slash before
this character T let's see what it does
it introduces this thing that we call a
tab space which is a larger than normal
space similarly if I were to use the uh
back sln combination
this would introduce what we call a line
briak and if you were to see the output
of this you can see at the point of the
string where I have this combination of
back sln a line break has occurred so uh
there are plenty of other Escape
sequences that you may choose to learn
and uh these are just two of the
probably the most common ones that are
used in this video I will give you an
introduction into lists and tuples
starting off with lists lists are a
collection of ordered orbit arbitrary
objects that are similar to what we call
an array in other programming languages
but lists are way more flexible when it
comes to python python lists are a type
of sequence and we might have you might
have seen what a sequence is when we
were learning about strings and much
like in sequences or any other sequence
list objects are assigned a numerical
index and whenever we want to manipulate
an object in a list we use its
respective index how do we Define lists
lists are defined using square brackets
so this is a simple way or a simple list
that I have just created and assigned to
a variable a which contains three
objects 1 2 and three let's talk about
some of the features of python lists
python lists are ordered and what this
means is that even if two lists contain
the exact same elements if they if the
elements are placed in a different order
the two lists are actually unique and
different and I can check that over here
I have created a list 1 2 and three and
say if I create another list two and one
and three the same elements but in
different order I will use the is
function to check whether these two
lists are the same and if they are the
same when I use is function it should
give me the value or the answer true and
if they're not the same it should give
me the value false and as you can see I
get the value false because even though
I have two lists with the same elements
they are in different orders and so they
are different and that's what we mean by
lists are order Ed the next property for
lists are that they can be manipulated
using their indexes or the elements and
the objects inside a list can be
manipulated using the indexes and we
will see that in the section where I
show you list operations the next
property is lists are mutable what this
means is that once we create a list
object we can actually make changes and
modify them without having to create a
new list object the next property is
that list are Dynam dnamic and what this
means is that as we are making or as we
are programming we can actually make
changes to an already created list as we
are programming without having to go
through a compilation stage so if we had
to say increase the or we had to add
certain elements to an already created
list that original list grows in size to
accommodate for these new elements the
next property is that list can uh
contain any arbitrary objects so if I
created a list right now where say if I
want to store some numbers say some
floating Point numbers now and I can put
strings as well into my list all of
these are valid uh when it comes to
objects that can be put inside our list
we have no such restrictions so we can
put any arbitrary objects inside our our
list the final property that I want to
talk about is that lists are uh they can
be nested to any arbitrary depth what
this means is is that I can put a list
within a list and I can keep nesting it
essentially by putting as many lists I
want within my list and I'm only
essentially restricted by my systems
memory so if I created a list like this
and within this say I put another list
and within this list I put another list
I can keep going on to by keep going on
doing this and I'm only restricted by
the memory of my system that I'm using
so moving on let's move on and talk
about some important list operations
that we will be doing when it comes to
lists so let's create a basic list
called a where I'm storing six numbers
so now say if I wanted to retrieve a
particular element say if I wanted to
find out what's on the index 3 this is
how I would do it if I wanted a slice of
my original list and much like strings I
do it the same way so what this does is
it tells python that I want all the
elements of list a from index one to
index 4 but not including index 4 so it
will give me 1 two and three index uh
objects so it should give me 2 3 and
four in this case as you can see here 2
3 and four I can do the same thing by
considering elements say two at a time
if I wanted to consider elements or
consider every second element what I
would do is this syntax I would use this
syntax and when I give this command to
python what it tells what it understands
is I want every element from a from
index one to index 4 but not including
index 4 but I am going to consider to uh
every second uh uh element essentially
so what it will do is it will go here
and then it will skip one and then go
here and then Skip One and that's
essentially what we uh what it's
essentially what we
call slicing by using strides so I'm
taking strides I'm not considering
elements consecutively but I'm skipping
certain elements in between if I wanted
to consider every third element I would
change this to three and fourth element
I would change this to four all right so
let's see what happens when I take every
second element it should give it should
give me uh it will consider say from one
to index 3 right so it should consider
essentially this section but since it's
going to skip one it's going to consider
this skip this and then consider this it
should give me 2 and four as you can see
it has given me 2 and four and like in
other uh sequences we can use negative
indexes as well negative indexing
essentially starts looking from the
right hand side of the list so when I
say A minus one it's essentially looking
at the last element of the list so it
gives me the sixth uh or the last
element which is the which is the object
six if I did a minus 2 it gives me the
second last element similarly another
neat trick that we can use for sequences
is the following syntax double colon and
we give a minus one what this tells the
what this tells the system is I want the
list a but with all the elements
reversed so as you can see I get my
element uh my list a but the elements
have been reversed right now let's move
on to uh concatenation and replication
well concatenation much like in strings
is done by using the plus sign so as we
know on either side of the plus sign
should be two similar objects so if I'm
doing a plus something a being a list on
the other side it should be a list as
well so let's add a list like this now
now let's see what's in a as you can see
my original list has uh 789 added to it
and I can also add things to the
beginning of a list similarly so if I
wanted to add say zero you know at the
beginning of a list I just do it like
this and I get the element zero added to
it it's very important to note that I I
I actually added zero within a list
because if I did zero like this it will
throw me an error because like this zero
is just an INT object and it's not a
list but when I put the square brackets
I make it a list and then this
concatenation becomes valid because a is
also a list similarly if I did a star
two this is essentially replication or a
replication function where I'm repeating
the values in a twice if I did a star
three it's the same function uh but now
I'll have the elements repeated Thrice
as you can see here let's move on to
modifying list values uh this also shows
the mutable property of list that I had
mentioned earlier so let's consider this
example so I created a list with
elements where there's three strings
eggs apples and carrots and I have uh
five int objects 1 2 3 4 and five now if
I wanted to change say the first element
all I have to do is take the zero withth
index and say if I want to replace eggs
with say mango this is how I would do it
now I replaced eggs with mango if I
check what's in B you can see the eggs
have been replaced with the element
mango similarly I can use the slice
syntax to replace uh a particular slice
from my list with uh a slice essentially
so let's look at this um I'm replacing I
want to replace the first three elements
I want to replace mango I want to
replace apple and carrot so what I will
do is I will consider this since this
garot is the second index so so I will
consider 0 to three because the third is
not counted now I'm going to replace
this with three different um let's see
kyv and say sponge now let's check
what's in B you can see my three
elements have been replaced in fact I
don't have to replace like for like if I
want to replace say three elements with
only one or two elements that is also
possible so now if I want to replace the
first three elements kiwi orange and
sponge with um just one element this is
how I'll do it let's say wine now let's
check what's here as you can see three
elements have been replaced with one
wine I can do it vice versa as well I
can replace smaller number of elements
with a larger number of elements but
here there is a slight caveat that I
want to show you so an obvious way of
doing this would be say if I wanted to
replace the first element wine with
three different elements an obvious way
would be just consider the that elements
index and then put whatever objects you
want say I want to instead of wine I
want to add beer I want to add ball and
say Club yeah well let's see what
happens now if I say B check what's
inside my you can see my elements have
been added but they seem to have been
added as is you know uh I had entered a
list over here and that whole list has
been replaced uh or this Vine has been
replaced by this whole list in the first
position position but that's not exactly
what I wanted I wanted the elements
within this list to be individually
placed into my list and the way to do
that is not this syntax but actually
what I'm going to show you now if I want
to replace one if I want to replace the
index of the object at index zero I
would give this statement a slice
statement where I will give 0 colon 1 so
when I do this and if I um so let's
create my old scenario again where I
have wine and I had 1 2 3 4 and 5 now if
I do this
b0 but I give a slice then this slice is
essentially a single object slice it's
essentially the zeroth index again but
because of this uh formatting or this
this type of syntax that I'm using what
python will do is now when I say beer
and ball and club now what python will
do is it will not consider this whole
list and add it to in place of uh wine
or whatever I want to replace it will
actually consider the elements inside of
this individually and then replace so if
you see here now if you see my list I
actually have the uh I've removed wine
and in place of it I've put beer ball in
club but these three are actually
individual objects within my list and
not objects within a list that is then
placed within my original list so this
is an important caveat that uh you
should should take note of so moving on
let's talk about certain methods
Associated to lists let's take a simple
list now 1 2 and three the first
operation that I want to show you or the
first method is the append method so
when I do a append and say if I want to
append the list by one object called
four I just do it like this now let's
see what's an a I put so as you can see
the append has put the object 4 into my
original list now say if I wanted to
append three different objects I want to
pend 5 6 and 7 now let's see what a pend
function does oh no as you can see it's
done a similar operation to what we have
seen earlier when we gave a single index
or the single element replacement uh
that we saw earlier it essentially put
this whole list into this particular
spot into the list and this is not what
I wanted I wanted 5 six and 7 to be
individually placed and we do have a way
of doing that and the way to do that is
the extend function that is what I'll
show you next now if I want to extend
Say the original list by three different
elements 8 9 10 when I use the extend
function it will not put this whole
thing it will consider each object
inside this thing individually and then
add it to a so if you see my result this
is exactly what I wanted now the next
method that I want to discuss is the
remove method so the remove method is uh
what you how you use use it is within
the parenthesis you put the object that
is present in the list that you want to
remove so you don't give an index over
here you give the object itself so if I
want the object 8 all right this number
if I want eight itself removed what I
will do is put the value eight here and
it will remove it from my list so if I
check my list a as you can see the value
eight has uh it's gone our next another
similar function to remove is the pop
function now the pop function by default
will remove the rightmost value from the
list but unlike remove the pop function
actually outputs a value uh and that
value is what we have popped out of the
list so by default it will pop out the
right route rightmost value of a list or
rightmost element of a list and in this
case that element is 10 so it should
give me 10 but of course if we want to
pop out any particular object in this
case we do not give that particular
object we give its index so now say if I
want to remove this uh this list object
from my bigger list um as I can see it's
in index 0 1 2 3 fourth it's the fourth
index so if I want to remove the list
which is at the fourth index I give the
index value inside the parenthesis and
it pops that out for me as you can see
over here so this was it for list let's
move on to tupal next so tupal are
another ordered collection of objects
much like lists but they differ from
lists in two Key Properties first of all
tuples are defined using parenthesis
instead of square brackets so this is
how I would Define a tuple with elements
1 2 and 3 and the next very important
property that is different or that uh
differentiates tuples from lists is that
tuples are immutable and what this means
is that once we create an object of type
Tuple we cannot make any modifications
to it we would have to only create a new
object if we wanted something different
and and this is obviously a key
difference between a tuple and a list
but apart from this uh every operation
that we have done on lists are actually
possible to do in the case of tuples as
well so any operation that we did to
lists that did not modify the list or
that does not do any modification we can
actually apply to tuples as well so if I
wanted the first element of this duple
all I have to do is call it by the index
zero it should give me the value one as
you can see if I wanted a slice I can do
that as well it should give me two and
three and if I wanted to reverse my
Tuple well I can use my same neat
technique that I've used for list and
that I can use for sequence I mean
strings as well so it gives me my old
Tuple but with the elements reversed so
now the natural question is why do we
use tuples over list well one important
difference is that when we when we make
a program execution where or where we
are manipulating a t if we did the same
thing for the exact same objects in uh
that if if it were present in a list uh
it would be much faster than a tuple
essentially program execution is just
faster on tuples when compared to an
identical list so you use tuples over
list when we want to be efficient while
we are creating an ordered list of
objects so whenever we create an ordered
list of objects that we don't need to or
we don't want to make any further
modifications to we don't need to create
a list we create a tuple and another
very important area where we use tuples
over list or why we need a tuple instead
of a list is uh when we are using
dictionaries dictionaries as we will see
later is a data type in Python that
needs an immutable component uh while we
are creating the dictionary so if we
want to use uh something that is like a
list but since lists are mutable we can
use a tuple instead and use that when we
are creating our dictionary and we will
see like what uh what I mean by uh the
the immutable component for a dictionary
when we actually uh learn about
dictionaries but yeah these are some of
the places where we would use a t over
list uh a brief section on Tuple
unpacking unpacking is what I would be
doing right now and what that means is
that when I create when I give this sort
of a statement you can assume this to be
me packing this Tuple into a object or a
variable T now what's very interesting
is and this is something that's very key
to tups is that I can unpack a tuple
onto another Tuple so let me show you
what I mean by that so now that I have
packed 1 2 3 and four Tuple into T let's
unpack it into another Tuple let's call
this let's uh put these elements into
this Tuple and I put this into T all
right now let's see what I mean by
unpacking something onto something let's
see what's the what what what happens
when I put a if I just want to see
what's in a it actually gives me the
value one if I see what's in B gives me
the value two if I see what's in three
giv me value three and D gives me value
four so essentially if you think of it
what I have done is I have matched this
duple then put it into T and then put
that Tuple T into this Tuple a b and c d
so what it's what what has happened
essent is the element a has been um or
uh better way to say this would be the
element one has been packed onto or
unpacked onto a two has been unpacked
onto B three has been unpacked onto C
four has been unpacked onto D to show
you what I've done in a single line is
essentially this this is essentially
what I've done I have assigned 1 to a 2
to B 3 to C 4 to D I have matched these
two tupes to together like this and this
is a very neat feature of uh tuples the
only only uh important thing that you
have to keep in mind is the elements on
this Tuple and the elements on this
Tuple uh should be equal so if there are
four elements here there should be four
elements here all right in fact another
very important thing about or a neat
feature is that we don't really need to
mention the parenthesis when we're doing
this uh unpacking or packing so if I did
X comma y comma Z if I did it like this
if I put say five and 6 and 7 this is
also a valid way of packing and
unpacking so now if I see what's the
value in X it is actually five if I see
what's the value in y it is six if I see
what is the value of x and z it should
give me a tuple containing five and
seven as you can see over here so this
is a neat feature of duples called
packing and unpacking in this video we
will cover Concepts surrounding
dictionaries dictionaries are another
type of composite data type in python
that are also a collection of objects
much like tuples and lists and like list
they are also mutable Dynamic and can be
nested however a key difference and
property of dictionaries is that they
are unordered items in dictionaries are
paired using keys unlike in listen
tuples where the objects are assigned
numerical indexes to define a dictionary
we use curly braces each key value pair
in this dictionary in a dictionary is
separated using commas and and the key
and values themselves in a pair are
separated using a colon let's look at an
example this is a dictionary where I
have three key value pairs as you can
see they have been separated by colons
and each pair themselves are separated
by commas and these are enclosed in
curly braces to define the whole
dictionary in this uh example these are
the keys banana apple and grape and
their respective values are yellow red
and green so this is very important that
in this particular uh data type we have
what we call a key and that key is
assigned a value and we can have
multiple such pairings and we have three
such pairs in this particular example
another example or the or another type
of way to define a dictionary is using
the dict function this is how we use it
as you can see I have inputed two value
or two object tuples this is a tuple
this is a tuple and this is a tuple and
when I use it in a dict function uh when
I place it within a list what python
will do is it will consider the first
element of each Tuple as a key and the
second element of each Tuple as its
respective value now if I check what's
in D as you can see the key banana has a
value yellow the key apple has a value
red the key grape has a value green this
is another way of defining dictionaries
an important
note over here is that the the objects
that we use for Keys have to be of an
immutable data type so we cannot use for
example lists uh as an example of keys
but we can use say integers or strings
for our dictionary Keys also Keys have
to be unique when it comes to a
dictionary you cannot have two different
keys with uh or should I say the same
key having two different values you can
have only one key and that one key will
have a unique value assigned to it
duplicate keys are not allowed however
when we speak about values we have no
such restrictions you can have a mutable
or an immutable data type as a value in
a dictionary and you can have duplicates
as well so if I created a dictionary
with a key say banana and if I gave if I
associated with it a value green I
cannot create another key banana and
Associate a value yellow let's see what
happens when I actually do this if you
actually see what has happened here is
python has considered the second case so
it's it first looks at the first pair
and goes okay so my dictionary has a key
banana with a value green but right
after it it sees another key banana with
the value yellow so it overwrites my
first key banana with the second key and
it overrides the first value green with
the the second value and we essentially
get one key banana with the second value
yellow so obviously this is a python
does this to avoid duplica however if I
created a dictionary with a key banana
again if I created I give it a value
yellow or say green and if I created
another key and if I gave this also a
value green this is perfectly fine and
this will not nothing special will
happen in this case because values do
not have to follow such rules let's
speak or let's see certain dictionary
oper operations and functions now so
let's uh bring back our original
dictionary which we had created earlier
with the three pairs all right so what
if I wanted to we can use keys to uh
essentially do these operations and
functions let's see what happens when we
so much like how we use sequence how we
use indexes in example of sequence is we
use Keys when it comes to dictionary so
let's see what happens when we use a key
over here so we as we know banana is a
key in this dictionary let's see what
happens when we do when we give this
command it actually gives the value
associated with that key which is yellow
what if we wanted to change a particular
value Associated to a particular key I
would give I would do this I would give
the key and assign it uh the value that
I want to change it with all right now
now if I check my dictionary you can see
the key banana no more has yellow value
but the value gold what if I wanted to
add a new pair you know a new key with a
new value completely I would do it
pretty much the same same way as I did
in the previous step I would um
essentially write my new key whatever I
wanted say if I wanted a new key called
watermelon I would assign it a value red
and now if I check my dictionary at the
end of the dictionary you will see that
my uh new key pair key value pair has
been added watermelon red as you can see
over here now what if I wanted to remove
if I wanted to remove a key value pair
from my dictionary I can use the delete
function which is uh called by using
this the de function now how do I do it
say if I want to remove the key value
apple and red so all I have to do is do
d d and within Square brackets I have to
only mention the key I don't even need
to mention the value just the key so you
can probably draw parallels in how we
use indexes when it comes to lists and
tuples and even strings and how we use
Keys when it comes to dictionaries they
are quite similar so if I did this and
if I um oops I think red is actually not
a key as you can see red is a value my
key is Apple actually it's not red it's
apple as you can see now if I see my
dictionary
the key apple and its value red has been
removed so these are some of the
operations that we can do for
dictionaries using keys what if we
wanted to use certain inbuilt functions
that are associated with dictionaries
well some of the examples are as follows
there is a get function when we use a
get function all we have to do is uh
enter a key inside the parenthesis and
it will get the value associated with
that key so if I gave the key great
let's see what value is associated with
it as you can see it's green uh there is
also a function called items that
Returns the key and value pairs in our
dictionary as a list of two object
tuples where the first object is the uh
key and the second object is the Tuple
so let's see what it does as you can see
it gave me a uh list and in this list
the uh objects in ins the list are two
object tups where the first object is
always the key and the second is the
value and it's the same for each of the
tupal so this is what items function
does let's see what uh the next so the
next function is Keys let's see what the
keys function does as you can see it
returns a list of all the unique Keys
within our list I mean within our
dictionary similarly we can there is a
function for values as well and as you
can see it returns all of the different
values that are present in our
dictionary in the form of a list also
it's important to note that if we have a
particular value that has occurred
multiple times in a dictionary it will
appear as many times it has occurred in
the dictionary or appeared in the
dictionary in our list over here when we
use the value function so if say a
particular value say I had another key
where its value was green again so I
would have the value green appear in
this list once more essentially our next
function is pop item what this does is
much like the pop function in list it
gives us the last entered um key value
pair that is present in our uh
dictionary so the last entered pair was
watermelon uh key watermelon with the
value red and that's what has uh popped
out when we give this for function
another important function associated
with dictionaries is the update function
and the update function is a very neat
function that is used to merge two
dictionaries together so say if I had a
dictionary let's say I'm creating a
dictionary using the dict function where
I have say some key called kyv so as I
had mentioned I will use two object
tuples in this case and um let's say I
give this also a value green all right
and another pair would be say mango and
let's give it a value yellow all right
so this is another dictionary that we
have created as you can see over here we
have created a dictionary with a key
called kyv with value green and another
key mango with a value yellow and I
already have a dictionary D with uh
these values all right now if I want to
merge these two dictionaries I can use
the update function what I do is say if
I want to merge D with X or x with d
only the ordering will change and that
doesn't really matter when it comes to
dictionaries so if I want to merge D
with X I use D update and then inside it
I put my target dictionary now when I
check what's in D I have the the the
dictionary X and its key value pairs uh
merged inside my original Dictionary d
as you can see I have my original ones
here and I have the merged ones over
here so this was the update function in
this uh brief video I will explain what
we call the type hierarchy or the
standard type hierarchy in Python it
it's also known as the data model in
Python and it probably has other names
so essentially in the what we do or what
we speak about in this is uh how the
different types that we use in Python
are categorized and classified and what
are their subtypes so it's important to
note before we continue further that
there in future versions of python there
might be new types that are introduced
or the existing ones may be modified but
it's safe to say that what I will speak
about in this video will still form the
core of what we call python standard
type hierarchy so let's begin so the
first type is the non type uh it's
accessed through the built-in name nun
its truth value is false it's
essentially used to denote um functions
or it's it's returned as the value for
functions that don't really return
anything so if you have an expression or
a function that returns no particular
value you actually get a data type
called none that is how python uh
interprets it uh then there is the
ellipses uh ellipses is something that
you might encounter later uh it is
accessed through the built-in name
ellipses um it is used to indicate the
presence of this particular um syntax
this particular symbol or expression uh
or syntax in a slice its truth value is
true again don't worry too much about
ellipses right now next is numbers and
numbers is something that we are very
familiar with we have seen we've worked
with numbers a lot they are an immutable
type they created through numeric
literals and they are the outputs of
arithmetic expressions and built-in
arithmetic functions its subtypes are
integers floating Point numbers and
complex numbers um within integers you
have plain integers that represent
numbers in the range uh this number and
and this number so this this number is
basically the largest positive value
that you can represent using 32 bit
notation in two's complement and this is
the equivalent for the the negative the
negative side long integers on the other
hand are used to represent numbers in an
unlimited range that is only subject to
the available memory of your system so
these are two types of integers and as
we know floating Point numbers represent
Machine level double Precision floating
Point numbers or numbers with a decimal
point and a component after that complex
numbers are numbers that contain a
floating Point number that represents a
real part and a floating Point number
that represents a an imaginary part so
these are the types of numbers then we
have sequences sequences are finite
ordered sets indexed uh by natural
numbers so each element in a sequence
has an index and that index is a natural
number the different types of sequences
are based on the mutability whether the
objects can be changed or not is
essentially what we mean by mutability
right once we create an object whether
we can modify it or not uh that is how
we differentiate different types of
sequences so there are mutable and there
are immutable types now the different
types of immutable ones are strings we
know what strings are there are
sequences that contain characters
Unicode is the other immutable sequence
and then there are tuples uh tuples are
collection of arbitrary python objects
and unicodes are sequences that contain
Unicode characters then we have mutable
sequences and uh there is only one
currently there is only one built-in uh
mutable sequence in Python and that is
lists uh lists are also again collection
of arbitrary python objects finally we
have U well not finally but next we have
mappings and mappings are uh again and
um sets of uh objects but these objects
are now indexed using arbitrary index
sets you know the difference between a
mapping and a sequence you could
consider um sequences are ordered but
mappings are not ordered and uh the
indexes given to the objects in
sequences are always numbers they're
natural numbers whereas in mappings they
are not natural numbers but they are uh
certain arbitrary objects that we can
set for ourselves
again in Python there is only one
builtin standard mapping type that is
the dictionary dictionaries are they
they represent finite sets of objects
indexed by nearly arbitrary values the
only condition is that these indexes
must be of an immutable data type so
these uh so what I have mentioned until
now are probably the most common data
types that we encounter uh or that we
have encountered now so next types are
like callable types such as user defined
functions user defined methods built-in
functions built-in methods classes and
class instances so again callable types
as a whole are reference using the call
function and this is something that we
will learn when we start learning about
functions when we learn about
objectoriented programming uh and
methods and functions and such the other
type are modules so modules are uh
module objects or modules essentially
are referenced or called using the
import function again modules can be
considered as these large libraries or
larger pieces of code or applications
that we uh that contain various
different methods and functions and
objects and classes within them um again
modules are something that we will think
about a little later files are data
types that are called using the open
function so anytime we and as we will
during the course of this uh tutorial we
or during the course of this uh this
this course essentially
we will be working with a lot of files
these some of these files are text files
some of them are Comm separated files so
all of these files that we open using uh
the function open or some other certain
uh specific functions where we create
file objects out of these files these
are what we call file data types uh
finally there are internal types that
are used by python interpreter again
this is something that uh does not
concern us right now but just know that
uh The Interpreter for python uses these
uh data types for its functioning in
this video I will show you some of the
categories of operations that are
possible in Python so let's start off so
the first category of operations are
arithmetic operations and as you can see
in this table there are different types
such as addition subtraction
multiplication so let's go over them one
by one so a simple addition operation
would be like 5 + 6 giving me the value
11 I can do 5 - 3 that's subtraction
similarly I can do a multiplication
using 5 say 5 into 2 there's division
where I use the back slash so say I did
division of 8 / by 2 now you might
encounter another type of division which
is called the floor division where we
use a double back slash and what this
does is it returns us the largest whole
number that is lesser than the result of
our division uh so the division
difference between the float Division
and the normal floor and uh the floor
division or the single and the back
double backlash is this say I did 9 / by
two using a single backslash it should
give me as you can see 4.5 right so this
is the actual value now let's see what
happens when I do 9 double back slash2
it will give me four which is the
largest number lesser than or equal to
4.5 that is also a whole number so this
is uh what we call Floor division
essentially finally we also have uh if
we want to raise something to the power
or something so if I want to do five say
6 ra to the power three so I would use
double asteris and this is how I would
do it it give me 216 as you can see uh
if I wanted remainder between the
division between two different numbers I
will use the percentage sign so if I
wanted the remainder of the division
between 7 and three this is how I would
do it I get the answer one as you can
see so next category of operations are
logical operations the first one is the
logical and operation where we use the
operator and all right so let's see uh
what we mean by this I am creating so as
we know the and operation Returns the
value true if both the operant are true
so let's actually let's actually do this
for an example let's give this variable
the value true and this the value false
it should be done like this true false
so now uh think of it like one and zero
so one and zero is obviously zero right
so if I did A and B I should get the
answer false or zero because I'm doing
true and false so it's like doing one
and zero so if you see this I should get
the answer false if I change this to
true as well now if I do this I will get
the answer true as you can see uh the
next logical operation is the or
operation where well um logical or is if
either of the operant are true then we
should get the uh answer to our R
operation as true as well so in this
case obviously if I did R over here it
will naturally give us true if I change
this to false it should again give us
true and it will only give us false if
both are false as you can see here now
it's false the next operation is The
Logical not uh it's done by using the
not operator so in this case the value
that we get uh is true if the operate is
is false so let's take a as we know a is
false over here so if I did not a I
should get the answer true but if I
change this to true now if I do not a I
should get false as you can see so this
was the uh logical operations let's move
on to the next set of operations that is
comparision operations so there are a
bunch of them let's go over them one by
one if I want to check if two operants
are equal so if I did X is say equal to
2 and now Y is equal to 3 if I want to
check if they are equal I will use the
double equals to sign and if um they are
equal I will get the value true if they
aren't it'll I'll get value false as you
can see since X is 2 and Y is 3 as you
can see X and Y are not the same so
there's false they are not equal if I
change this also to two now I will get
the answer to another the next uh
comparison is the uh not equal to or
where we use the exclamation sign so
over here this is this um the result of
this is true If X and Y are not actually
the same so I should get false over here
as you can see but if I change this to
say five now I will get true because X
is not equal to Y in this case the next
one is greater than so if I did X
greater than y as we can see 2 is not
greater than 5 I will get false over
here similarly there's a lesser than if
I did X lesser than y I should get true
over here as you can see there's also a
greater than or equal to and lesser than
or equal to we simply add the equal to
sign here so let's see now if I say x is
lesser than or equal to 3 I should get
true because X is two i and if I put two
here I should also get true but what if
I put one here since X is equal to 2 and
2 is not lesser than equal to 1 this is
a false statement and I can do the same
thing with like this using the greater
than equal to now it's true because 2 is
actually greater than equal to 1 and so
this was comparision operations the next
set of operations that we can do in
Python are assignment operations we've
already seen a whole bunch we've already
been assigning values to variables we've
been doing assignments throughout
already but let's go over them and see
some of the assignment operations so as
we already know the equal to operation
is uh assigning everything that is on
the or the value on the right hand side
of the equal to sign to what is on the
left so if I did a is equal to 5 + 6 it
will assign the value 5 + 6 or 11 to a
let's check what's in a as you can see
it is 11 there is a plus equal to sign
and what this does is so for example if
I did uh say a now since a is 11 let's
create another variable called B and
call this five all right so now if I did
A+ equal to B what this will do is it
will add B to a and then store it in a
so let's see what this does once I do
this now let's check what's in a it
should be 5 + 11 as you can see 16 so
this a plus so this plus equal to sign
is essentially the same as doing a is
equal to a + b it's essentially the same
thing they're both the same uh there's a
similar thing for this the negative Sy
or subtraction as well minus equal to so
now that a is 16 and B is still five of
course if I did minus equal to B now I'm
subtracting the value five from 16 so I
should get a is equal to 11 again as you
can see here and this is the equivalent
of doing a minus B A is equal to Aus B I
mean as you can see so uh the next
similar like assignment operation let's
create a is equal to say 6 in this case
and say B is equal to I will say two
right now if I do a star star equal to B
what this does is it multiplies B to a
and then assigns it back to a so if I
see what's in a now it should be 12 as
you can see here similarly there is
similar thing for subtraction as well so
if I did a is equal to 6 and B equal to
2 if I did a sorry for division so if I
did a division symbol and the equal to
sign and then if I give B what it will
do is it will divide a by b or 6X 2 and
it will assign that back to a so my
value in a should be three as you can
see here 3.0 obviously this is a single
uh single backlash so this is a float
division the resultant of a single
backslash is always a float I can do the
same thing with a double backslash so
let's see if I did a is equal to 7 now
and then B is equal to 3 now if I did a
double back/ equal to B now it will do
the same division but uh it will do a
floor function so it should give me two
in this case if I did the same thing uh
with a single back slash just to show
you the difference between single back
slash and double back slash division in
this case it will give me um the value
around 2.3 or something a float
basically 2.33 as you can see here then
there is the modulus you can use the
modulus sign as well with this
assignment um say a is equal to say 5
now B is equal to 2 now if I do a
percentage symbol equal to 2 I mean the
it will give me it will assign the uh it
will take the modulus in both sides and
then assign it to the left hand upper
and now let's see what's in a as you can
see it it did a divided by 2 the modulus
symbol is basically the remainder of the
division between two objects so in this
case it will divide a by B and then give
me the remainder and then put that
remainder back in a and as you can see
that the remainder of 5 ID 2 is 1 and we
get that over here similarly we can also
do exponential so if I have a is equal
to say 5 b is equal to 2 and I want to
raise a by if I want to raise the value
of a by the value of B and then store
that back in a this is how I would do it
so it should be 5 to the^ 2 which is 25
as you can see here so this is
assignment operations so finally we move
on to uh two special sets of operators
one is the identity set identity
operators and the other is the
membership operators uh let's look at
the identity operators so when we talk
about identity operators what we when
what we mean is the is and the is not
operator so what the is operator does is
it checks whether two operant uh have
the same location in the memory
essentially this do does not mean that
it does not check for whether two
objects have the same value and this is
very important so let's look at this if
a is = to
1,1 and B is equal to 1, + 1 all right
if I did a is equal to this is an
equality check are they the same values
true now if I say a is B let's see what
happens as you can see it's false this
is because this object and this object
are not the same and this is what the is
operation does uh we can confirm this by
checking the ID of a the ID of a gives
us some value like this and the ID of B
gives us as you can see a different
value so the two objects are not located
in the same place in the memory as we
have seen using the ID function and that
is what we check uh through the is
operator and the is not is essentially
just the opposite of that so so that is
the identity operator now the membership
operator is used for checking whether
something is present in sequence or not
so let's create a sequence I will create
a list to show in this example my list
is 1 2 and three basically simple list
with three integer objects 1 2 and three
I will check whether now say two in a so
is two in a if it is it will give me
true as you can see is five in a it
should give me false because five is not
in a and the not in operator is just the
opposite of that it checks the other
condition essentially so this is is the
membership operators in Python in this
video we will be looking at the math
module in Python and we will look at
some of the math functions that are
associated with this module in Python so
starting off what is this math module
well uh the python math module is an
important library or a feature that is
uh designed to deal with mathematical
operations this math module is part of
the basic python installation so you
don't have to install this separately uh
to use this math module all you have to
do is import this uh module and this is
how you would do it you just do import
math and this will import your math
module for you to use in your
programming and in this in the course of
this video I will be showing you certain
um Concepts surrounding the math module
such as what are the constants that come
with the math module some of the
arithmetic functions the logarith metic
functions um Power functions and even
trigonometric function that we can do
using this math module and the function
inside the math module so starting off
let's uh look at some of the constants
that are part of this so as you can see
the standard constants that are
available uh in this module are Pi there
is T there is ul's number Nan which is a
special it's a it's a programming
specific concept and Infinity uh so
let's look at these one by one so
starting off our first constant is pi um
Pi is as you know in maths it's the
ratio of the of a circles circumference
to its diameter and Pi is an irrational
number you know the value of pi is 3.14
something since it's an irrational
number it does not we cannot uh Define
it in terms of a specific fraction but
it can be approximated to the fraction
22x 7 so how do we access this um Pi
constant is as simple as this once you
have imported maths uh the maths module
all you have to do is do math. PI and it
will give you the value as you can see
so as you can see the value return to us
is a float this is important to note and
the number of number of decimal digits
uh the number of digits after the
decimal point that we can see here are
15 and this is like a by default uh
thing for python that if you call the pi
constant it will give you the value of
pi correct up to 15 decimal points so an
example of where we can use this thing
is say we have the radius of a circle
three it can be in any units 3 m or
whatever you want um and you want to
find out its uh say circumference so as
we know the circumference of a circle is
2 pi r so if I had to find the uh
circumference of a circle in my in my
code for some application with the
radius three or all I would have to do
is use the formula 2 pi r and uh to call
the value 2 pi r instead of specifically
writing 3.14 something I can just use
this function math. pi over here and
then I can enter the r as you can see it
will return me the radius as you can see
so moving on uh the next constant that
we will talk about is T T is a similar
to Pi in fact to is the ratio of a
circle circumference to its radius Pi is
the ratio of a circle circumference to
its diameter and to is the ratio of a
circle circumference to its radius it's
so important to note this difference so
because of this definition to is always
2 * the value of pi this is by
definition and much like like Pi if you
call the tow constant in you from the
math module it will also return you a
float number and to find that this is
the function that we use or this is the
syntax so as you can see this is this is
actually 2 * the value of pi 6. 283 and
even this is returned correct up to 15
uh places to the right of the decimal
point and this is by default uh next
constant is the ul's number uh the ul's
number is a it's one of the most WI red
constants used in the world of uh in the
scientific community in the mathematical
Community um you will be using the ul's
number probably a lot as if if you move
into data science or AI or something
like that so what is the UL number it is
uh it is the base of the natural
logorithm if you know what the natural
logorithm is it is used to calculate
rates of growth or rates of Decay and as
with numbers or constants like pi and to
even the Ulus number is an irrational
number with infinite decimal places uh
the value of the Ulus number in short
it's denoted by the small letter e so
this value of e is usually approximated
to around 2.718 so how do we call this
uh constant is simply as math. e this is
how we do it so you get this value again
this is also a float and it's correct up
to 15 decimal places so the next concept
that we will be talking about is
infinity now Infinity is a it's more of
of a mathematical concept and this is
very important to note because Infinity
doesn't is not really a number there is
no number called Infinity it is it is
used to define something that is
infinitely large or infinitely small so
positive Infinity is something that uh
is higher than any known number to us
and negative Infinity is lower than any
known number to us um so this is the
concept of infinity and how do we call
this uh function well so let's see what
happens when we call the math function
math constant Infinity so this is how we
do it and as you can see it will return
us this um it might look like a string
to you but this is actually a special
type in Python um which is not a string
this is also a float it's a type of a
float in fact this uh infinity value
it's it's it's like a special data type
it's a special data type that you can
you can consider as an equivalent to a
float but um it's not it's not a typical
float that we know like you know 3.14 or
2.71 the value of math. INF will give us
um INF and this is this INF is actually
not a string so we can we can confirm
that over here as you can see when I do
a type when I check the type you see
it's actually a float in fact this was
recently added in Python 3.5 um a
special type known as
math. um it returns this INF data type
um which is the equivalent W float uh so
this is this is how we use Infinity if
you wanted to get the uh value of say
minus infinity all you would have to do
is math. INF with a minus sign preceding
this constant and you will get minus NF
now let's check if the concepts or the
properties of infinity are U maintained
you know like every a positive Infinity
is greater than any number that we know
and negative Infinity is greater than
any number that we know so let's just
confirm this um so I take mathr in and I
will do a check is this greater than say
some really large number number
something that comes off the top of my
head immediately okay so let's see if
it's if this is true then uh this is
conceptually correct and as you can see
it is true in fact I can change this
number to anything as large as I want
this will be true because Infinity is
true is larger than any number that we
know uh and similarly if I did minus
math. in INF uh and I checked some very
small number you know a very very small
negative number so just consider some
minus uh 10 to the^ something right this
should also be true uh sorry it should
be smaller symbol this should also be
true because I'm checking minus infinity
it's smaller than any known number to us
and it is true as you can see so uh it's
very uh also if you did a if you did
something like so let's say if we do uh
let's add something to this you know
it's a number so we should be able to do
arithmetic on this let's actually see
what happens when I add say 10 to
positive Infinity it actually gives us
the same value back infinity because uh
intuitively we know know that infinity
plus anything is still going to be
Infinity right and this is exactly what
python does for us even if we add a
number to this math. INF or the infinity
constant in Python it will still give us
uh the same value the same data type of
INF or Infinity similarly if we
subtracted something from the negative
of math. you know um say minus say again
let's say minus 100 so if you subtract
something from minus infinity we're
technically still minus infinity itself
so this will again give us minus and
minus INF as you can see and this is
absolutely what we need and this is a
very very interesting feature in Python
uh finally the last uh constant that we
will discuss is the n or the not a
number constant so this is not really a
mathematical concept uh there is no
constant in maths called not a number
this is a computer science related
concept that it's it's used to it's used
to denote invalid inputs or in it used
to
indicate certain places where say a
variable that should have a number um
it's been corrupted for whatever reason
and it it now has a text or a symbol and
our code throws an error then in these
in these cases where uh python expects a
number from us or from your code and it
does not get it it will throw you a n um
value and this is usually used in cases
where you have errors in your code so so
again just to check like what this this
constant like how to call it this is how
you actually do it math. n and it will
give you a data type called n also much
like the infinity constant let's see
what's the type of this um this constant
again might look like a string to you
but of course this is not a string this
is a a numerical concept and as you can
see it's still a float so this is like
um it's another special uh data type
that was created for specifically this
case where uh it's some it's the
equivalent of a float but um it's not
really the typical float that we are
that we associate with so this was uh
constants in the math module so our next
topic will be arithmetic functions that
we can do in the using the math module
so some of the common arithmetic
functions that are available to us are
factorials um the ceiling operation
floor operation uh there's permutations
there's combinations you can find the
greatest common divisor or the gcd and
the LC M or the least common multiple
and you can truncate numbers so let's
look at them one by one so starting off
with the factorial operation the
factorial operation is done using the
factorial function as you can see here
actually defined like this math.
factorial all right so now what we pass
in between the parenthesis will be uh
what we calculate the factorial for uh
as you know factorial is so factorial is
always for a positive integer and the
factorial for say a number 10 would mean
10 * 9 * 8 8 * 7 so on until the number
one obviously factorial only defined for
positive integers uh it is not defined
for negative values or it's U and it's
also not defined for decimal values so
uh let's see let's look at an example so
as we know um so let's say we pass math.
factorial for six and let's see what's
the value so this is exactly what we
expect so we expect the value of 6 * 5 *
4 * 3 * 2 uh that is actually 720 let's
see what happens when we pass zero this
should give us one since we know 0
factorial is one now let's see an error
case where we pass say minus 5 as you
can see this will throw us an error
because factorials are not defined for
negative numbers now Moving On Let's uh
so the next function that we'll talk
about is the ceiling function so the
ceiling function is defined using math.
Seal Seal as you see here so again we
pass the number that we want the ceiling
for in between the parenthesis so what
is a sering function it gives you the
largest uh sorry excuse me it gives you
the smallest number that is uh greater
than or equal to what we pass over here
so for an example if I gave you 6.6 and
I asked you okay what is a ceiling
function for 6.6 it should give you 7
because 7 is the largest inte in
integral value that is greater than 6.6
or equal to it obviously if you give the
ceiling function for an integer it will
give you the integer itself so let's
look at an example 7.8 so this should
give me the value 8 as you can see here
let's look at it now a negative number
so - 12.3 uh an integer that is greater
than
-12.3 uh is -12 the smallest integer
that is greater than -2.3 and this
should give you 12 as you can minus 12
as you can see here uh a similar
function is the floor function which is
defined like this again the Flor
function what it does it gives you the
greatest number that is smaller than
whatever value
we pass between the parenthesis so if I
gave it 2.3 it should give me the value
two um again if we pass integers it will
uh just give us the integer itself again
just to reiterate this uh ceiling and
floor functions uh they give you in in
integer values so the floor function
will give you the largest integer that
is smaller than what we pass over here
so let's look at 6.7 so the largest
integer that is smaller than 6.7 is 6
and as you can see this is our answer
over here uh the next function that we
will look at is the truncate function um
the truncate function is defined using
this truncate is very similar to what we
have seen this is how we Define the
truncate function uh it is very similar
to the ceiling and floor uh in the
truncate function what we do is um we
pass a decimal value a float number to
the in between the parenthesis and what
we get back is the number without the
decimal component so only the the
integral component so if I gave it 7.8
for example it will give me only the
seven part it will return me only the
seven part and it will chop Away the8
part um if I gave it - 12.3 uh it will
chop Away the3 part and give me only -12
back so let's look at an example 8.9 it
should give me only 8 as you can see
here say I did minus 8 uh or - 6 9 it
should give me Min - 6 so you can think
of truncate function as it does the
floor function for positive values and
does the ceiling function for negative
values because it rounds down and rounds
up respectively for positive and
negative values so now let's look at the
next set of arithmetic functions um
let's move on to permutations
permutations are defined using this as
you know so in between the parenthesis I
have to pass two values n and K so I
have to pass an n and a k the K has to
be less than or equal to n because the
permutation as you know is uh the number
of ways in which we can permute from n
objects k k different objects uh so what
this mathematically what this is is um
permutation of N and K is n factorial
divid n minus K factorial so if I pass
say 10 and 6 it will give me the
permutation of 10 and six so let's look
at what's the value as you can see it's
this very large value 50
151,00 similarly there's a combination
function and this is a combinations of
permutations are used a lot in
probability so if you're going to move
into that sphere which you will
encounter a lot in machine learning AI
you will be using these functions quite
a bit um so the combination function
again you pass an n and a k again the N
should be greater than or equal to this
K what this evaluates is n factorial / n
minus K factorial * K factorial so again
this is a mathematical concept so let's
look at the permut sorry the combination
of 10 and six so as you can see it gives
me 210 which is the combination of 10
and six in the arithmetic function
section um are gcd and LCM as we know
gcd is the greatest common divisor LCM
is least common multiple so as of the
newest version of python in 3 python 3.9
the math module gets these two new
functions that were very lately added
actually um since uh I cannot show you
that because I don't have the absolute
latest version of python on my system
but using the math. gcd function this is
the function and in between this we
would what we would do if we had the
latest version is we would pass two
numbers or as many numbers in fact and
what this function would do is find the
common divisor amongst them so if I give
these say for example if I gave these
numbers it would give me the value 10
similarly the LCM function again added
in Python 3.9 finds the common multiple
amongst what whatever we pass over here
so if I passed say 20 and 30 this will
give me uh the value of 60 which is the
LCM of 20 and 30 so again these are it's
something neat that if say you have
python 3.9 or uh if you have python 3.9
or after that uh you will have access to
these functions as well if you uh when
you import the math module so that was
for the arithmetic uh functions let's
move on to the next section which are
power and log arithmetic logarithmic
functions so let's start off with the
power function um there are two there
are
uh multiple ways you can actually do a
power function in math uh in Python so
you can do something like this which is
the equivalent of 2 ^ 3 or you can use
the inbuilt uh module math and you can
use the P or the power function which is
this is how you do it and uh if I had to
do same 2 to the^ 3 I would just pass
two and three as arguments like this and
it should give me the value as you can
see eight over here What If U so there's
actually one more function which is
simply the P function and this is uh not
part of the math module it's a function
not part of the math module but it's
still part of the base python you can
use this as well and you can do the same
thing b w 2 and 3 it should give you the
value eight again the now you might ask
what's the difference between these two
functions well it's not much for at
least in a beginner standpoint it's not
that much uh just note that the math do
uh power function is slightly
computationally faster than the simple
power function so yeah moving on the
next topic would be the next function
that we'll discuss is the exponential
function which is defined like this
again exponential function is again e to
the power something so if I did
exponential of three uh this would give
me e to the^ 3 as you can see oh of
course I did not Define the module
beforehand so math. exp now when I do
this it should it'll give me some value
which is basically ul's number or E to
the^ 3 so this was the exponential
function and let's look at uh an example
so we will look at the example of rate
of DK and we will use the uh this
function in that example so the
exponential rate of DK um uh for is used
to calculate the amount of radioactive
elements that is present in a substance
after a certain amount of time so the
the the the the expression is uh
something like the initial amount of
radioactive elements that were present
uh right at the beginning times the
exponent of - 693 * t uh t for time
divided by the time period the half life
time uh so let's just write it down to
make it simple so again as you can see
the uh so this will give me the
remaining amount of radioactive elements
right so let's uh write down remaining
let's assign this to a variable
remaining so the initial again um
initial is the initial amount of
radioactive elements so let's give it
some value say 100 um the time let's
assume it's 10 years uh and let's say
the half life um half life is around I
don't know this give some value say
three or something again this is the
details are not important so this will
uh I'm using the math. exponential
function over here as you can see and
for these values uh now when I check
what's the value of remaining after I
calculated it it's something uh so this
is it's basically what this tells me is
that I started off with 100 units of
some radioactive element um and in 10
years is this is what is left so yeah so
this is how we would use say the uh
exponential function in a particular
example of our so next next type of
again functions are logarithmic
functions so let's look at some of the
logarithmic functions that are part of
the math module so a basic log function
would be written like this math. log in
between this I would pass the number
that I want the log for by default if I
just pass one number it will it will C
calculate the log of 8 to the base of e
as we know e is the ul's number so let's
see what it does in this case gives me
some value what if I wanted to specify a
particular base well I would pass a
second argument in this case I want to
find the log of a to the base two and
this should be the value three as you
can see over here uh there are two
specific functions that are also
provided in this math module that is log
2 uh what this will do is again it will
again I have to just pass one argument
and this will automatically find the
value the log of 8 to the base 2 as you
can see here uh similarly there is a
math. log 10 function if I gave if I did
this I will find the value of uh
something here to the base 10 as you can
see so this was logarithmic functions
then you have the finally you have the
square root function so how would we use
the math uh the square root function is
math.sqrt
again we pass what we want over here uh
if we want the square root of say 49
this should give me the value 7 as you
can see finally maybe move on to the
final set of functions that we can do
using this ma math module uh they are
trigonometric functions and they are
hyperbolic functions so uh let's start
off with some of the trigonometric
functions as we know um we can do s we
can do cosine and tan some of the basic
functions um the way we would do it is
math. sign um in between this what we
this is to calculate the sign of a
particular uh angle and this angle must
be passed in radians this is very
important to note we do not pass it in
degrees but in radians so if I say pass
s of 3.14 as we know 3.14 is an
approximation of D value Pi uh sin Pi is
uh supposed to be uh in fact it's
supposed to be zero so let's see uh we
get something close to zero again since
this is an approximation it won't give
us the exact value uh similarly we can
use math dot cos to find the value of a
particular angle um if you want to find
if you want to find the value of the
sorry the cost of a particular angle uh
we can use the tan function in case uh
we wanted to find the tan similarly uh
we have the next set for arc sign and
the Arc cosiness of uh certain of angles
so to use to find the arc sign for
example we would use a do sign I mean
sorry A Sign uh for our cosine we would
use this and for AR 10 we would use this
the next set would be hyperbolic
functions again hyperbolic functions are
are basically the sign and the cosine
and the T calculated not circles but on
hyperbolas uh again the details don't
have to be you don't have to know the
details you just should uh you should
know that if you wanted to say for
example find out the uh hyperbolic sign
of an of an angle we would use math do
sin H and then we would pass what we
want in between this similarly if we
wanted to find the cosine it would be
cos H tan it would be tan H and if we
wanted to find the inverse of uh the
hyperbolic inverse what we would do is
what we would do is use a so we would
use a tan H if we wanted to find the
hyperbolic inverse uh of s we would use
a sin H and similarly for cos it would
be cos a COS H in this video we will
learn about conditional statements uh
and we will learn about uh how do we
create these control structures uh where
we have these conditional statements uh
we will learn about the keywords that we
use in Python to create a conditional
statement block the if keyword the LF
keyword and the else keyword uh we will
also learn about indentation and its
importance in Python so let's get
started so the basic uh syntax if you
will for a if statement in Python
consists of the keyword if followed by
an expression as you can see from this
uh pictorial uh it there's an if
statement there is a expression uh there
is this uh block of code which if you
can actually see is slightly indented to
the rest of the code uh and then we have
the rest of the rest of our code after
that so what we're looking at is this so
this is our if statement block um now
let's let's break this down so what is
this expression that we're speaking of
uh an expression in this context is a
Boolean expression which evaluates to a
true or false statement so when we are
speaking about the if statement we have
an expression and if this expression
evaluates to true then we ex execute
everything below the if statement
otherwise we skip that portion as you
can see if the statement is true we
execute this statement or these
statement blocks uh otherwise if it's
false we move on to the next the next
statement block or the beginning of a
new statement uh so let's look at an
example to uh further understand this
let's take this statement over here as
you can see in this if statement I have
this expression 50 greater than 30 so
what python is going to do now is it's
going to check whether 50 is greater
than 30 and it's going to check it in a
Boolean context if this is true then we
can move on to the next portion which is
this but if it is false then we will
skip this so let's see what this uh what
happens over here so since we know that
50 is indeed greater than 30 this is a
true expression we move on to this block
of code which is saying that print 50 is
indeed a larger number than 30 so let's
see if this actually gets printed so as
you can see we get this uh the result
which is this is a true statement and we
get the print statement getting executed
what if we gave a false expression over
here so let's look at uh what happens if
I gave a false expression now I'm
checking if 50 is lesser than 30 which
is a false statement so if it's a false
statement we do not move on to this
portion of our if statement block and we
we directly in fact we directly skip so
if I have to execute this you will see
nothing gets executed in fact my print
statement is just not executed because
we never entered this because our
expression over here was indeed false so
yeah this is how a basic if statement
block looks like in Python and this is
how the uh how we move on to how we
check for the TR the truth truthfulness
or the falseness of a particular
expression in the if statement so moving
on um let's move on to the topic of
indentation in um in python so as you
can see this uh this if statement is an
example of a control structure so
without moving without defining what a
control control structure is uh in
detail control structures consists of
these uh conditionals or Loops or uh
iterations if you will uh so all of
these control structures involve heavy
indentation so what does an indentation
mean well what if I gave you an example
say I gave you some variable called age
and I wrote 20 over here now if I gave
you an if statement saying if age is
greater than 10 now uh it's very
important to note that when I'm defining
an if statement I need this colon
otherwise this if statement is not
defined so this uh colon is important uh
anyways so now I'm checking this
expression if age is greater than 10 now
what is this what happens if age is
greater than 10 now what if I want
python to do something only if age is
greater than 10 well well how do I tell
python that there is a piece of code or
a section of code that I want executed
only if this condition is met well this
is where indentation comes into play so
if I want say if I want this line this
person is an adult again this is some
random line where I'm assuming age is
pertaining to this adult all right or
this person so if I have uh this
variable age where I write this number
20 which denotes the age of some some
person and I'm doing a check if age is
greater than 10 actually let's be
specific here well the adult age for
most people is 18 in most countries so
let's see if age is greater than 18 now
if I'm doing this check uh I want to
print this statement only if this person
is uh person's age is above 20 uh above
18 so how do I tell python that I only
want this statement to be uh executed
only during this if this condition is
met well this is where indentation comes
into play and as you can see exactly as
you can see uh this part this portion of
the code is slightly indented compared
to the if statement so when this
condition is met then only do we move on
to this if this condition is not met we
move on to whatever the next section of
code will be like whatever whatever uh
code that we have after this if
statement so let's see so this since
this condition is actually met as you
can see this print statement is actually
executed so this is the importance of
indentation now we will see uh in as we
move as we learn more about if
statements and lse statements and LF
statements how indentation plays a key
role in defining what we want as an
output when a certain condition is met
all right so for now it's very important
to understand that uh this is how
indentation is used in Python in other
languages we might use uh we we probably
don't use indentation in fact popular
language the C language uh does not use
indentation at all but some languages
and Python and probably the trademark
language for uh indent indentation in
programming so you might say that so
different people have different opinions
on indentation the general consensus is
that indentation helps make the code
look very presentable and very readable
and this actually is one of the facets
of Python Programming is the indentation
and the easy readability of it anyways
moving on so what if we have um multiple
conditions in our code or if in our if
statement block that we want to see so
let's create this um list or let's
actually just copy this example that I
have written over here as you can see
what I'm doing in this piece of code is
I have a list X where I have this
integer 50 I have two strings Gat and
apple now I want to check a bunch of
things so I want to check if 60 is an X
and I also want to check if the string
cat is an x uh and I want a final sort
of like if none of these conditions are
met I want something to happen so how do
we do that well we start off our state
our if statement block with the standard
if keyword all right now if we have uh
one more condition that we want met then
we can use the L if which uh is kind of
a short form for else if uh so we use
the L if keyword so it so what this
python uh what python reads is it checks
this condition then it will check this
condition and then finally we have this
else keyword and else is a keyword used
in our block to tell python that if none
of our earlier Expressions have been
true then do uh what is in the uh that
is within the else uh keyword that is
indented within the else keyword so
again we don't pass an expression for
else because else is uh only we only
Reach This l l statement in case all of
the earlier conditions have not been met
or have uh come to be false and not true
so let's look at uh this particular code
example so we have a list of 50 cat and
apple and I'm my first expression that
I'm checking is uh is 60 in X so this is
how we check actually so if 60 and X
should be read as is 60 in the list X so
is 60 in the list X well actually no we
don't have the object 60 so this part is
not executed we move on to the next
condition is the string cat in X well
actually it is uh the string cat is
indeed in X so we move on to this
statement block which is within the uh
condition that is met which is print cat
is in list X and you will see that uh
none of the other statement blocks will
be executed because we have met our
condition over here so if I execute this
as you can see that uh the print
statement cat is in list X is what is
actually executed and we do not uh
execute this obviously because it is
false and we do not even check or we do
not even move on to this statement
because well we have a condition met
over here so it's uh one thing that is
important to note note is that we can
use as many l if statements to check for
as many conditions that we we want to
check for U but it's very important that
we only use and if we are using that we
only use one L statement and only at the
end of our block okay so moving on now
I'm going to show you a very neat
example about how python actually does
its uh these these condition checkings
so it's very important to note that once
a condition is met none of the other
conditions are even checked for so uh um
we do not even consider the next
statements and we directly leave this uh
if statement block so let's look at this
example over here now in this example
that I have over here is where I've
stored the string cat in X now I have
three um I have three conditions that
I'm checking I'm checking is 50 greater
than 60 I am checking if the value of x
is indeed cat and I'm checking um some
random expression 1 divid 0 this is not
even a check this is literally just
checking if 1 divid by 0 is true or
false and as we know we cannot divide
anything by zero so let's see what
happens when I execute this statement
now typically if I wrote 1 divided by 0
python will throw me an error because
one cannot be divided by Z that is an
error error in statement so let's see
what happens when I do this actually as
you can see I have a statement being
printed but I have no error even though
I gave a wrong I gave an error statement
in 1 divid 0 well now you might ask why
is that so well it's simply because I
have actually never Reach This condition
I have not even uh python is not
bothered looking at this because if you
actually see there is a condition
previous to this uh over here which is
met and which is true so we move on to
this block we execute this block and we
forget about the rest of the code so we
don't actually get to uh this error
statement which is an interesting thing
and which is an example that I have
shown uh to to show you that once a
condition is met in an if statement
block we do not look at any of the
further conditions that are being
checked okay so finally um I have one uh
one small topic that I would like to
share with you is the conditional
expressions or the Python's tary uh
operator now this is slightly different
to the if statement that we have talked
about up until now uh in the sense that
it is not a control structure so what
this actually is is more of an operator
that defines some expression so let's
see what I'm am trying to say over here
so as you can see over here highlighted
is the uh syntax for what I'm trying to
talk about this stary operator so let's
look at this example and let's see what
I'm trying to do over here so I have
this variable age all right and this age
is 26 now X now just just read this uh
statement X is equal to adult if age is
greater than 18 L's child now I could
have done an elaborate control structure
with an if statement then an indentation
within that if statement and then um I
could have written else and then another
indentation and I would have written
another statement over there but instead
of that I have used this uh operator to
assign a particular value to the
variable X and this uh what value I'm
assigning to X depends on if this
condition is true or false so uh as you
can see the condition says is age 18 uh
greater than 18 so if this is true then
I assign this particular string if it is
false then I go to the lse statement and
I assign this so since age is 26 is
greater than 18 I should assign the
string adult to X and as you can see if
I execute this and check what is an X
you can see adult is indeed an X so this
is a very neat very knable readable and
a very um it's a it's probably a more
it's it's a better looking way uh to
perform simple else uh simple if and
else statements where you don't want to
create a whole um if St if if else
statement control structure block so
yeah this was the turn operator finally
we let's uh we we make a short note on
the P statement uh in in Python so the
pass statement or the pass keyword is a
a place where is is a placeholder of
sorts so what if I had an if statement
and I'm writing a piece of code but I
don't know what to do with this if
statement so if if a statement is
correct if a statement is true um but I
don't know what to do if the statement
was true how do I tell python well let's
just keep it a hold for now and I might
U put something into this uh block later
in the future well I would use the past
statement so if I had this uh say this
some condition again if I'm checking age
is greater than 18 but I don't know what
to do with this I would just simply use
this P statement and uh this basically
does nothing uh it it's a way to it's
it's like a way to create a placeholder
where maybe in the future I might have I
might write some sort of a say a print
statement or some sort of uh different
function or something else within this
indentation so but in the meantime like
currently I don't have anything to place
over here so I just leave it with a p
statement so this is uh a way where you
can use a p statement in um if and else
statement or uh if and else control
structures in this video we will be uh I
will introduce you to the concept of
iterations in Python and we will be
speaking in specific about the
indefinite iteration in Python otherwise
known as the while loop so let's look at
what an iteration means an iteration is
uh uh executing the same block of code
over and over potentially many times a
programming structure that implements an
iteration is called a loop now in
programming we have two types of
iterations definite and indefinite
iterations and in this example we will
be speaking about indefinite iterations
indefinite iterations in Python is the
while loop where we use the while
keyword to Define an indefinite
iteration so uh let's look at the basic
syntax as you can see this is the basic
syntax where we have the V keyword
followed by an expression and uh again
the colon and below that is something
indented again we encounter indentations
just like inl statements uh a set of
statements where um what happens here is
following the while keyword we have this
expression where um this expression is
evaluated in a Boolean context again we
check if this expression evaluates true
or false and if it is true we uh execute
all the statements or the statement
block that is indented below this file
statement uh this is another example of
control structure much like uh if andl
statement blocks where we use a lot of
indentation so let's look at a basic
example now of while loop so let's copy
this example and let's see what this
does so I have a variable n where I am
assigning it a value zero this is called
an initializing process and it's very
important to note that most while Loops
consist of an expression which contains
a variable or a control variable uh
which um is usually initialized prior to
starting the loop and then this control
variable is uh typically verif modified
somewhere within the uh main Loop body
so in this case my control variable is n
and I am initializing it by assigning it
the value zero so let's uh move into the
loop now so the loop has this V keyword
as you can see followed by a uh an
expression n lesser than or equal to 5
now what this is is an expression which
is going to check if it's true or false
is n lesser than or equal to 5 and as
long as this expression is true we will
continue doing whatever is indented
below this VI statement and what is
below this VI statement is a print
statement first of all which says value
of n is and it basically prints the
value of n in that particular iteration
and as you can see this uh compound
assignment where we add the value of n
uh by one and we assign it back to n so
what this is uh let's see what this does
actually let's execute this and see what
this does uh important to note the value
of n again is initialized at zero so
this while loop will keep going on until
the value of n remains lesser than or
equal to 5 so as you can see I have the
ex ution of this uh particular block of
code or this while loop where I get the
multiple different iterations of this
print statement that you can see here
the first iteration it says value of n
is zero then it says value of n is one
what I'm doing is I'm writing I am
assign I'm writing uh the value of n
multiple times uh and each time the
value of n is written over here based on
what iteration it is so what is
happening actually is uh that initially
value of n is zero and I print the
statement value of n is zero now I add
uh the value of what is In N by one so
now what is the value of n so again we
do this check so after this first
iteration we come back like once this
whole uh code block of code is executed
we again come back to this expression
and we again check if this statement is
true so now that the value of n is
actually one this uh statement is still
true so again we execute this and that
you can see over here value of n is 1
now again we add the value of n by one
one and again we go back here once this
uh this block is executed and we check
if the statement is true again and as
you can see the value of n when it's two
is still uh making sure that this
expression is true and this keeps
happening until the value of n is
greater than five so once the value of n
becomes six this condition is no longer
met and finally we do not execute this
statement because this expression
evaluates to false and we do not do this
anymore and we finally leave our while
loop so let's check what the value of n
is just to confirm this as you can see
the value of n is indeed six and that is
why we have left this while loop over
here so this is an example of a basic
while loop where we check for this uh an
expression if it evaluates to true we
evaluate everything within it once this
is done we go back and we evaluate this
expression again if it is again true we
again go back and do whatever is
indented within it and we keep doing
this until the expression gives us false
and interestingly we don't uh we don't
necessarily have to Define these control
variables always we can actually use uh
iterables and we will learn about
iterables actually in a future video but
uh we can use iterables and an example
of an iterable is uh the list so let's
look at this list uh and let's look at
this whole block all right so I created
this list a which contains five objects
1 2 3 4 and five all integer objects and
I have another variable X where I store
the integer one now I'm this V statement
now it might look confusing now it says
it says while a now what is a well a is
not uh your typical expression where
you're making sure if some condition is
being met or not but this the way you
read this is while a exists so in the
context of a list as long as a which is
a list contains objects within it a is
true if it does not have any objects
within it a is false so while a
basically what it means is while a has
objects within it and if if it does have
objects within it or as long as it does
we continue executing whatever is
indented within this vse statement and
this V statement is a print statement
again we uh do like we we have this
value X where we um we're doing this
this we're printing this is iteration
number and uh we pass X so the first
iteration will obviously pass X is equal
to 1 and then we add X by one and then
the second iteration should pass this is
iteration number two and then so on and
finally we have another statement within
this block called the a called the pop
statement where we're popping the
elements of a now as if you would have
seen the list the video on list the pop
statement removes the rightmost value uh
from a list so if I do a. popop
initially it will remove five from this
list and I will have the rest of them
again if I do pop it will remove four
from this list and then you will have
the rest of these so let's actually see
we'll actually check what's left in this
list each time we do this pop statement
so I'll also print the list a each uh
during each iteration and let's see what
happens over here as you can see what is
happening out here is while a or while a
has elements we are going to continue
doing this vse statement whatever is
within it so in the first iteration
obviously we have all of it uh and it is
iteration number one and as you can see
the list contains everything then I pop
it then iteration number two it again
has elements but it has lost its most
rightmost element and this keeps on
happening until the list finally has no
elements left and once element or once
the list has no elements left we this
expression while a evaluates to false
and we do not execute this anymore and
we leave the while loop and again let's
check what is in a a should have no
elements as you can see it's an empty
list when I checked what's an a it's an
empty list and that is why V A returned
me a false and we did not print any
further so this is an example of using a
v statement using lists uh and of course
uh the next topic would be discussing
nested V loops and um this is a broad
topic what I mean by this is that when
when I'm saying nested while Loops I'm
actually talking about nested control
structures so we can have while Loops
within while Loops not only that we can
have if and L statements within while
Loops we can have while Loops within if
and L statements and we can have if and
L statements within if and L statements
so if you think of all of these Loops uh
and we will even speak about for Loops
in the ne in the in in a in another
video for Loops again a type of control
structur so all of these are control
structures while Loops are control
structures for Loops are control
structures ifnl statements are control
structures all of these are control
structures and nesting can happen within
them and it does not matter uh which is
the like the parent of the nest and then
the child of the nest you can have a
while loop within an if andl statement
you can have for Loops within a while
loop all of this is valid in Python and
uh it's one of the one of the great
features of python that is very flexible
in this way so let's look at an example
where I have a while loop within another
while loop so I'm copying this piece of
code where I have this list 1 2 3 4 5
and another list first and second now my
first while loop I print I print what is
popped from a so I take a then I pop the
zeroth index so basically from the left
hand side and I print what is that all
right and then I have another V Loop
where I have this list B and I'm doing
the same thing but this V Loop is within
the first V Loop and let's see what
happens out here so as you can see my
first uh my first iteration of this
parent while loop causes me to pop what
is the first element which is one then I
do these while loops and this is
completely executed and only then do I
go back to this first one and then I
come back and do all of this again then
I go back to this one and then I come
back and do all of this again and that's
why you can see this repetition so I
have this first iteration and then I do
uh the second while Lop then I have the
second iteration and then I do the
second while lop and I keep doing this
and this is an example of a nested Loop
okay so our next Topic in uh this this
video would be break and continu
statements now break and continu
statements are ways to abruptly end
iterations uh in in a particular Loop
you can use break and continuous
statements not only in while Loops but
you can use it also in for Loops so
let's look at how we use it in while
loops and let's look at what we mean by
breaking continous statements first of
all well the brake statement terminates
the loop entirely so once the break
statement is found the the complete
while loop that we are using is
completely terminated and the continuous
statement on the other hand terminates
only the current Loop iteration and it
goes back to the beginning or the
expression and it checks whether uh the
expression or the the controlling
expression is again re-evaluated and it
is checked whether uh the loop will
execute again or terminate this
pictorial that you can see here actually
emphasizes or it shows the difference
between break and continue so I have
this y Loop and I have an expression all
right I have a bunch of statements and I
have a break command over here and I
have a continue command over here so if
I encounter the break command it will
not execute any of this in fact it will
not execute this VI statement at all and
it will move on to the next piece of
code that we have but a continuous
statement if a continuous statement is
encountered in while loop will not
completely break away but it will not uh
it will not execute the the rest of the
statements in that iteration only these
two but it will go back here it will
check this expression again and again we
will do this all over again so this is
this small uh difference between the
break and continue statements but both
are used to abruptly end an iteration in
a loop so let's look at an example of
how we use the break statement so I will
use this example where I have again I
have initialized some controlling
variable n to zero uh my first Loop will
check whether n is less than equal to 5
if this is true then I will print this
statement then I will what I'm doing
over here is I am incrementing it by one
now in my previous in my earlier example
using a similar uh using the similar
example uh I had no like this this part
was not there so what you got was I was
printing the value of n so it was
printing as like value of n is one I
mean zero and then one and then two and
then three four and five but over here
I've included a small I've nested an if
statement and within that I put a break
statement and this if statement is
checking if if n is equal to equal to 2
so once n is 2 I move on to this and I
do the break statement so let's see what
happens now as you can see once so when
I've executed this I don't get the whole
value of n is zero and then 1 and then 2
3 4 5 I I stop at 1 and that is because
once n is equal to 2 I actually do not
execute this while loop again I do not
go back and uh execute print value of n
is two now in fact I break from this
whole while loop and my while loop
terminates right then and there and
that's why you only get these two
iterations value of n is zero and then
value of n is one okay so now I'm going
to show you a neat example of what
happens or what is the difference
between a break and a continuous
statement okay so let's uh go back to
our initial example where we're printing
this value of n is 0 1 2 3 4 and so on
but I added one more statement where I
print hello at each iteration so let's
see what happens when I do this as you
can see it will print hello after each
of whatever I was doing already now
let's introduce our break statement
first of all so when I do break well
let's go back to this if statement if is
if we check this condition then we break
let's see what happens now as you can
see something interesting has happened
where we have this first iteration
completely being executed but the second
iteration kind of stops where there's no
hello and that is because we have broken
from this y Loop before the second
iterations hello was printed let's see
the difference between a break and
continue now so now I have this continu
statement instead of a break let's see
what happens here as you can see it
seems familiar to our first example
where we did not have any break or
continue but there is a small difference
that I want you to catch and that is
very important about this continue uh
statement so as you can see the first
iteration has value of n is zero and
then hello then value of n is one but
there is no hello and this is because
and this is because once this condition
is actually met we do not move on to
this statement but we go back to this
expression and we evaluate this
expression and then once we evaluate
this expression again and it's found to
be correct we do everything the same
again where we print hello but except
for that one step where this if
statement was met and we did continue
and this following statement was not
executed and that happens only for one
iteration and that is when n is equal to
equal to 2 and as you can see that is
what happens over here in one of the
iterations we miss say hello and that is
the difference of the continu statement
between uh that is the difference of the
continu statement with the break
statement this video will be an
extension to that topic where we will be
looking at three examples where we are
using while Loops along with other stuff
like say if and else statements so our
first example will be where we calculate
the factorial of a number in this
example as you can see here we are first
going to ask the user to enter a
particular number for us now this number
is supposed to be an integer once we
have this integer we store it to a
variable called number now we have this
you can say this uh variable called fac
which stes one and you we will see how
we are using it later now we know that
the factorial of 0 is 1 that's how it's
just defined so we have an if statement
checking whether our entered number is
zero and if it is zero we say that the
result is one or the factorial is one
however if we enter a number that is
greater than zero we must calculate the
factorial for this number and that is
what we're going to do in this else
statement block over here now in this
lse statement block we have a while loop
in this while loop the condition is
checking while number is greater than or
equal to 1 so as long as this condition
is true everything within that while
loop will be executed so as long as
number is greater than equal to 1 we are
going to execute these two lines now
what do these two lines do let us see so
the first line takes the variable fac
where we had the number one stored and
we're going to store FC * number into it
number being the number that we have
inputed so in case for example we we
entered 8 then what this will do this
line will do is 1 into 8 and it will
store that back into fac now once that
is done we move on to the next line
where we are decrementing the number
variable by one so if we have stored
eight or we have entered eight into our
input it will become seven now as we
know 7 is still great than equal to 1 so
this condition is still being met and
then we do this process again where we
are going to multiply fac this time f
stores the value 8 and we multiply times
the new number which is 7 now so we do 8
into 7 and then again we decrement this
uh also once we do 8 into 7 we store it
back into faac and we keep doing this
where we keep multiplying 8 * 7 and then
we decrement the number variable uh by
one and then we check this condition
again so so what ends up happening is we
going to keep doing 8 into 7 into 6 into
5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 and once
we are at one again when we do this
decent operation the number variable
will store the value zero and then this
condition will no longer be met so
number will be zero and this condition
will be false and we can move out of
this while loop then finally we store
the result into a variable called result
which stores the result of 8 into 7 into
6 into into 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into
1 this is of course if we did enter 8
when we were asked to give an input so
let's see this um in real time once we
execute this so I'm executing this the
first thing it asked me is to enter a
number so let's say I enter my number8
as I was speaking about 8 all right now
that I have entered 8 as you can see the
result that it gives me is factorial of
8 is
40320 which is correct and you can check
this for yourself where it will show you
um 8 * 7 or 8 factorial is basically
this this number okay so now in our next
example we will be looking at how we can
generate Fibonacci numbers for this
example we will be using bunch of if and
else if statements along with a while
loop so let's look at this piece of code
where we are actually doing this so as
you can see the first part of the code
is basically an input statement asking
us how many Fibonacci numbers we would
like to generate and then the user would
be asked to give an input which is
stored as an INT into a variable count
now in this uh IFL statement the first
if statement checks whether what we have
entered is zero in which case we just
store an empty array in the variable
called FIB next if our uh entered
integer is one we just store the value
one in this array called FIB if our
entered number is two we store one and
one in the array FIB all of these are
different sets of Fibonacci sequences
this obviously an empty an empty array
shows that well there is no numbers to
be generated in this sequence if we have
one we just print the first number of
the Fibonacci sequence which is one
itself if it is two we print the first
two numbers which is one and one now the
actual calculations happen when we say
we want a Fibonacci sequence for more
than two numbers now in that case we
move on to this block in this statement
block we initialize the FIB variable
with the first two Fibonacci numbers one
and one and we store in this very in
this array now we are going to do a
while loop within this and in this while
loop uh we're going to keep executing
this statement block as long as this
condition is met or this condition is
true and what this condition is is it's
checking this variable I which we have
initialized as one over here and we're
going to check whether that is lesser
than count minus1 count being the number
number that we have been asked to input
if the statement is true and as long as
the statement is true we will be
executing this statement block which is
basically us appending this expression
into the array FIB now what this
expression is is basically it's going to
keep adding uh each subsequent numbers
and we're going to store each subsequent
numbers back into the uh array Fib so in
this case if you see the what the first
step will do is it will take the value
at the first position of the array fib
and it will add it to the value at the
zeroth position of the array fib and
both of these values since they are one
and one when we add them we get two and
we append that to Fib so now our FIB
will look like 1 comma 1 comma 2 then we
increment this by one and what we do is
we uh do the same process again so in
the next step what would be what we
would do is we would do 2 plus one so we
would get three now this would keep
going on until this condition is met or
basically until uh the numbers that we
actually want to generate in our
sequence so let's like let's let's uh
execute this and uh let's see an example
of what happens so it asks me how many
Fibonacci numbers I would like to
generate and I will say I want the first
let's say six Fibonacci numbers so I
execute this as you can see this gives
me the first six numbers in the sequence
which is one and one and then 2 which is
basically 1 + 1 and then 3 which is 1 +
2 and then 5 which is 2 + 3 8 which is 3
+ 5 so if we wanted more numbers we
would just enter over here like say if
we wanted the first 10 numbers it would
give us the first 10 numbers in the
sequence as you can see here now in our
next example what we are going to do is
we're going to write a program which
takes two digits that represent the
dimensions of an array for example if we
want a 3X3 array we will enter 3A 3 and
we are going to generate a
two-dimensional array in which each of
the elements of the array are basically
the row times the column position of
that particular element and what I mean
by this is say we have a position I
comma J on the array the value of the uh
element at that position would be I * J
so for example if I'm looking at
something at the third row and the fifth
column or say the third row and the
third column for example the value of
the element would be 3 * 3 and if I'm
looking at something at the second row
and the fourth column I am going to do 2
* 4 so let's uh let's see how we can do
this using Code so if you look to the
right over here I have a piece of code
where I'm going to uh in where it asks
me to input two numbers two integers to
represent the dimensions of my uh
example my sample array now once we have
done this we are going to store these um
these uh uh dimensions in the input uh
in in a variable called input string so
obviously when we enter say 5 comma 5
that will be stored as an INT in this
particular string or this variable what
we want is we want uh five say we
entered 5 comma 5 we want five as a
separate integer and the other five as
another separate integer and that is
what we do in this particular statement
where we're going to split up our input
string uh based on the comma separator
and we're going to store the first part
of that string into the zeroth position
of Dimensions which is an array and the
uh next dimension in the first position
in this uh particular array now we're
going to store the number of rows as row
number and that is the zeroth position
of this array and we're going to store
the number of columns as the first
position of Dimensions or whatever we've
mentioned in the input so now we uh we
have this um our results array called
multi-list which is basically what what
our final array is going to look like
and we're going to store into multi list
and uh in this example we will be using
for Loops to uh do this or to create
this particular array so as you can see
here our first uh we have initialized
our multi list saying that um we're
going to have only zeros in our sample
array so initially once we have
initialized this array all multi list
will contain is a say for example we
have inputed a 5x5 array it will have
basically a 5x5 array with all elements
as zero and that's what this line does
once we have done this we are going to
move on to the for Loop portion where we
actually going to create our uh array
that we want so as you can see we are
our first for Loop is going to say four
row in range row number so obviously uh
range will generate a uh an iterator
which can be iterated over um and since
it says range row number and say our the
number of rows that we entered were five
what it's going to do is it's going to
create an iterator containing the value
0 1 2 3 and 4 so for row and range it
will basically basically row will take
the value 0 1 2 3 and 4 and a similar
thing is going to happen in this nested
for Loop which is within this where
we're going to again uh create a an
iterator using this range function and
for the column number once we have this
we're going to do the simple process of
um multiplying the uh the value of the
element based on its position so if it's
at the position 3 comma 4 we're going to
store the value 3 * 4 into that
particular position of the array and
we're going to do this for every
position which is what happens in these
two for Loops we're going to first go by
uh each row and then within that we're
going to check each column and we're
going to perform these calculations and
finally we print our result so let's
look at an example now I'm going to say
I want a 3X let's say a 2x 4 Matrix so
let's see what the results will be when
I give this as um so what I'm saying is
I want two rows and four columns now as
you can see here it might not be very
clear to you right now but what you can
see here is this is the first row and
this is the second row and each row
contains four columns so these are the
this is the my final array that I get so
what you can see here is this is the
zeroth position and the uh or you can
say this is the first row First Column
first row second column and since python
is zero based so this is actually the
zeroth row and this is the first row so
as you can see uh this this value
basically is 0 * 1 this value is 0 * 2 0
* 3 0 * 4 and over here it is 1 * 0 1 *
1 1 * 2 1 * 3 so similarly if I did for
example a 5x5 Matrix what you will get
is five rows now five rows and five
columns and for example like this
particular value is uh 1 2 3 or 0 1 2 3
so 0 1 2 3 and the First Column so this
is 3 * 1 um if I took this value this is
like the fourth row for example fourth
row * the um 0 1 2 3 third column so
this would be 4 * 3 which is 12 so and
uh each value of this has been generated
in the similar process so this is an
example of how we can use for Loops um
for a particular exercise that I have
shown you right now in this video we
will be covering the topic of definite
iterations uh using for Loops in Python
so starting off we know that there are
two types of iterations in programming
uh definite and indefinite we have
already covered indefinite iterations in
the form of V Loops definite iterations
on the other hand are done using the
keyword for uh and the basic syntax or
the standard syntax for a basic for Loop
in Python is as you can see over here we
have this for keyword we have some
variable we have the in keyword and we
have have this iterable and we of course
Define this control structure with the
colon and then indented we have this uh
statement block so once this for Loop
has started we execute all of these uh
statements within the statement block as
part of the for Loop iteration so yeah
let's uh now let's to understand like
how for loops work uh exactly let's uh
look at the concept or meaning behind
what we call iterables and iterators so
so think of it in a stepwise manner all
right so we in Python we have different
objects that can be used as iterables
and an iterable is basically some object
that uh it's it's a collection of other
objects so you know think of your lists
uh think of dictionaries and sets so all
of these are essentially collections of
objects so once we have these collection
of objects uh we can create an iterator
out of it uh how do we do that is we use
the iter function so for example if I
passed this list a if I pass this list a
through the iter function and I stored
it in some variable _ a um and I see
what is _ a it is actually a list
iterator at some random memory location
which we don't really care about
similarly if I gave a duple and I did
the same thing I will create a tuple
iterator and uh in the left if you can
see over here I've done the exact same
uh functions with sets and dictionaries
as well so I'm creating iterators out of
these uh iterables so as to speak uh now
what is an iterator well an iterator is
an object that yields values
successively so if my list contained
five values or five objects an iterator
of this list will yield these values uh
one after the other and that is kind of
how or that is the basis for which we do
uh we create Loops let's see what we
exactly mean using this uh using another
function that we call the next function
so the next function keeps moving from
object to object within an iterator so
since I've created this list iterator
let's just do it once again so as you
can see I've created this listed
iterator _ a now with this _ a what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use this
next function what next function does is
starting from the leftmost object within
this iterator I will keep yielding or
keep producing the values so let's let's
just see what happens when I do next it
when I do next for this particular
variable it gives me this object first
now let's see what happens when I do it
again now it gives me the object second
what if I did it again it gives me third
now if I kept doing this it would keep
giving me the different objects that
were initially stored in a that is first
and then second third fourth and fifth
one after the other so let's actually
perform that now I get fourth now I get
fifth now natural question is now that
I've exhausted all of these values what
will happen if I perform the next
function again well let's see what
happens I get a uh an error or and this
error is the stop iteration function
error which basically is telling me uh
look you have uh exhausted all of the
objects that were initially present in
this list a and you cannot you cannot
keep doing the next next function
anymore you cannot go keep going further
so yeah so this is uh what the next
function does when it comes to the
concept of iterators all right so now
we've learned two things what is an
iterator and what is the how do we
create an iterator out of different
collections of objects like a list or a
tuple and we've also learned how to use
a next function now let's uh move or
let's come back to our for Loop that we
uh started off this uh video with so our
for loop again let's consider our for
Loop over here as you can see some for
loop with the objects again 1 2 3 4 and
five all right this is a list now I'm
going to do for X in a print X and let's
try to see what happens when we do this
okay as you can see when I have executed
this it gives me 1 2 3 4 and 5 so I have
first of all let's look at this for loop
I in this for loop I Define a new
variable X and then I say for X in a
print X and what's happening well in
each iteration I'm printing whatever the
value of x is uh at present so in the
first iteration it is the first object
one in the second iteration it is the
second object two then 3 4 5 and then
finally uh on its own like uh this for
Loop knows that okay now once I have
exhausted all of the objects within my
iterator I can stop doing this for Loop
and I can move on with the rest of the
code all right so think of it like a
three-step process uh a for Loop in
Python the first step is it calls an
iter function to obtain an iterator for
whatever we pass over here this iterable
second step it calls the next function
repeatedly in each iteration all right
to keep getting the next item from the
iterator so it gets one then it calls
next then it gets two then it calls next
and it gets three and then four and then
five and so on and then finally the
third step is the termination step is
when after we do the final next where we
get this uh error as you can see the
stop iteration error or exception
finally this tells the for Loop function
or the for Loop that um okay we have
reached the end of our definite
iteration or the end of our definite for
Loop and this is where we must terminate
our Loop and then continue with the rest
of the code all right so this is how a
for Loop Works in Python now it's very
important to note that whatever we have
discussed when it came to while Loops
such as nesting of while loops and
nesting of other control structures is
also applicable in the case of for Loops
so if I had a for Loop within another
for Loop that is perfectly fine if I had
a while within a for Loop that is
perfectly fine so all of these are valid
statement blocks that we can do uh and
again for Loop is another control
structure and so we must follow the
concept of uh indentation when it comes
to writing our statement blocks within a
for for Loop okay so now I'm going to
speak about in specific I'm going to
speak about the this uh something called
the range function that is uh quite you
could say it's used definitely it's used
in other areas of programming but it's
widely used in Python uh I and uh I mean
the for Loop in Python uh what I mean by
this is
that um Range this range function is
very important for the for Loop and we
will see why okay so let's look at um
one of the examples of using the range
function so what does the range function
do is if I give Range Five let's see
what it does it gives me range 0 to 5
what this basically tells me is that
this will create an iterator that
contains uh integers from 0 to 5 so it
will contain the object 0 1 2 3 4 and 5
and we can use this as an iterator so
let's let's look at this uh I have range
five uh let's store this in X okay now
let's do a type just to see what happens
when we do Type X it should give me the
type of range as you can see and this is
a type of an iterator in Python now
let's see what happens when I do for I
in X print I okay let's see what happens
as you can see it prints the number 0 1
2 3 4 an important caveat when it comes
to the range function is when we say
Range Five it creates an iterator from 0
to 5 but it contains the objects 0 1 2 3
and 4 only it does not contain the
object five itself okay this is
something that is very important to so
uh once again I created uh I use this
range function to create an iterator
from iterator of five objects from 0 to
4 0 1 2 3 and 4 uh I use that in my for
Loop and uh that what that is what you
are seeing here now let's use this range
function in the context of something
else for example let's see so I had my
earlier list a right look at my list a
here so you can see list a contains
these 1 2 3 4 five five objects okay
let's see what length of a is length of
a is five okay uh let's use the range
function on top of the length of this
list a and this is uh like I can't show
you an example right now without any
context but this uh this form of using a
for Loop is used is widely used in uh
Python programming you will use it so
much in data science you will use so
much in machine learning and AI I cannot
tell you uh this is this is a very
important like sort of uh for Loop
expression so you have for let's say I
in range Len a let's see what's going on
here first I create uh first I do length
of a that gives me five then I do range
of five that creates an iterator between
uh 0 and four right when you do Range
Five it gives you an iterator of 0 1 2 3
and 4 as we saw earlier and this is what
we're doing over here we have created an
iterator out of the length of a list now
when I do print I it should give me
again 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 of course so as
you can see here it will give me 0 1 2 3
4 and this is a very neat way of using
the range function on top of the length
of a particular collection of objects in
this case we're using the list a this is
something that you will use a lot so I I
would recommend that you get used to
this form of creating a for loop as well
using the range function
also of course um there are uh the you
can use break and continu statements as
you have in the case of while Loops uh
exactly the it works exactly the same in
the case of for Loops wherein the break
statement will abruptly stop the for
Loop completely and we will move on to
the next piece of code whereas The
Continuous statement will break that
particular iteration and then we will uh
resume with the next iteration so yeah
that was break in continu statements and
for loopes uh finally I would like to
show you something about uh how to use
dictionaries as an iterator or as an
iterable when it comes to for Loops so
let's create our dictionary let's go we
have a dictionary already here in fact
create this dictionary again will store
it in a okay so I created this
dictionary a all right so I have
dictionary a uh what I'm going to do is
I'm going to pass it through the iter
function as you can see and now I'm
going to just for the sake of showing
you it will show I'll show you that it
is actually an iterator of type of a
specific dict key iterator type all
right so now let's uh let's do something
on this so as you can see in the
dictionary I have the key first that has
a value one I have the key second that
has a value two I have the key third
that has a value three and then fourth
for four fifth for five now a good
question would be when I do iteration or
when I do a for loop on top of this a
well what is it going to pick up is it
going to pick up first uh is it going to
pick up the keys like these or is it
going to pick up the values or is it
going to go one by one key and then
value and then key and the subsequent
value uh let's see what actually happens
so let's do for I in uh iter _ a print I
let's see what what is The iterations
Happening upon using this so as you can
see we're using the keys so by default
when we do this when we perform when we
create an iterator out of a dictionary
we use only the keys as our uh uh
iterator elements or iterator values but
of course like if you wanted to use
values all you would have to do is pass
a do values over here and if you
remember from a dictionary video this uh
a do values gives us a a list of or it
it gives us the essentially a list of
the values in our dictionary so when we
pass this to the iterator uh iter
function and we create an iterator out
of it let's see what happens over here
now let's see what is iter _ a you can
actually see it's now the dict value
iterator at a particular memory location
so it's not the dict key as we saw
earlier it's a dict value iterator so
now that we have this dict dictionary
value iterator now let's print what are
our iterator elements and as you can see
now we are printing values and not um
the keys so this is how to this this is
basically two different ways of
iterating through a dictionary one
through keys and one through values in
this video we will be doing a small
exercise on if statements now in the
previous video you might have already
seen some of the basic concept
surrounding if statements however in
this video just to drive home the point
or the purpose of an if statement we
will be doing a small exercise so let's
first revise some of the concepts of an
if statement so a basic if statement can
be something like this we have a small
condition where we're checking if a
variable X is greater than 5 or not and
if it is greater than x next we print a
statement over here so if this condition
is met we print this statement else we
move to the statement block now our
variable X has a value five now since X
is not greater than five what this will
do is it will check the statement and
since this will be false we skip this
statement block and move on to this
statement so as you can see here
similarly we can do something uh where
we're checking multiple statements we
use the L if statement in such a case so
now in this block we we're checking in
one of the one of the conditions we're
checking is if x is equal to 5 or if x
is greater than 5 and then finally if
both of these conditions are not met we
say else and we print whatever or we do
whatever is in this particular statement
block which is a simple print statement
so as you can see X is indeed get is
equal to five so this is the block that
will get executed as you can see here
now another example are nested if
statements so nested IFL stat statements
are IFL statements within IFL statements
so let's look at an example as you can
see here we have a string stored in a
variable called orange quality and the
string is fresh now we have an integer
or a float in this case 4.0 stored in
Orange price now our first statement is
checking whether orange quality the
variable orange quality is it equal to
the string fresh now within that if the
statement or if this condition is met we
do another check where we're checking
what is the price is it lesser than five
if it is we do this block else we
execute this block finally if our
initial uh statement or initial
condition is not met we move on to this
else block now when I execute this what
should happen is I will enter this block
because this is true and finally I will
enter this block because this condition
is also true so I should have this
printed I will buy 5 doz as you can see
here now let's move on to our main
exercise for this video so this was all
just revision now we're going to use
some or all of these Concepts in a
sample project or a sample exercise uh
to for your further practice so in this
exercise what we're going to do is we're
going to request the user to enter a
number between 1 and 20 and our U our
code is going to check whether this
number entered is an even number or an
odd number so as you can see there are
two sets of checks that we're going to
do in this code the first check is going
to be whether the number that is entered
is between 1 and 20 or not and if it is
not we have to say it's an invalid
number but if it is entered between 1
and 20 we have to move on to the further
checks which is whether it is an even or
an odd number so let's see how we do
that so in this piece of code what we
start with is a print statement saying
please enter a number between 1 and 20
and then we add in input command this
input command will open a box where we
can enter whatever number that we want
to enter now we use this int keyword to
make sure that whatever we have entered
into the input box is stored as a int
data type in the enter num variable once
we do that our first if statement is
going to check whether the entered
number is greater than or equal to 1 or
lesser than equal to 20 uh sorry and
less than equal to 20 so both of these
conditions have to be met if this
condition is true then we have a valid
input and this statement is printed that
we have a entered a valid number and
then we move on to the rest of the
statement block within this if statement
which is another set of if and else if
statements if our number is not between
120 we move to this block and this block
prints that we have entered in invalid
number now once we have say entered a
valid number we move on to this block
this if an uh if else uh if L if
statement block now what this block is
checking is whether the entered number
is an even number or not now as we know
an even number is divisible by two and
leaves the remainder zero when divided
by two so this is what this check is
doing if this check is true that means
our number is even and we get printed
that our number is even the other other
check or the other uh if statement is
checking whether it's an odd number and
that means when we divide by two we
should get the remainder one as you can
see here and we get printed your number
is odd so let's execute this and see
what happens when we enter a number
number now it's asking me to enter a
number let's say I enter
17 now that I have entered 17 as you can
see it's a valid number that I have
entered and the code is telling me that
my number is indeed odd let's look at
some other what if I entered something
else here let's say if I enter 16 now
since it's an even number as you can see
16 is also a valid number as it's
between 1 and 20 and my number is even
and the code checks for that let's see
if I what happens when I enter an
invalid number let's say 25 now I enter
25 as you can see it says I have entered
an invalid number and in this case what
has happened is this condition itself is
not met and I have moved on to this
statement block so to give you a
breakdown as to how our code has
executed this let me show you an example
for the number say nine when I enter
nine the first check that happens of
course is this check whether it's a
valid number or not and since it is
between 1 and 20 we move on to this
block and in this block block is
checking whether our number is divisible
by two or not and since it is not it
will remain it will leave a remainder
one and we execute this block which says
our print our number is Odd as you can
see here in this video we're going to
learn about the topic called file
handling now file handling is basically
needed because so most of the times when
we're handling large and different types
of data in python or uh in general we
cannot store everything into a variable
and we will have to use files now there
are two types of files that we are going
to deal with they are binary and text
files so binary files are some of the
files that we most of the files that we
commonly encounter like uh document
files image Files video files Etc now
all binary files are encoded in a
particular format and they cannot be
read by a normal text editor and we
would be needing certain uh specific
softwares for specific files text files
on the other hand do not have any
specific encoding and they can be opened
in the normal text editor itself and
they are like um XML CS says HTML files
and so on now there are four main
operations that we can do on uh p in
Python on files they are open read write
and close um there are certain other
operations as well though like uh rename
delete so some of the most basic
operation that we can do is obviously
creating and opening a file and the
syntax is as you can see here where we
store where we use the open command and
we give a file name and we give a mode
and we store that in a particular
variable now a mode is uh basically
telling python how to handle this
opening so we can have a readon mode
which is done by this letter r a write
only mode which is done by letter W and
for there are a bunch of other modes
such as read or write mode which is done
by r+ and we're going to see them as we
encounter them now the this important to
note that what I just mentioned is for
text files if we are going to do for
binary files we're going to do this file
handling then we would be using the
letter B in front of whatever we were
using in the case of text files so if we
were doing a readon mode for opening a
binary file um we would be using RB and
if we were doing read and WR mode read
or right only mode for a binary file we
would be using rb+ um so basically just
adding the b in the case of binary files
let's look at a basic example U when we
want to open a particular file we are
going to open like in this example I'm
going to open some file called file
handling. txt in a read and write mode
read or write mode and I'm going to
store it in fo so this is as simple as
it gets similarly if I wanted to do it
for a binary file since I'm using a
binary file I will use the letter B as
well in the mode and uh that's how you
do it here now let's look at different
ways in which we can read from a file
and there are three commands that we can
use we can use the read command followed
by optional number of characters you can
use the read line command followed by an
optional number of characters and the
read lines command so this optional
number of characters denoted by n over
here um and basically it's telling us
how many characters we want to print so
let's look at a simple example of um
when I'm going to print something called
so I'm going to take this and I'm going
to do a print on top of this so I've
done first I've opened it and I've
stored it in my file and then I'm going
to do a uh a method or a function called
read and I'm going to say like in this
example just read the whole thing so as
you can see my file that I have opened
has all of these lines this is like the
whole file basically but now what if I
wanted to open only the first five
characters of this file which is
basically this well in that case let's
open this once again now let's do the
same read command except we will give
the character number which is five as
you can see it's only printed five now
let's do a print read command and uh try
to read the whole thing again and you
will notice something very interesting
now when I do the read command you can
see it's kind of picked up from where we
left off in our from our previous
command and that is the nature of how um
python handles files so if I wanted to
again take the cursor back in such an
example I will have to open this again
and then I use this read command once
again to get back to where I started
from as you can see here now another
command that we can use is the readline
command so let's uh once again open this
over here and now we're going to use the
readline command on over here so what
readline command is going to do is going
to each time we use this command it's
going to go one by one and read each
particular line from this file so in
first case it will take artificial
intelligence then data science data and
so on so as you can see if I execute
this it first takes artificial
intelligence now if I did this command
again it will say data science next time
if I do it it should say big data as you
can see here okay so this is the
readline command now within the readline
command also we can enter uh characters
and that will tell us basically um that
we want these number of characters from
the next line so if I want the first six
characters of the next line uh I will
say six I will enter six here and and it
will give me the first six characters of
this particular line which is the next
line that is to come as you can see here
now another way in which we can um print
uh whatever is there in our file line by
line is by using a for Loop so again I'm
going to open this file I'm going to
store it here now I'm going to use a for
Loop saying that well uh for line in my
file and what this does is basically at
each each iteration it's going to take
each line and store it in this variable
that we enter over here which is called
line itself and we're going to print
that at the end of the loop what we'll
have is all of the lines have been
printed one by one and another thing
that we can do right now is um say we
want to read a particular line say I
wanted you to read the uh Fifth Line of
my file I can use this technique where
um I just say okay I'm going to store
five in this variable called line number
and I have this um another variable
called current line which I'm going to
initialize with one and I'm going to in
I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm
going to do the same Loop where I'm
going to say four line in my line but
I'm going to add a condition saying that
only if current line when it's equal to
line number I'm I going to print the
line and then I'm going to break out of
this whole thing uh and end of each uh
loop I'm going to say current line is
going to be incremented by one until
basically these two variables are equal
so when I do this I get my result which
is uh machine learning which is the
fifth line of um my which is the fifth
line of whatever file I had now now
we're going to move on to the topic of
um image file handling so we we saw how
we handled and we we saw certain
operations around um text files um and
text files are obviously something that
we're going to use a lot um but we are
also going to be using files uh such as
images a lot and let's uh look at
certain examples and certain um use
cases around image file handling so my
first step is going to be importing a
bunch of uh modules and packages now the
details of these modules and these
packages are not important as of right
now because they will be covered in a
future video uh but just keep a note of
some of these packages such as um let
say numai and uh image the image um
package so once I've done this let's
move on to my example so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to store certain file
locations in two variables so it's
basically two strings uh I've attached
the uh this prefix R to say that this is
a readon uh sort of prefix so the next
topic that we're going to be handling is
image file handling now we have already
seen many examples pertaining to text
files so text files are obviously
something that we're going to be using a
lot but uh image file handling is
something very important as well and
we're going to see certain uh operations
that we can do around image file
handling so starting off I'm going to
import a bunch of um packages and
modules what these packages exactly are
and what these modules exactly are are
right now not of that important of not
are not that important to you right now
but it's something that will be covered
in a future or in future videos uh it's
important to just keep note of what
these are such as numpy and image so
once I've done that what I'm going to
store is I'm going to store two
particular file locations into variables
location one and location two and I
prefixed them with r just to say that uh
these are raw strings so once I've done
that I'm going to use the image uh from
the image package I'm going to say open
and I'm going to say open from uh this
particular location and this particular
location and I'm going to store these
image images in im1 and im2 over here
very similar to a normal text file
opening now once we've done this uh we
can access certain properties of this
image using save format which tells us
the format of the file um it attributes
the it identifies the source of an image
and if the image is not read from a file
it is set to none we can also see the
size of the file using the size
attribute and we can see the mode which
basically defin the number and names of
the bands in the image and also contains
a pixel type and depth certain common
modes are like L for luminence RGB for
true color images and CMYK for pre-press
images so let's look at them so when I
uh access this you can see my first file
is a JPEG of this size and an RGB format
image and my second image is another
jpeg slightly bigger image and again RGB
now we uh can also of course display
these images and to do that we can use
the PLT um again PLT is the is supposed
to stand for matte plot lip. P plot it's
a particular for a particular package um
that again you don't need to know the
details of right now but this is how we
would um do this so I'm going to use a
bunch of um commands and methods such as
figure and subplot and then I am show so
once I have done this as you can see
both of my images with this being im1
this being im2 have uh been PR produced
on the screen as you can see I can also
use display this display function
followed by the name of the file and
this will simply display my image as you
can see here now um I can obviously save
a particular uh image using the save
function which is as simple as is doing
this so I'm going to save the image as _
save. jpg over here now if I wanted to
crop an image I can do that as well so I
initially I stored the dimensions that I
want uh cropped in the form of a tuple
as you can see here and I'm going to
pass that duple to the crop function and
I'm going to apply that on top of im1
and I'm going to store that to region
once I've done that as you can see so
basically what I've done is I've cropped
this image based on whatever I've passed
here and I've stored it into region and
now if I wanted to see what was um
actually in that crop I can just um do
the IM show function and I'm going to
pass the particular crop image which is
denoted by region as you can see here
and you can see my uh cropped image is
basically uh a certain a left portion of
this whole image has been cropped out
and I have produced it over here now I
can also use the copy function using
it's a simple basically copy basic you
use the copy function and it copies an
image onto another um variable that you
have assigned and when I use the IM show
function I'm going to show you the
copied image which is basically the same
now we can do the transpose operation as
well so let's see some of the uh let's
see what we've done here so in this
transpose opposite operation so in this
uh basically I've done a bunch of um
operations such as rotating by 90°
rotating by 180 rotating by 7270 and
finally once I'm done with all of these
multiple operations I'm going to show
you the final output which is basically
a certain transposed image like this
which is basically the result of
whatever I have done before this so this
is it for this video on file handling uh
I have shown you two slightly more
comprehensive examples on um text files
and even certain examples on image files
however we can use file handling in
different libraries uh pertaining to
file handling for audio files and even
for like stuff like PDF files and uh
this is like this is just only the
beginning and I'm sure you will
encounter a lot of um different use
cases different examples as you continue
learning um Python Programming this
video is going to be the first of a part
of a series on object-oriented
programming so to start off with with
let's try to understand and get an
introduction into what is
object-oriented programming well as a
name suggests object-oriented
programming is all about creating
objects an object is a group of
interrelated variables and functions
variables can be referred to as the
properties of the object whereas the
functions can be referred to as the
behavior of an object so if we were to
treat say for example a car as an object
its properties would be its color its
model its price and its brand whereas
it's Behavior or functions for that
matter would be like accelerating gear
change breaking similarly if I give you
an example of a dog as an object we
could consider the properties of the dog
as its weight or its name its breed its
color whereas its functions could be say
barking playing eating walking Etc
objects provide a better and a clear
structure for a program now let's move
on to what is a class and an instance
now a class is like a blueprint or a
template of certain functions and
entities whereas an instance is a
particular realization of a class
classes are used to create user defin
data structures and Define certain
functions called Methods within the
class whereas instances are realizations
of these classes and when we are
speaking of classes and instances
classes don't contain any real data they
are just merely templates instances on
the other hand contain real data to
think of an example of the difference
between a class and an instance think of
a class like a empty form or a
questionnaire now an empty form or a
questionnaire does not have any
information but it does have a template
to it it tells you to fill in certain
information and based on who is filling
in the information that information or
the data on a particular form will be
different so an instance is like a
filled out form with its own uh unique
set of information that is one way of uh
treating or understanding what is a
class and in instance now for our first
example on classes I will be taking you
through a class where I've defined based
on the circle object so this class is
going to define basically information
about your uh General Circle such as its
radius and its area so let's go through
it now obviously to define a class we
need a keyword well in the case of
classes we use the class keyword
followed by a name for that class so in
this case my name is circle now after
the uh colon every every information
that is part of the class has to be
obviously indented as is typical for
python now you can see over here A bunch
of Def keywords followed by so something
that you might not be familiar with and
I will try to get you through this so if
you see here you have a def keyword
followed by init and this init is U
prefixed by a double underscore and it's
suffixed by a double underscore and you
can see the same thing for St Str and RP
well this double underscore is called a
Dunder and any method um these are of
course methods this is a method this is
a method this is a method this is a
method now any method that is prefixed
and suffixed by double underscores are
called Dunder methods um these Dunder
methods are or can be thought of like
predefined or built-in methods for any
class that you define so these we have
like a three Dunder methods over here
and uh we have one user defined method
that we will get to so this first method
that you see here is the init method or
the initialization method and this is
invoked or called whenever we create an
instance of this class Circle and what
we do here is basically we pass um when
we create this instance Circle um we are
what what happens is that we are we get
an option to pass an a a value for a
what is this um keyword or variable
radius so if I pass so you will see me
uh later on creating instance where um I
will be passing a value and that value
is basically stored as the radius and by
default the radius that will be passed
whenever we create an instance for this
uh class is one um the Str Str method is
basically used to return a descriptive
string for the the instance of um class
um rpr is not something that you have to
bother with right now and uh now get
area is something that you should follow
because if you see here I have not used
any double underscores so this is a user
user defined method um user defined
methods are some methods that we Define
and these are like tasks that we Define
on our own so in my user defined method
called get area I will be returning the
area of this circle based on the radius
that I passed to it now if you notice
here before every um in every method I
have the self keyword before any other
attribute so like this has self this has
self even the get area has self now what
this means um self is like an optional
keyword that is used to improve
readability of a program first of all
and it's also the function of the self
keyword is basically um telling python
that well any of the methods that we are
invoking in this class or the instance
of this class has to refer to attributes
and variables within that instance of
that class so if I'm going to use get
area function I'm going to get values
and attribute values and variable values
based on on only the current instance of
um that particular class self is
obviously uh optional we don't really
need it but basically the first
attribute of any method is is basically
the is basically what the me is is the
instance that um the method is invoked
upon so if I say self I'm telling uh
this particular function that okay all
the value that you're going to get for
performing whatever task you want is
going to be found in that particular
particular instance where you have been
invoked itself now don't worry if all
this is very confusing um this might be
in the beginning but just try to
understand that uh this is something
that we do for good practice and uh you
will understand um when when to yourself
or when not to yourself as you learn
about object oriented programming so if
you see here my get area function is
supposed to return the value radius time
radius self. radius is basically telling
um whatever value I've passed for radius
for that particular instance you can
read this as radius time radius * pi as
well so obviously this is < R squ which
is the area of a particular circle now
let me show you an example where I'm
going to perform some of these functions
so if you see this first line I have
created an instance of the class Circle
where I've passed 2.1 for the radius of
the circle so now the value of the
variable radius in this particular
instance is going to be stored as 2.1
and this particular instance is going to
be stored in the variable C
now the print C1 function invokes the
Str Str self-defined or predefined
function now if you remember Str Str was
it's basically used to return a
particular string that describes like
what the class will do and this is
something that we Define on our own in
our example St Str will return the U the
string saying this is a circle with
radius of and then it will return the
radius that we passed so in this case it
should say this is a circle of radius
2.1 as you can see over here so if I
execute this you can notice this line
This is a circle with radius 2.1 and
this is invoked by the print function
the print basically invokes the dunder s
strr function which uh does all of this
now in the next line we say print C1 do
get area so this is going to print the
value of the what what gets returned
when we invoke the method get area for
this particular instance C1 so obviously
in this particular instance our radius
is 2.1 so the get area function should
do PK * 2.1 s and the value is as you
can see here is some 13.85 so that is
the area that we got now if we want to
print a particular radius um we just say
print C1 do radius so this will print
the value of what is uh what is stored
in radius for the particular instance C1
now you might notice me using a DOT
whenever it comes to defining a certain
function or a keyword well anytime that
we want to invoke or use a method of a
particular class we have to use the dot
keyword so we use the instance name C1
dot followed by whatever method that we
want to use so if we want to use the get
area function we say C1 do get area if
we want to find out what is there in the
radius uh key radius variable of a
particular instance we say C1 do radius
now before we move on let's talk about
some of the naming conventions class
names are initial capitalized so if our
class name is um for example um like for
example if it's camel case well each
word that is part of this class has its
first letter capitalized variables and
Method names are in lower class so if my
class was called Circle we say class
circle with C being in capital now
moving on let's talk about how we
initialize or Define instance variables
now instance variables are declared
within the init method if you remember
from the earlier example of circle init
is a Dunder method it's followed and
it's preceded by double underscore as
you can see here now if you see in this
particular
uh case I have again used the self
keyword and as I I mentioned earlier the
self keyword is the first parameter of
all member methods um and it this
basically binds that particular method
to the particular instance itself during
invocation so every time a new Circle
object is created the dot init function
sets the initial state of the object by
assigning the values of the object's
properties so the init function
basically initializes each and every new
instance of um whatever of of our class
so we can give in it any number of
parameters but the first parameter must
always be a variable called self now
when a new class instance is created the
instance is automatically passed to the
self parameter in init so that new
attributes can be defined on the object
inside the init method the self. radius
basically means that we want the value
of radius based on the current instance
itself so as you can see radius defines
an instance variable radius and we're
going to use the particular instance and
it's value uh of for radius in our
variable radius now instance uh the in I
mean the init function is not a
Constructor but it is an initializer to
create instance variables the init
function also will never return a value
and it is optional and can be omitted if
there are no instance variables now
let's move on to um class variables so
now as we mentioned earlier all the
attributes that are created inside the
innit function are instance specific
attributes and the instance attributes
are obviously specific to a particular
instance of the class for example all
dog objects now if we have a class
called dog then all dog objects have a
name and age but the values for the name
and age will vary depending on which dog
we are talking talking about or
basically which instance of the dog are
we talking about now class attributes
are attributes that have the same value
for all class instances and we define a
class attribute by assigning a value
value to a variable outside of the innit
function so if you look at this example
over here we have created another class
called Circle and we have this
initializer again where we have a class
specific variable called radius uh which
whose value will change depending on
whatever we pass for that particular
instance however if you look before the
inti the init um init function or the
initializer function if you see here we
have another variable called shape
object which stores the uh string Circle
and this variable is going to be the
same and constant for every instance of
of uh the class Circle and unlike the uh
variable radius we will not have
different values depending on a
particular instance okay now let's talk
about instan shating an object and let's
see what happens when we create two
different instances of the same class so
as you can see here I've created an
instance C1 for class Circle and I'm
going to check its ID well if you see
the ID is something like this now if I
created another instance over here
called C2 and if I check its ID well
it's something different now so if you
see each instance basically has a
different memory location in our uh
memory um and each instance is this is
how each instance is different each time
we create it and they are created in
different memory locations finally
before we conclude this topic on um the
introduction into oop let's talk about
class methods instance methods and
static methods now class methods are um
usually declared are actually declared
with the um at class method operator or
decorator as you can see here it accepts
the class as its first argument so in
this case I am going to say I'm going to
define a class called my class I'm going
to use this at class method decorator to
say that whatever follows here is going
to be a class method and I've defined a
class method called hello that takes in
a um that uses again self and a name uh
attribute so what this does is it prints
um whatever I have uh pass to it in the
form of hello from um self. name now
what this this is going to do is
basically it's it's going to give out a
string saying hello from uh name of is
um called uh the string name my class
with a uh comma and then whatever we
passed initially which was rakes next is
the instance methods and these are the
most common types of methods um these
are invoked by an instance object so we
have to create an instance to actually
use an instance method and it takes the
instance or the keyword self as its
first argument so if I say class class
uh if I define a class my class in this
example um and I'm going to Define
another function called hello as you can
see I have not used any decorator like
at uh class method so this is going to
be an instance method and it's going to
be invoked by the particular instance so
in this case it's going to print hello
from and it's going to basically say the
name of the class again so I create my
instance called my instance one and it's
an instance of this class and then I'm
going to invoke the instance method by
using this do dot operator and the
instance name and the result will be
basically this string over here as as
you can see now finally we have another
type of method called the static method
which is declared using the at static
method decorator so a static method does
not know its class and it's just
attached to the class for convenience it
does not depend on the state of the
object and could be from a separate
function of a module a static method can
be invoked via a class object or an
instance object so if you look at this
example over here I have defined a
stating method um I've defined hello and
it basically says print hello world so
it's going to basically just print this
so if you can see here I created my
instance and I'm going to say do hello
it should basically PR print print hello
world that's all in this video we will
continue that discussion on oop with
inheritance inheritance is used to
describe the relationship between two
classes wherein one class takes the
methods and properties from another
class in this relationship we have
something called the base class or the
parent class from which we will derive
all or some of the properties and
methods and the class
which actually derives these properties
and methods is known as the derived
class so you can think of the derived
class as a specialized version of a base
class to explain what inheritance is in
a basic way I will show you an example
where I'm creating a cylinder class
which is going to be a subass of the
circle class that you might have
encountered in the earlier video on opop
so what we're going to do is create a
cylinder class that is a subass of
circle where we're going to get the
attributes radius and get area from
Circle class and we're going to add the
attributes height and get volume to the
cylinder so right off the start you can
see we have our class Circle that you
might have seen in the earlier video so
this class Circle has the familiar
initialization where we are supposed to
enter a value for a radius that gets
stored in self. radius and we also have
a description string which basically is
a uh Dunder method that uh returns a
string when we invoke the print command
on a particular instance and we have the
get area method as well now if we move
on to the cylinder class you can see
that I'm defining this class with the
class keyword with the cylinder name but
you can see that I have added a
parenthesis and within it I have
mentioned the name of the super class
that I want the cylinder class to be a
subass of so this is how we actually
Define a subass in the most basic way
you enter the name that you want and you
enter the name of the super class that
you want the subass to be a a subass of
in parenthesis right after the name now
next if you move on to the dunder
initialization um the initialization is
very famili familiar except now we have
another attribute for height which has a
defa default value of one just like the
radius so this basically means that we
have an option of entering two different
attributes for our cylinder instances
now if you see here there's a line which
says super do in it now this is like um
this is a command which we use to invoke
the super classes initializer so anytime
we create an instance for cylinder we we
also want an initialization for the
circle method as well as a part of our
cylinder instance next you can see that
um much like how we stored self uh I
mean the radius attribute in self.
radius uh we're also storing the height
attribute in self. height now even this
uh cylinder class has an Str Str uh
method to return a particular string if
we use the print function and uh finally
we get on to uh a more uh a new method
that we have defined only for the cender
class called get volume now um if you
see the get volume it returns as
basically the volume of um the cylinder
that is being described in the
particular instance for which we enter
the height and the radius so if you can
see here uh what we basically added
extra is an a height attribute and
another method called get volume and the
other parts of um the circle super class
such as radius and get area are also
going to be a part of cylinder even
though you do not explicitly see them
anywhere here and we will see how in uh
in the form of an example that's coming
up so let me just execute these classes
now that that's done I'm going to create
an instance for cylinder I'm going to
store it in cy1 and I'm going to pass
1.1 for the radius and 2.2 for the
height and once that is done let's just
print um to invoke the St Str method and
as you can see the Str strr method
basically tells us the information that
it's a cylinder with radius 1.1 and
height 2.2 so now let's print what is
the value we get when uh we use the get
area method now it's important to not
get area was not explicitly defined in
the cylinder subass but it's a method
that is a part of the circle super class
and we can see that we can actually
access methods that are part of the
super class simply by um accessing any
other method so if you use a DOT get
area you can see that we get a value for
the area of the cylinder so this basic
this area is basically the area of the
circle face of the cylinder uh the top
or the Bottom now let's use now let's
invoke uh the subass specific method
which is the getw volume method in the
similar manner as you can see just by uh
doing invoking this method we get the
volume as well now um if we want to see
what is the radius and the height we can
just do a simple print statement
followed by cy1 radius cy1 do height and
it gives us both of these values as you
can see here now over here what I'm
going to do is create another instance
of cylinder but I'm not going to pass
anything for radius or height so
basically it's going to take the default
values for radius and height which was
one and one respect itively so once I
print um this is this statement is
basically going to print the S Str
method or whatever we stored in the S
strr which is basically the description
of the object followed by what is its
radius and height uh this method will
give us the area and this method will
give us the volume so once I execute
this as you can see here this is what we
get and uh this is what we expect as
well so uh now in this example what I'm
going to show you is uh now I'm going to
go back and I am going to create another
instance for circle now this is the
super class of course and I'm going to
give it and since the super class has
only one option uh one attribute that we
can enter which is for the radius so I
pass 3.3 and I'm going to print what
what happens when I just print uh this
instance it's going to basically give us
whatever was uh a part of the St Str
method uh after that I'm going to print
is instance this is basically a check on
whether C1 is an instance of this class
Circle and next I'm going to check if C1
is an instance of its subass cylinder
now when I execute this you can see that
that um well this is what we uh this is
the Str Str method that gets printed but
if you see here um you can see that it
says C1 is indeed a an instance of
circle when it says true over here but
when we look at the next line is C1 an
instance of cylinder it says false and
this is obviously because um a super
class object is never an instance of a
subass object whereas whereas vice versa
it would be true now in the next part of
this video what we're going to do is
look at the different types of
inheritances in Python so there are
basically five types of inheritance in
Python there is the single inheritance
there's multiple inheritance multi-level
inheritance hierarch hierarchical and
hybrid in inheritance so we'll go one by
one and see each of these examples
starting off we have the single
inheritance this is simply where we have
one Base Class and one derived class
from That Base Class so this is a simple
single inheritance and in this example
you can see I have a class called
country where I have a method that I've
defined called show country which is
basically going to say print uh this is
India it's basically going to print this
every time we invoke this show country
method then we have a class called State
um which deres uh from the super class
called country where we have a method
called show state which is going to say
print this is state every time so you
can see I created an instance of the
class State and uh um through that
instance I can access the super class
and the uh subclass methods over here
next we have the multi-level uh sorry
multiple inheritance and this is when um
a derived class contains more than one
Base Class so uh let's look at an
example to understand this so if you can
see here I have a class called student
with uh two methods defined called uh
method one and Method two in method one
we can pass uh two attributes SN SN o or
I think this is this is supposed to be
like uh an ID I guess like SN number and
we have S name so this is basically two
attributes we can pass um that are
probably descriptors for a student and
um in the next method you have basically
uh two print statements which Says
student number and then they will print
the student number and uh it will also
print the student name um next we have a
class called marks this is also um so
these these two classes are basically
what our super classes are going to be
and we're going to derive a third class
from these two so this second class is a
class called marks and we have two uh
methods again one method is called set
marks which has um the option of putting
in two attributes M1 and M2 both are
representative of the two marks and we
store them in self. mark Mark 1 self
talk Mark 2 the second method is put
marks which is going to print the marks
um namely Mark 1 and then it's going to
tell us how much uh marks are there in
the first uh subject for example and
another print statement doing the same
thing for um the second subject or Mark
two finally we have a third class called
a result which derives from two classes
marks and student as you can see here in
my parenthesis I've passed in marks and
student both are super classes and our
class result is going to derive from
both of them this is an example of
multiple inheritance and within this
class result I have uh two methods uh
specific to this derived class called
Cal uh wherein I'm going to basically
calculate the two the total marks of um
uh the the total marks which is
basically the addition of Mark 1 plus
Mark 2 and I'm then I'm going to have
another method called put total which is
going to print me what is the total so
if you can see here I have created an
instance of this derived class called uh
result and I'm storing it in R then I'm
going to access method which is
obviously a method from the first Super
class called student um and I'm going to
store okay so this his uh name is I
guess lucky and he has 60 marks uh
secondly then I'm going to do our set
marks which is the method from the
second Super class which is going to set
the marks uh respectively so you have
lucky student and his ID is 60 and he
has got 50 and 60 marks respectively um
in say the first two subjects and uh
finally I'm going to access the derived
class method called CL Cal so this is
going to do the sum uh finally I'm going
to also do our method to which is um
going to print our student number and
the student name next we're going to
have put marks which is going to tell us
the um what are the individual marks uh
for Mark 1 and Mark 2 and then finally
we're going to print the total marks
with the put total so once I execute
this you can see here it says student
number 60 student name lucky Marks One
is 50 as I had written here marks 2 is
60 as I passed here and then total is
110 which is is basically 50 + 60 our
next type of inheritance is called
multi-level inheritance now multi-level
inheritance can be assumed as where you
take a super class let's call it a and
you derive a Class B from that class A
now what if you derived a Class C from B
and we kept doing this so until say
Class E now each of these steps is uh in
its own and inheritance but this whole
relationship can be described as a
multi-level inheritance so um let's take
an example again so this this time
defined a class called student where I
have defined two methods called set stud
and put stud or you can call it set
student and put student in my first
method I have options of adding two
attributes again this is the student
number this is the student name in my
second method I am going to print what
is the student number and what is the
student name finally uh so sorry next we
have another class called marks which
derives from the first uh class called
student U this has two methods called
set marks where I'm going to again get
the option of adding two um integers for
M1 and M2 um which is going to represent
Mark 1 and Mark 2 and finally I have put
marks the method which is going to print
Mark 1 and Mark 2 um finally I have
another class called result and this if
you see um this derives from marks now
if you see this relationship you'll
notice result derives from marks whereas
marks itself derives from student and
this is an example of multi-level
hierarchy and uh even as a part of this
third class we have have its own um
methods called Cal and put total um calc
will calculate the total as we had seen
earlier and put total will basically
print that total and we're going to do a
very similar operation we're going to
create an instance of this third class
uh result and store it in R um then
we're going to do basically we're going
to set the student details uh his uh
student number and his name we're going
to give him his marks 50 and 60 we're
going to calculate what are the total
we're going to say okay now put the
details of um what is the students
number and name we're going to also St
enter I mean display his marks Mark 1
and Mark two and finally we're going to
display the total marks so let's execute
this and if you see um it's basically
the similar operation that we did
earlier but the only difference is in
the earlier example I uh our third class
result was derived from marks and
student together um so this was an
example of multiple inheritance whereas
in this example the result class derives
from marks and marks itself derives from
students so this is an example of mul
level inheritance finally we have um
sorry not finally penultimately we have
um as our fourth example of inheritance
called hierarchical inheritance pardon
my mispronunciation it's hierarchal
inheritance so in this case a base class
basically will contain more than one
derived class so let's look at an
example of what we mean here so I have a
class called one where I have defined a
method called display where what I'm
going to do is I'm going to store self.x
is equal to 1,000 and and s. Y is equal
2,000 then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to print a statement saying this
is the method in class one and I'm going
to say uh after that I'm going to print
another statement saying value of x is
self.x which is going to be 1,000 U then
I'm going to have another print
statement saying value of y is self.y
which is going to be 2,000 finally um I
mean next I have another class called
two this this is going to derive from
class one as you can see here and in
this class two I have defined another
method called add and in this method add
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
first print a statement saying this is
the method in class 2 and then I'm going
to actually print the result of x + y
which is 1,000 + 2,000 finally I have
another class called uh three and this
is also deriving from one so if you
notice we have one parent class called
one and from this one uh parent class
we're going to derive two different sub
classes called two and three so this is
an example of hierarchial inheritance
now in this uh class three what I've
done is I've defined a multiplication
method what I'm going to do is print
first of all I'm going to print this uh
when I invoke this method that this is
the method in class three finally I'm
going to say uh I'm going to print the
result of x * Y which is 1,00 * 2,000 so
if you see I am going to create an
instance of two and I'm going to create
an instance of three and I'm going to
store them in T1 and T2 now since uh T2
I mean T1 is an instance of two so I can
access its methods add and I can access
this methods display so I'm going to use
t1. display and even it two uh T2 I mean
since it's a class uh it's a instance of
class three and this also derives from
class one I can also access its method
display but now I cannot access add but
I can access multiply so if you see here
I access add through T1 instance since
add is a part of Class 2 whereas
multiply is a uh is is a method in class
three so I access it in its respective
instance which is D2 so if you see here
now once I execute this what you will
get is basically um the results so first
of all it will basically display the
method from uh class one which is a
display method it will display the
values of X and Y and since I've done
this twice from two different instances
uh it will basically show a repetition
over here finally I've done the addition
and since this is a method in class 2 it
is going to say as much that this is a
method in class 2 and then it's going to
say x + y is 3,000 and now multiply is a
method in the third class so it's going
to say this is a uh method in class 3
and it's going to tell me what is the
multiplication result finally we have
what is called Hybrid inheritance and
this is a combination of multiple plus
multi-level inheritance that you saw
earlier so um let's again understand
this through this example so we have a
class called student where we have a
method called set student um again two
attributes we can pass here for student
number and student name next we have a
another method part of the class student
called put student so this will print us
the student number and student name next
we have a class called marks and this
marks inherits from student so uh we
have a me method in class marks called
Uh set marks where we can pass two
attributes for Mark 1 and Mark 2
respectively and uh as we had saw seen
earlier we also have a put marks which
will display the marks for Marks One and
marks 2 we have a class called practical
uh this practicle is basically a another
Super class if you see here since this
does not derive from anything it is
super class on its own and what it does
is it uh it has two methods get
practical um and we can uh has an
attribute for P1 here and we store that
in. P1 and then we have an attribute for
uh put practical which will print us the
Practical Mark whatever we passed for
this attribute in P1 finally if you see
we have a class called result now in
this result we have we are going to
derive from marks and practical but if
you notice here marks itself is a subass
of student so this is an example of
multi-level inheritance whereas since
result derives from marks and practical
book both it is also an example of
multiple inheritance so if you see
notice here uh this is an example of
multiple and multiple level inheritance
which is basically what we call Hybrid
inheritance and as we had seen earlier
this result class will have a calc
method to um do a total of the marks um
in this case Mark 1 plus Mark 2 plus the
Practical Mark P1 and we have a put
total method which is basically going to
print us the total so now we're going to
create an instance of this result and uh
through this instance of the result
we're going to first invoke the parent
class method called set student which is
the the second level parent basically
the student uh the student class um set
student method so we're going to set
student here we're going to say 60 is a
student ID and name is Ash then we have
set marks which is again the the the
second level parent which is a student
class um where we set the marks finally
we access this get practical now if you
notice get practical is part of um the
Practical uh super class so in this we
for the third subject of the the
Practical marks 100 then we calculate
the total and we put uh first the
student details then we put the
individual marks then we put the
Practical marks and finally we enter
what is the total so let's execute this
and if you notice you will see here
student number is 60 student name and
all the basically whatever details we
wanted um is shown over here in this
video we will continue our discussion on
objectoriented programming with the
topic of polymorphism now the term
polymorphism in oop refers to the
ability of an object to adapt the code
to the type of data it is processing
polymorphism is one of the key concepts
of python and it is also a built-in
feature of python an example to get us
started on polymorphism would be how we
use the plus operator we use the plus
operator not only for arithmetic
additions but we also use the plus
operator for stuff like string
concatenations or joining two lists
together this example where we able to
use the plus operator for different
different operations is an example of
polymorphism to to show you what I mean
I have basically done a simple addition
operation here when I'm adding two
variables number one and number two when
I do it on integers it basically adds 1+
2 now when I use it on two strings Str
str1 and Str str2 which contains Python
and programming two separate uh strings
and when I use the plus operator on
these you can see what it does here it
forms um One String containing both of
these individual strings so this is
basically the plus operator showing
polymorphism and it's one of the
simplest occurrences and yet most common
occurrences of polymorphism in Python
another example of polymorphism would be
through the lens function the lens
function in Python is something that we
use a lot and over multiple data types
depending on the data type that we use
the length function for we get a
different value or a different um sort
of information from the length function
now if you see here from this diagram
when we use the length function on a
string it gives us the length of the
string when we use the length function
on a list it gives us the number of
items whereas if we use the length
function on a dictionary it gives us the
number of keys so this is well another
example of how we have polymorphism in a
function now what we're going to do is
look at the different techniques through
which we can enable polymorphisms in our
code our first example that we are going
to look at is through method overloading
now method overloading in its
traditional sense where we can have a
method with the same name uh more than
one method with the same name in the
same class is um not exactly possible in
Python so if we have multiple methods
with the same name in a class in Python
which may differ in uh in types and
number of arguments are not allowed and
not supported in Python in fact if we
did something like this where we created
a method with um different uh with
different say types and number and
arguments but having the same name um in
the same class then what python will do
is it will only recognize the the last
defined method and uh it will um not
recognize any of the earlier methods
with the same name but we can simulate
polymorphism through method over
overloading by using default arguments
in a method now for example what I'm
going to show you here is an example
where I have a method called sum Now by
default it has three attributes that you
can pass through this uh method a uh
does not have a default value B does not
have a default value but if you notice C
has a default value zero so this is a
simple example where I'm going to show
you that the the sum method is um going
to be used in two different cases in one
case we're going to Simply add two
digits uh I mean two numbers and in
another case we're going to use the sum
method to add three different numbers so
we have this class overload demo within
it a method sum and I have three
attributes A and B are uh are have uh
are supposed to be given by the user
since they don't have since they do not
have any default values whereas C has a
default value of zero so if you see here
in my first case I have uh I first of
all created a an instance called over uh
an an instance called OD for the class
overload demo and uh I have uh what I'm
going to do is I'm going to store the
value of the sum of seven and 8 in the
variable sum now if you see here I have
not passed a third argument so what this
method is going to do is is going to
take the value of C as Zero by default
so it's basically going to do uh 7 + 8
and it's going to give us the sum for 7
+ 8 and in the next instance I'm going
to give three arguments 7 8 and 9 so now
c will be replaced by 9 instead of zero
and then I'm going to get the sum of 7 8
and 9 so in this this is not a very used
not a very commonly used thing uh but
it's basically a method just to show you
that we can actually simulate method
overloading in Python uh by using
default arguments so I've basically
shown you how the same uh how the same
method sum has been used to U do the
addition of two digits and then in in
another instance is doing the addition
of three digits it might look very
similar but you'll basically notice that
by having this uh third attribute C I
have a default value of zero I have
induced some form of polymorphism
through method overloading now the next
way that we can induce polymorphism is
through inheritance which is called
method overriding as well now method
overriding gives us the ability to
change the way or the change the
implementation of a method in a child
class which is defined already um in one
of its super classes now if there is a
method in a super class the method
having the same name and same number of
arguments in a child class uh then the
child class method is going to override
the method in the parent class so what
we do is when a method is called with
the parent class object the method of
the parent class will be executed
whereas if we call the method using the
child class object the method of the
child class will be executed executed
and it will override the method in the
parent class so the appropriate over
method is called uh is called based on
the object type which is an example of
polymorphism so let's look at an example
to understand this so we have a class
called person and we have defined U what
we're going to define the initializer is
two attributes which we have to pass
called name and age and we're going to
store them in self. name and self. AG
now we have a user defined method called
display data where we are going to print
if this display data has been called
through the parent called person um if
it's going to be called through the
parent class object then we're going to
print uh in parent class display method
and then we're going to print the name
and age that we have entered now we have
another uh class called employee which
is going to be a derived class on person
so it's going to um so it's also going
to have an in an initializer and this
Constructor will basically um what what
this initializer will have is it'll have
an uh Constructor for the super class
where we're going to do this uh the same
initialization that we do in the super
class but we're also going to store
another attribute called ID ID in self.
employee ID and if you see here we also
have another method called display data
which is the same named method from
person but now if you see in display
data I have every I have all the same
almost the same information I'm going to
print the name I'm going to print the
age but if you see the first statement
I'm going to say uh if I'm going to call
this method from the employee object
then I'm going to say in child class
display data method instead of in parent
class display data method to say that
basically I'm invoking this method from
the child class object and I'm also
going to print on top of the whatever
I'm printing before I'm also going to
print the employee ID so if you see here
I have created an object called person
um which is uh an object of the class
person with the information of name John
and age 40 and then I'm going to display
this now next I'm going to create an
object called M which is the child class
employee object which is going to uh now
have the same information of John for
the name and age 40 but now it's going
to have an employee ID and then I'm
going to store this uh in m and I'm
going to display the data for this child
class object and we will see the
difference in how the display data is
differing from the earlier earlier case
so when I execute this you see the in
the first case it says in parent class
display data method so this uh display
data has been called through the parent
class object and I'm only going to show
the information of name and age whereas
when I invoke this method from the
employee class object it's going to say
uh it's going to to specifically say
that it's a in child class display
method and then I'm going to say the
name age and also the employee ID over
here so this is the difference between
how display data has been used in its
parent and its child class and this is
basically the example of method
overriding now our next example of
polymorphism uh is going to be through
operator overloading and operator
overloading is the ability to overload
the operator to provide extra
functionality in additional to its um
real or core operation and operator
overloading is also an example of
polymorphism as the same operator can
perform different actions the earlier
example of where we use the plus
operator for different operations is an
example of operator overloading
polymorphism now when um when when is
operator overloading required well um
anytime you want an operator to perform
a different function for you in your
custom objects you would basically do
operator overloading now an example of
this would be what I'm going to show you
below so if you see this class called
point it has an initializer where I'm
going to store two attributes X and Y in
s.x and Y and S uh in s.x and s.y now
I'm going to create one object called P1
where I'm going to create Point uh one
and two so you can think of this object
as basically like a coordinate x
coordinate 1 y coordinate 2 this is one
point and another Point called x
coordinate 3 x coordinate 4 I'm going to
call that P2 now I want to print P1 + P2
all right now if I try to execute this
you will notice an error it says
unsupported operant types for plus point
and point this basically means means
that plus does not know what to do when
it's given an object of this type it has
no idea what to do whereas what we want
it to do is add the the the x coordinate
from this point and the x coordinate
from this point so we wanted to do 1 + 3
and we also wanted to do this y
coordinate plus this y coordinate or 2 +
4 and then we want to print basically
like something like 4 comma 6 or the
addition of the two points uh or the the
vector addition of these two points so
this is what we want this plus operator
to do but the uh python does not have
any inbuilt feature for the plus
operator and we are going to have to
basically do some operator overloading
to create a polymorphism on this so
let's see how we can do that so to do
that first of all we have to understand
that all operators in Python have
internally defined methods to provide
functionality for these operators the
operator or the special method to uh
provide functionality for the plus
operator in Python is the add method and
whenever the plus operator is used we
are basically internally internally
invoking the add method so uh these
these sort of internal methods that
provide functionality for The Operators
are part of a big a bigger class of
methods known as magic methods and these
magic methods are automatically invoked
whenever its corresponding operators are
used so if we want to change um the the
operation for um the plus operator in
this example we are going to have to use
the the add method in this case and
since it's a magic method uh magic
method are also are basically what we
saw earlier in the in the form of Dunder
methods so magic methods are going to be
invoked using uh double underscore uh a
prefixed and suffixed to it so similarly
to how we defined an init an init method
or an st strr method we're going to also
invoke the ad method using the same
double uncore before and after its name
so now let's see how we're going to do
this so if you see this class I have now
my class point and I have the same uh
initializer when I'm going to store X
and
now I am going to Define on uh this this
add magic method I am going to override
the the normal functionality of plus and
I'm going to give it a very specific
function where I'm going to say um for
two two different objects you're going
to add its uh the first part the first
part or its so-called x coordinate with
the other x coordinate and the y
coordinate with the other y-coordinate
and you need to return return this to me
in the form of a similar object so now
when I pass one and two and three and
four it should return me 4 and six as
you can see here I have basically done
what I wanted to do by operator
overloading I have changed or I have
overloaded this add this plus operator
using this ad magic method and I have
created a new functionality for this add
function for these two points 1 and 2 3
and four now I'm able to add 1 comma 2 3
comma 4 in the way I wanted to so now
that you saw how we did operator
overloading I'm just going to show you
um a list list of uh similar magic
methods for different operators that we
are familiar with so the plus operator
already we've seen has the add method
then we have the minus operator with the
sub method and similarly we have for all
of these operations such as
multiplication division we have its
respective magic methods these magic
methods are again prefixed with uh two
underscores and suffixed with two
underscores and they are basic they're
also called uh dunders in Python so this
is how we would do operator overloading
in Python for whatever operator we want
uh similarly we can do this for like
comparision operators and for unary
operators as well so look at this
example now where I'm going to overload
the uh multiplication or the uh asteris
operator so I again defined a point uh I
mean a class called point I'm going to
Define an initializer but I'm going to
store some attribute X and self.x now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
overload the multiplication operator
where I'm going to basically allow the
uh this ASX operator to multiply two
objects uh from like for example 12 and
5 usually I can just do a normal 12 * 5
but in this case my object is slightly
different my 12 is being passed through
an object of a class called point and
five as well in another uh instance of
the same class now when I want to
multiply these class instances like the
the multiplication operator does not
perceive these class instances to be
integers so by default it would not be
able to multiply what we want to
multiply but when we Define um or we
overload the multiplication operator
within our class it's now able to
understand what to do um using the
attributes of these classes in its
respective uh class instances so it's
able to say okay so I want this
attribute from this particular instance
B1 12 and I'm going to multiply it with
the attribute five from instance P2
whenever I say P1 * P2 or P P1 as P2 so
when I execute it it will give me 12 * 5
similarly I can also do this for the
greater than operator over here so I
have a class called person where I'm
going to to Define an initializer where
I'm going to pass name and salary and
store them in self. name self. salary
the um GT method is basically the
greater than method uh magic method and
it's going to uh we're going to use this
to overload the greater than operator
and now again I using this greater than
operator I'm able to basically say
object one greater than object two and
I'm basically able to check through this
and if object one is greater than object
two it will basically tell us if it is
true or false or basically whatever like
we want to know so basic the print
statement will check for object 1. name
and it will say earns more than object
2.n name if in case object one is indeed
greater than object two so when I
execute this you can see here uh my
first information says John has is
earning 4,500 of some units Natasha is
earning 6,000 of some units so it will
say uh John earns more than Natasha well
it's false because object one is not
greater than object two so um since 4500
is not actually greater than 6,000 and
this is the check that I'm doing by
overloading the GT operator over here
where I'm so where I'm returning the
Boolean value of uh what is greater self
do salary or other dot salary self being
the first uh object in any comparison so
in the if I'm basically any comparison
if I'm doing say if I'm doing 5 greater
than 5 greater than 6 so what the GT
will do is this will be the self object
and this will be the other object so
this is what I'm doing over here I'm
checking self do salary with other do
salary in in the form of these objects
object and it's basically the same same
way that we we are able to do 5 + 5
through these class instance objects
that you saw earlier or 12 * 5 that you
saw earlier so this is all examples of
operator overloading in Python in this
video we will be taking a brief
introduction into what is a function so
a function in Python is a group of
related statements that performs a
specific task or tasks now functions
help break our program into smaller and
modular pieces of code and it's very
good and very uh convenient to use
functions to make uh our code organized
and manageable especially as our overall
program grows larger it also helps us to
avoid repetition and makes the code
reusable so let's look at the basic way
of defining a function so this is a
basic function that I'm calling fuore
name all right now the rest of the
function or whatever the task is going
to be performed by this function will be
written over here with an indent of
course as a standard when it comes to to
python so I'm going to Define this one
something in triple uh double quotes so
don't worry about what this is right now
this is a doc string don't worry about
what this means and I'll explain it to
you just in a short bit all right now
now the rest of the statement the rest
of it uh will obviously be what this
function will do let's include a simple
print statement all right let's uh done
here let's call this so of course once
you defined the state function to call
the function you just have to use its
name like this this is how you call a
function so as you can see when I call
this function it should print the
statement hello now let's go let's uh
look at some of the uh like what
happened over here so we've used the
keyword DF to define a function we give
it a unique name which makes it uh which
with which we uh uniquely identify this
function um and also once we've done
this we um we can give it we can give
this function a particular header uh
it's called a dog string so what this
dog string is basically something that
we include in triple codes over here
just after the the def keyword and um
this is like a brief we can use this to
give a brief uh in give brief
information into what our function is
doing so we can say this is uh this
function performs addition this performs
um subtraction or whatever like some
basic information as to what our
function does so we can use a doc string
for that um of course this is an
optional thing this does not have have
to be we don't have to include this as
well all right but for the sake of this
let's just keep it here after that of
course rest of the function uh will
contain whatever task we want to do with
it and that will be indented um finally
we can also include a return keyword and
what the return keyword does is um at
any point you find the return keyword in
a function you immediately leave the
function and you go back to where this
function was called okay so now let's
see um now there's also one more
important uh component of defining a
function and that's parameter now if you
noticed over here within these
parenthesis I did not include anything
this is like an empty parenthesis
opening and closing what if I said a if
I included some A and B over here so
what this means is whenever I call this
function I need to pass two parameters A
and B these can be like strings or
numbers or whatever um but now it
becomes almost mandatory that I pass
these two things for my function to uh
to work so let's define a function when
I'm going to add a and b so instead of
this print statement let's do this I
create a variable C and in that I'm
storing A + B all right and then I
return C so you can use a return and you
can you can return certain like
variables along with the return
statement so I'm saying not only return
from this function but also give an
output or return an output called C
which is the addition of A and B now how
do we use this well now instead of just
calling the function like this I'm going
to add par I'm going to include
parameters so I'm saying Pass 2 and
three to function name where two will
take the place of a and three will take
the place of B all right what will
happen now is addition will take place
and we will get returned the result so
let's see what happens now as you can
see 2 + 3 and I got the the addition of
2 + 3 and it returned me five so yeah
this was like a basic uh usage of a
function and parameters so of course um
we can if you want to know like what a
what the docs string of a particular
function does or or says uh you can use
this uh particular you can use this like
um statement so let's say if uh so uh
it's very important to like just keep a
a note in your uh while you're going
through this or while you're learning
that uh whenever we use some sort of a
function which has double underscore
right this is like a buil-in a built-in
command provided by python um within the
python Library itself so these are like
buil-in commands to check certain
details so I want to check what is a
dock string and this is how I do it so
let's do print let's print what is the
doc string over here this is a doc
string so this is basically what I wrote
over here I can change this to this like
this does addition for example all right
now this will say this does addition
when I execute this line so this is the
way to check what is a doc string
anyways so now that you have seen uh a
basic um basic function or two basic
functions that I defined for you and how
we use them what a parameters is let's
look at another concept that we call
scope and lifetime of variables so scope
of a variable is the portion of the
program where the variable is recognized
all right now a parameter and a variable
that are um defined inside a function
are not visible from outside the
function this is a very key thing uh so
if we Define something within the
function we can only use it within this
function and we cannot like we cannot
use it once the function has already
been exed uted so as to speak um these
variables and these parameters uh have
what we call as local scope since they
are only um recognized within a
particular function now the lifetime of
a variable is the period throughout
which the variable exists in the memory
itself and um it's very important to
note that lifetime of variables that are
defined inside a function um are as long
as the function executes um once we
return from a function uh what whatever
we have defined within it are destroyed
so when uh we use a function um it will
not remember the values of a variable
from a a previous iteration of a
function call so let's uh try to
understand this example or this concept
using certain examples so out here I
have defined a function where I'm going
to create a variable
mycore V my variable and I am going to
store the value 10 in this and then I'm
going to print so whenever I call this
function I will always create this
variable I will store 10 and I will
print the value of this all right now
what I'm going to do is I'm not only
going to create this my VAR inside this
function I'm also going to create a
variable outside so you see there now
you might be confused as to okay how is
the behavior going to be because outside
the function I have created my VAR with
a value 20 but inside the function I
will always Define my V is 10 okay now
I'm going to print so my first what I'm
going to first do is I'm going to
execute this function that I created
initially where I store the value of 10
in myar and then I'm going to PR print
the value of myar that was present
outside the function let's see what
happens you can see two different things
happening so when I execute this
function it prints the value inside the
function as 10 but when I print the next
line which says um okay now get the
value of myar um it actually prints a
value of 20 and this is a very key
concept because What's Happening Here is
when I initially call my function within
this function it creates a variable
called myar and it prints a value as 10
and the moment my function has been
executed it destroys this variable and
um the variable which contained the
value 10 is of course now destroyed and
all we have is a myard that contains 20
from the outside and when we print that
we get its respective value as 20 so you
can also think of it like this the myar
that is present inside this function is
different to the myar that we create
outside so the scope of the myar within
this function is local only to this
function and once the function executed
that variable is destroyed all right now
let's look at a another case or the
other side of this case where um say
we're dealing with variables that have a
global scope how do we deal with them so
let's create a variable called myw all
right and I say I store 100 in this all
right now if I Define a function I've
stored my we let's say I Define a
function define underscore say again
same name where what I'm going to do in
this is I am going to print the value of
whatever is there in myw okay so let's
do print um value of variable is value
stored in variable is okay let's uh my
where so let's see what happens when we
do this let's call this function funcore
name see what happens here so as you can
see the value I stored a value in myw
and I've called it inside the function
and this is because since I've defined
it outside I can use it inside as well
now what if I try to change the value of
um this variable inside the function
though so let's see if I did this and
now if I try to print let's see is this
Allowed no it's not allowed in fact I
get an error it says local variable myw
reference before assignment um and
without going too much into detail what
it's saying is that the variable inside
over here is still local to this
function and I have not defined this
mayware as a global variable so I cannot
make changes to it within this function
right now and uh to change that I can
use a global keyword what if I did
Global over here so if I did Global and
now if I said okay Global myw and I
declare this variable as a global
variable now if I do this now if I do
the same incrementation now let's see
what happens when I'm trying to do this
you see I get the value 101 this is
exactly what I wanted and that is
because I've defined my variable to be a
global variable within this function so
I can in fact make changes to it within
this function so this is how we use the
global keyword and Global variable also
just to make a quick note um there are
three types of functions uh the three
types of categories in which we can
divide functions first one being
built-in functions uh these are the ones
that are built into the standard library
of python the other is user defined
function that is the ones which we
Define ourselves and the third type is
called Anonymous functions they're also
known as Lambda functions and this is
something that we're going to cover in a
separate video now let's talk about the
arguments that we pass in Python so
there are four types of arguments that
uh python userdefined functions can take
first one being default other one is
required then there is keyword and then
there is variable number of arguments so
the default argument is when say um if I
defined a function where underscore
sorry funcore name and I'm saying a
comma B right but what if um the user
has not um like say I I I want a default
value of a and b each time when I uh use
this function so in the case where if
say I don't pass a value for a and b
like this will always be used so I can
just say a is equal to 2 by default and
B is equal to 3 by default and then
within this function I will say C is
equal to a + b and then return C so I do
this and if I say funcore name and in
case I don't pass any arguments here
let's see what happens by default I get
the answer five because by default a is
two and B is three but this is not fixed
and I can always change this by passing
my own values here five and six and in
this case I should get 11 as you can see
here now the next type is uh required
arguments and when we are defining a
required argument we just simply do not
use the equal to sign for the parameters
over here and this basically um it makes
it so that now anytime we call this
function we have to pass something over
here so now if I try to pass like this I
won't get a oops Yeah I won't get a
default value then that's because um uh
that's because well there is no default
value and it needs an A and B so I have
to pass it a three and say four now it
should give me seven as you can see the
next type of argument that we'll be
talking about are the variable number of
arguments so let's look at an example
here so what I'm doing in this
particular example is I'm defining a
function called my sum where I'm passing
some parameter called my integers and
I'm doing something out here and what
this does is um it will take the values
of a particular like collection of
objects and that's called my integers
and each value I'm going to keep adding
it to each other and I'm going to result
a particular sum I'm just going to
result the sum of whatever is there so
in this case what happens is I'm
creating a list 1 2 and three which
contains 1 2 and three and then I'm
going to print the summation of whatever
is there so it should give me six now
the problem in this case is that each
time when I'm going to perform this uh
function I have to create a separate
list where I'm going to store these
objects but what if I did I do not know
like what exactly I'm going to pass here
what if I don't know if it's going to be
a list of objects or like what is it
going to be exactly well in that case I
can use a variable uh variable uh key
variable number of arguments so it's
like a variable keyword argument so what
we use here is um a specific way of
passing um keywords and we do it like
this so I say Define my underscore name
and I use an asteris now I give it any
name this can be args this can be
integers it doesn't really matter what
this is but it just this is the key the
asteris here and this tells us that
whatever we pass here is now we're
supposed to create an iterable out of
this and then we can perform whatever
task we want so let's just the since
I've already created one here let's see
how I'm going to use it in this case so
as you can see I'm doing uh I'm creating
a particular uh variable argument
function over here and I'm doing the
same task I'm just going to keep uh
performing Ed uh I'm going to add
whatever I pass over here but now when
I'm calling this function I don't need
to create a separate list as I did over
here I'm just passing all the numbers
that I want to in the form of like it's
pretty much like a tuple so I'm just
passing these numbers here and what this
function is going to do is is going to
create an iterable out of this and then
we're going to iterate over it as you
can see that's happening over here and I
can keep uh I don't need I can just keep
like uh so since I've done it for 1 2 3
and 7 the summation should be 13 in this
case I can add another number here just
explicitly just like this and you can
see the value will change and that's
because this is a variable uh this is a
variable argument um method of perform
creating a function now the fourth type
of function arguments is the variable
keyword uh argument so let's look at
what is the keyword argument now so I
have defined a function here called the
concatenate function and let's see what
I'm going to do with this so in this I
have passed a keyword argument I've said
that okay this is going to be a keyword
argument uh function and what I'm going
to do in this is I'm going to create a
blank string and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to add uh or I'm going to
concatenate certain strings that I'm
going to pass to this function so I in
this example I have passed Python and is
and cool and an exclamation mark all
separate strings and what I'm going to
do in in this function is I'm going to
join them together um and I'm going to
create one whole string out of it let's
see what's the result python is cool so
this is so of course like uh if I had to
add some something else like python is a
um cool and say I just wanted to say
hello and say one more string I can add
I can add it just like this I don't have
to like Define a fixed number of
arguments I can pass any number of
arguments I want and this works exactly
the same as variable in the uh only
differences instead of positional uh
arguments we're using keyword arguments
over here hello by like this it doesn't
really make sense but just to show you
as you can see so this is how we use
keyword arguments in this video we will
be learning about exceptions exceptions
uh errors that are raised during the
execution of a program um when an an
error occurs python generates this
exception that can be handled uh which
avoids our program from crashing python
has many built-in exceptions uh however
we can create many uh user defined
errors or exceptions as well to catch
whatever errors we're looking for in our
program so when an error occurs python
interpretor raises an exception and
stops the current process and it passes
it to a calling process until the
exception is handled and if this not
handled the program will crash um some
of the uh built-in exceptions are like
IO errors in the case when a file cannot
be opened or import error python cannot
find the particular module being import
important and uh there are so many
similar uh so many exceptions that are
built in in Python for the appropriate
cases now before we move on and see how
we raise these exceptions um let's look
at the difference between an exception
and a syntax error so for that I will be
using example where I will be dividing
something by the number zero of course
this is not possible so let's see how
python handles this particular problem
well it raises something that it raises
what we call a zero division error and
this is an exception that is built in in
Python whenever we try to divide
something by zero now let's look at the
difference between this exception and a
syntax error so this is the same
statement except I'm going to add this
extra bracket which does not make sense
syntactically in this now if I try to
execute this as you can see we get a
different type of error known as the
syntax error um when it says the
unmatched closing bracket so this is
what a syntax error looks like like an
extra bracket or a comma uh that
basically makes the line unreadable to
The Interpreter in the first place so
the the interpretor doesn't even get to
the point where it it needs to figure
out uh that there's something being
divided by zero it doesn't even get to
that point because it finds this extra
bracket and it uh cannot execute this
line at all so that is like the
difference between an uh an exception
and a syntax error all right now for our
first case of how we raise or how we
handle exceptions let's look at uh the
keyword raise so for this example what I
will be doing is um I'm going to take
this variable X all right and I'm going
to store a value 10 and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to check for a
condition if x is greater than 5 then
I'm going to raise this exception using
the raise keyword like this and in case
this condition is met if x is actually
greater than five I want this particular
message to play out in my uh exception
so let's see what happens when I execute
this as you can see the exception is
raised because X is indeed greater than
five its value is 10 and the metor
message says as so that X should not
exceed 5 the value of x was 10 so this
is an example of how we can raise an
exception and as you can see when a
condition was met the program comes to a
halt and an exception was raised now
let's look at another type of uh
handling exception where we use the
assert statement so when we use the
raise command we waited until an error
occurred and our program crashed Midway
right what if we want to check if a
condition is met and if this condition
is met then then the program can
continue but if the condition turns out
to be false then we want a particular
error namely the assertion error
exception to be thrown to us so we can
use the assert command in such a case so
in our example we'll be checking um
whether the system that we are working
on is actually Linux or Windows 32 so
let's see first of all let's import a
library called CIS this is the it's a
library which where we can access system
information one of the modules and that
is uh one of the functions in that is
the platform it basically tells us like
what system I be working on so we're
working on a win32 system okay so um
let's let's now let's use the assert
keyword all right now we're going to
check if Linux is what we are working on
and in case it is not then we want an
error message and this will be the error
the error will obviously be an assertion
uh error because we're using the assert
keyword so this is U how we use the
assert statement and if you execute this
as you can see we get the assertion
error because cy. platform contains Vin
32 and not Linux and so we got this
assertion error so if we change this to
check for Windows system we won't have
any error when we execute this as you
can see so this is the example where we
use the assert statement another way of
handling exceptions is by using the try
and accept block so this is probably one
of the most common ways of handling
exceptions in Python um where we um use
a try keyword and an accept keyword now
within the try keyword as you can see
here we have a chunk of code um which
we're going to check and if everything
is fine in the try keyword then this is
perfect so we don't need to move on to
what we call the accept part of the uh
try and accept block but if say there
was an error in the try block then we
move on to the uh except block where uh
we're going to run the part part of the
code in the case we find an error in the
triy block so first we check the CH the
part of the code that is under the tri
block and if if there is an error we
move on to the accept block and we run
that part of the code over there and
where we and in the accept block where
we that is where we handle our whatever
error ER that might get thrown our way
in the tri block okay let's look at an
example at how to uh use this technique
so I have a basic function out here all
right it's I'm defining a function
called Linux interaction what this is uh
basically doing is that when I call this
function I want to do an assert check
I'm going to check if Linux is the
system I'm working on and if it is not
then I want this error to be thrown okay
and um so yeah let's see what happens in
the case and if if this search statement
is actually passed then we will move on
to this statement so you look at it like
this if when I I mean when I call this
function it will first check for this
assert statement in case something wrong
happens and we get an assert error then
we do not move on to this line so we
only get this printed but if this assert
statement passes then we move on to this
line and we get print doing something
okay so let's see now I'm going to call
this function out here let's see what
happens here as you can see I get an
assertion error because obviously this
is a Windows system and not a Linux
system and I get this message okay now
let's see what happens when we use it in
a try and accept block all right so now
I have a try block over here in which I
am going to try the same this function
Linux uncore interaction if in case I
find an error I immediately jump from
the dry block into the except blog now
you see the slight difference in how we
handle this like what happens so as you
can see when we use the function
explicitly we directly went to what we
called an assertion error but when we
use a try and accept block we will not
use use the assertion error because we
are leaving the try block immediately
and we're going to go into the accept
block where the only thing we're doing
is printing the statement as you can see
we are not on Linux found some error
okay now what if we wanted to catch the
error within uh this function itself
which was the assertion error and we can
do that explicitly like this so now what
I'm doing is I'm going to try all right
and it's going to catch an error in this
right so now in the accept block I'm
going to say the assertion error that we
found in this function in the tri block
we're going to use that in our except
block so as you can see we're going to
print that assertion error it will
basically print this statement function
can only run on Linux systems as you can
see here function can only run on Linux
systems function can only run on Linux
systems and uh the next part of the
thing was the Linux interaction function
was not executed okay so this is um a
very this is like um this is a key
there's a key uh something very
important happening here when we use
this assert statement the whole program
is actually getting executed right uh
but when we're using the try and except
block we are immediately jumping on like
the moment we catch an error we
immediately jumping onto the accept
statement and uh however and all the
handling of the exception is done in the
except block and not in the tri block
anymore so we to uh think of it like
this that the tri block is only to check
if a particular piece of code is uh like
does it have any errors or not and in
case it does then every like all the
handling that we do is uh in the except
block of this uh particular statement
now let's let's look at another example
in this example I'm going to try opening
a particular file now this file does not
exist so I will be I will get a file not
found error and this is a built-in
exception and I'm going to catch that
and I'm going to print that error uh
over here in the except block all right
so as you can see file not found and
whatever like error I have I printed
over here all right so this is another
like this is uh a file not found error
that we're going to that we we caught in
our Tri block and we're handling it in
the ex block now let's use now let's
combine both of these examples where we
use this Linux interaction and we also
try to uh open a particular file and we
try to do both things in the tri block
and since both of these contain errors
let's see what happens when we try to
what happens when we have like multiple
errors in a tri block so as you can see
in my tri block I'm not only doing this
Linux interaction I'm also trying to uh
open a particular file that does not
exist obviously so now you might think
will I get two exceptions well let's see
what happens when we try to uh execute
this so uh it's important to note that
in our accept we have an accept for uh
catching a file not found error and we
also have an accept for finding um uh
the assertion error that that is part of
this Linux interaction function so so
since both of these uh are errorous
statements are uh they will throw
exceptions so now the question is will
we get both of these except blocks or
will we get both of these exceptions
will we get only one of them them will
we get the first turn so let's see what
happens so as you can see my error
statement is is very much like the
assertion error that I had that we had
done as part of this Linux unor
interaction function function can only
run on Linux systems the Linux function
was not executed so as you can see that
that is the one that has been caught and
for some reason the file not found error
has not been caught and this is because
this is a very important feature of the
tri block the moment we find the first
error in our Tri block we immediately
leave and we do not execute any of the
further statements and we jump into the
exceptions and we handled it using the
except blocks so the moment and error
was found in this function we did not
execute this part of the statement and
we directly jumped into the respective
exception that was the assertion error
exception so this is a key takeaway so
some of the some of the other key
takeaways when it comes to exceptions is
a tri Clause is executed up until the
point where the first exception is
encountered and in the accept clause or
the exception Handler we determine how
the program responds to this uh
exception we can have multiple
exceptions and we can differentiate how
the program uh response to each of these
and it's also very important to not use
uh accept clause on its own it's very
important not use a bare accept Clause
now finally before we conclude this uh
topic of exceptions let's look at the
else and the finally Clause so the else
Clause is used when we want to execute a
particular piece of code uh in the case
uh where we have no exceptions or no
errors found so let's look at this just
like we had the Linux interaction
function I'm going to define a win
underscore interaction and this is going
to check whether our system is Windows
or not in case it is not then we get
this error message all right and in case
it is a Windows uh it is a Windows
system we print this in the case of uh
when we call this function so let's
again use our try and accept statement
only in this case we will be using an
extra else Clause so we first try this
function in case there's an error we
catch it as an assertion error and we
print that error but if there is no
exception then we move on to the else
statement and we print this so as you
can see our um we have actually moved on
to the lse statement and we print this
line executing the else clause and that
is because we have found no exceptions
over here so again it's key to remember
that the else Clause is used whenever we
want to execute a particular statement
in the case where we do not find any
exceptions in the tri block the finally
Clause is used when we want to execute
something regardless of um whether we
have an error or an exception or not so
no matter if an exception happens I mean
is raised or if it's not raised we want
this finally block to always get
executed and let's look at uh how it's
let's look at an example of it being
used so I have this block uh where I'm
doing a lot of things the first thing
that I'm doing is I'm going to check for
this Linux interaction function which is
going to check of course whether it's a
Linux system or not this is I'm doing
the tri block now if I catch an error
that I want to be I want to handle it by
simply printing the error over here and
in the event that there is no error then
I will move on to the lse statement and
I will try U this particular block of my
statement which is again that uh when
I'm trying to read a particular file
that does not exist and it's very uh
it's it's very important uh that you
note that within the else block I have
another try and accept block and this is
perfectly legal and it's perfectly valid
in our program we can do this so think
of it like this I'm first trying this if
I have an error then I do this and I
don't execute this but if I don't have
an error then I execute this whole
statement which contains its own try and
except block all right but regardless of
whether I get an error here or not um I
will always execute this portion of my
statement or under the finally Clause so
let's execute this as you can see of
course the error uh is raised in this
try this Tri block so we move on to the
exception and that is what is printed
over here and uh after the exception is
done we move on to the finally we of
course skip this else blog because the
exception was actually raised so after
that is done we move on to the finally
blog where uh we print this uh
particular statement well that was it
for an introduction into um exceptions
in Python I hope you learned something
from this and um of course this is just
the beginning exceptions are something
that you will be uh that you would
probably encounter a lot especially when
you're beginning and it's something that
you will uh learn to extensively work
with and that will also help you improve
in your uh programming in this video we
will we will be covering the topic of
iterators now an iterator in Python is
an object that contains a countable
number of values or it's a larger object
that contains a countable number of
subobjects an iterator is an object that
can be iterated upon and what that means
is we can Traverse from each value and
we can manipulate or perform certain
functions or operations and tasks using
each of the uh sub objects or values
within this larger collection called
iterator now um when we're looking at it
technically an iterator is an object
which implements the iterator protocol
in Python which consists of the methods
iter and the method next so to begin
with let's look at a simple iterator
we're going to see the example of a list
where we're going to Traverse through
the objects of a list using the for Loop
so we have objects 1 2 3 4 and I'm going
to print each of these values one by one
as you can see here similarly we can
also do the same thing for another
itable known as the string where we can
go character by character again using
the for loop as you can can see here uh
another example of uh an iterable in
Python is um the dictionary so let's say
I have a dictionary we have two values
two key value pairs uh key X which
contains the value one and key Y which
corresponds to the value two now when
I'm going to do a for Loop through this
by default I will be traversing through
the keys X and Y as you can see over
here and of course um the other types of
Ables in Python are like sets and tuples
as well all right now let's look at um
what this iterating protocol is in
Python so first of all we take an
iterable it's an object that contains uh
it's a collection of objects that
contains subobjects and when we use the
iter function it uh creates an iterator
out of it so we can one by one we can
Traverse through um each of the objects
and we can manipulate each of the
objects that is contained in this and uh
anytime we want to um move to the next
object we use the next function and when
we have finally uh completed all of the
or we've manipulated or traversed
through each of the sub objects we
encounter the stop iteration exception
which tells us okay there are no more
objects to be manipulated or uh iterated
upon so an as an example I will create a
list where I will store the values some
simple values integers 1 2 3 4 1 3 4 5
okay um I'm going to create an iterator
out of this where I will use iter
function uh and I'm going to say this is
let's say this is called my my iter okay
and um I'm going to use iter function as
I had mentioned and I'm going to pass my
list in this now if you see what is my
iter it should say it should be a list
iterator at a particular memory location
now let's use the next function to keep
going through whatever is there in this
so of course the first object should be
one as you can see now when I look at
the next it should be three then I
should get four and now I should get
five as I use the next uh successively
now since I've reached the last of my uh
objects in this collection now the next
time I use this next function I should
get a stop um stop iteration exception
that is raised as you can see here so
this is the basic um iteration protocol
in Python now you might have uh already
gone through the for Loop video and in
that I have spoken in quite a bit of
detail as to how a for Loop performs
this um this iterator protocol and how
it creates an iter iterable object out
of say a list or a a tuple and how we
how it internally performs the next
function and it um breaks out of the for
Loop once it encounters the stop
iteration exception so um for Loops are
like they're very very uh similar to
your standard iterator and they use
pretty much the same uh protocol for its
functioning now um let's do a basic
comparison of what is a a basic
comparison between a generator and an
iterator in Python so in generator um we
use a function we use like we Define it
using the DF keyword and we Define it
under one function to create a generator
whereas uh in the case of iterators we
use two separate functions the iter
function and the next function um the
generator makes uses the yield keyword
whereas the python iterator does not um
in generators we save the states of the
local variables each time we use the
yield keyword and we pause the loop uh
temporarily whereas in iterators we do
not make use of any Loop local variables
all we need is an iterable like a list
um to iterate upon um we may use any
number of yield statements in generators
and we do not use yield statements in
iterators generators are not memory
efficient whereas iterators are very
memory efficient so this is like basic
uh comparison between generators and
iterators in this video we will be
covering the topic of modules in Python
now a module in Python to put it simply
is basically a python file that has
functions and classes written into it
and is saved with the py extension to
specify that it is indeed a python file
a Python program can use one or more
modules and modules can have one or more
functions they basically help us
organize our code and instead of having
one like one long python file we can
have several files or several modules
now modu of programming is the process
of breaking a large um a large event or
task into smaller and more manageable
subtasks and uh we call these subtasks
basically modules now individual modules
can be grouped together like building
blocks to create a larger application
there are several advantages to
modularizing code uh in a large
application and we will be going through
them right now so first of all there is
Simplicity uh because instead of
focusing on a big big problem or big
task we can break down the problem into
smaller smaller portions of modules now
maintainability of code is much better
through modules because they are
designed to create these sort of
boundaries or uh clear demarcations
between different problem domains um
there is usabil reusability uh in the
sense that once we create a module we
can use it in different parts of the
code or even different different
applications itself um there is also
scoping and uh what this means is uh
modules typically uh Define a separate
name space and uh this helps us avoid
collisions between identifiers in
different areas of a program functions
modules and packages are basically all
constructs in Python that promote code
modular modularization um you might have
already come across U or gotten an throw
into functions in this video we will be
going through modules and another video
we will also cover the topic of packages
to import a module we use the import
keyword and in this example what I'm
going to show you is a simple function
or a simple operation of importing the
OS module um this is short for operating
system and um as the name suggests we
can perform uh system tasks uh through
the functions and methods that are part
of this uh OS module so simply executing
the statement will import this module
onto our program for us to use now if we
wanted to see all the functions that are
present in a module what we have to do
is use the dir function so if we print
the dir OS function it will print us
basically a directory of all the
functions that are present in the OS
module as you can see here that like all
of these are basically uh names to
different functions that are part of the
OS module finally moving on another
function commonly used with modules is
the get CWD function and what this does
is it will give us the current working
uh directory that we are working upon uh
right now so if I execute this it will
tell me what is the directory that I am
currently working upon right now as you
can see see notebook dr/ temp if we
wanted to see all the files in a
particular directory what we can do is
use the list di function followed by
giving a path by default if we do not
enter a path inside the parenthesis it
will basically give us all the files in
the current working directory which in
our case is temp so if I were to execute
this it gives basically gives me a list
of all the files that are presently uh
there in the directory that I am
currently working upon now a basic step
is um creating a python module the
simplest way to create a python module
is basically creating a python script
with whatever functions and tasks that
we want and methods that we want inside
uh whatever module and saving it with a
py extension um so in in my example what
I'm going to do is I have already
created a script in uh notepad and I've
stored it with a pyx extension that
contains these four functions add
subtract product and division um I have
basically copied I basically used this
code and I've stored it in a py script
and I'm going to be using this as my uh
as as as a test module for this
particular example now how do we import
a module now once that I have created a
script uh in my example it will be
called my cal. py uh and we've sted
stored it in our directory to import the
module all we have to do is use the
import statement so if I had to import
my Cal all I have to do is say import
mycore Cal and now my calc has been
imported um so we can use the import
statement or if we want to import
something particular from my Cal we can
do from my Cal import um now we whatever
like for example if we wanted the add uh
the add function we can basically just
say only add or if we wanted add and
subtract we can say add and subtract uh
for example so this is basically by
using from we can say that we want some
something from something but only parts
of it we don't want everything uh we can
also use from myal import and we can say
asteris to basically say uh import
everything that exists in my uh right
now so this is another way of importing
something from a module now to access
contents in a module we have to use the
dot operator and I will show you how
right now so what I'm going to do is in
my example I'm going to import my calc
as Cal so now what this since this is
the original folder or the original
module but I'm going to give it a
shorthand name so that I can easily use
it in my code and I don't have to type
out myor cal every time so now I'm going
to import this as C so anytime I have to
refer to a particular method or function
inside this script or this module I will
just use this uh this uh placeholder
this variable name so now I have two
variables A and B and I'm storing 20 and
30 in them so my first fun what I'm
going to do is basically four operations
I'm going to print the addition of A and
B then the subtraction multiplication
and the division of these two numbers
and each time to do the this operation I
am going to use the add function that is
present in the my Cal module so to do
that I have already imported my Cal as
Cal all I'm going to do now is invoke
these functions using the dot operator
that we already familiar with so I'm
going to say cal. add and then I'm going
to pass these two arguments or these two
variables to say that I want to add
these two and similarly I'm going to do
it for subtraction um uh multiplication
and division as you can see these are
the results of my tasks now if I had to
do a directory uh operation on the
module C it will basically give me a
bunch of inbuilt uh or Dunder methods
that are already a part of any uh python
script by default such as builtins so if
I execute this just to show you what
happens when I use the DD function it
will basically give me all the functions
that are part of this python script so
these double underscores that you see
are basically uh denoting uh Magic
methods or Dunder methods and these are
like inbuilt methods as a part of the
script and if you see here add division
prod and sub these are the methods that
we we have defined earlier on in our
script ourselves now to go slightly
deeper or in more detail into what
happens when we do a module search um
let's let's actually look at what
happens so what happens is when for
example we execute the statement import
my Cal as Cal as we did over here so the
first the steps that actually take place
are the interpreter executes the above
statement and it searches for this
python script in a list of directories
assembled from these following sources
that you see here so it takes the
directory from uh which the input script
was run or the current directory if The
Interpreter is being run interactively
which is the case right now uh secondly
it will list all the directories
contained in the python path environment
that you set up um that you can set up
or you can change later on as well and
this format for python path is OS
dependent of course but it should mimic
the path environment variable that we
see in uh Windows systems then the other
source or the other directories is
basically an installation dependent list
of categories configured at the time
python is installed now the resulting
search paths that is accessible in the
python variable system. paath um this is
basically obtained from a module named
CIS so if I imported this CIS and I did
CIS do paath now these are all the
directories that we are going to look
for when we want to search for any
particular module so if I'm doing uh
import my or import OS it's not only
going to look at the current directory
that I'm working on it's also going to
look at all of these uh directories that
have been set up as U um you could say
directories or um Parts in the system.
paath in this video we will be covering
the topic of packages now what if we
developed a a very large application in
Python that contains many different
modules and we have so many different
modules that have similar names and
functionalities and they're all kept in
like or dumped in the same location that
it becomes very difficult to track these
modules what if there was a way to
organize and access these in a much
simpler and more organized manner well
packages allow us to do just that
packages are a hierarchical structuring
of the module Nam space you using do
notation and this is the same dot
notation that we use when we want to
access methods or functions that are
part of other classes or modules so
let's try to uh let's look at certain
examples to understand what we mean so I
have a directory called PKG this can be
basically treated as what we call a
package now in our package we have two
modules mod 1. py and mod 2. py and what
we're going to store in mod 1 and mod 2.
py are the follows so I'm going to
define a function called f and I'm going
to print uh this particular statement
mod one and then I'm going to basically
say FU um and then I'm going to say in
class Fu I'm going to have an empty pass
command similarly I'm going to define a
function called bar in mod 2. py where
I'm going to print this statement so
basically mod 1. py has a simple
function where I'm going to print this
statement and mod 2. py has a simple
function that I'm going to print this
statement um and I'm going to store them
in mod 1 and mod 2. py respectively and
these two modules I'm going to store in
the directly PKG in my local folder now
I've already done this so we can already
get uh to working with this now if I
wanted to access these particular
modules from the PKG folder I can simply
use the import command and use the dot
notation so I can say PKG dood one so
this will in this will um import the mod
one module from pkj folder similarly I
can do the same thing for the mod 2 uh
module from the PKG folder in the same
line so now that it's been imported just
simply execute this and this this
Imports whatever you needed now if we
wanted to um perform a function that was
a part of uh mod 1. py we can just
extend the dot uh notation and use the
function as over here as you can see it
performs this print command whatever it
was supposed to do similarly I can
invoke the function uh that was part of
the mod 2 module uh by extending the dot
notation to it in the same way now
another way that I can invoke um I can
import a package is by directly
importing the package Itself by using
import PKG and uh not accessing any of
the specific modules within it now let's
see what happens when we do this so just
for this example what I'm going to do is
I'm going to restart the kernel so that
uh the PKG modules that were already
imported uh get cleaned away so we see
what happens when we execute this on its
own now if you see I have imported this
now let's see if I can access uh my mod
one and mod 2 now if you see here it's
throwing me an error and this is because
using simply using the import command on
a particular package only Imports um you
could say the package name space but it
does not actually import any of the
modules and files that were part of this
package so if I wanted mod one uh from
this package I would have to actually
say import pg. one directly um and I
cannot simply say import PKG and uh
python will not import everything that
is part of a package on its own I have
to specify it myself um specifically now
I'm going to create and I'm going I mean
I'm going to show you another type of
importing from a package using the star
operator so I have this package PKG once
again now I'm going to store um three I
mean four different modules within this
package mod
111p mod 222p and I've already done this
so you don't need to bother about um um
seeing me doing it right now because
I've already created these files and
what I've done is within mod 111p I've
defined I've I've written this statement
and I've stored it in the python script
similarly I've created another scrip
script called mod 222p and I have
basically written this in the code and
I've simly done this for mod 33 3py and
I've done another for mod 4py now once I
have done this I've stored these Python
scripts into my uh into my package or
PKG uh package so now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create I'm going to
execute this command if you see this
from PKG mod 333 import start so once I
execute this now I'm going to say print
directory and print directory basically
will tell me all the functions that
exist in my current directory if you see
here there's this B function that was a
part of mod 333 module now if I change
this and if I imported mod 111 and if I
did the same thing you will see Fu has
now been added as a part of this dire
directory and these are all functions
that were part of these different
modules where I'm importing from and
that is what the star function does what
the star function will do is it will
basically tell python okay so the
statement is saying from from PKG mod11
so it's saying that um okay look into
this directory or this uh package and
find this module and in this module
import everything that exists inside it
up until this point so this is another
uh another way of basically importing uh
files or functions uh from a particular
package and a particular specific module
within that package so yeah this was a
very brief video on packages in Python
uh the conclusion being that packages
are basically a an organized way of
storing many different modules that we
might have created in a very large
application um and these modules can be
accessed using the familiar dot notation
that we have used in other examples such
as methods when we were working with
classes and objects in this video we
will be taking an introduction into the
concept of generators so python provides
a generator which is like a
function uh where we can create our own
iterator in a generator function we use
the yield statement instead of the
return statement that we use for
standard functions so let's look at a
simple Generator First of all so out
here I have defined a generator called
my generator where I'm doing uh like
there are three uh like three functions
or three tasks that I'm doing uh first
one is when I'm printing the first item
and I'm yielding a value 10 then I'm
printing second item yielding 20 then
I'm printing last item yielding 30 so
let's see how do we use use this now
since we know my generator is the
function it uses the yield keyword um
every time we use the next keyword we
will keep getting what is next in this
function so let's store um the generator
in my
gen so now we uh have stored the
iterator in this function variable
called GN or gen now let's see when we
do
next and we use gen
what happens so the first um task is
performed or the first it iteration is
performed where we get this the first
yield command is done all right let's
see what happens when we do next
again next
gen now as you can see we get second
item and we get 20 let's do it for the
next let's do it once more since there
is one more task uh there's one more
iterable inside you can see this now
valid question is what will happen and
if we do next gen again since there is
nothing after this well let's see what
happens we should get an error as you
can see stop iteration error this is
another uh built-in exception um that
happens when we have uh like reached the
last uh object of an iterable so we get
a stop iteration
error so now a key difference between a
generator and a fun function is that
when we execute a function the moment we
hit the return statement in a function
or when we execute a function like
whatever variables that were stored
inside are lost and they're destroyed
unless they were defined as Global uh
and the function is completely done
executing and we leave the function
completely whereas when it comes to a
generator when we hit the yield function
we don't actually completely leave this
function so the first time the yield is
found we get 10 but uh the generator
remembers its position inside this
function so the next time we use the
next we actually move on to the next hit
Tribble and then we move on to the next
hit Tribble so you can think of a
generator as it sort of has memory if uh
that makes sense it's a way to like
create iterables in python or create
iterators in Python so to understand a
what the difference between the yield
command and the return command does
let's take the same function all right
and let's put a return over
here after this particular the second
yield okay let's do the same thing we
say gen is equal to my
generator and let's start uh yeah let's
start doing next gen and seeing what's
there so the first deal will be standard
first item 10 the next one is again is
going to say second item and then 20 but
now if you notice there was a return I
put over here so technically when I did
the second next it's not only yielded 20
but it's also executed this return
function or this return statement so
let's see what happens if I do next
again as you see I have gotten the stop
iteration seemingly earlier than I did
before and that's because I have used
the return function and return statement
and what that's done is that um if we've
completely left this function so as to
speak and there is um nothing next so as
to speak so we get the stop iteration
and that's uh the difference between
yield and
return now in the next example I'm going
to show you how we use a generator
function in place of the for Loop or for
a for Loop so let's take this what I
over here and I have defined a function
called get sequence up to X and um what
this will do is basically it will keep
printing the uh printing numbers up
until
whatever we have entered in place of X
over here so if I said say sequence is
equal to Let's
uh copy this all right and say I want um
I want sequentially I want every number
up until 10 well not including 10 of
course because python starts with zero
right so let's do this and
um now let's see so the first number
will yield zero and now if I
did this
again should give me one two and I can
keep
going until I will stop at the value 9
as you can see
here so 8 9 now I should get the stop
iteration error because that uh we have
reached the end of our iteration so this
is a way of using generator functions
for four
Loops so another uh neat examp example
where we're going to use a generator is
um in the case of Fibonacci numbers so
let's use it uh let's uh see how we can
generate a Fibonacci series using um
generator so I've defined a Fibonacci
function called Fibonacci where I'm
passing Max so max is basically the max
value that I want um like up until where
I want the sequence right so uh this is
basically the code which will uh give
return me the subsequent values of my
Fibonacci Sequence so let's um pass this
to fib and see I want all the Fibonacci
numbers until 10 so in I will pass 10
over here let's see what happens when we
do next
FIB well it should start with zero then
when we do this again we get one then we
do 0 + 1 it should be 1 next number
should be 1 + 1 1 which is 2 then we
should have 2 + 1 3 and then 3 + 2 5
then 3 + 5 should be 8 now 8 + 5 is 13
and since 13 is greater than what we
passed for our max value here now when
we try this we should get the stop
iteration error as you can see in this
video we will be learning about the
concept of list
comprehension Now list comprehension is
it's a neat way of creating a new list
based on values that are already there
in an existing list so you can think of
it like um creating a new list uh using
a much shorter and cleaner syntax
compared to what you might traditionally
be thinking so let's go through some
examples and uh through those examples
we will see how list comprehension makes
uh creating these new lists much simpler
and much easier for us so in our first
example we will be creating a new list
uh which will contain fruits that
contain the letter a in their name so we
already have a list of uh fruits over
here as you can see it has Apple it has
banana Cherry kiwi and mango now we want
to create a new list which has only the
fruits that have the letter A inside
them so Apple would be one of them
banana would be one of them and uh mango
would be one of them so traditionally if
you look at this piece of code this
would do what we want to do but this
contains a few uh extra lines but yeah
it does it does do what we want to do
now what if there was a way of uh doing
doing the same thing by just writing one
simple line of code and that exists as
you can see here so I take the
same list now uh this is where you need
to follow so now my new list is equal to
so I'm creating a list over here as you
can see now within this list you have
this line this is what we call a list
comprehension so as you can see it says
each fruit for each fruit in fruits if
now it's checking for the letter or the
character a
inside each fruit and uh what this each
fruit is that we're checking each object
in this list one by one so first in the
first iteration each fruit will contain
the string Apple then in the next
iteration it will contain banana and in
each uh each iteration we're going to
check if it contains the character a and
if it does then we store that each fruit
in the new list as you can see here so
if I execute this line you see my my
result is the same I have my whatever I
wanted and this was a much cleaner way
of writing uh or creating this new list
let's look at some other examples now so
my next example what I'm going to do is
I am going to iterate through a string
so I have a string it can be anything in
this case I'm using a string called
human all right so I have a string
called human right now I want to store
each character of this string into a uh
list that we call hore letters so so if
I used a for Loop this is how we would
do it if I execute this as you can see
the list contains H and then u m a and
then n now what if I wanted to do the
same thing but uh by using list
comprehension so what I would do is
let's create a list over here hore
letters and um so as we know list com so
a list comprehension will uh it's it's a
you just basically need one line in this
case it'll just be like like
this now this is my
string now let's see when I check what's
in h
letters let's see what is the output so
as you can see I have the output as uh
what I needed so this is a much cleaner
way let's go through some more examples
now now we can do more list
comprehensions um we can even use so we
we've already seen uh one case where we
checked for the character a we've seen a
case where we uh went through where we
we did a sort of a loop through a string
we can also use list comprehensions in
conditionals so let's uh look at an
example where we use the uh list
comprehension with an if statement so
what if I wanted to store say the first
10 even numbers so this would so this is
an example that I'll be using so in my
list I want to store the first 10 even
numbers so this would be a way to do
it so I have in range 20 so what this is
going to do is X is going to take the
value of 1 2 3 4 and so on until 19 it
actually take it from 0 1 2 3 4 until 19
so when we do range 20 we're creating an
iterate an iterable where uh we're going
to Loop through or iterate through the
value of 0 to 19 so uh if I if I do this
and this what this statement does is
basically Al it checks if it's divisible
by
two so if this is equal to equal to zero
that means we have an even number and if
this condition is met if this condition
is met that means we store uh the X into
our number list so let's see what
happens when we execute this this should
contain uh 0 2 4 6 until 18 so this is
the first 10 even numbers as you can see
so this is a neat way of using IF
statement we can also use an IFL
statement so what if I I'm checking um
each okay so I'm going to create another
list and in this list I'm going to
basically see if um each of my uh num
numbers are even or odd the first let's
say 10 natural numbers so let's write
this statement down so I want it to be
even in
case the I that I'm checking I being
every number between so like say the
first 10 n natural numbers as I said
let's check if um if it is divisible by
two well if it is divisible by two of
course it's going to be even right
else we say that it is
odd and then we check for I in say the
first let's say the first
20 okay so now when we do this and we
check we check what's in the list so as
you can see the list contains like even
odd even odd is basically saying the
number uh zero is even then the number
one is odd then number two is even and
so on and so forth so this is uh uh an
example where we used the list
comprehension with IFL statements so
another neat thing that we can do with
the uh list comprehensions is that we
can use it along with functions so let's
look at this function in this example we
have a function called double X where we
Define this double x uh this double
function to take an input uh to take an
argument X and what we return is the
square of the argument so let's use this
in uh in our Li list comprehension so
what we do over here is that we are
we're checking what we're doing is for
every X um in range 10 so we're taking
the value 0 1 2 3 until 9 and we're
passing it to this function X and um
we're going to get the square of them
and we're going to store that in a in a
list as you can see here let's call this
list uh X let just call this list uh
just call it y so now let's see what's
in y when we check uh it should be 0 1 4
9 and so on so wait this let's check
again does this Square no this is
actually two times so let's make it
Square as you can
see so you can see 0 1 49 uh for the
first uh 10 numbers 10 natural numbers
now what I've shown you is obviously
list comprehension um but we can also do
set and AR comprehensions in fact set
comprehensions work exactly the same way
as uh list comprehensions the only
difference is the um set comprehension
will make sure that there are no
duplicates inside the set so you can't
have like duplicate items uh which you
can in the case of list comprehensions
so let's uh let's take just take a look
at an example so here in this example
what we're doing is we're going to check
uh so we have this string that we're
storing in the variable text Tex and the
string is uh something like life finds a
way so whatever this is now what we're
going to do is we're going to uh iterate
through this string uh character by
character and we're going to check if uh
there are we're going to check for vbls
essentially so uh we're going to see if
the character a e i o or U is present in
the string and if it is we will pass it
into our set now if you if you look you
will find there are multiple eyes right
and there are multiple A's as well so if
we did this through a list comprehension
each time that we find found find a vol
it would be added to our list but since
this is a set and sets do not allow
duplicates so you will only have one
copy or one particular object for each
of the uh wobbles so uh of course now uh
set comprehensions defined using curly
braces so let's keep that in mind so now
if I check what's in this I will see a e
i and u even though there are multiple
A's or multiple e or I and U's since
this is a set we don't have duplicate
copies of any copies of any of these uh
so this was just a small example for uh
showing you set comprehensions similarly
we can do the same thing uh this this
comprehension uh for dictionaries and
they we call the disc dictionary
comprehensions the only thing that we
have to worry about when it comes to
dictionary comprehensions is that uh we
have to define a key when it comes to
this so uh let's just look at an
example in this what we're doing is
again dictionary comprehensions are also
defined using curly braces just like
sets except uh in this case we will
Define a key and that separates it from
a set comprehension so in this case what
we're doing is that I'm checking uh I'm
going through the a list of numbers from
0 to 9 right this is what the range 10
function does and uh what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a key which is
going to be like 0 1 2 2 3 and the value
of each key would be its Square as you
can see here I'm doing I * I or just
to make it a little more clearer as you
can see I'm doing I Square over here for
every value from 0 to 9 so what I should
get is like a dictionary where the first
key is zero and the value of that key
should be zero as well because 0o uh
square is zero then for one it will be
one and then for two 2 4 and then 3 9
416 so let's see what happens as you can
see here this is the the result that I
wanted so just to summarize let's go
through some key points uh to remember
when it comes to list comprehensions um
so it's obviously An Elegant way uh to
Define and create lists based on uh
existing lists uh it's more Compact and
faster than normal functions and Loops
but we should also keep in mind that we
shouldn't write like very comp
complicated uh list comprehensions
because the idea of a list comprehension
is to be user friendly and also it's
important to note that every list
comprehension can be written in the form
of a loop but uh every Loop cannot be
written in the form of a list
comprehension and that is a probably a
very key point to remember in this video
we will be learning about the concept of
regular Expressions now a regular
expression is simply a sequence of
characters that defines a search pattern
for example if you see this example here
you can see a symbol called the carrot
followed by P and then five periods then
an n and a dollar sign and what this
regx pattern does is it's searching for
a seven letter string that starts with B
ends with n and has five characters in
between let's look at this example now
this is a regx pattern that is looking
for a five character string that starts
with a ends with s and has three
characters in between now if we had to
match this with this Str with these
strings as an uh as test strings the
first one would not match because it's a
three letter string and we're looking
for a five character string the second
one would match because it's a five
character string that ends with an s
starts with an A and has three
characters in between this will not
match because what our pattern would do
is it would find the first s and it
would find that the string itself starts
with an A and it would say okay there
are only two characters between this
first s and this a and it would assume
that this is actually just a four
character string to actually Identify
two consecutive s's we would have to do
something special and what we would have
to do is what we will see later on so
again this is the same example since
this is case insensitive capital a uh is
perfectly fine when we're searching for
this and it will also match this is um
this is obviously two words and it's not
a five character string so this will not
be a
match now the regx pattern or the
regular expression module in Python can
be imported using this statement import
R now once we've done this we can
actually use the our regular expression
tools and methods to do uh pattern
recognition character recognitions and
to identify different sequence of
characters in our strings Let's uh try
to understand uh a bit more in depth
about regular Expressions now so what
you're seeing here is one variable
called pattern which stores something
that looks like a regx and another
variable that stores our test string
called a
now what we're going to do is we're
going to use the match method of this
module re and we're going to check
whether this pattern um or whatever we
are trying to search using this regx is
in fact does it match with the our test
string and what we're trying to look for
is if you see here very similar to what
I just showed you a five character
string that starts with a and ends with
s so if you see our test string it
indeed is a match and when we use this
uh this command we should get a perfect
match so we should be basically it
should say that search is successful if
I execute this and this is what it does
now if I change the test string to this
now you will see that now this is no
longer what we're looking for a five
character string with a and start
starting with a and ending with s and
you will see that the search will be
unsuccessful as you can see here now
let's try to understand what exactly do
we mean by uh when we use the these
different certain these special symbols
like for example this carrot or this
dollar symbol um these are by the way
known as meta characters and now we're
going to look into all the or most of
the different meta characters that are
used in
reex so to put it simply meta characters
are simply characters that are
interpreted in a special way by the
regex search engine now here's a list of
meta
characters let's go through them one by
one now the square brackets square
brackets simply specifies the set of
characters that we wish to match so we
want to match some combination of a b
and c it can be 1 a 2 A's 3 B's 4 C's we
are not looking at a specific pattern we
just want to know if a b and c exists in
any form in our string so if we used it
on a the string a simply we would find
one match because the the letter a is
found here AC would match twice because
we have a and C present here in this
string he Jude we will have no matches
because a b and c none of them are found
here and in this weird string we will
have actually 1 2
3 four and five matches so we would have
five matches for this uh this bigger
string because we have five instances of
a b or c now let's use r e. match to do
to actually search for this and to uh
see if we have our particular whatever
patterns that we're looking for now in
this input string this is just some
example string um I'm going to test test
this I'm going to match whether my
pattern that um a any of a b and c is it
actually found in this so let's see what
happens when I use re. match for this so
the the format uh the syntax is simply
the regx pattern and then comma whatever
test string that we have
so let's see what object gets created
when we try to do this as you can see
it's none even though you might be
wondering like I can see an a over here
I can see a c over here re. match
actually gives us the result none now if
I try to do it on this test string which
is slightly different instead of the
film Titanic was released in 1998 what
I'm seeing here is all film Titanic was
released in 1998 now let's see if the r
match U works or not as you can see it
actually does get return When I execute
this it returns us an object called re.
match object with a span 01 the span 01
is basically telling us that we have
found a match between the zeroth and the
first character which is basically this
character a which is what it has found
and it's saying that the match is indeed
the character a uh from amongst these
options so what this is basically
telling us and uh what this means
actually is that the re. match method
will only find matches if they occur at
the start of the string being searched
once there is a space in in our bigger
string it will not search for whatever
comes after it so what happened in the
the first instance was it was actually
only searching for matches in this
particular word in my largest string and
since it found no match it basically
gave us the result none which was not
the case in the second example because
it found a match immediately in the
first letter A now if we want to
actually check the whole thing what we
would be using is the re. search as you
can see here the re. search method will
actually check the whole string and uh
it will return us the first instance
where it finds a match now let's see
this is a test string now and we're
searching again for our we're searching
for a b and c any any of these um in our
test string but we're going to use re.
search and not match so now if you see
it returns us when I execute this it
returns us a match object again but this
time it's saying the span of 9 and 10
now the span span of 9 and 10 actually
exists over here this is the ninth
character and a itself is the 10th
character over here so what this
basically is telling us that the 10th
character is where we found a match
which was the letter A which was the
first instance of either A or B or C in
this whole string and this is basically
how re. search works it will not only
search the beginning of the string but
it will search the whole string and
return us the first instance of wherever
we find now what if we wanted to find
out all the instances wherever a b and c
were found and not just the first
instance well in that case we would be
using the method find all over here so
when we use find all it will actually
return us each and every case where it
found a a b or c and you might not it
won't tell you the exact position but it
will tell you like um so if I execute
this you can see it gives us a a list
with a C A and A and what this basically
means is it was looking for the
characters A or B or C and it found a
first and hence this for the first item
the list then it found a c and then it
found two A's successively so this is
exact this is actually how find all
works where it will actually find all of
the instances of our regex pattern now
that you've seen how the square brackets
work and how the re do search and re do
match and re. find all methods work now
we're going to go through all the other
met meta characters that we saw above so
the period now a period matches any
single character except the new line new
line is basically SL end or a break now
if you look at this picture what it's
going to do is um a this expression
basically saying that uh do we have um
two characters like sets of two
characters in our string so this is a
single character string and obviously a
single character string is not a double
character string and this expession this
double dot is basically uh asking us do
we have two characters present in our
string so if I had to match it with this
a it will obviously be a no match
because a is one character if we checked
it with a it is a match because A and C
are two characters A and D will also
give us only one match because it will
find AC and then it will leave d as a
single character but when we check a c d
and e or this string in particular it
will find two matches because it will
consider a and C as one of the matches
and d and e as one of the matches So
Below is basically what we're doing
basically the same thing we're just
using rd. search for each of these
different examples so if I if you see
when I use find all on acde and when I'm
searching for a two character match you
will see that it will return me AC and
de as you can see here and similarly for
something like this it will return me
again uh whatever like two character
patterns it find
successively so the next symbol the next
meta character is the carrot symbol that
you've seen earlier and the carrot
symbol is basically used to check if a
string starts with a certain character
so if you look at these two this picture
we have two two expressions that we're
going to check over here one is the uh
one is checking if a is the beginning of
a string and the other one will check if
a uh is the beginning of the string but
is it followed by b or
not so when we check this what you can
see is the first string will be a match
because it's the only the character a
and it will match here as well because
this string starts with a but it will
not match here because this string
starts with B now if I look at this
particular expression you can see that
um this is going to search for if the
string starts with a and is followed by
a b so it will match in this case
because it does start with a and is
followed by a b but it will not match in
this case even though it starts with an
A because it's not followed by a b so
out here is basically us using the i.
search to basically find these patterns
the next symbol that we will come across
is the dollar symbol so the dollar
symbol that you can see here is used to
check if a string ends with a certain
character and we've already seen how
this is used in one of the uh one of the
earlier examples so this is going to
check basically if so this expression
will check if the string ends with a so
this uh this string is basically the
character a so it will match this also
ends with a so it will match and this
particular string does not end with a so
it will not match and we are going to do
that using the re. search over here so
as you can see it finds a match in the
first character itself here in this case
it finds a match in the last character
but in C there is no match so it returns
us a none another example is of the meta
characters is star so this is the symbol
for star and uh this what the star
basically is used is for checking if
there are zero or more occurrences of
the pattern to the left of it so now if
you see here what this will check for is
um is there any form of
M and A that occurs before n and it's
very important to note that the N has to
follow the a in this case so let's look
at these examples and what will happen
so if I checked it with M and N this is
actually a match because n is followed
by zero occurrences of M and A which is
if it might seem a little weird but it
is technically the truth because uh the
the star symbol checks for not doesn't
check for the Existence it just checks
for with n occurs it must occur after an
A or the a should not be there itself in
this particular string so as you can see
here the N occurs after an m and it's
fine because there is no a now you will
see when it will not work so M A and N
is obviously fine m a uh mle a n is also
fine because n follows an A and there's
an M here this however main will not
match now why even though we have M and
A and we have an N you see the N is
immediately followed by an I is n
follows an I immediately or the N is
preceded by an I immediately and this is
a no match because our the strict
condition in the search is that n must
uh proceed an a if the a exists again in
woman it will match because n follows an
a over here we're just going to use the
re. search for the these examples that
we saw saw over here in terms of code
using the ar. search as you can see here
finally we have the next meta character
which which is the plus symbol yes so
the plus symbol matches one or more
occurrences of the pattern left to it
now this is very s similar to what we
saw earlier in terms of the star except
now in the plus the key difference is
we're looking for one or more
occurrences instead of zero or more
occurrences that we were looking for in
the case of star so when we say one or
more occurrences now we need what is
there to the left of the plus sign at
zero uh no occurrence of it will not be
allowed or will not cause a match so
let's see now what we're going to do
here we're going to use the same
expression except we're going to replace
the star with a plus sign so now what
we're going to say is okay we need M and
A at least one occurrence followed by an
N the all of these conditions have to be
met so again if you took the first
example M and N this time it will be a
no match because there's no occurrence
of an a over here for preceding the N so
it's a no match Ma A and N is a match
because well this is this is perfectly
fine m a and N is also perfectly fine
but if you look at m a i and N much like
earlier the N is preceded by an i and
not an A so there is no match and again
woman is perfectly fine and we basically
execute the same thing through the
search function in this piece of code
the next meta character is the question
mark the question mark symbol matches
zero or one occurrences of the pattern
to the left of it so let's see what this
does so now we saw the star the star
which was Zero or more occurrences of
the pattern to the left of it we saw the
plus which is one or more occurrences of
the pattern to the left of it now we
will see the question mark which is zero
or one only zero or only one and not
zero or more or one or more which was
the previous cases only zero and one or
or one occurrences of the pattern to the
left of it again we're going to see the
same expression except we're going to
replace the meta character with the
question mark So now let's see what what
happens when we match so if you see here
M and N is a match because there is zero
occurrence of a and one occurrence of M
preceding n so this is fine this is also
fine because there is one occurrence of
A and M and then it's followed by an N
this will not be fine because now we
have three occurrences of a which is
followed by an N we're only looking for
zero or one this again main will be a no
match for the same reasons that we have
already gone through and woman will be a
match again for the same reasons and we
we do the same thing using the search
function in this piece of code the next
meta character is the braces character
now the braces character is interesting
because what we're going to do is we're
going to see if there are so uh the the
typical Syntax for a braces is n brace
followed by some integer n comma integer
M and then closed braces so what this
means is we're looking for at least n
and at most M repetitions of the pattern
left of the braces let's see uh through
an example if you see this expression
we're looking for at least two and at
most three occurrences of the the
character a in our test strings so let's
see what happens in the first case we
have no matches in this case because
this part of the string contains only
one a and even this part of the string
only contains one a we looking for at
least two and at most three this part
will contain one match the second the
second example because the second part
of the string actually contains two A's
for one two repetitions of a cons
consecutively but this this uh in and
and in the third example you can see
both the strings actually contain
matches so we get two matches because as
you can see here there's two A's here
followed by Three A's here now when we
look at this particular string let's
look at what happens now so what we're
going to find is that this thing is
perfectly fine so we have two
occurrences of a but now we have four
occurrences of a but what the search
engine is going to recognize is these
first three A's and it's going to see
okay so there are three occurrences of a
and I already have a match it's not
going to consider this fourth a in the
search it will just look at the first
three and it say okay there are uh Three
A's and my my match is fine so again
there are two matches in this case again
if we're going to use the search
function initially and you can see each
in each of the cases there is a match
except for the first case which is this
case now let's see the find all option
and uh see what happens when we do the
same thing using findall so when we use
findall it basically gives us each of
the instances where the match has
occurred in each of these lists now
let's try to use a slightly more uh
complicated example where we combine
different let's say different meta
characters and we create a a more
sophisticated expression that we want to
search in our test strings so if you
look at this expression what we're
looking for is 0-9 now a dash symbol is
valid in Python using regx because what
this basically tells it is that it's
looking for either 0 1 2 3 4 so on until
9 basically any of the digits we looking
for any of the digits from 0 to 9 and we
are going to uh check if at least two
and at most four occurrences of digits
if they are there or not in our
particular code so let's see what are
the matches that happens when we use it
on test strings so if you use it on this
string you can see It'll find one match
this basically this uh particular part
of the string where it says 1 2 3 so
this is uh three occurrences of digits
so it's fine now when we look at this
whole string 12 and whatever this is you
will see this will not find a match here
this obviously will not because these
are characters but if you look at this
part it will find matches in terms of
the first four and then seven and three
the next two one and two again there are
no matches because there's only single
occurrences of digits we're looking for
at at least two and at most four so if I
use a find all you will see like what
all it will return so for the first test
string what is going to return me is
it's going to return me 1 2 and three as
you can see here but now if you look at
this test string it's going to return me
12 it's going to return Me 3 4 5 and 6
it's going to return Me 3 4 1 and 2 but
not 7 because we're looking for at least
two and then it's going to return me 4 5
6 and 7 followed by 8 and 8 as you can
see in this list over here now if we use
curly braces with only one digit it's
basically telling the search engine that
uh we want exactly so many repetitions
of the preceding uh whatever expression
that we have so when we do this example
for uh for example we're basically
saying that we want
uh X followed by a dash and the dash has
to occur at least three times in our
particular expression and then it should
be followed by an X again which will not
match in this case because there are
only two dashes and it will match in
this case because there are exactly
three dashes and it will again not not
match in this case because there are
four
dashes as you can see here none followed
by an object match followed by none next
we move on to the alternation um the
alternation meta character and as the
word suggest alternation is basically
looking for some alternate form of A and
B so a should be followed by B and uh
basically this pattern has to keep going
on so in the first string over here this
pattern will not match in the second
string over here uh we will have a match
because we at least find an a even
though there is no B but this is still
considered a match because we did find
an a at least over here we'll have uh
three matches because we have a followed
by a b followed by an a again so uh if
we did a reg expression for this we
would basically find these many matches
for each of these
examples the next meta character is the
group now a parenthesis is basically
used to group subpatterns so let's look
at an example to understand what we mean
now if you look at this complicated
expression what this means is that I
want some form of x and z the x and z
have to occur together but before that
what I want is some form of a following
B following C some sort of alternation
between a b and c so this part as you
can see see here is kept in a
parenthesis because I want this whole
condition to basically occur before I
find an x and z so let's look at what
happens here in the first case we don't
have a match because the this basically
this parenthesis condition is not being
met we x and z is preceded by a space or
basically the A and B is preceded is
followed by a space so the if the space
didn't occur we would actually find a
match as you can see in the next example
here you can see A and B occur basically
this uh initial condition is is met
followed by x and z so there is one
match so it's fine for us now if you
look at this S Mode trickier one what
you can see is we have two matches in
this case first an a followed by x and z
and then we have C A and B now this is
perfectly fine because we we are looking
for a b followed by an x and z we're
looking for either of these things we're
looking for some form of alternation of
these things followed by an x and z and
we can get that over here we get B
followed by an X andz so you'll get two
matches in this case now let's go
through the concept of grouping
constructs now that you've seen many
meta characters you've seen how
parenthesis Works let's look at grouping
constructs so grouping constructs break
up a regx in Python into sub expressions
or groups and this serves two purposes
one is the grouping part which basically
says that a group represents a single
syntactic entity and any additional meta
characters apply to the entire group as
a unit and then there's the capturing
part which basically tells us that some
grouping constructs also capture the
portion of the search string that
matches the sub expression in the group
you can retrieve captured matches later
through several different mechanisms so
let's look at basically what we mean by
this example over here so if you see
this this expression has a plus sign so
we're looking for uh as you know a plus
looks for one or more occurrence so this
will basically check for one or more
occurrence of the character R only
because there's no parenthesis as in
this example so this plus is next to an
r and it's going to check for basically
whether one or more occurrence of R
happens preceding b and a but if we
actually put B A and R in a parenthesis
followed by plus it will actually check
for the entire string B and it will
check one or more occurrences of B
together so if you look at the these two
examples when we use this uh on these
examples you can see that these are fine
like these matches are fine but if I
used this uh parenthesis then these
would be the acceptable matches and like
ba a tri would not be a match if I use
parenthesis as you can see here so this
is how grouping constructs work and how
parenthesis work so look look at some
other examples so what this will do is f
o has to be optionally followed by B A
and B a r must exist to together and um
this is because we have a question mark
here this question mark symbol tells us
that there should be zero or one
occurrences similarly this particular
complicated expression is checking for
one or more occurrences of whatever we
saw earlier basically this whole thing
is followed by a plus so we're looking
for this whole sequence for one or more
occurrences of it C W is simply just C
we're looking for this pattern and this
is going to check for zero or one
occurrence of C because of the existence
of the question mark for preceded by the
parenthesis in this video we're going to
continue our discussion on regular
Expressions now that you know the basics
of regular Expressions let's continue
our discussion with special sequences
now in an earlier video on strings you
might have encountered what is an escape
sequence and how we use the backs slash
character to generate these Escape
sequences and an escape sequence is
basically if you remember something that
we use to either give certain special
meaning to characters that are otherwise
ordinary or it is used to remove the
special meaning that are inherently
present in certain characters that we
call Meta characters so let's look at
what special sequences are in relation
to regular Expressions so the first one
we're going to look at is the back SL
capital A which is used to match if
specified characters are at the present
are present at the start of a string so
out here if you can see we are checking
if the word d is present in these two
strings so we would get a match in the
first case over here because this starts
with the word the but in the second case
we won't get a match and this is how
we're going to check it for the the same
thing using the find all function so if
you see in the first case it gives us it
returns us an object because we do find
the in the beginning of the string in
the second case we get us empty list
because this string does not start with
the word the now the next one that we'll
look at is back SLB small B now this is
used to match if specified characters at
the beginning or at the end of a word so
when you use back/ small B and then you
follow it up with whatever you're
looking for it would look for the that
particular those particular characters
or that pattern if it exists in the
beginning of a word in a string so if
you look at the first example it starts
with f o and in the second example you
see this portion of the string or this
word is actually also starting with f o
so it will also match however in this
string which is very similar to the
second one we don't have a space between
a and F and it's basically one word so
this does not start with f o but it
actually starts with afo and it won't
match as you can see here now similarly
if we wanted to check if something
exists in the back of a string at the
end of a string we type what we want to
search for first and then we follow it
with a back slash small B and then if
you see here it will match in this first
case it will match in this second case
because this part of the string ends
with f o but it will not match in this
case because well we remove this space
so now this whole thing becomes a uh the
string that we're looking for and it
does not end with F anymore and this is
basically us just checking it through
the find all function now the next ESC
the next special sequence that we will
be looking at is the/ capital B which is
basically the opposite of what we just
saw this matches only if the specified
characters are not at the beginning or
the end of a word so if you see here
this is checking if f o is not at the
beginning of these strings so in this
case there will be a no match in this
case also there will be a no match and
this third case there will be a match s
similarly if we wanted to see if
something does not end with a particular
string we would type that whatever
pattern we're looking for followed by a
back/ capital B and then we can use the
find all function to generate us lists
wherever we find such objects uh find
such matches in our particular test
strings like we have done over here so
the next one that we're going to look at
is the back slash small D and this
matches any decimal digit which is
equivalent to doing a square brackets
0-9 as you seen you must have seen ear
so if we did a square bracket 0-9 and if
we did a search or a find all or a match
it would look for any of the digits
between 0 and 9 so a similar thing can
be done using a special sequence back/
small D so as you can see there will be
three matches in this case because 1 two
and three digits exist whereas in this
case for the word python there will be
no matches so these are certain examples
where we are doing the same thing using
the back/ D now we have another one
which is the back/ capital D and this
just basically the opposite it it
matches for any non-decimal digits it's
also equivalent to typing a carat inside
uh square brackets with 0-9 which if you
remember from the previous video is
basically asking us to check for
anything that is not uh the digits 0 to
9 so this is basically we're going to
check in these two strings if there is
no digits and no non-decimal digits so
if you see here we we we will find three
matches a b and the uh double double
inverted commas and in the second string
we will find no matches because this is
fully just digits next we have back SL
small s now this is matches where a
string contains any wh space character
so this is equivalent to doing a uh
check for all of these so this is like
back SL small T is a check for tab space
back SL small N is a check for brake
line and then back SLR black slf back
SLB uh are are their own uh checks for
different sorts of whites space
characters that you can see by just
looking it up honestly but yeah so if
you simply do a back slash S it would
actually be the equivalent of searching
for any of these uh White space wh space
characters that we generate so if you
see here when we do a back slash S on
this string you can see that there is
one space over here so it will match it
will give us one match because there is
one white space which is just the normal
space here and in the second example
there is no match because there is no
white space here similarly SL capital s
now as you might have noticed is
basically checking for a string which
does not matches in a string wherever
there is no Whit space characters so
it's basically the same as doing carat
/t/ n/ r/f SLV in a square brackets so
this is basically a simpler way of doing
uh the same thing using square brackets
and a carot symbol so if you see this
expression back/ capital S now we're
looking at uh a space b so over here if
you see it will match for all the nons
spaces so it's going to match for a and
b so we're going to get two matches here
whereas an empty string does not contain
well it does not contain any
non-whitespace character since an empty
string is basically a whites space
character on its own so this will be
this will give us a no match so the next
special sequence that we're going to
look at is the back/ small W uh this
matches any alpha numeric character
which is the equivalent of doing a to z
in small and then capital A to Z and 0
to 9 follow and also an underscore check
in square brackets um it's Al it's
important to note that the underscore is
considered an alpham minic character
hence why we include it over here but
yeah this is the back slw small W which
basically checks for uh any alpha
numeric character and matches it in a
string so if you see in this first case
um it will find three matches at one two
and also at the letter c these others
are not alpha numeric characters whereas
in this string none of these are alpha
numeric characters so we will get no
match again much like the other examples
there is a capital there's a back/
capital W which will check for any
non-alpha numeric character and it's the
equivalent of doing whatever we did
before in uh in the square brackets just
with a preceded by a carot sign so if
you see here we have this string where
we have a bunch of characters well yeah
only one of them this uh percentage
symbol is a non-alpha numeric character
so we will get one match over here but
in this case in this string python we
will get no matches because they are all
alpha numeric characters we're just
doing the same thing here with a bunch
of different examples using the find all
function now the back slash capital Z
matches if the specified characters at
the end of a string now don't confuse
this with uh back slash small B because
the back/ small B checks for a string
and it checks each and every word in the
string individually and checks if uh if
any of the words ends with a particular
thing or or starts with a particular
thing but it checks each word
individually but in this case back SL
capital Z will check the string only and
not each word so if you see the
difference here in um when you use
capital back/ capital z
um it will match in this first example
but it won't match for the next two but
if you used a um back slash small B over
here it would actually match not only in
the first example here but it will also
match in the second example because it
would check this word individually and
it would find out that yeah there is a
match here as well so it would actually
match in the second example as well in
this video we will be covering the topic
of closures now before we understand
what a closure is we have to understand
what is a nested function and non-local
variables now a function which is inside
another function is known as a nested
function nested functions are able to
access variables of the enclosing scope
so if I Define this function called
outer function where I pass some
argument called text and I store that in
a variable called text again and if I
create a function within this called
iner function and I want to print
whatever the variable is in text uh when
I execute this it will be able to access
this variable because it's within the
enclosing scope so if I said outer
function hey this gets stored in the
variable text and then the inner
function will print that variable which
is basically the string here as you can
see
here now inner function can easily be
accessed inside the outer function body
but not outside of its body so here uh
inner function is cheated as a nested
function which uses text this this
variable text as the non-local variable
now a closure is a function object that
remembers values in enclosing Scopes
even if they are not present in memory
it is a record that stores a function
together with an environment it's a
mapping basically that Associates each
free variable of the function which are
basically variables that are used
locally uh but are defined in an
enclosing scope with the value or
reference to which the name was bound
when the closure was created a closure
which is uh which unlike a plain
function allows the function to access
those captured variables through the
closures copies of their values or
references even when the function is
invoked outside the scope so let's look
at an example to emphasize on what uh
what was just said
so again I've created I've defined this
function outer function where I'm doing
the same thing now I've defined the same
inner function where I'm going to print
the same thing now it's very important
that when I return over here what I'm
going to return is inner function but
it's not going to be a function called
this is important to create our our
closure so we return inner function but
with without um using the call as we do
over here and what this return will do
is basically to create the enclosure
sorry the closure
um where the inner function will
remember the values of the variables
stored in the enclosing scope so now I'm
going to store this outer function in an
object called my in a variable called my
function now when I call this my
function um you can see there there'll
be two things that are happening here so
once I've defined this and I've executed
this what happens out here is this
function has already executed and then
I'm storing it into this but because
I've done return inner function without
parenthesis I have created a closure
basically and this closure allows the
inner function to remember the values
that were stored in text at any point at
and at every Point even after the
execution of this one time so when I
execute this again for the second time
over here it will remember the value
that was stored in the variable text
which is hey which was which was given
over here that's why you see when I
execute it for the second time over here
the first time being in this line when
I'm storing it in my function when I
execute in the second time again it
would give me the result of he as you
can see the closures have to invoke
functions outside the scope the function
in function has a scope only inside the
outer function but with the user
closures we can extend its scope to
invoke a function outside the scope so
now let's look at this code so this code
uh don't worry about what's going on
here just know that what we are doing
here is we have two functions which we
Define called add X and Y which will
return X+ Y and the subtract function
which will subtract X and Y so now we're
going to execute these once we're going
to execute the add over here and add
logger and we're going to execute the uh
subtract function and we're going to
store it in subl logger so technically
we have already executed these two
functions but now uh since I've created
an ex an enclosure basically uh if you
see here this is the enclosure that I
have created now what happens is when I
access this function from uh outside its
um initial scope which is basically over
here this was the initial Scope when I
access it outside you will see that it
it is it still has access to these
variables X and Y so if you see here I I
I first of all I've allowed this uh this
the enclosing function to accept uh
arguments of any numbers so uh I can
pass X Y I can pass XYZ also but if you
see here I I only have thing for X and Y
so when I want to access any value of X
and Y even after the execution of this
code initially um I have access to these
variables X and Y and that is because
I've created a closure out of that so if
you see if I do add logger three and
three over here I'm able to get the
result six if I do add loger four and
five I'm able to get the result 9
similarly for subtraction loger 10 and
five I will get five here and 20 and 10
I'll get 10 here and uh I can keep doing
this I can keep saying add logger and if
I if I say four and seven so if I
executed this and now I'm going to say
let's say for example add logger if I
set four and seven here so this still
has access to my variables X and Y
because I've created the closure and it
should give me 11 similarly if I did
subl logger say 30 and 15 it should give
me 15 because 30 - 15 so let's say 30 -
16 right so it should give me 14 because
again I have created the closure and it
has access to these variables already in
this video we will be learning about the
concept of Lambda functions now a Lambda
function in Python is an anonymous
function without a name we usually use
Lambda functions whenever we want to
create a um a function type object for
for a short period of time a Lambda
function is defined using the Lambda
keyword like a uh normal function is
defined using the DF keyword we Define a
Lambda function using the Lambda keyword
also the Lambda function can take any
number of arguments but it can only
accept one expression as a part of it so
think of a Lambda function like um a
sort of a a temporary function object
that you create whenever you want to
perform a particular task or object but
you don't want to give it a name or you
don't want to define a full full blown
function and give it a name Le that so
over here I'm going to give you an
example of a Lambda function let's say
that this Lambda function takes in uh
let's call it
X and so you define the function let's
call it X let's call it a Lambda
function using this keyword now we want
say two parameters right we're saying
say A and B or two arents A and B so
we're going to pass two arguments A and
B whenever we call use this function and
we're going to perform some sort of an
expression now let's write down a simple
arithmetic expression for this once
you've defined your
arguments just use the colon now over
here we have our expression so let's
call it a plus b so now we've created a
Lambda function called X where uh we
will pass two arguments and the result
will be the expression a plus B A Plus A
and B being the arguments we pass so now
let's print the result of um let's say
we pass one and three so now we should
get the result four right because a plus
b is equal to 4 so we've passed a as 1 b
as three now let's execute this as you
can see the result is four similarly you
can pass any number of arguments so you
want to call some function X U may say
Lambda function may we say um
a b and c this time and we want to do
the product of these three
arguments so now when we do uh when we
check the result let's say we're doing
the product of two 4 and six so this
should be
48 and when you execute this you get 48
as you can see here so these are two
simple examples of a Lambda function now
I could have done this um in a different
way where I could have defined some
function X and over here I Define that
it takes in three parameters and then
you can Define um some say return the
function basically returns you a product
B product C but many of times you don't
need to define a full function called X
you don't you don't want to um assign
some function with this name you just
want to create a temporary or U uh a
shorttime Anonymous function with some
name just to perform a simple expression
and in that case we can use Lambda
functions uh that's an example by the
way you can use Lambda functions in
multiple places so let's uh move on now
now uh for the um sake of this video
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you how the sorted function works
and we're going to learn how the Lambda
function uses the sorted function how
they work together so this will give you
a clearer understanding of how we use
the Lambda function in our code so to
start off sorted function returns a
sorted list from the items in an
interval so you can have a bunch of for
example numbers and the AED function by
default will give you uh will return you
the list of numbers in an ascending
order of course you can also um using a
parameter called reverse you can you can
you can return a list of numbers in the
descending order um you can also do this
for Strings uh I mean characters so if
you give it a bunch of characters say a
e f g in the in the alphabet it will
give you if you use a sorted function it
will give you the um characters it will
return it in an ascending or descending
order depending on the parameter you
give so basically this uh the sorted
function the syntax is uh you use the
keyword sorted then you pass the
iterable which is basically some some
list or some uh Tuple then you give it a
key so this key sometimes we don't need
to give by default if the iterable is
does not contain um multiple uh multiple
items per object for like if it's not a
tuple of multiple objects um if it's not
a list of tupes for example you don't
need to give it a key if it's a simple
list of numbers you don't necessarily
need to give a key if you want to sort
it but yeah a key is basically the
parameter which we use to tell the
sorted function that we want to sort
based on something which is going to be
the key in this case uh finally the
third parameter is reverse uh which
basically just tells us that if you want
to sort in the default ascending order
or if we say reverse true then we will
sort in the descending order now let's
look at some examples so I have this
list over here and I'm going to print
this
list so uh this list is obviously a
bunch of vowels e a u o i and this is
not in the ascending order of the the
alphabet right like we we know it as AE
IO U if I print the sorted form of this
list it should give me AE IO a list with
AE iio in the ascending
order sorry yeah so now as you can see
um it's given me this uh list as you can
see here similarly if um I gave it a
string a string as you know is an
iterable it's a collection of characters
so if I use a sorted function on this
interestingly it'll give me a list of
these um individual characters like p y
t h o and n but in the uh order that we
want it to be in um which is the
ascending order of course so if I print
this you can see it returns me the list
with each character in the order that we
wanted it to be in now you might notice
why does p come before H that's because
this is in uppercase so what this does
is first it uh sorts all the uppercase
characters um since there's only one so
it just places it in the first uh object
of this list and then it sorts all the
lowercase characters that you see here
so yeah moving on now now what if we
wanted to say um sort this in descending
order so we have this list now we want
to sort this in a um descending order so
in that case we have to give the
parameter reverse and we have to assign
the value true so once we do this now
now when we execute this you can see we
have the return as the same list but in
the opposite order so that's how the
reverse parameter works now let's uh try
to understand how we use the key
function or the key parameter in the
sorted function now of course if you if
we want to sort something based on some
key that we want to Define um we use the
key parameter so let's take an example
now so in this example what we have done
is um I've defined this function called
uh take SE so what this does is it it
simply it takes the second element of a
list of tuples so what is this list of
tuples well this is random you can see
this random this is a list of tuples so
this is one Tuple this is the next Tuple
and what I'm going to do is in this
example I'm going to create a key out of
every second element in um each duple so
I'm going to create a key out of 20 40
10 and 13 and based on these in an
ascending order I I will sort this whole
list so my what my uh result should be
is that since the smallest of the every
second object in these tuples is 10 so
this will be my first object in the my
sorted list then it should be the one
with 13 because this is the next highest
number so then this will be the next
object similarly this will be the next
object then this will be the whole next
object so you see I'm using every second
element of the Tuple as my key and for
that to create a key basically um I'm
creating this function which will
basically return every um it will it'll
iterate through all of these and it will
return um each of these second elements
so um let's actually uh let's actually
do this now so what I have here is I am
going to create a sorted list which is
going to use a sorted function on this
itable which is a bunch which is a list
of tuples it's called random now my key
is going to be take second so this
sorted function is actually uh very
dynamic in the sense um I don't I don't
exactly have to create a list directly
each of these objects present in the
tuples I just have to define a fun I can
even pass a function in the parameter
for key and it will apply this function
on the interval that we pass over here
which is random namely and it will use
this function to generate Keys uh
generate a key out of each second
element and based on that it will do the
sorted it will perform the sorted
function so now if I
check what's my um sorted
list you will
see that as I had mentioned now it's
using the second object so the second uh
each each second object of the Tuple as
the key so since 10 is the smallest this
whole object is the first object then 13
so we have this object here and then so
on and so forth so so this is how we
have used a key to do the Sorting
function a key that we've defined on our
on our own now similarly we can use
multiple Keys as well so just to quickly
go over through this uh we have this um
some some list where a bunch of names a
bunch of tuples you can see right tuples
with three objects each within it each
first one is is always a string denoting
someone's name some students name um the
second is the marks out of 100 and the
third is the age so what we have here is
what we want to do is we want to sort
this uh these tuples uh in the order of
first marks and in case the marks are
clashing or they are the same basically
um we will sort by the age so um what we
want to do is we want to First sort by
these marks as you can see here but in
case the Clash for example like say this
75 and 75 they're the same marks in that
case we want to sort it by the age which
is 12 and 20 which is different so in
this case we're going to use two keys
one for the first key will be given the
highest priority and then if there is a
clash then we use the second key so how
do we do this now let's define some
function like uh how we defined the St
second function here this will be our
function that we will pass to the key
this function basically what it does is
it gives us uh who has the highest marks
now since we are creating an uh since
the key works in an ascending order so
um the smallest uh object in a key is
the first object that we gets returned
right so what we're going to do is we're
going to return the error eror which is
basically the difference between um 100
which is the total marks and the marks a
student gets so this is how we obtain a
ascending order in our list which is
what we which which basically is what we
want because we want um the highest
marks to be first so we do 100 minus
item one item one is basically the first
object of whatever itable we pass in
this case it would be the the first
objects of each duple which is the marks
secondly we want age age is the item two
which is yeah each second object of each
duple now what we return in this
function is uh like this is going to be
our key now a list of errors and the
list of age error being the marks error
the difference between 100 and the marks
you obtain so now what it's going to do
is it's going to take the marks as the
first key and the age as the second key
when we pass this to a sorting function
so uh if you skip this you don't have to
look at this but if you look at this now
we have the sorted list which is going
to be the result of the sorted function
on top of what we passed which is the
participant list now we're going to use
the key we're going to use the key as
the sorter function so we're going to
use the soter function as a key and when
we print if you
see we get let me just execute all of
this so if you see here in this section
what you can see is we have the highest
marks first then the second then the
third but if you see here there's a
clash this guy and this guy have the
same Mark 75 so now what we want to do
is the guy who has the younger age
should be in the first in the object so
that is how this has happened because
we've passed two keys error and the age
so when The Clash in error key happened
we went to the age key and then we did
ascending order on that and then finally
the rest of the objects that you can see
here so now that we have seen how the
sorted function works now let's look at
how the Lambda function Works using this
sorted function which was the main goal
of this video right so let's see
so now some of you might have figured
out where this Lambda function will be
used right so whenever we were using the
key in the sorted function we had to
define a function and then we would pass
that function as the key so as some of
you may have figured this out um what
we're going to do using the Lambda
function is we're going to skip that
process of defining a function with a
new name and all that and we're going to
pass a Lambda function or going to use a
Lambda function as the key so let's see
how we do it so initially what we've
done is we've created this list this
list is a list of dictionaries that you
can see so this first object is a
dictionary second object is a dictionary
each dictionary contains two keys um the
name and the age and the values are some
like nandani the uh values for ages like
20 20 and 19 so we have three
dictionaries in a list so what we're
going to do is we want to print what we
what we want to do with this we want to
print the these objects or these these
dictionaries in an ascending order of
age so we want obviously we want this to
be first and then this and this because
19 is smaller than 20 so let's see how
we do this so if you go here what we're
going to do is we're going to print the
sorted the sorted function or the uh the
result of the sorted function being
applied on this list so this is our
aable now if you see here in the key the
key parameter we don't we don't
predefine a function and pass it over
here instead we use the Lambda and this
Lambda function is defined in such a way
so we say Lambda it will take one
argument I and then it will return
basically the age index for some I and
this I is we we're going to presume an i
to be some sort of an iterable which has
an index called age and which is uh
which is the case in our case right like
we have a bunch of dictionaries where
there is a key in each of these
dictionaries called age so we're going
to use that and now you're going to ask
like what is I well when we use the
Lambda function in the sorted function
this I will basically be each object
that we get when we iterate upon this
list so we're going to iterate first on
this so it's going to take this
dictionary and it's going to search for
the age then it's going to take this
it's going to search for the age then
it's going to take this and it's going
to search for the age and each of the
time it will pull out what is the value
for each of these age keywords or these
age indexes or age keys and out of these
objects so 20 20 and 19 or these values
we're going to create a key with which
we're going to sort each object in this
whole list okay so this is how the
Lambda function will work here so let's
do it so as you can see our sorted list
now contains this object first because a
19 is smallest age and then this and
this now you might see that uh there are
two 20s so how do we control which one
comes first well by default it will um
that it will just uh give us the result
in the way we passed it in the original
list so since nandani came before manjit
in the result also nandani will come
before manjit but what if we wanted to
sort it even more what if we want to
sort it in such a way that first we go
by age and the second key will tell us
that if there is a clash in ages we have
to go alphabetically by the name so in
this case we will create uh a second key
and how we do that well if you go to
this step over here what we're doing is
we're doing the same sorted fun function
but now the Lambda will again take one
parameter which is I which is going to
be each which which is going to be each
object in this uh iterable list and
we're going to take two keys so the
first key will be the age key and the
second key will be the name so it will
first sort on age and then on name so
now if you see um the result should be
that manjit will come before nandini
even though the ages are 20 because M
comes before n in the alphabet as you
can see this is the result
now if we wanted to do the same thing
but uh in a descending order all we have
to do is after this uh key parameter we
have to give another parameter called
reverse and we have to give it true so
if we did this now you see this this uh
or if we do it on this one to be more
clear now if I execute this basically
this uh whole uh whatever result we get
will be backwards now
oh wait I did not enter it in the sorted
function so this should come within the
sorted function over
here so now if we execute this you will
see nandani comes first manjit comes
second and then nikl comes third because
we've done the reverse or we use the
reverse keyword as true uh reverse
parameter as true in this this video we
will be covering the topics of map
filter and reduce functions in Python
now python provides several functions
that enable functional approach to
programming and since functional
programming is all about Expressions um
some of these expression oriented
functions of python are um Lambda
functions list comprehensions map filter
uh map filter and reduce now we've
already covered the topic of Lambda and
list comprehensions um now let's cover
the topics of map filter and reduce so
to start off let's look at the map
function the function takes in two
attributes a function and a sequence um
a function is basically some defined
some user defined function or any
function uh a sequence is basically an
iterable object like a list or um a
tuple for example or a bunch of lists
and tuples as well so let's look at an
example so one of the most common
operations that we do with something
like a list is uh doing an operation on
each of the elements in the list and
then outputting a new list with uh the
the values as uh whatever we have
modified to the original items of the uh
list so we what if we did the square of
all of these items in this list and we
we want to create a list based on that
so we can basically iterate through it
and we can do a square function and then
append those values to a new list called
squared and when we do this uh for
example over here you can see when we
print
squared we should get the list of
whatever Square values we have uh for
the original list but this is um
slightly a bit tedious and what if we
had a method that or a what if we had a
a technique wherein we could um
basically pass a function that we have
uh that we want to do and a sequence on
which we want to apply this and we pass
it to a function and this function
basically takes care of um applying
whatever operations we want to do on
each element of a sequence so this is
where the map function comes in use so
let's look at uh uh how we use the map
function over here so if you look at
this I've defined a square function so
the square function basically returns
takes an argument X and it Returns the
square of it and I have a map function
which takes the square um function as
one of the arguments and uh the I the
list or an itable as the second argument
so this map function creates a map
object if you see here so let's just do
it one by one so I'm creating my list
and I'm going to create my function
called Square and I'm going
to send this to the map function so I'm
sending this uh the first argument as
the function that I want to do and the
second argument as the list that I want
to apply it on now let's list out all
the items that are in this map object so
if you see it creates me a list with
basically the squared items and this is
exactly what we needed and another way
of doing the same thing would be just
going through a for Loop in each of the
map objects and printing each which
would give me the same results so if you
see here I found a very neat way of
passing a function and an iterable and
um using the map function to apply each
operation that is part of the function
or applying the function on each item in
the iterable so as you've seen we
basically passed in a user defined
function and we applied it to each item
in the list then the map calls the
square function on each list item and
collects all the return values into a
new list and because map expects a
function to be passed in it also happens
to be one of the places where Lambda
functions are are appearing a lot so
let's look at the an example where we do
the same operation using a Lambda
function so if you see here I have a
Lambda function where I'm passing it as
the function argument and what this
Lambda function takes is some variable X
or some argument X it does its square
and it returns at X and this x is
basically going to come from each
element that is present in this list
called items and when we list down these
you will see it basically does the same
thing for us it creates a list with
squared items now we can also pass
instead of passing an ital itself we can
actually pass a sequence of functions
and use the Lambda function to perform a
sequence of functions on particular
items so let's look at a new example a
slightly different one so we're going to
use a numi module for this don't worry
we're just using it to use the square
root function that is present in the
numi P module um we will be learning
about numi in a later section
so we're going to import this first and
now I'm going to Define three functions
called Square Cube and square root so
once I've defined these basically they
returning the square the cube root uh
the cube and the square root of some
integer X and um now I'm going to create
a list of these F functions that you've
just seen um and we're going to uh use a
for Loop and we're going to iterate
through a range from 0 to 4 and we're
going to pass this and we're going to
say that we want to apply
some some function we want to apply some
function X and we want to return that
using this Lambda function now what
values this x will take is based on
whatever functions we've stored in this
variable called Fu NCS or funks and in
Fu NCS we have a bunch of functions
called Square Cube and square root that
we have defined earlier so what we're
going to do is we're going to apply each
of these functions to R and R will take
the value 0 to 4 and now let's see when
we print this what values we get so if
you see here we get a list of um square
root squares cubes and square roots for
integers 0 1 2 three and four so this is
another way of um using the map function
and Lambda functions together to apply
multiple different operations to a bunch
of
itals now for our next example what
we're going to do is we're going to
create a function that
basically what it does is it creates the
uppercase of some string that we passed
to it right so that's what we've done
here in this function called two
uppercase so we let's first Define this
function now we have a print function
basically which is going to print each
object in a particular um which going to
print each element of a particular
object and it's going to at the end of
it at the end of printing we're going to
give a small space for printing a new
line basically so let's create this also
this print dat data object now what
we're going to do is we're going to pass
a string with uh the letters a b and c
to this function and we're going to map
we're going to apply the uppercase fun
function to this uh string now if you
remember string is also an iterable
where it's a sequence of one character
strings so this whole string is
basically a sequence of one character
string a one character string B and C so
we're going to so we can pass a string
as a as an iterable to the map function
because it will apply the operations on
each of these characters so let's see
what happens when we do the uppercase
function uh we apply the upper uppercase
function using the map uh using mapping
to uh this string a b and c so if you
see it's created me a list with capital
a capital B and capital c as we had
expected um because we have applied the
list function to the map object now um
in the next step what we're going to do
is um we're going to do a very similar
thing we're just going to instead of
Simply mapping and creating a list out
of it we're going to store the map
object in uh a variable called map
iterator we're going to print uh what
type of object it is and then we're
going to print out each of the elements
using the print iterator function that
we defined here so um let's do this if
you see the class the type of object is
of class map and the objects elements
inside the object are a b and c Moving
On Let's uh let's look at now an example
where we're going to pass multiple
arguments um so instead of one itable
we're going to pass multiple iterables
now and we're going to apply some sort
of an
operation so if you see here what we
have done is we've created two U two two
sequences one is a list of some numbers
and another is a tuple of some numbers
so just to show you let me first copy
this here um yeah so if you see here I
have a list and a tuple and I'm passing
both of these if you see to this map
function and before that I have defined
a Lambda function as the operation that
I'm going to apply and what this does is
it takes two arguments X and Y and it
Returns the product of both of these uh
where does it get X and Y from so the X
it gets from this uh uh this sequence
which is a list and it takes y from this
sequence which is a two so what it's
going to do is going to take X as one
and then y as 5 in the first step and
it's going to return the product as five
then the next step is going to take two
as X and then y as six and it's going to
return the product of that and we're
going to get 12 and so on we're going to
get 21 and then 32 um when we and this
is these values are going to be stored
in the map iterator uh which is a map
type object and when we use the print
iterator function it's basically going
to print out uh whatever results we got
um through this mapping so let's execute
this and as you can see this is the
result we got five 12 21 and 32 which is
what we wanted so the next part the next
function that we're going to discuss is
the filter function now now my filter
function is basically again it takes two
two arguments a function and a sequence
and a function basically tests if each
element of a sequence is true or not now
a sequence the sequence um so this
filter function will basically take two
arguments so one is the function and
this function is basically going to test
if each element of a sequence is true or
not and it's going to take another
argument called sequence and uh this
argument sequence is the list or the
Tuple or basically any sequence and or
iterable that needs to be filtered and
it can be as I mentioned it can be sets
list tuples or containers of more
iterators and what this function will
return is an iterator that is already
filtered um so let's look at an example
now so we have this list R which you've
generated which is basically numbers
from - 5 to 4 so if I create this list
here you can see it will create a list
of - 5 to 4
now if I wanted to extract only the
values that are lesser than zero well I
can use a for Loop and use a if
condition to check this right so if I
did this over here you can see it gives
me it returns me some list called result
which contains only the values um lesser
than zero which is basically checked
through this condition what if there was
a uh neat or a more convenient or a more
um organized approach to doing the same
thing instead of creating a loop
ourselves what if we defined function
where we are going to do the test or
we're going to create the condition and
we're going to pass this to a particular
function and then apply that particular
operation on every object of some
sequence well just like mapping we have
a filter function to do this and in this
example what we're going to use is the
Lambda function which takes an argument
X and it checks for some condition X
lesser than zero and where it's going to
get the X from is some sequence R um
which which in our case is the numbers
fromus 5 to 4 and the filter will
basically create a filter object type
which contains uh only the objects from
r that meet this condition that is X is
lesser than zero and when we use the
list operation on top of it you will see
it creates it results in a list with the
values that have met my condition so for
a second example what we're going to do
is we're going to create uh a list which
um contains a bunch of letters and we're
going to only extract the vowels from
these bunch of letters so let's look at
what we have here here we have some
letters d a t j k o p l and we only want
the vowels from this so we want to
filter only the vowels so we can use
that using the filter function by first
of all defining a function that returns
true if a check is met that um one of uh
the letter matches one of these letters
in this list called letters and if it
doesn't it returns false so this is our
condition that we've created once we
create this condition uh this function
that checks this we can pass this
function and the sequence into the
filter function and then we can list out
whatever we get so you can see our
filter list contains only a and o which
is basically the only Wes that are
present in our original list finally we
have the reduce function this reduce
function is basically a fun tools it's
in the fun TOS module of python 3.0 and
what the reduce function does is it
applies a function of two arguments
cumulatively to the elements of an
Tribble and it optionally it starts with
an initial argument and it returns a
single result so let's first import this
function and once we've imported it
let's use it in this example that we
have here so in this example what we're
going to do is we have some list called
numbers right what if we wanted to take
to get the sum of each element in this
list well we can iterate over it and
store it in some variable called total
in each step right um this is what we
would typ typically do and in this step
what you can see is the loop basically
iterates over every valuable in numbers
and accumulates them in total the final
result is the sum of all the values
which is the value of 10 over here and
this
example the variable total is what we
call an accumulator and we can apply the
reduce function to do the same task so
how do we do it let's first of all
create a function called my ADD where
we're going to take two variables uh two
arguments and we're going to return the
sum of it okay so let's uh Define this
function and um now we have we have a
list called numbers right which contains
1 2 3 and four now let's do reduce my
add to numbers now when I do this when I
use this function what it will do is it
will apply the function of my ad it will
take basically each and every element uh
in a sequence so it will take one and
two then add them together and then it
will create basically what it'll do is
it'll take one and two add them together
then we'll have three so it'll take
three and then the next element which is
three again so it will create the sum
which is six and then it will take six
and then it will take the value four and
it will give us the result 10 so this is
how the reduce function would work so
this is how it will give us the result
of 10 as you can see here I've simply
used I've passed this function where
I've defined that I want two uh
arguments to be passed to a function and
then the return should be basically the
sum and then I've passed a whole list of
like four numbers and I've used the
reduce function to basically do this
process for four numbers in a step
by-step manner by taking two at a time
subsequently and my result as you can
see is correct as you can see here so
let's use the Lambda function now to the
to do the same top to the same task so
what I'm doing now is I'm going to
define a Lambda function and that's the
function I'm going to pass to this
reduce so when I pass this Lambda
function which basically takes two two
arguments X and Y and it's going to
return the sum of that uh as x + y now
where it's going to get X and Y from is
in a very in a very neat manner so it
will take first the first two elements
one and two it will then do the sum and
we get three then it will take that same
three and then take the next object
which is three again and then give us
six then it will take six and then the
next element which is four and then give
us 10 and then the reduce function will
output the the the single result which
is 10 to us as you can see here in this
video we will be covering a sort of a
project side type of scenario which is
basically going to be a problem case for
you and it's going to be slightly
slightly difficult slightly tricky but
what we're going to do is we're going to
tackle a particular problem and we're
going to uh what I'm going to do is also
um show you a solution to that problem
so uh let's start with this so this
question that that we have is we have
this program um that we have to write
where we compute the frequency of words
that um exist in some input okay uh the
program should output after sorting the
key Alpha numerically now this input can
be any it's basically a block of text
right so in our example we have um for
example if this was our input right uh
what we want to see is an output which
is basically saying that uh the word
python has appeared say well in this
example it's appeared five times and
then the word read has appeared one time
and so on and so forth like for each of
these words we want to see um how many
times have they appeared in this part
particular block of text so um let's
look at a particular example now where
we have done this so let's um let's see
here so first of all I'm going to create
a dictionary so why am I creating a
dictionary is because I'm going to use
each uh unique word as a key and the
number of times they have appeared in um
a block of text as the value to that key
so um I'm going to use a sample uh
string which is basically this long
string that you can see here which is
stored in line so this large chunk of
text is what we're going to be analyzing
so how are we going to do this it's is
pretty simple so we have this now what
we want to do is um when we find what we
one way of tackling this problem that
we're going to do here is we want to um
check word by word first of all we want
to see if it's a unique word and if this
word is we encountered it for the first
time then we need to store a new key in
our dictionary called frequent table or
frequency table and if it has already if
there's a key already with that um
particular name then we just want to
increment the count or the value by one
so let's see how we do this over here so
if you can see in my this the solution
is as simple as this but if you see
what's happening it's basically what uh
what it's doing is we splitting up this
string uh using the split function what
this will do is it will split up the
string at every white space so it'll
take this as one part it'll take this
part as another part it'll create an
iterable with uh each word as the um
each iterable object in that container
so it's going to be a list of words like
python is one so on and so forth and
we're going to go one by one so we're
going to say forward in line do split
now if this word is if it exists in
frequency table as a key then what we're
going to do is we're just going to
increase the count of uh the value of
that key by one but if it does not exist
then we're going to actually create a
key uh with the word as that unique word
and we're going to create its value um
initialize its value to one so when we
execute this now if we want to once
we've done this we can sort it by the
count of the words so what we're going
to do is we're going to create a another
Tuple called sorted tuples where we're
going to use the Lambda function out
here uh to sort the dictionary in terms
of its values so what we're going to do
is we're going to take the key the key
being the Lambda item item with index
one index one is basically the value um
so a particular key has a value so the
word python appears so many times the
word say scientist appears so many times
so we're going to check which words have
the highest number of uh occurrences and
we're going to sort it in a uh
descending order so that that is
basically what the reverse is equal to
True does so when we're going to sort
this when we're going to use the sorted
function when we say reverse true uh it
tells the Sorting function to sort this
dictionary this dictionary frequency
table uh in terms of value by the the
descending order so whichever word
appears the highest that would be the
first word in our uh sorted CLE so
that's what we do in this line and once
we execute this we're also going to
print so if you see the result of this
um activity that we've done you can see
that the word machine appears six times
learning appears six times then python
appears five times and so on and so
forth so we've created a sorted Tuple
where the first object of the Tuple
we've created a list of sorted tuples
where the first object of the T each
Tuple is the unique word the second one
is the the number of times that it has
appeared in this particular example or
this particular string so yeah this was
the first basic project that we have
tackled in this you might have seen some
examples of how we do list operations
and how we use a Lambda function in uh
sorting the dictionary by the values of
the key in this video we will continue
with u what we started in terms of our
uh project number one what we're going
to do is um we're going to tackle
another slightly complicated um uh a
question or a situation um we're going
to try to arrive at a solution so in
this what we have is some sort of a
robot a moving robot which moves on a
cartisian plane a two coordinate plane
um is going to move uh in terms of up
down left and right okay and each each
time it moves up or down or left or
right it takes a certain number of steps
in that direction um integral steps of
course so what we need to do is um from
a starting position whatever it starting
position is which we're going to take as
0 comma 0 in this example um we're going
to make it move to a particular location
with the commands up down left and right
followed by certain steps um and we're
going to uh ask what we're going to do
is we're going to calculate the distance
between these two points um and we're
going to calculate different types of
distances so you might be introduced in
New Concepts um new distance Concepts in
this video as well so what we're going
to be using for distance calculation is
the minkovski distance and that is we're
going to take so the movi distance
between two variables is basically the
absolute difference between these two uh
variables so these two points and we
take it to the power of something so if
we want to say uh calculate the
minkowski distance with in terms the
quadratic mowy distance with basically
P2 so we are going to do x i minus y i
absolute difference to the^ two and then
we're going to take the second root of
it after summing each and every point so
when we take p is equal to 2 we we say
the minkowski distance behaves like the
ukian distance and this is probably one
of the most common distances uh in case
you've done basic uh cartisian geometry
when you're asked to find the distance
between two points on a a plane um we
can also take the absolute distance
where we take p is equal to 1 so in this
case we're just basically summing the
absolute distances between each point no
roots no powers nothing basically p is
equal to one and we call that the
Manhattan distance so we're going to
take p is equal to 1 2 and 3 in each
case and we're going to find the
distance between two points uh based on
these measures so just this just a
visual representation this is basically
the UL distance basically the estimate
of the value between these two points if
um since this is a two coordinate system
whereas the Manhattan distance would be
the absolute distance in terms of um if
we go up and then we go right between
these two like say this was and this was
another point so yeah let's move on to
the problem in this particular example
we're going to start from the starting
position 0 and Z on a on a graph and we
are going to give the commands of up
five down three left three and right two
so first of all what we want to do is we
initialize the starting position as 0
and 0 and we also just for the sake of
this example we initialize the end
position as 0 and 0 so what we're going
to do first of all is um let's execute
this much now we have this list list of
two
um it's we're going to call this actions
and this is the actions that we're
performing so the this the each dupal
contains an action and the number of
steps in that direction so it contains
four actions up by five steps down by
three steps left by three steps right by
two steps so now we're going to iterate
over this each dupal and we're going to
get the direction first of all in this
line um for each step uh and we're going
to calculate the number of steps it
takes so for each action it's going to
First tell um it's going to check what
is the direction which is done by this
line and we're going to find out the
number of steps in that direction which
is stored in this line so once you've uh
gotten this for each action we have to
uh update the end position right so what
happens is if you go up by a particular
direction so you are basically changing
the y y axis right the uh the y axis so
we're going to change end position and
the first index which is basically this
part of the um end position coordinate
point so we're going to say if it's
moving by up then we're going to uh
update by adding uh the y axis by the
number of steps so um and and and if the
direction was down we're going to do the
same thing for the y- axis but we're
going to decrement it similarly if you
move left or right we're moving the
x-axis right so we take end position in
the first index so we take the x-axis
and if we're moving left it's a negative
uh it's a decrement and if you're moving
right it's an increment so if there's
any other like action like any other
action for example that was given here
we say pass so basically the only valid
actions that we can pass is um up down
left and right otherwise we we um just
skip that particular action so this is
what the this particular Loop will do it
will update our final
position so once we've done this uh if
if I execute this what will get stored
in the end position is basically my end
position so uh now that I have my
starting position and my end position um
just to show you what the end Position
will look like right now let's just do
this so if you see here after I've moved
up by five steps down by three steps
left by three steps and then right by
two steps my final end position is min
-1 and two um my start position on the
other hand
was as you remember it should be 0 and 0
it is 0 and 0 so now we're going to find
the distance between 0 and 0 and minus1
and 2 so we're going to first of all
create a function called minkowski
distance which which does the basic
function of just calculate the uh the
difference between the what do you say
um the end position x coordinate and the
N position y coordinate times or to the
power of a root and we're basically
going to do this operation that uh you
saw here we're going to do this and um
we're going to use this root variable to
specify to like P is equal to 1 2 or 3
like what P value we want to take for
this minkovski distance so once you've
done this what this function will do is
basically store uh this much and it will
wait for us to uh it will basically wait
for us to give us a root so when we give
root one it will create these it will
check the distance between the end and
starting points um with the P value of
one if we gave it two it will calculate
ukian distance with P value two
similarly for three and we can calculate
for any Roots so we're going to
calculate for 1 two and three Roots um
and we're going to see what values we
get in each case so when root is equal
to 1 I print a statement saying
minkowski distance with root 1 is
something and then root2 is something
root3 is something let's see what
results we get so if you see here the
minkowski distance with root 1 is
actually 1.0 but the ukian distance
between these two points point is 2.23
whereas the um the cubic manowski
distance with basically the with root3
is 1.91 so you see these three different
uh distance measures for the same
distance between two points so in this
video you basically so in this basically
by doing this activity you might must
have you will learn how to um basically
how to iterate through Loops um and
perform these uh distance calculations
which you'll find pretty handy in um
many activities related to uh data
science and machine learning in this
video we will be continuing tackling
different problems and problem cases in
terms of a project called project 3
where we're going to be using regular
Expressions to validate whether certain
passwords that have been entered do they
match certain criterias or not so let's
look into our particular question we
have a website that requires users to
input username and password to register
now we have to write a program to check
the validity of passwords input by the
users now the criterias that the
passwords have to follow are that
there's at least one letter between a
andz and one number between 0 and 9 uh
the third criteria is that uh there's at
least one letter between capital A and
capital Z so this first and third Point
basically is saying that there should be
one lowercase letter and there should be
one uppercase letter now there should be
at least one character from dollar sign
hash or the at symbol um it should have
a minimum length of six and the maximum
length of 12 so when we whatever
passwords that we enter into our um
example they must be comma separated so
if we're going to have an input uh
they're going to ask us for an input
where we going to have to input the
different passwords in a comma separated
way so let's look let's look at um how
do we tackle this so for my example I'm
going to use these uh examples in terms
of these are my password examples if
we're going to check if these are valid
passwords or not so let's copy this
first of all and now let's import R
which import R is basically the regular
expression module um now in this step is
going to ask us to input the passwords
as you can see here so I will just
control V so since this is comma
separated what it will do is it will
split up each of these uh by the comma
and it will store them in a list so
it'll take this as one password this as
another password this has another
password and this has another password
once I press enter now if I want to
check what's in list I mean what's in
items what I can do is
just check over here what's in items
it's a list of whatever password I had
entered uh each object is separately
treated now in this list now I'm going
to create a an empty list called value
first of all once I've done that I'm
going to move on to the next step so
once I've created my list called value
what I'm going to do is now I'm going to
search and I'm going to check for each
condition using regular expressions for
whatever criteria that we have U
initially so if you see here what I'm
going to do is first itate by each item
in this to check for each password now
my first check will be a basic check uh
for the length of the password if it's
lesser than six or greater than 12 then
um our basically our password is illegal
so we can't be using this and we will
just continue and we won't check for
anything else but if it is within 6 and
12 the length 6 and 12 then we can uh
continue with our check so we can do
we'll do an lse statement for pass which
basically moves on to this uh next block
now once once we've done this what we
will do is uh this this first statement
what this is going to do is it's going
to do an re. search and re. search as
you know is going to look for at least
one instance of um a letter occurring
between um A and Z so this i. search uh
followed by this now this is the regular
expression that we have passed and what
this tells us is basically the square in
the square brackets we're looking for
anything between uh A and Z in terms of
small letters so if this condition is
not met then again we continue and we
leave this uh particular search because
one of our criterias is not met all
right but if it is met then uh this if
not statement will not uh like we we
won't enter this block and we can move
on to the next check so now now we move
to LF not now again we're using if not
statement so this is basically checking
for uh a negative case so anytime one of
these cases have been met it basically
means that our password has been in inv
valid because these conditions are not
being met so we're we're trying to
eliminate all conditions all of these
conditions so that we get a valid
password so again we move on to the next
statement which is basically going to do
the search for numbers once again if we
find a case uh a password without any
numbers we continue and we don't um
check this password no more because we
already know it's it's a an illegal
password now next check will be for
capital letters a to z and the next
check again will be for these particular
symbols the dollar the hash and the at
one of these three symbols we're going
to search for a widespace character so
if we actually do find a whitespace
character in our password um that's an
illegal password and we're not going to
continue checking for those cases so um
so this is basically all our cases
lowercase letters uh numbers capital
letters these one of these three symbols
and the existence of uh a white space so
once we've done all these checks if none
of these have been passed we move on to
this lse statement where we just pass
and uh what we can do is we append the
value P to the uh the list called value
so basically what happens is um just to
go through it again um if this condition
is not met and this condition is not met
this is not met this is not met this is
not met and if this is uh also not met
then we're fine so basically as long as
we have small letters as long as we have
a number as long as we have a capital
letter as long as we have one of these
three symbols and as long as we don't
have any U Whit space characters we can
append P to this otherwise it will
continue and it will break out of this
for Loop completely that's what the
continue thing the continue statement at
the end of each of these blocks checks
um anytime this condition is met uh this
if not condition is met then we break
through we break through this uh whole
for Loop and we don't append P to the
value but uh if we actually get to this
stage then what we can do is simply
append uh p two value now finally what
we are going to do is uh we're going to
print out all the valid passwords so
just by a quick look you can see here
this is a valid password right so let's
execute this and let's see uh what we
get if you see here we only get one
valid password and let's look at why um
some of these did not turn out to be
valid so if you look here all of the
conditions are met it has a capital
letter it has a small letter it has at
least one number and it has one of the
symbols either dollar sign or the hash
sign or the AD Sign In this case we have
two white spaces one over here and one
over here so this is an illegal password
similarly in this case also we have an
illegal password because it begins with
a space in this case it's the same thing
we begin with a space and also it does
not have any of those uh symbols that we
were looking for the dollar or the hash
or the at so again so these three are
illegal passwords and they do not get
appended to Value however this does get
appended to Value and that's why we get
the result for only one password which
is the only legal password welcome to
web scraping with python my name is
Richard kersner with the simply learn
team certainly there are many reasons to
be able to go online and scrape
different websites they range everything
from pulling out different links uh to
pulling data off of websites as a data
scientist you might need to get some
information off a website that doesn't
have a direct API to pull that
information and in Python we have a
wonderful tool when you talk Python and
you talk web scraping we're talking
beautiful suit which is a package you
add into your python that you're running
and we can come over here to the website
www.com.com software beautiful soup and
you can actually read a little bit about
it currently beautiful soup 4 is the
current version if you don't remember
the full website for it you can always
do what I do which is go over and do a
search for beautiful soup official site
and it almost always comes up right at
the top and you click on there and it'll
take you to the crm.com software site
for beautiful soup now we're going to
use our whatever python interface you
want IDE I'm going to use Jupiter lab
which is built on Jupiter notebook
through Anaconda so when I open up my
anaconda Navigator you'll see that I
have my different tools available again
you might be using a different editor
and that's okay you might be in pie
charm or something like that where you
don't need to do this and uh Jupiter lab
is Jupiter notebook with added tabs and
some added features it's basically in
beta testing so it's got a few little
glitches when you're saving things and
moving between projects but for the most
part it's a great upgrade to to the
Jupiter notebook and you can use them
together so you don't have to I mean
it's built on Jupiter notebook so
anything you do in Jupiter notebook you
can open up in Jupiter lab and the first
thing we need to do is we need to go
ahead in this case I'm going under my
environments since it partitions the
environments out and I'm going to open
up a terminal window we have to install
some packages in here to work with now
there's a lot of choices on this I
because of the Simplicity will be using
cond install now you can use pip install
for the same thing and we're going to
install our beautiful super 4 uh and you
have to type out the whole thing
beautiful soup 4 and you can use a pip
install if you're using a different
environment and I am using python
version
3.6 although according to beautiful soup
they also work on 37 all the way from 27
through all of 3x now according to the
beautiful soup website the beautiful
soup 4 works on anything you can install
anything from python 27 all the way
through any of the Python 3 versions uh
this just happens to be python 36
because I do there's a lot of other
packages that don't work 37 yet and
we'll go ahead and run this install on
here and let it go through its
environmental setup and of course with
cond it goes in there and finds all the
dependencies PIP doesn't do as much as
far as finding dependencies but you know
exactly what's on there with Pip so if
you're doing a huge distribution you
probably want to use your pip install so
you can track what's going on there with
the um cond I like to just let it take
over since this isn't a major
distributed package going out another
quick note between pip and cond is that
if you start on a project in one of
these environments and you're using pip
in there stick with Pip if you're using
cond stick with cond they track the
packages and you can run into some
issues where they're not tracking the
same packages and something gets
overwritten so it's important to stay
very consistent with your uh install on
your environments and we'll also need to
go ahead and install our numpy
environment and our pandas on here so go
ahead and do that if you haven't added
those packages in go ahead and install
those into your environment that you're
working in of course pandas is just
simply uh install pandas and let's just
install a couple more packages in this
case let's get our uh install our map
plot Library cuz we're going to plot at
the end since we're going to be
collecting data and for this project
that will be all the packages we'll need
so we can go and close out of our
installer or whatever setup you have and
we'll go back to home and we'll just
launch our Jupiter lab and now will open
up in our browser window now if you're
coming from Jupiter notebooks and first
time in lab we can go ahead and just
create our first first notebook Python 3
you can also do it under file launcher
and you'll see new notebook it
automatically opens up and we just click
right on there it'll pop open on the
left and I'll rightclick this and we'll
rename this we'll rename it uh just
beautiful and it is a i p and B file on
there so that should look familiar
because that's a Jupiter notebook file
this is a new one now I have M tabs and
in the past I usually hid this on the
other computer all my notes for the
lesson today but this is my notes going
down and we'll go go ahead and just
start going through this and see what it
looks like to do a data pull from front
to end and see how that works as a data
scientist pulling that information in
from the website and the first thing I
want to do is I want to go ahead and
close this side window that way it looks
get the nice full screen and we can also
up the size a little bit one of the
wonderful things about working in a
browser window just do that control+
thing the packages we talked about is
pandas so we imported our pandas if you
haven't already that's our data frame if
you haven't done our pandas tutorial
definitely worthy of uh the time to go
through there and understand pandas cuz
it's such a powerful tool this basically
turns your data into a spreadsheet data
frame our numpy is our number array uh
so it kind of works with pandas very
closely as far as manipulating data in
arrays matap plot we want to go ahead
and bring that in our PLT so that we can
plot the data at the end and this line
right here that says Matt plot library
in line is for the Jupiter notebook
specifically it tells it to print that
on this page a lot of the newer versions
don't actually require to have that line
they'll still print it on the page we
should still include that if you're in
the Jupiter lab setup and then we have
our URL library. request we're going to
import URL open for opening up the
website and then we have our bs4 that's
your beautiful soup 4 we're going to
import beautiful soup and then our last
one is our re that is for manipulating
our regular Expressions so when we get
to that part of importing our data we
have to do a lot of reformatting so it's
something we can use and the re is one
of those tools we'll go ahead and run
this and just bring all that in so this
is all imported all these packages are
now into our web scraping program we're
going to run now if we're going to dive
in and pull data which you have a nice
website to pull from and let's go ahead
and we'll use the um hubber timing.com
results for the
2018 Martin Luther King race and if we
take this you can actually just take
this um where did we get this from well
you can go in here and find the website
you're going to scrape from and you'll
see right here it says you just copy
that link right in there that HTTP um
and this is the website that we're
looking at you can see right here all
the information that we're looking at
let's say we want to to run some
statistics on this it sure would be nice
to be able to pull it off of here and if
they don't have a direct API that means
we need to pull it from their website
some of these will have a download
although if you've ever done we have a
download click and maybe you're paging
through a hundred websites uh in one
case I was uh pulling all the different
United States bills that are passed to
track who voted on them uh for a project
and you can imagine that there's you
know hundreds and hundreds of those
thousands of these documents that they
voted on who voted on it it goes to the
Senate goes back to the Congress so I
open up a website pull all the links off
of there that match a certain criteria
and we'll look at that in just a minute
how we go through the HTML and then I
had to reformat them or I could hand
download each one one at a time which
would just be a nightmare so it's nice
to automate it in this case we're going
to be pulling up this chart we want to
figure out how to pull this chart off of
this website and so when we go back into
our Jupiter notebook I've got my URL
just um our name for it and it's just a
string that's all this is nothing fancy
there you'll notice that on the slashes
we now have forward forward slash you
can do a single forward and HTTP is a
double forward this is just how you have
to switch it to match setup in there and
then it's going to go ahead and use the
HTML equals URL open URL and that's from
our URL Library Quest so it's opening a
link to that website or at least
pointing to it and if we run this this
just sets it up so this is all set up
and then once we've done our uh setup
let's go ahead and create an object
called soup this will be and if you
remember up here here's our beautiful
soup that we imported from the bs4 uh
and this is the package that we're
working with and so we're going to do
our beautiful soup on here and on this
we need to go ahead and send it our HTML
so it knows what it's opening and then
the second part is we have to tell it
how the format is coming in and the most
common one for your HTML polls is an
lxml setup and so almost all of them
you'll end up using the lxml there's a
few other options and because this is so
common uh in the newer versions a lot of
times they just leave it out just
because it's already on the default
we'll go ahead and leave it in here just
to remind us that it's there we'll go
ahead and run that and on the newer
versions uh they actually default it to
the XML setup and the HTML we'll just
leave it out and call it HTML so it's
just going to pull from this URL and
when we run that on here we've now
created an object soup that has pulled
the website into it so soup contains the
information along with information on
that website and what's going on so
let's just go over what we did real
quick before we start digging into the
actual soup before we start scooping out
stuff we imported our different uh
modules that we're going to use with our
package specifically the beautiful soup
we did install the Beautiful soup if I
remember correctly you have to call it
beautiful soup 4 specifically so it
knows what you're bringing in and this
line right here is very key from bs4 cuz
that's how it installs the module we're
importing our beautiful soup and then we
found our URL in this case we're going
to go pull information from The Martin
Luther King dream run and then we set
our HTML to our URL open URL and you can
see right here we imported that so
here's our url. request import URL open
so we're requesting a connection and
once we send that connection into the
beautiful soup it creates an object
called soup and then this one of course
we chose soup just because it goes with
beautiful soup I guess we could have
chosen beautiful and now we can start
extracting information from our website
because we've pulled it down onto our
computer under soup and we can start by
looking at the title of the website sup.
tile and if we print title. text you'll
see this a lot in beautiful suit because
title contains all kinds of information
and if we want just the text from that
title title you add the text on the end
and you can see right here we have our
2018 MLK dream Run 5K race results if
you look at the tab that's the actual
title up here uh 2018 MLK dream Run 5K
race that's what the title is on the
website and then you might be curious
what's in title what's the whole title
that it's storing up there well let's go
ahead and print it out here's print
title and print tile. text and when we
run that you can see it has the HTML
tags title on it and then the forward
slash tile to end it and so really just
pulling off this piece of the HTML code
and then we look at the text inside that
particular part of the HTML and earlier
I mentioned links what if you want to
get all the links off this page oh that
would be fun uh we could do soup Dot and
we'll do find underscore all put this in
bracket and then quotation marks we'll
go and put a a is the um key find and
you'll start seeing a div and all the
different options you have for finding
these entities in a website and then
let's go ahead and just print links and
you can see here that it now shows all
the different links in here that are
marked by a CU we did to find all a and
then we can also because this is a
little bit hard to pull off the H
reference so we can also add in our find
all finetune that in this case the H
reference equals true we'll actually
filter that out and then finally we
might do a four link in links and we can
simply do something like this for each
link we want to actually find the H
reference cuz we know there's an H
reference in it and if I run this you
can see it just comes through and prints
them out one at a time some of these are
really useful so you might be looking
for something that has https in it and
you know that's a link running to
something else or you might be looking
for the mail to tags you know that's all
the mail addresses but either way you
can easily find all the links in your U
HTML document that you're paging through
and of course um any packages that have
evolved over time you can also do link.
getet H reference which should do the
same thing as our other format and you
can see it certainly does we get the
same print out up here in this
particular case we really want to get
the data off the page uh so let's go
ahead and do that let's see what that
looks like in in data let's call it all
rows there we go equals and then we have
our soup. find uncore all there's our
brackets and then if we're looking for
each row in a database you'll remember
your HTML code we're looking for the tag
TR so we want to find all TR and we can
take this and let's go ahead and just
take all our rows and do a print all
rows and about this time you're going to
guess that we're going to get a huge
amount of information just dumped onto
our page and sure enough we do if you
look at this it just kind of goes on
forever but this is an array each row is
considered an array so because of that
we can do something simply as putting
brackets and just print the first let's
do the first five rows so uh from
beginning to five and you can see here's
our first five rows on here I sometimes
like to just do let's just do row zero
and we see that row zero is finishers
finishers 191 and just out of curiosity
what's if that's zero what's Row one
male okay so we're starting to see
titles going across here so if we come
up here and we do rows we did what up to
10 let's just take a look and see what
10 does again and just take a look at
that information that comes across Place
uh bib name gender age city state chip
chip paste gender and so on so it comes
all the way down here we kind of have an
ending right here and then we have one
and then we actually looks like we start
to have information so we have our one
our 1 1191 Max randoff that must be the
name Mel 29 and so on you start seeing
how the information starts getting
displayed going down so the next thing
we want to do with this I'll go back up
here and just edit the space we're in so
it starts to make a little bit more
sense keep it all together and so we
want to do for each row in all rows
we're looking at what information are we
looking at well we have our th here
that's the header our TD down here which
looks like the individual information
and we really are looking for um the
actual data so we're looking for our TD
tags in the rows and we can do that
because when remember when it stores the
row it also stores the tags underneath
that so all rows have all the different
tags in it and you can see right here as
we print each one of those out and so
when we look at each row we can create
another variable and we'll call it row
list and we'll set this equal to in this
case row because we've already pulled
all the rows out of soup so now we want
to find for each row and in there we
want to find our TD and if we go ahead
and just print I'm going to do it if you
notice I changed the indent so I'm just
going to print row list what this does
is the last value to go into row list
our last row is going to print now and
of course make sure you have an
underscore instead of a period when
you're typing so row. findall TD and if
we print the last row you can see I have
all the data coming across here we have
our 191 are 1216 Zuma Oak choa I hope I
said that right female I believe that's
age 40 and so on and then we can take
our uh row list and there's a lot of
things we can do with the row list but
we'll do for let's do object or let's
just do cell in row list and so we're
going to look at each cell because this
is if you look at this they have commas
separated between the different objects
and then we're going to go ahead and
print cell. text let's just take a look
and see what that looks like and we can
see here for each row we get 191 there's
our 191 there's our 1216 1216 our
individual who's in the race and so
forth all the way down for those
different settings and let's go Ahad and
create a new variable up here uh we'll
call this all let's just call it data
we'll keep it simple uh so here's our
data and then we have our row we take
our row we break it up into individual
cells so we'll call this um data row
we'll set this empty to an empty row and
we're going to take take our cells tab
this and we know that each cell
generates a text and so what we want to
do is I want to take my data row let's
just replace that let's take our data
row and let's appin our cell. text so
I'm going to add the each row is going
to be a row of the different text on
here and then once I create each row I
want my data which is going to be
everything to append each row and here's
our data row and then if we go ahead and
come down here and let's just print data
now if we were looking working with
large data we'd be very careful about
just throwing all our data on the page
but you can see here we throw the data
on the page and we get uh finishers 199
male 78 female 113 one and so on and if
you look at this this is the headers on
the file we have finishers uh male
female it's just like some general
statistics on the first one and then we
have actually uh um an empty data set
and then we have our data that continues
which actual the actual information
we're looking for so we have 1 1191
Randol mail 29 Washington DC runtime uh
one of 78 and so on on here uh so we
could really quickly get rid of that
number of different ways to do that one
of them is just to do we're going to set
if we do data two on uh we should get
rid of everything but we want to keep
randoff so make sure randoff is in there
oh we lost randoff let's try one on
there we go there's Max randoff on there
uh so we can just simply do redo our
data on here we can do data probably
want to do it in all rows from one on
but I'm just going to do my data equals
data one on down here and there's
reasons to split it this way in data
science sometimes you don't want to
touch the original data in case you need
it in case we do need the first row so
we'll put it down here and uh maybe
we'll just call this titles titles
equals data of zero and so we could do
something here where we print we'll
print up our titles and we'll print our
data in this case instead of one on
let's go minus two let's look at the
last two rows data so here we have our
titles and uh for some reason it just
put in finishers of 191 I was expecting
a little bit more up there and we have
our last couple people and they look
like the data on these looks just fine
on here turns out this is just some
generic statistics up here so we'll get
rid of titles completely doesn't really
do us any good but we know that data
comes in here and we can look at our
data and look at the very end of the
data too the minus two to the end and we
can see it pulls the data in pretty good
we don't have anything too funky in here
we're looking at it looks pretty clean
now you got to be a little careful
because at some point we might have to
come back here and clean up the data if
we get an error for running data
analysis we might find out there's some
unusual characters or something is
misset in the data itself and you also
notice that everything is a string so
when we're bringing it in we might have
to do some conversions to test it out
and convert them to whatever kind of
data format we're working with so at
this time we want to go ahead and bring
in our pandas um and let's go ahead and
call this idea for data frame we'll set
it equal to and if you remember
correctly we imported pandas as PD and
that's standard you'll see that in most
code examples where they call they
import pandas as PD um and it is capital
D capital F for data frame and we're
just going to bring in our data that's
what we call it on here and let's uh
take this and we'll print now when
you're working with data frames you're
usually talking large amounts of data
and so you almost never want to print
the whole data frame out uh we're going
to go ahead and do that anyway just so
we can see what that looks like and you
can see in here brings in our data frame
coming in here we just have a mess of
information this is our data let's go
ahead and print DF and see what that
looks like in the data frame and this is
nice because it organizes it into a very
easy to read table and we have uh they
set the label 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and so on
and then we have each row uh we have Mel
uh 78 none none none none none going
across when we get all the way down here
we'll see Max Randall about number three
and the first thing this does is this
Flags me that I brought in a bunch of
information up here that we really
didn't want uh it's from three on that
we want and we can clean this up in one
of two ways uh we can try to clean it up
under the data or we can clean it up
under the data frame depending on what
it is we're trying to do and so to fix
this um I want to go ahead and just
change it up here on the actual data PLL
in we don't need that information so
I'll rerun it reload our data from 4on
and then when I run this we see we have
Max Randol is right at the top of the
list like he should be and we have have
all the data going down now with the
data frame remember I said we don't
usually print the whole data frame we'll
go ahead and do DF doad and this prints
the first five rows and you can see that
we have uh 13 columns here's Max Rand
all the way to Theo kinman and I usually
also print
DF and the reason I like to do these
particular two setups I'm going to
change it just to two rows because you
can do that you can print as many rows
as you want is it's good to look at the
first part and the end because those are
usually where you have extra d brought
in Uh something's messed up and you can
also see that we have 190 rows in here
and it comes in with our Zula Lea and
they're both on here on the list so now
we have a nice data frame uh columns and
rows we can easily look at it we can see
the setup on here and we can look at the
names and everything now at some point
you might be looking at these individual
columns and find different information
that needs to be re-edited if you can
you try to do it with the whole column
under pandas you can up in the upper
part of the code where you went from
cell to cell or row to row you could
look at individual cells maybe find a
marker in that cell that's something
specific like remove all colons or
semicolons or something in there or
brackets so there's a lot of options in
there but you'll find that this one
actually comes in pretty clean on here
all the way down and the next thing we
really want to do is we want to look at
the headers um I don't know about you
but doesn't make any sense to me when I
have column one I don't know what 1191
is or 1080 need name Kaiser Runner I'm
guessing that's column two is names
third one it looks like male or female
probably age but I don't want to guess I
want this to bring in my column so I
know exactly what I'm looking at so how
can we make beautiful soup do that for
us well let's take our column headers
and we're going to set that equal to our
soup findor all and then we're going to
look for our headers our th files and
since we're in Jupiter lab in this case
Jupiter uh notebook I can just type out
column headers if it's the last variable
I have listed it will automat atically
print it so it's kind of a shorthand and
we can see right here we have place I'm
guessing that's bib name gender age city
state chip time chip pace and so on so
we have all our headers right there I
shouldn't have to type them all in and
we'll go ahead and do it before we'll go
ahead and do a header list equals our um
empty array and then we can do for a
column in column headers and we can take
our header list and just a pin and what
do we want we want the text from the
column so we'll just do column. text and
then if we come down here and we print
our header list let's see what that
looks like if we did it right we should
get a nice list of all the different
column headings we want so we have Place
bib name and so on and then pandas just
because pandas is so cool we can simply
do DF columns equals our header from our
header list we can simply set DF columns
set to DF headers and then if I print
dfad we'll take a look at that and we'll
see right here it has nice ly placed our
values on here Place bib name gender age
and so on so very quickly we've created
this nice data frame we have the data
displayed in nice rows and columns and
easy to read and then as a data
scientist the first thing we want to
know is the info what is in these
columns and rows and headers and you see
right here they all come up with nonnull
object there's a big flag so if I want
to do anything with this these are all
coming through as strings or an object I
usually mean strings in this case that
they're a string variable and we have
you can quickly read through this 191
entries date columns total 14 columns
there's a total of 14 columns in the
data and it shows you all the different
names and what type of column they are
and it's probably good also to look at
the shape of the data DF do shape we'll
go ahead and just run that you see it's
191 by 14 14 columns 191 entries this is
more like a the way you look at a numpy
array 191 by 14 for the shape and
remember this is a variable so if I put
it on if it's a last variable or last
value in the set of cells Jupiter
automatically prints it out so if you're
in a different IDE you'd want to go
ahead and use the print statement on
here uh and then one of the things you'd
want to also go through we'll create a
second one df2 equals DF do drop na now
the axis is automatically equal to zero
so a lot of times you'll see something
like axes equal zero comma How equals
any axis is equals z is default that
means we're looking at at going down the
rows you could look at the column going
across let's remove the how any that's
just going to confuse you the axes is is
whether you're going down the columns or
if you're looking at it uh row by row by
row by row or you could be looking at it
by column by column by column this would
drop any column and it would drop off
the na in any column and how equals and
we want any I always confuse all and any
cu they both start with a all means that
all of them have to be nonv value where
any means that any of them can be there
to drop it so this would drop any column
with a null value in it but we want zero
and it'll drop any value with a null
value and then because zero is always
the default we'll just leave it out and
then as curious as to what the shape is
now did we lose anything was there any
null values in our df2 that we dropped
from the DF and we'll go ahead and run
that uh and we see 191 and 14 so we
didn't really drop anything but it's
always good to check there's other ways
you can also do are there let's see any
Naas you can detect Naas in here null
values infinite values that's another
one you got to watch out for we're
working with data that we're going to do
something with here in a minute so you
got to be a little careful also in the
conversions are you going to convert
something where people typed in weird
characters to describe the data a
certain way so now we've got to this
point where we have all our different
columns we have our different data and
um at this point maybe you're asking or
maybe the shareholder of the company is
asking hey can we look at at the um
based on the chip time here's our chip
time can we plot that versus gender how
does gender versus chip time compare and
so we can do that we can take that and
the first thing we look at is we say hey
well chip time came in as a string and
that's going to be an issue now there's
a number of ways you can change this one
of them is we could go all the way back
up here where we created the data and
find a way to tag it and say Hey
whenever um this cell text maybe instead
of appending this I notice that anytime
there's two in it that's probably a time
signature and let's uh convert all the
time signatures to date time field or
whatever A lot of times you don't get
that uh you don't get that option and
that's always a question in bringing in
data whether you convert the data coming
in at the beginning or do you wait till
you have it open it up and then convert
it when you go to use it uh we're going
to go ahead and convert it after we got
it into our data frame so we have our
df2 here U we've dropped all of our Naas
we dropped our we have a shape u in fact
let's do this since there's no
difference between DF and df2 oh we'll
just go ahead and use df2 uh so let's go
ahead and take our df2 and we want to
take those that specific field and
convert it into some kind of numerical
value we can use and let's add another
column A lot of times this is uh
something you want to do is where you
want to go ahead and keep all the
original columns and just add a new
column in there and this new column is
going to be based on the if we remember
correctly we had chip time that's what
we're going to look at okay we want chip
ship time versus gender if we go into
our pandas we find out we have a pandas
2 Delta and this is actually time Delta
and then we just want to take our df2
and we're going to use the chip time
column so this is going to say hey let's
look at uh let's convert everything in
df2 chip time into a Time Delta format
that's the data type we're going to put
it as and we go ahead and just run this
and if we go in here and we do info uh
df2 and we'll keep our we're going to
look at this particular column but we
want to keep it as a data frame uh so
this is a list of all the columns we
want to look at we'll just do. info on
here and run that and we do an info on
that you can see is now a uh time Delta
64 nanoseconds uh well we really don't
want nanocs we actually probably want to
do it in minutes uh so let's take a look
at that and let's take this whole thing
TF2 let's just set the df2 we have our
df2 this is a column we're working with
here and we can use the as type property
in pandas and so we can set this equal
to df2 we'll take our same uh column in
here and we'll set it as type time Delta
second so it's still a Delta time here
so if I run this you'll see that it
still comes up as where is it oh it
turns it into a float so we're now at a
float 64 so it's a number of seconds in
that Delta time and then finally uh we
want to go ahead and turn that from
seconds to say minutes and you know
there's 60 seconds in minutes and so now
now we divide by 60 we still have a
float we have our info it shows us as a
float and then we can go ahead and just
do a print df2 and let's just keep it
small we don't want to look at all our
data we just want to do the head of it
and we run this and you can see right
here where we go to it'll be the last
one here's our chip time in minutes and
a lot of times uh just to make life easy
for viewing since we're only looking at
this particular element uh we can do
chip time in minutes and now we just see
thats we take off we'll go ahead and
take off our info done with that we'll
run this and you can see we have our
minutes 16.8 minutes
17.51% just look at the end of it and
here we have female female male female
female so we have two different genders
and we have our chip time in minutes and
if you remember we brought in our PLT if
you haven't used the plot Library the
Matt plot Library you have a drawing
place you're putting stuff on so we have
our PLT we're going to do a bar graph
and we just want to Simply use our df2
gender and df2 uh chip time in minutes
so that's going to plot the two bars and
to make it pretty we'll go ahead and
give it the X label gender the Y Lael
chip time minutes and that simply is
remember it always plots X and it plots
y we have our gender our chip time give
it a nice title uh comparison of average
minutes run by male and female uh and if
we go ahead and run this with the
correct titles in here and everything
matches uh you'll get a nice graph we
can see here the comparison of average
minutes run by male and female here's
our chip time in minutes the men seem to
be Slackers in this particular case and
it's actually uh um there's a number of
studies that show that women team tend
to have as far as doing cross country
there's a lot of women who have a longer
endurance than men so that's not too
surprising uh but we can see here the
average chip time around 70 and for
women over 100 minutes and then another
really cool thing we can do is we can
describe the data uh so df2 describe
this again is a pandas function just
like info is and we're going to include
uh NP number the numpy number if we run
that you'll see here it comes up and it
says a chip time in minutes a count it
gives you the average or the mean
standard deviation the minimum the
maximum um all the different descriptive
information you're going to want from
your data set on there and just because
there's all kinds of fun ways uh let's
do a box plot to display your
information uh we can do a box plot
where the column equals chip time in
minutes and let's go ahead and run that
keep mistyping my chip time in minutes
you can see it puts out a nice uh box
plot showing in information we have our
uh different values and floaters and
this is always interesting this is a
nice way of seeing where where we have
these floaters one up here and there's
two up above and of course your your
nice spread on the box plot and we can
also uh modify this a little bit and we
can add in by equals gender and then
we'll give it a we'll just give it a
blank title I don't know why we're
giving it a blank title uh we'll just
add a y plot y label on there for
runtime and if we run this you can see
here box plot Group by gender chip time
and minutes and now we have our female
and male two different areas and you can
see how they vary you have your two
different uh your outlier up here you
can also see how there's such an overlap
between the two different values uh so
if I was looking at this I'd be like wow
you know I I really could not draw a
conclusive thing on this saying that
women's runtime was more in general
because they overlap too much that would
be one of the conclusions I'd have to
come up with on here and then we get to
U maybe the partners come in from the
company and say hey we'd like to know
the age versus chip time in minutes
that'd be something worth uh knowing on
the statistics on this and the first
thought is we can simp L plot it and we
can do this we can actually plot the
scatter plot chip time versus df2 of H
those are XY coordinates but if you
remember from df2 when we did the info
let's go way back up here uh we're
looking at a data object as far as our
chip time on this and our age now we
converted the chip time but we also need
to convert the age and if we do it right
here we just plot it and it'll actually
let us plot it it shouldn't it should
give us an error but it does let us plot
it you'll see the Ages come up a mess
over over here because they're
converting it to weird float numbers and
all kinds of things so what we want to
do is we want to take our age and we'll
just call this hore I so we're going to
take our age and we're going to create
another column for df2 agcore I and the
I is just going to stand for integer
it's our own choice of values there is a
number of ways to do this but we're
going to do a pandas to numeric is the
best way in pandas and the reason we're
doing this is that numeric creates a
float value uh so right off the bat we
want all our stuff converted converts it
to the least common denominator so if
they're all integers already you'll get
integers as you can see from here it's
doing some kind of conversion that
converts it to a float value the other
thing the numeric does is if there's a
null value or they put in like a blank
line or a dash to represent no
information uh it'll convert it to a uh
null uh so it goes from like a string to
a null versus just having some kind of
madeup number that python somehow
created for the graph we have below and
then we want to add our df2 age because
that's what we're converting to numeric
and then we want to coers it and there's
a couple different options on this like
you can have it where just doesn't
process it in pandas but coer means that
if it gets a weird value that is a null
value now and since we're dealing with
errors this is what happens when you get
an error converting it we want to coers
it there we go and put the end bracket
on there and then finally we want to go
and round this off so I'll put brackets
around all the way around it and this
rounds off everything in this series so
what we've done here is I've taken df2
AG which is a dtype object which is in
this case is mostly strings with a
couple blank ones in there and we're
going to convert it to a numeric which
will automatically go to float and then
we're going to take wherever there's an
error wherever it says hey this doesn't
convert and usually that's a blank
screen like I said I've worked with so
many databases where they someone puts
down none someone types in space some
types in a dash to mean none and you get
this really weird conversion coming up
this covers all of that in pandas so
it's really a nice way of just coercing
it and saying hey if we don't have a
number in there let's make it a null
value and then we're going to round it
off and then finally let's go ahead and
take our df2 uh here's our df2 and let's
drop those null values drop Na and we
want how how equals any so that means if
there's any null values in the data set
now you can be this might get you in
trouble because you might have null
values in a different column and so you
might lose uh data that way um at this
point we could also do like certain
parts of like Drop just certain columns
with null values there's all kinds of
other options in here we're just going
to do how we're going to just drop any
and we want to do it in line equals true
so that means it's going to reassign it
to um df2 uh so df2 now has a rounded
out so it's rounded to the integer we
didn't do any places the age and it's
going to be agei and then we've dropped
all our null values that way we're not
going to get any errors when we try to
plot a null value and it also makes sure
that data U by deleting out the rows
because that's what this does it
automatically does axis zero which is
your rows axis one is your columns by
doing this it automatically removes all
the rows with null values uh so it just
cleans out the rolls and then when we go
ahead and plot this we see we have a
nice clean data and we have age all the
way up to 70 uh so we have our chip time
set and then our age going across and it
makes a nice plot that you can easily
show uh for display and for the the um
and you can easily show that to your
shareholders or whatever group you're
working on it makes a really nice and
quick easy display so as you can see I'm
using Jupiter notebook for the python
okay so here what I will do I will new
go to new and this Python 3 okay so here
first I will rename it
to
pandas for
data
analysis okay then rename it okay so uh
already everyone know pandas is a python
library that provides extensive means
for data analysis right data scientist
of work with data sorted in the table
formats like CSV tsv or XX okay so
pandas makes it very convenient to load
process and analyze such tabular data
using SQL like queries okay so in
conjunction with matplot Li and cbor
pandas provide a wide range of
opportunities for the visual analysis
okay for the you can make charts and all
right so the main data structure in
pandas are implemented with series and
data frame classes so now let me
import number first okay as NP then I
will write
import
pandas as PD why I'm writing as NP and
as PD because I don't want to write
pandas andai again and again and again
so I have gave the short form you can
see okay so here
I will write just pd.
set uncore
option
display do
Precision okay then I will write comma 2
okay me run it okay fine so we have
imported pandas and this nump Library so
now what I will do I will demonstrate
the main method in like you know action
by analyzing a data set on the churn
rate of Telecom
operator I have like one data set name
Telecom churn okay operator clients data
set so now let's first import it okay so
I will write here DF equals to DF means
data frame you can give any name okay DF
PD PD as you can see here PD means
pandas
panas dot read _ CSV
then
Telecom
Chan do
CSV so you can find this data set from
the description box okay in the
description box below right then I will
write here DF do
head what does this do DF doad it will
show you you know the first five lines
using the head method of the data set it
will show you first five lines of the
DAT data set head and if you will use
tail instead of
head you can see the last five rows of
data
set okay if I will write here DF do
tail you can see the last five rows of
the data set
fine yeah so on our data said we have
state account length area code
international plan voicemail this this
this this this this okay and the CH rate
is false fine so we now what I will do I
will recall that each row correspond to
one client and instance and the columns
are the features of the instance so now
let's have a look at the data
dimensionally features names and the
feature types okay so how many columns
and rows we have fine so I will write
here
print DF do
shape okay so now we have
3,333 rows and 20 colums in our table in
our data set okay so now let's uh try
printing out the column names using
columns okay so for that what I will do
I will write here print so these are all
the functions using pandas okay then DF
dot
colums okay so now you can see here we
have 20 columns right here 20 columns
okay so here state is one column account
and three four these are the all columns
name these columns name
fine so now let's use another function
called info
which will give you some you know it
will give you some general information
about the data frame okay so here I will
write
print DF do
info
okay so yes so now you can see class is
Panda score Frame data frame then this
much entries okay 0 to this 332 3, 332
okay column name and the non Nal values
non Nal count is okay zero and the data
types you can see this is object this is
in 64 64 object floating type
okay so there are four five type of data
set here okay bull is there float is
there okay int is there and the memory
usage you can see 49 498 1 plus KB okay
and then bull is one float 64 type is 8
columns then in 648 columns and object
right so uh here these Bull in 64 FL 64
and object are the data types of
features already I told you so we can
see that one feature is logical okay
that that Bo one is
logical where is BU yes this one CH rate
is logical okay logical means two fals
two fals okay and the three features are
of the object type um you can see this
state these are the object and the 16
feature are numeric okay float is also
numeric plus variable right so with this
same method we can easily see if there
are the missing values so here are you
know none because each columns contain
3,333 observation
see every column is same and that you
can see n null count is non non null
okay so here you can see we don't need
any cleaning and that typ of thing okay
so we can change the column type with
the as type method there is one more
method so let's apply this method to the
churn feature to convert into
N64 got it so for that what I will do I
will write
DF then I will write
CH please note that no spelling mistake
while writing
the column names
okay to
DF
Chan Okay C is
capital
dot as
type
N64 fine so now uh you know we have
convert this uh Lo bu to N64 now okay so
now what I will do I will use one more
method okay let me run it first okay
it's
no issues now what I will do I will
write here DF do
describe
yeah so now so the describe method shows
basic statical characteristics of each
numeric feature in 64 and Flor 64 okay
count is there for the particular column
the mean standard deviation minimum
value
25% 50% this is the max value
okay okay now you can see the CH zero
and one one okay so and the number of
non-missing values mean standard
deviation range medium everything is
here using describe you can just find it
okay for the for every column it will
give you okay count how much count and
mean of this particular you know account
length and the area code like this so
now so in order to see the stat of
non-numeric feature so you know one has
to explicitely indicate data types of
interest in the include parameter okay I
will use the include parameter so first
I will try DF do
describe include
equals
to
object comma
bull
okay so now you can see the count is
333 and unique values are the 51 and the
top is this and the frequency is this
okay so I am here
seeing the stat of non-numeric features
okay like St international plan and the
voice plan like this fine so for C
categorical data like type object and
the Boolean type B feature we can use
the value counts method so now let's
have a look for that also so I will
write
DF
ch ch dot value
okay so this is some
data right so now what I will do so
there are
okay
fine so now what I will do here I will
normalize
it
CH dot value
counts
normalize equals to
True
okay
so so we have 2850 users out of 333 are
loyal their CH value is
zero
okay
and to to calculate fractions pass
normaliz equal to two we have I have did
that with the value count function okay
so here you can see Zero and the one
value
counts right so now let's go for the
Sorting data so what is sorting so a
data frame can be sorted by the values
of you know one of the variables like
columns so for example we can sort it
this table by total day charges using
using ascending or in descending right
so now I will do here DF okay first I
will let me write here
sorting okay DF do
sort
values by equals
to total
B charge
ascending equals to
false dot head dohe means I want to see
the top five rows
okay so now what I did you know total D
charge okay total D charge I sorted in
this ascending equals to false means I
have sorted into the descending order
okay and the top five rows are this okay
59 is the maximum 59. 64
fine so now like we can also Sol by
multiple tables in one go okay so let me
do it DF do
sort same thing you have to write
values by equals
to
CH this
yeah CH comma then again
total
day
charge comma
ascending equals
to True
comma
false then
I want to see okay let me write the same
dot
head okay first I will show you this
11111 okay then let me change
it see it's
sorted now
fine so these are the top
five as per these two columns CH and the
total data charge
column okay so now we will we will do we
will perform some indexing and ring data
so a data frame can be indexed in a few
different ways like to get a single
column you can use data frame name okay
and so now let's use this to answer a
question about the column alone so let's
take one question like what is the
proportion of churn users in our data
frame okay proportion okay DF do simply
we have to find the
mean I will write
Chan do
mean that's it okay so 40 14.5% is you
know actually a quite bad for a company
such as a churn rate can make the
company go bankrupt right so Boolean
indexing with one column is also very
convenient so the syntax is I will write
here
I will write here
DF then again
DF
chals to
1 then dot
mean okay so here what I'm finding is
what are the average values of numerical
features for churn user
okay see account L
on just ignore this warning okay so
account length is 10 2.66 area code is
this this this this this right so now
what I will do I will find one more
thing so like we will find how much time
like in average do churn user spand on
the phone during
daytime okay
de then ch
equals toal to
1
then
total day in minutes we have this column
right I hope so we have this column
total day minutes okay
fine yeah dot
me
okay so how much time and average CH
user spend on the phone during daytime
is
206
okay almost
207 okay so now let's take one more
question like what is the maximum length
of international calls among loyal users
okay loyal user means where
CH is zero like who do not have the
international
plan so here for that I will write DF
and
DF
Chan equals to equals
to
zero here I will
write
and
DF
okay I
will okay International
plan international
plan because equals
[Music]
to
no because there is see you can see the
inter no yes no yes no okay
no
then then
total International
minutes
okay
this okay for the confirmation let me
copy it and
paste okay no
issues dot maximum
value yeah so
18.9 okay so 18.9 is the maximum length
of international C among loyal user
where is CH is zero who do not have the
international plan
okay so indexing data frame can be
indexed by column name I told you
already or the row name or by the serial
number you can say of a row so there is
one method looc okay method is used for
the indexing by name while iock is
another method for indexing by the
number okay first I will show you DF dot
here I will write
dexing DF do
L
comma
State
then area
code
okay so in this first case you know we
can say I gave the values of the rows
with the index from 0 to 5 like
inclusive and the column label from the
state to area code inclosing okay so so
this is how you can perform indexing
okay using by name okay if you want
indexing by the numbers you have to use
iock instead of this lo
I means location
okay don't get
confused 5 comma 0 2
3
okay see you got the same
almost
right yeah this is 0 to 5 okay and this
is 0 to 3 you know 0 to 5 mean 1 2 3 4 5
and 0 2 3 1 2 3 fine
yeah so what if we need the first or the
last line of the data frame so we can
also do that so here simply you have to
write Simple Thing DF minus
one okay that's it see this is the last
line minus one last
line fine so if you want to you know
apply something to all the columns so
there there is one more function which
is apply so how to do is DF
dot
apply
NP do
Max
okay right it gave me all the maximum
values of the particular
table sorry particular column not table
okay so this is how you can do this so
This apply apply method can also be used
to apply a function to each row I
already told you so to do this you have
to just specify the AIS or the Lambda
function are the very convenient in such
scenarios like for example let me give
you one example DF then DF State let's
use the
state okay then dot
apply apply Lambda
State and
state
zero equals to equals to W which is
starting from W okay then dot I need
only five rows do it
okay so the state is starting from W
here it is okay top
five right so
yes so there is one more function map
method which is used to replace the you
know values in a column by passing a dis
of the form
right so math
function b equals
to
no okay
it is
false
then
yes
is
strong right then
DF
International
planal to DF
international
plan do
map D okay DF
do
fine
okay there is some international plan
okay p is a small that is why I was
saying
please write it carefully
yeah okay so this is this is the map
function okay so wherever there is no or
yes okay so I have mapped it to the true
true
false right okay see here you can see
international plan yes no yes no yes no
I have
marked yes to false and okay why
different because because you know the
series is different okay here I have
performed different thing the numbers
just check the number
okay 0 1 2 3 4 right DF do let me write
this so now let's compare
okay okay why it's coming because I have
already performed that thing so we'll go
to here see no no no no yes
yes now you can see here false false
false true true so for No I gave false
and for the true for the yes I gave true
fine this is the mapping this is how you
can do the
mapping okay so now let's do DF equals
to same thing can be done using replay
as well there's one more function okay
let me give you the name has replace
dot
replace
then
voicemail
plan oh sorry my
bad
Plan
D
okay fine now let's
then
dot okay so what I took voice mail plan
right same see true true false false
because here if you will see I have
write d d equals to this again you have
to write no to false and yes to True
same I used here D no need to write
again and again fine so now let's see
how to do grouping
okay so first the group by Method
divides the grouping columns by their
values okay first let me
write
this
grouping
okay so here I will write
columns to
show because
to total
day
minutes
right
comma
total if
minutes
comma
total
night
minutes okay then DF dot
grow by
then here I will write
Chan
then here I will
write
columns to
show dot
describe you know
percenti fine where is empty
fine where there is
error d. go
by caname describe go unexpected keyword
argument
percentile okay okay okay fine fine
fine will be percenti
yeah so this is how you can do the group
by with a churn okay so what I did so
let me explain the you know steps so so
first the group by Method divides the
grouping columns by their
value okay then they become a new index
in the resulting data frame then column
of Interest are selected column to show
this column to
show okay so if column to show is not
included all the non-rp by classes will
be included finally one or several
function are applied to obtain the
groups for selected columns so here what
I did we group the data according to
their values of the churn variable and
displace that of three columns in each
group right these three columns in each
group same count means standardization
minimum 50% Max count mem this this this
this this okay so this is how you can do
grouping fine so if you want to
summarize the table okay suppose we want
to see how observation in our sample are
distributed in the context or two
variable churn and international plan so
to do so we can build the you know
contingency table using the cross tab
method I will show you okay so here I
will write summary
table PD
do cross
tab then I will write here data frame DF
Chan Comm
DF
international
plan
okay so this is the true false no
summary okay we have this much true
false Zero from the intenal plan and the
for the one are this much okay for one
the 346 and 137 true right so this is
how you can perform the summary table
right you can do for the more also so
now let's create the P table okay
so let's make the tables
OT
tables okay P tables fine so I write DF
dot pivot
table okay
then I will write
here sorry yes so here I will write
total day
calls comma I will take three column
total Eve calls
comma
then
total
Night
Calls
comma
then area
code okay comma then aggregate
function equals to mean
okay I'm using
mean
fine so this is Pivot you got the area
code and the mean of particular this
this right so data frame transformation
so let me explain you first this uh
pivot table okay before moving forward
so this p
so now we can see the most of the users
are loyal and do not additional Services
okay international plan of the voicemail
so this will resemble pable to those
familiar with Excel and non of
course okay so here the values are the
list of variables to calculate is stat
for and the index okay a list of
variables to group data by okay area
code okay and the aggregate function is
what stat we need to calculate for the
groups
like we can use sum mean minimum maximum
okay something else okay so here I have
used the
mean
right so now let's uh predict the
Telecom CH okay so now let's see how the
CH rate is related to the international
plan feature so we will do this using
you know cross tab contingency already
saw and also through Visual analysis
with cbone I've already told you with M
plot when the c one it Bas is crazy okay
so
here I will write
predicting telom Chan okay so here I WR
PD do cross
tab
DF CH Okay C is
capital ch
comma
DF
International International
plan comma
margin equals to
True
okay okay sorry my bad it's margins yeah
okay we got the P table here using
costep
so I will import
here import M plot Li for the you know
charts M plot
lip. P
plot as
PLT then I will import cbon import just
remember to install all these libraries
okay you can use pip install cbon and
pip install nump pip install
pandas before using
it
C1 s
[Music]
SNS then for the graphic routina I will
use
config inline
backend do
figure format
to
retino
okay then here I will write
SNS dot count
plot
where x equals to xaxis I'm giving okay
international
plan comma let's set the
H equals
to
Chan then comma
data will be DF
okay
see we have the counting of using
international plan and the H is CH okay
zero and one point so we can see that
the international plan the CH rate is
you know much higher which is an
interesting observation you know perhaps
the large and the poorly controlled
expenses with you know international
calls are very conflict okay so now
let's uh take a look to another
important feature which is customer
service call let's also use to you know
to make the summary table first so for
that I will do here
PD dot cross
tab
DF ch
comma
DF
customer
service
calls comma margins equals to
True
okay yes so
again I have made the summary table for
the
uh you know customer service calls so
now what I will I will create SNS do
count
plot x equals
to
customer
service
calls where
H is
CH then data equals to DF
yes okay so this is how you can you know
create the charts using pandas and the
C fine so therefore predicting that the
customer is not loyal churn equals to
one in the case of when the number of
calls to the service center is greater
than three and the international plan is
added okay so this is how you can you
know do data analysis using pandas so
hello guys welcome to this demo part of
this video so here what I will do I will
go to new then Python 3
file then
here I will give it the name called
exploratory
data analysis basically we will so we
have one data set file of roller coaster
basically so we will be using that and
you can download that file from the
description box below from the below
Link Drive Link okay so we will be doing
some small basic functions using Python
and later on we will uh make some good
charts okay we will remove duplicates
and all we will do all
that thing we'll do data preparation
we'll do feature engineering okay and
and uh we'll remove the duplicates we'll
check for the duplicates we'll make
charts like histogram KD plots box plot
and like many more similar to that like
heat map will make scatter plot Group by
comparison okay we all do that right so
just stick with me and you can right
side along with me your discode okay
okay so let's start with
importing pandas
first I guess everyone know what is
pandas and
numai
f as NP then I will
import
numpy as NP why this is NP and PD sorry
my bad PD is here because I don't want
to write again and again this pandas
this so basically I can write this is
small version okay yeah so if you guys
don't know what is Panda so Banda is
very popular library for working with
data okay it's goal is to be the most
powerful and flexible open source tool
okay so it has these that good so data
frames are the center of pandas and what
is data frame a data frame is a
structured like a table or a spreadsheet
okay the rows and the columns okay
whereas nump number is an open source
python Library again that facilitates uh
you know efficient numerical operation
on large quantities of data okay so
there are many functions in numpy as
well those we can use in the Panda's
data frame got it so we'll import one
more do p
plot do PAB okay as
PLT okay there is one more Library M
plot lip for plotting the graph and and
there is one more
import
cbon as SNS so what is cbon cbon is
again the python data visualization
Library based on M BL Li okay it
provides a high level interface for
drawing attractive and informative
statical you know graphs okay then I
will write here PLT Dot
ti.
use we'll write GG blot got it GG
plot
fine so yeah let me run it so what is
ggplot so ggplot is an again this is an
open source data visualization package
fortical programming okay so yeah uh you
can say or a general scheme for for data
visualization which breaks up graph into
know semantic components such as scales
and layers okay m
loly
p get
PB P okay yeah so
now we will import our data set DF DF
means data frame you can write any word
of your choice then PD again pandas do
zore CSV used for readings CSV file okay
Excel files got it then here I will
write
my this
coaster do CSV okay I'm not writing any
path because my this uh data set is here
itself coaster coaster C Co this is
coaster. CSV okay if you have your data
set in another location as in like in C
drive D drive or whatever okay you can
give that
path okay let me run it yeah so now we
will do some data understanding okay
we'll see data frame shape head and tail
data types UND describe like small small
function we will use DF do
shape and it so we have 1087 rows and 56
columns in our data set
okay then we will see DF do head
five so DF do head means it will give me
top five rows of my data set okay you
can see 1 2 3 4 5 okay five rows and 56
columns here 56 column but we have 1087
rows okay so we have Costa name length
speed location status opening date type
this this this this okay we will
do uh you know we'll make some graphs
using this these columns okay and there
is one more DF do
tail again last five rows so DF do tail
gives you the last last five rows see
1086
1085 and if you want to
see full data it is here okay 0 to one
fine yeah so we have one more DF do
columns to
check all the
columns see coaster name length speed
location status opening date type and
these all are my columns names fine so
we have one more data types actually we
have like many data types but let me
show you some important ones or you can
say some of the basics ones okay so DF
Dot D types D types means data types Co
name is object type length object and
inversion is float okay we'll check
[Music]
inversion where's the inversion yeah
flow type
okay then everything is object and er
introduces in numeric one and let itude
float okay so basically we have three
types float int and object okay okay
then what we do let's just quickly check
this
describe okay so what is the count of
this inversion
932 okay it won't include any you know
what is it empty cells okay it won't
count empty cells right mean of this
particular table then standard deviation
then mean minimum value 25 % 70% 75% and
Max it will describe you all this okay
and there is one more DF do info to get
the info see coaster name 1087 value non
null object then length 953 non n okay
like
this yeah so now moving forward what we
will do we will do data preparation okay
what comes in data preparation like
dropping irrelevant columns and rows
which we don't want okay then second
thing is identifying duplicates columns
then third is renaming
columns then we'll do some feature
Creations
right so if you want to drop a column
okay how you can
drop so you have to write just DF do
drop first I will give here stack
data
reation okay yeah
so how you can drop a column okay DF do
drop then here I will
try
opening
date comma aisal to
one
okay opening okay spelling
strong instead of this okay maybe what
is the opening date okay o is capital
here instead of this you can use double
equals
to okay AIS is not
defined my bad so what you have to do
you have to keep this here and you have
to
yeah again ACC is not
defined yeah fine okay okay so as you
can see here first I will show you this
question name length speed location
status and opening date is here
fine so if you will go here question
name length speed location status
nothing opening date is there right so
this is how you can drop a table fine
for a while I'm making this as a comment
maybe in future
upcoming you know uh making graph I need
this okay so yeah so I will write here
DF equals
to
DF coaster
name comma
location then
comma
status then here I will write
manufacturer find
then again
comma then I will give
here
ear
introduced
then
comma
latitude wait I will tell you why I'm
doing this then
longitude let it
longitude then I will give you
Type
M okay
then
opening
date
clean
fine then speed
into in hour is Right speed
and comma what else
then
height
F
inversion
clean
Comm
gForce clean dot copy
yeah so here I will write okay
type
in okay one more mistake is
here
fine so now what I will
do I will write here
opening
date clean equals to
pd2 dot date time
DF
opening
date clean
fine what
happen so what this does this PD do2 day
time do okay so it converts argument to
data time date time okay so this
function you know you can say converts a
scalar array like or series or data
frame dictionary like to a panda's
datetime object
okay so now let's rename the
columns
okay then to you know for better things
DF equals to DF do
rename columns equals to
coaster name
then
poster
name
comma
here introduced
then
here
introduced
okay opening dat clean to
date okay then I write
speed
R
thens
speed got it
then height
into
foot I will write it
as
catch so why I'm writing this because
this is a very good practice as a
professional way know as a data analyst
or as a business analyst whatever you
are working on machine learning projects
or whatever the this is a good
practice okay so any
versions
clean then should be
like
inversions
then
gForce clean to
g4ce
fine let me done
it okay now let's check the color
yeah so now you can say our column name
is
changed
fine so I will write this
and Dot
sum so what does this is an a do sum do
so is an a function returns a Boolean
value of you know true if the value is n
and the false otherwise and the sum
function return the sum of the two
values which equals to the number of NN
values in the column so here we have
zero and N here same the status
23 here 217
5 height 4 916 okay so now what we will
do we will write here DF dot
location DF dot duplicate
I told you in the
starting
will duplicate it
okay question name location status okay
it's duplicate now
okay so now what we will do I will check
duplicates for the co name so you can
write DF
doco LC then
DF DF do
duplicate and
subset
poster name then dot head okay head of
five now everyone know right what
do what this head
does okay yeah so here you can see so
these are
duplicate okay of the question name
right
why because you can just check the type
inod and all fine so now checking with
an example duplicate let's check DF do
quy coost
name equals
to
Crystal now you will get
Beach cycl okay I took this Crystal B
cycl
fine then run it so now you can see 39
and 43 are the
same okay everything is same so this one
is duplicate so now what I will do I
will write here just let me give some
space yeah DF dot
columns then I will write here
DF
DF location
then DF
dot
duplicated
subset
question question
name
then
location
then
opening
date okay
okay
do
deset
index then drop
that
okay so now what we will do we will do
some feature understanding
okay so now we will do some feature
understanding
okay so in this we will plot some
feature distribution like histogram KD
box blot okay for that I will write here
DF ER
introduced okay then I will write
value
counts so now what I will do let's
create bar chart okay axal to
DF here introduced
dot
value comes okay then
dot head 10 Max I
need then do plot kind alss to I need
bar then title is
stop I like what what what what should
we give top
10
years coaster
introduce okay
then I will write here a DOT
set X label
then I will write here
here
introduced okay then I will write that
ax
dot set y
LEL
then count okay let me run it okay
unexpected character after line
continuation okay
we can
this unexpected
intended now let me run it yeah so this
is our bar plot okay so this is how you
can create barplot using your data okay
so a barplot is you know one of the most
common types of Graphics in this data
visualization or Ed it shows the
relationship between a numeric and the
categoric variable okay so each entity
of this category variable is represented
as a
bar got it so now let's do some more so
what uh let's
makeo class okay
histogram so for that I
write ax = DF
speed R then
plot kind equals
to
Stam then comma I will write bins here
okay pin equals to
20
then
title coaster speed
okay meter R then
ax dot
set X
lbel
spe me okay for to give
this okay yeah so a histogram displays
numerical data by grouping data into
bins of equal width so here each beingin
is plotted as a bar whose height corresp
on to how many data points are in that
bin so bins you can say are also
sometimes called the intervals or
classes or buckets
basically it's the
same so here for this this much is the
bin for this this much is the bin this
is like that
okay so now let's create KD plot so for
that it's very simple ax = to
DF then and I can write as
speed R then
plot
kind KD comma then
title I can write anything
coaster
speed then ax do
set X label
speed yeah so KD what does KD means a
kernel density estimate this plot is a
method of you know visualizing the
distribution of observation in a data
set analog to a histogram so KD
represent the data using a continuous
probability density curve in one or more
Dimension okay in one or more Dimension
that curve fine so now let's do some
feature relationship so in this we will
make scatter plot heat map correlation
and pair plot okay or we can also do
some group by comparison fine so now
let's first
make scatter plot okay so DF do
plot kind equals
to
scatter
comma X = to
speed m
r comma y =
to height in
foot
fine then comma let's SK the title
equals to coaster
speed
versus
height fine then PLT do
okay some error is there speed me R okay
okay s should be capital and it should
be
Capital
yeah so this is scatter plot speed
versus height this is a speed versus
height okay if the I can see here height
is directly proportional to speed
somewhat because if you get see the 350
is a speed than 120 km per hour no it's
not like that okay
fine so scatter plot identifies the
possible relationship between change
observed in two different sets of
variable here the variables are height
and the speed okay it provides a visual
and the statical you know means to test
the strength of relationship between two
variabl fine now
let's okay now let's make one more to
give you better idea okay with
Legend now I will show you wait SNS do
scatter plot then xals
to
speed
R comma y =
to high into vot
feet whatever you can say then H will be
there then
ear
introduced okay then data equals to
DF then axal to set
title set title then
coost speed versus
height then PLT do
sh yeah so now you can
see so this color you know the light
color I will let me Zoom it okay so this
color we have some here which are
introduced in '90s okay and this color
which are introduced in 1925 and these
colors which are introduced in
2000 so you can can see like this as
well so now let's make pair blot okay
it's look
amazing so let me write SNS
dot dot pair plot then DF
comma variable equals to I need ER
introduce then speed
me
R comma that should be Capal height foot
just remember the spelling okay case
sensitive
inversion inversions
comma inversions comma
gForce okay comma here I will what what
what what what okay I
type
me find that
PL okay let run it okay some error is
there here
introduced why
be let's see here so that's why I'm
saying just remember the proper spelling
again
some sorry my
inversions is
[Music]
inversion now let me run
it okay again
some
okay M
versions okay let me check here while
renaming inversions only
okay
fine in
versions paste but nothing changes let
me check
again okay some error is
there wait so yeah you can see it's
running
fine so after this what I will
do so what is the pair plot so pair plot
function allows the user to create you
know then an AIS grid via which each
numerical variable is stored in the data
is shared across the X and the Y okay in
the structured
column so this is how see you know type
in V other and steel this red one is
wood other are the blue one and the
purple are the steel one okay the
different different format okay now
let's create the last graph which is
heat map okay so let me write
DF for
relation to
DF
here
introduced
comma speed m
r
comma
height into
for can
comma
G4S then drop P then
coration okay DF
I
cap cap
yeah so this is correlation values of
all the things right so now let's write
SNS
do heat
map heat map then TF let's
go comma and not will be
true okay
now let me run yeah so to create heat
map in Python so you can use this okay
see Bor library for this heat map so
this function takes a data frame you
know as an input and generates a heat
map type of things as the output okay so
this is how you can perform Eda using
any data set or you can show your data
or Insight with a beautiful
representation of using graphs and all
like this fine so guys let's get started
so here's our first interview question
that is given to arrays write python
function to return the intersection of
the two for example if you have X = to
1590 and Y = to 3029 then it should
return 9 and0 so how you will approach
this problem by coding in Python you can
take your time and then you can come to
the solution so guys in order to solve
this question we will have to create a
python function that will find the
intersection of two arrays and this
function is going to use the set data
structure to efficiently determine the
common elements between the two list so
guys first what we are going to do let
us create a function first so we are
going to say the name def intersect and
you can just call it as arrays okay and
then let us give the two argument a 1
and a
R2 pretty fine till here now after that
convert both of the list and sets to
remove the duplicates and allow for
intersection so what we are going to do
we are going to create set one okay and
this is going to be set of array
one okay then next what we are going to
do we are going to create a set of two
okay
and this is going to be assigned to set
of array two pretty
fine now what we have to do guys we have
to find the intersection of both of the
sets so guys we can give a variable name
sets intersection so sets Okay and this
is going to equal
to set one okay dot
intersection of set
two very easy guys and then we have to
convert the intersection set back to a
list before returning this list so what
we can do finally we can just
return
so return list and here we can give the
intersection of the same
so now we have done that let us take an
example of the same so for example we
can take say x =
[Music]
to 15
09
and Y equals to say 3
0 2
9 and finally we are going to call this
as
result so rest equals to and finally we
can just called our function so our
function was intersect arrays so we can
just copy this and we can give the
arrays name that it will be X comma y
fine and then we can finally ask to
print the
result so in this way we are going to
find the intersection let us run our
notebook so we can see there are some
errors coming up so
okay so we can see that the answer is
coming 0 and N pretty fine right now so
we have completed our first question now
let us move to the next question so guys
our next question is given an array find
all the duplicates in this array for
example we have 1 2 3 1365
and we should return only one and three
so we can see one and three are the only
one which has been duplicated so how you
are going to approach this problem you
can pause this video for a while and
then you can come to this video and then
you can watch the solution so guys to
find all the duplicates in an array in
Python you can use a dictionary or the
collections. counter to count the
occurrences of each element and then
gather those with the counts greater
than one so for for example I'm going to
show you a dictionary so what we can do
we can define a function first say let's
find a duplicate So Def
find
say duplicate and in this we are going
to take an argument array
Define now after that let us declare a
dictionary with name as
counts okay and let us create an list of
duplicates
after that what we are going to do we
are going to count each element in the
array so let us go to the for Loop so
for Num in
Array
Okay then
if num in
counts okay then what I'm going to do
I'm going to
put this that count
num or
else what we can
do we can
count of that num equals to
one so finally what we are going to do
in this code that we are counting the
occurrences of each element so we are
using the for Loop and we are
maintaining it with the account okay now
as you would have got the idea regarding
this so let me write this variable now I
hope so till here you are clear with it
in the next we are going to collect
elements that appear more than once so
guys for key and value in counts. item
if the value is greater than one what we
can do we can upend that key okay I'll
show you right here what I mean so here
we can apply the for Loop so for
key comma value in
counts
in okay so for key value in counts.
items so if the
value is greater than one okay what we
are going to do we are going to append
this list so
duplicates do
append with the required
key okay now what we are going to do
finally and finally we are going to
return our duplicates
so finally this function is going to
return duplicates now let us have the
example usage for example we have we
have this input
array
say 1 2 3
1 3
6 comma
5 and the
result is equals to
find SL
duplicates and we are going to put the
input array
so now let us cross check the functions
we have so it is fine
duplicate this is we going to exclude
this now let us run our this code so it
says there is a error okay now let us
see what's the error in this so it says
for key and value in counts. item okay
so it says un inent does not match the
outer end so there's indentation problem
okay so guys as you can see all over
here we have given our duplicates 1 2 3
1 3 65 and we are finding the duplicates
in this input array and our result is 1
and three very easy so go through this
question this question has a high
probability of being asked in the
interview question so don't miss it out
now let us move to our third question so
guys our next question is that you have
to rotate a list to the right Pi K
places where K is a non- negative number
for example we have an input of 1 2 3 4
5 and k equals to 2 so your rotated
array is going to look like something 4
5 1 2 3 okay so basically when k equals
to 2 so 0 1 and two so after this all
the numbers are going to come first and
then in the same process like 1 2 and
three are going to go back so it's a
rotation problem and let us see how we
can approach this problem
so guys in order to solve this problem
of rotating a list right by ke places
where K is a non- negative you can use a
straightforward approach then this
involves slicing the list and
rearranging the parts but here's the
another way you can try it that is by
normalizing so guys since the rotating
the list by its length suppose it has a
length of n it results the same list so
you can normalize by K by taking K mod n
or k percentage n where N is a length of
the entire list so what is going to do
this is going to handle the cases where
K is greater than n okay so let us try
to see the problem so we have created a
function called def rotate list and I
have taken two parameters nums and K now
here I'm defining n as a length of the
given list so if n is equal to Z I want
it to return the nums okay the given
parameter which we have given okay the
length of the given list so now after
this we have to normalize so in order to
avoid like where K repeat where K
becomes greater than n so k equals to K
mod n so this is our normalization and
after this we are performing the
rotation so by Rotation by slicing so
rotated list equals to nums of minus K
Dot plus nums of K so this means that
till K you have to partition it okay and
after post of K you have to do the
partition and after that we are
returning the rotated list so you can
see in the input list we have 1 2 3 4 5
and here k equals to 2 so what is going
to return so the given list okay so K
dot means since two and post two and
pre2 so you have to take that into
consideration so guys after post we
adding the pre so for example K = to 2
so 0 1 and 2 so these comes so four and
five is be going to be put all over here
then after that pre of two are going to
be placed and finally we are
concatenating it so 45123 is going to be
our output so let us run this program
and we can see we are getting the output
4512 and three very easy problem okay
now let us move on to the next problem
so guys the next question is given an
integer array find the sum of largest
contiguous sub array within the array
for example given the array a equals to
0 -1 - 5 - 2 3 and 40 so it should
return 70 because of 3 and 14 so there's
a note also that if all the elements are
negative then it should return a zero so
it has given the case study for example
you have to consider an integer array
and you have to find the sum of largest
contiguous subarray so this is a subay
problem let us try to approach this so
for example we have the input list 0 -1
- 5 -2 3 and 40 so we have to take a
case on this and it should return 70 so
guys to solve this problem you can use
the cadan algorithm which efficiently
finds the maximum subarray within the
time complexity of O ofn and this
algorithm maintains the running sum of
Maximum sub array found so far and
updates it as it traverses the array
additionally to handle the case where
all the elements are negative so such
that you want to return zero in such a
case you can initialize the maximum sum
as zero so here's the python
implementation of the same so guys
here's the solution to this problem let
us Define the function diff Max subarray
and which is going to take nums as the
parameter now we are going to initialize
variables to tracks the current sum and
the best sum found so current sum equals
to zero and maximum sum is also equals
to zero then we have to Traverse through
the array and update the current sum and
Max sum accordingly so for example for
Num in nums okay then we have to update
the current sum and reset it to zero if
it becomes negative so if current sum is
less than zero then you have to put the
current sum equals to zero and then
update it with maximum sum equals to Max
of you can take a Max function then take
Max sum and the current sum and finally
we are returning the max sum this is
very easy so basically what we are doing
so we are taking two variable current
sum and Max sum and we are traversing
through this nums array and we are
finding that if our current sum is
equals to zero okay then we are updating
our current sum such that current sum
equals plus now okay so we are adding
the current sum with the given number
like the iter number basically we are
using for example if it is one so
current sum will be equals to Z so 0 + 1
will be there and then if it goes
negative so if current sum is less than
zero then we are putting it to zero very
easy suppose if you have negative
numbers in your array so that covers
this situation now I hope so you have
got the idea regarding the same and
finally we are taking the maximum of Max
sum and the current sum okay so in this
way we are going to print the maximum
part of it which is 70 now let us take
this and let us try to run our
application so you can see we have
printed 70 so this clearly covers the
idea regarding this question now let us
move to our next question so guys our
next question is Define tles and list in
Python and what are the major
differences between them so guys this is
one of the very basic question so in
Python list and tles both are sequence
data types that can store collection of
items they are used to store multiple
items in a single variable and have
several similarities but there are
significant differences that affect how
and when you should use each for example
if you take a list so a list in Python
is a mutable or changeable ordered
sequence of elements each element inside
a list can be accessed added edited or
removed and lists are defined by having
values between a square
bracket for example if we Define a list
say list l so which is equals to say 1 2
3 and also we can put
hello pretty fine and also we can add a
Boolean value so let's add
true now let us talk about the tles so a
tuple in Python is a immutable or
unchangeable ordered sequence of
elements this is very important and once
a tupple is created you cannot change
add or remove its elements tles are
defined by having values between
parenthesis and this way we cover the
definition of tles so for example if we
defined a tuple so it it is going to
look something like this so T equals to
say we take the parenthesis and suppose
we add 1 2 and three this forms our tle
now if we talk about the major
differences we know that in list are
mutable okay and tles are
immutable so that's a basic difference
next you can talk about their syntax so
like if you talk about list they use
square brackets whereas tles uses
parenthesis if we talk about performance
guys then tles are faster than list
because of their immutable nature of
tles Now list being mutable they are
slightly slower as compared to tupple
okay and they also require additional
operations for memory so in this way you
can differentiate between tles and list
now let us move on to our next question
so guys our next problem is on anagram
so it says given an array of strings
group anagrams together okay suppose we
have strings like eat T tan eight Nat
bat so our output should look like
something like this it should be eight
eat T natat tan and bat okay now to
solve the problem of grouping and
anagrams together forming a given array
of strings you can utilize a dictionary
to help organize words by their
signature so guys what's a signature a
signature can be formed by sorting the
characters in each string which ensures
that all anagrams will have the same
signatures so for example what we are
going to do we are going to create a
dictionary so you can use a dictionary
to map each sorted version of a string
such that the strings to a list of
strings can be added and when it is
sorted you can match that signature then
you you can use the sort each string for
each string in the list you can sort the
strings to generate its signature and
add the original string to the
corresponding list and then finally you
can collect the results so basically
here's a python implementation of the
scene so guys as you can see all over
here we have defined the function named
group anagrams and we have taken
arguments words so here's our dictionary
anagram dict then we are taking the for
BL and finally we are sorting it okay
with the empty string using the join
function okay and we are using the
sorted function then if sorted word not
in anagram dictionary then what we are
doing basically we are putting it into
this anagram dictionary with the
category of the sorted word which we
have created so this is the required
variable okay now this will be equals to
and word dictionary now finally if this
does not have happen then else you can
put anagram dictionary in the sorted
words and you can append that it in the
word so these are the certain things
where word is our iterator okay so this
is equals to a number which we are
basically storing so now finally we are
extracting the list so we are presenting
the groups into a list okay so finally
the dictionary is converted into the
list so list anagram dict value vales
and finally we are returning our result
so here is our input words and finally
we are calling our function with this
word as the parameter so let us run this
and let us see whether our output is
coming or not and we can see we are
getting the output of the anagram words
so eat T eight tan Nat and bat so we had
this as the anagrams are certain things
like suppose it is there so T is ending
with T so it is next word is starting
with t you can see the next word is
ending with a and here the next word is
starting so similarly tan and Nat are
grouped and bat are grouped so what we
have to do all over here the entire
logic Remains the Same and it is here so
you have to create a variable all over
here sorted word and let's say be empty
and you have to join it with the word
word means in the G dictionary whatever
the word like eat T tan so initially we
are putting it in empty words now if
this word okay if this sorted word is
not in anagram dictionary means it is
not present in our dictionary so we can
just do what we can put this in our
dictionary so we can take this parameter
as sorted word okay and put that word in
this so similarly like we are grouping
in this case like eat and T okay now now
else if it is not present in our
dictionary so anagram sorted dictionary
is appending that word okay so here the
assignment is happening and here we are
appending it so finally what results us
e te eight tan Nate and bat very tricky
question has a higher probability to be
asked in the exam now let us move on to
our next
question so guys our next question is
given an integer n and integer K output
a list of all combinations of K numbers
chosen from 1 to n for example if n
equals to 3 and K = 2 you have to return
1 2 1 3 and 2 3 so how is this going to
happen so guys this is going to happen
by generating all the possible
combinations of K numbers from set of
numbers ranging from 1 to n you can use
this so there is a Python's iter tools.
combination function and and this
function is designed to generate the
combination without repetition based on
the specified length so how you can do
this so for example you can import iter
tool okay from combinations and then you
can generate the given combinations so
let me show you so guys as you can see
all over here I am importing iter tools
from combinations then I am creating a
function Dev generate combinations NK is
a given parameter okay where I'm
creating a range from 1 to n so range
function I'm using and I'm putting this
from 1 to n + one and I'm storing this
into the variable or assigning it into a
variable called numbers then I'm using
ID tools. combinations to generate all
the combination of the length ke and
finally we are converting it into a list
and storing it in the result so in this
function basically what we are doing so
we can see there is a range 1 + n + one
so this is B basically generating the
numbers from one up to n and the
combinations of number comma K you can
see so in this line so what this is
basically doing this is producing the
combination of numbers in numbers okay
taking k at a time so each combination
is returned as a tle and all the
combinations are stored in a list so
this output of tles in the list
represents the combination of numbers
chosen so if you need them in specific
format like list of list instead of list
of tles you can convert them accordingly
now let us run our code and we can see
we are getting it in the form as 1 2 1 3
and 23 so this is generating the same
and so we are getting an output of list
of all the combination of K numbers
chosen from 1 to n so in this scenario I
have put Nal to 3 and k equal 2 very
amazing question has a higher
probability to be asked in the exam now
let us discuss the next question so guys
our next question is pretty interesting
and it says write a function to generate
n samples from a normal distribution and
plot them on the histogram so guys in
order to solve this question you need to
know about normal
distribution so to generate the samples
from a normal distribution you can plot
them on the histogram so you can use
Python's Library called as numpy for the
generation of samples and mat plot flip
for plotting the histogram
so here's the implementation so guys as
you can see all over here we are
importing numpy as NP and we are
importing the mat plot lib okay then
finally we are defining a function plot
normal distribution samples and here we
have to take the three parameters the
first one is n second one is mean and
the third one is standard deviation we
have initialized mean equals to Zer and
standard deviation equals to one then we
are generating n samples from a normal
distribution with specified mean
standard deviation and with that we are
going to plot the histogram so it's more
of a mathematical problem but if you
have a little bit idea regarding normal
distribution you can achieve this so we
can see there is a parameter n where the
N denotes a number of samples okay and
mean is there for the normal
distribution and similarly we have
included standard deviation for the
normal distribution finally here we are
generating the samples so samples equals
to we are using the numpy library so np.
random. normal okay and I have given lo
location equals to mean scale is
standard deviation and of the size n so
it is very standard and after that we
are plotting the histogram with PLT do
HT so I have taken samples then bins
equals to 30 H Color we have given black
and Alpha equals to
0.7 and finally we are putting the title
as histogram distribution sample on the
X level there is a value and Y is
frequency and we have put the grid as
true and finally we are asking it to
show it now let us run this so we can
see it has generated the histogram of
normal distribution samples very
interesting question I hope so you are
clear with it now let us move on to the
next question now guys let us take a
question from pandas a very popular
Library so the question says that what
is the difference between apply and
apply math map functions in pandas so
guys in pandas the functions apply and
apply map serve different purposes
although they both apply a function
along the x-axis of the data frame or in
Panda series but here you can use them
so for example in apply is used to apply
a function along the axis of the data
frame so it can be either a row or a
column it can be used to operate on the
entire row or column at once and this
function is extremely flexible and can
return a single value or a series or
even a data frame then if we talk about
flexibility guys it works on a complete
row or column and can be used to
implement aggregation transformation and
other operations that consider multiple
elements at once so for example let me
show you so say we have
this
import pandas as PD okay then we can
Define our data frame so DF equals to PD
do data
frame and find the here we can give as
a all over here and we can give the
value as list as 1 2 and
three
similarly we can change the given
thing as we
and we can change this value as
four five and
six and finally we have closing this so
by applying a function to each column
say default axis equals to zero so we
can store the result certain something
like this so let us create the variable
called result and this is equals to say
DF do apply okay and we can use our
Lambda expression so
Lambda
X and here we can take x.
Max okay
minus x.
Min pretty fine so we are applying a
function to each column all over here
and if you talk about like
apply map so apply map is used to apply
a function to each elements of the data
frame so this method is available only
for data frames not for series object
that is the most important thing and if
you talk about element wise operation so
apply map operates element wise and it
is very suitable for operations that
depend on the value of the single cell
and they do not need to consider other
elements in the row or column so guys
that was a basic difference between
apply and apply MTH functions now let us
move on to the next question so guys our
next question is on strings and it says
given a string return the first
occurrence character in it so on none if
there is no recurring character for
example if the input is python interview
questions and the output is n so as you
can see N is a recurring alphabet so we
have to find the recurring character in
this given string so guys to find the
first recurring character in a string
you can use a python function that
tracks a character you have seen as you
iterate through the string you can
utilize a set to efficiently check if a
character has appeared before so for
that here's a simple implementation so
guys as you can see all over here we
have defined the function first
recurring character and we are taking
input string as a given argument now
here is the variable called scene and it
is stored as a set now let us iterate
through the each character in the string
so for C in input string if car is
present in this set so what I want to do
I want to return the first recurring
character then finally we are adding
this character into the set if it is not
already seen and if it is not present we
are returning the none very basic for
Loop and conditionals we have applied
okay now in this we are presenting the
input string okay and let's see what our
output would be when we are calling the
given function so you can see we are
getting output of n so this is very
basic guys and I hope so you have got a
brief idea regarding this now let us
move on to our next question so guys as
you can see our next question is given a
positive integer X return an integer
that is a factorial of x if a negative
integer is provided it should return
minus one and implement the solution
using recursive function so guys we have
got a problem on recursion and it is
mostly asked in TCS or extensiones
interview question so whenever you are
having a technical round so you're going
to have a higher probability to be asked
now let us see the solution of this
question so guys to calculate the
factorial of a given positive integer X
using recursion and to return minus one
for negative integers you can Implement
a simple recursive function so here's
how you can do it so you can see all
over here we have defined a function def
factorial X okay so if we are hitting
our base case means x equals to Z what
we returning it as one and if the input
is negative we are returning minus one
as indicated and finally we can see a
recursive case so if it is not hitting
both of the cases then we are basically
returning X into X factorial x - one so
basically what it is doing guys so say
if we put xals to0 so we know that we
are getting its factorial as 1 now we
are getting factorial of one now if x is
greater than 0 say suppose we are taking
one so 1 into factorial of 0 so
factorial of 0 is 1 so 1 into 0 will be
1 similarly next if x = 2 so 2 into
factorial of 1 so it becomes two so you
can see we are going to get a series of
multiplication so in that way we can
find this solution using recursion so
let us try to print the output so we can
see we are getting output as 120 min-1
and 1 so we have finally completed this
problem using recursion definitely try
this problem guys one of the most
frequent asked questions in the
interview now let us move on to our next
question so guys our next question is
given an M byn Matrix with positive
integers determine the length of longest
path of increasing within the Matrix for
example let us see so guys in order to
find the longest increasing path in an M
* n Matrix of positive integers you can
use a technique called depth first
search approach and combined with
memorization this problem is going to
involve exploring all the possible parts
from each cell and caching the result to
avoid redundant computation now so in
this approach we are using DFS with
memorization for each cell in The Matrix
use DFS to explore possible increasing
path starting from the cell then cure
the length of the longest path starting
from the each cell to avoid the
recomputation then also go on the edge
conditions like you will only move to
the adjacent cells that contain a higher
value to ensure that the path is
increasing finally you have to implement
the steps so you can create a DFS
function that explores all the four
possible directions like up down left
and right and it is returning the length
of the longest path and finally use
memorization table a 2d list basically
to store the length of the longest path
starting from each cell iterate over
each cell in The Matrix and you can
initiate a DFS if the cell hasn't been
explored so here is the implementation
of the same so guys as you can see all
over here we have created a function
called def longest increasing path and
we have taken an argument called Matrix
so if not Matrix or Matrix is present
okay then we are returning it zero and
finally we are defining our DFS function
with in as the two given variable so if
it is already computed then return the
cached value so if memo of I and J is
not equal to zero we are returning the
given memo then we are exploring all the
possible four directions like 0 1 1 0
0us and minus one 0 so it is denoting
the up left right and bottom and say we
have initialized our maximum length as
one okay so in order to find the DI and
DG means the distance what we are taking
the two variables as n i and NJ okay and
we are incrementing it with I I and G
and then finally we are using IF ni I is
greater than Zer it is less than M and
NJ is greater than equal to Zer and less
than n so finally at the Matrix is also
we are seeing in this Matrix we are
seeing that ni and NJ should be greater
than the Matrix of i g then finally we
are printing the maximum length so using
the max function we are finding the
maximum length and we are returning this
DFS and finally we are storing the memo
of IJ equals to maximum length so which
is basically our cache length and
finally we are returning the maximum
length so you can see later on what we
are doing we have taken m&n and we are
multiplying the length of the Matrix
into length of the Matrix zero so later
on we have created the variable called
memo all over here and in this we are
multiplying it with n okay for element
at zero index and in the range of M and
we initialized our result equals to zero
then we can start DFS from each cell for
I in range of M for G in the range of n
we can result equals to maximum result
of DFS i g so here we can see the Matrix
of 994 6x8 211 so let us see what is our
longest increasing path so this was the
basic idea regarding the code the code
can see a little bit more exhaustive but
if you try to do it with the concept it
will be solvable now we can see the
longest path it's showing is four so
this is the output of our given problem
so let us go again with this problem so
here basically in this what we are doing
is we are traveling from 1 to 2 2 to 6
and 9 so that has become the four okay
so this is our longest increasing path
so 1 to two Okay then 2 to six then 6 to
9 so this is our maximum path we can
follow so four is the given output now
let me go through this problem once
again for example here we have taken a
DFS function okay so this DFS function
is called recursively to explore each
Direction it checks whether a move is
valid stays within the bound or moves a
higher value then you can see we have
taken the use of memorization so memo of
I andj is towards the length of the
longest increasing path from cell IJ so
guys this reduces the time complexity by
avoiding the recalculating parts of the
same cell then we are doing the result
calculation so we are iterating through
each cell starting a DFS if the longest
path from that cell has not been
computed then we are printing the
maximum value obtained from all the dfl
calls and that is our result so this
approach is basically efficient for
matrices where many values are not
recomputed due to caching thus making it
a feasible for larger matrices
so that's the solution of this problem
now let us move to our next problem so
guys our next question is explain flask
what flask is and its benefits so guys
as we all know that flask is a popular
microwave framework written in Python it
is called micro framework because it
does not require particular tools or
libraries it has no database abstraction
layer form validation on any other
components where pre-existing third
libraries provide common function
however flas supports extensions that
can add application features like here
we can say suppose if you want to add
Simplicity
flexibility okay lightweight features
then you can use it flask is also
extensible that it can be extended with
extensions available to additional
functionality like object relational
mappers form validation upload handling
and various open authentication
Technologies and several common
Frameworks related tool then you can
also say it has a built-in developer
server and debugger so flask also
includes a buil-in server and debugger
which makes it easy to develop and test
your applications locally so this is
flask and these are some of its benefits
now let us move on to the next question
so guys our next question is what is the
difference between list arrays and sets
in Python and when you should use each
of them very basic question guys so guys
in Python list arrays and sets are all
contained data types that store
collection of items each type serves a
different purposes and use in specific
scenarios depending on the needs of the
program so for example list list are
like are one of the most versatile data
structures in Python they are ordered
mutable and can hold a heterogeneous
assortment of objects then if I talk
about characteristics lists are ordered
meaning that the items have been defined
in order and that order will not change
until unless you change it so guys as
you can see all over here that lists are
mutable meaning you can change their
content without changing their identity
they can also have a duplicate element
in a list so it is always advisable to
use list when you need an ordered
collections that can change and might
include the duplicate entries suitable
for the cases where you need to perform
frequent read and write operations now
if I talk about arrays arrays in context
of python arrays module or the numpy
arrays are specifically optimized for
numerical data and offer more storage
efficiency and operations which are
tailored to numerical processing like
you can use numpy arrays and a situation
when an extensive set of operations are
for mathematical and logical based
arrays are also mutable and ordered so
you can use arrays when you need to
store large amount of numerical data for
scientific Computing or other operations
that require efficient and compact
storage with vectorized operations like
for data analysis machine learning or
any task that requires efficient array
computation the next one is sets so guys
sets are unordered collection of unique
elements they are like mutable and
provide operations to perform common
sets of operations like unions
intersections differences and symmetric
differences sets are like unordered so
they do not record element in position
or order of insertion we can use sets
whenever you need to ensure that element
appears only once in a collection so
ideal for membership testing removing
duplicates from sequence performing
mathematical set operations like Union
intersection symmetric Etc so this was
all about this question now let us move
on to our next question so guys let us
move to our final question that is what
are some of the common ways to handle
missing data in Python and which method
do you prefer and why so guys as we all
know that handling missing data is a
crucial aspect of data pre-processing
especially in real world scenarios where
data incompleteness can skew or
invalidate analysis python particularly
with libraries like pandas and numpy
provides robust methods for dealing with
missing data so here are some of the
common strategies the first one that is
is removing
data okay so like dropping rows or
columns with missing values using dropn
function okay so you can can use when
this data set is too large or when the
missing data is not significant and it
is not likely to introduce bias so in
that scenarios you can use it there are
certain drawbacks to it like you can use
valuable data also that could be
critical for analysis the second
technique that comes up to my mind is
imputation so guys when you're filling
missing values with either a test
statistic like mean median mode okay for
numerical data or frequent category for
categorial data this can be done using
fil now or a simple imputer from sk.
impute so you can use it when the
Integrity is crucial and you cannot
afford to lose data points a drawback of
this is that potentially it is
introducing bias or affecting the
distribution of the data so using
algorithms is a third
part repeat
so third one is predicting the missing
values using algorithms to predict
missing values based on other data in a
data sets techniques can range from
simple linear regression to more complex
approaches like K nearest neighbors or
random Forest so when the missing values
are substantial and there's a reasonable
hypothesis that other variables can
predict the missing values so you can
use this so it is computationally
intensive and can overfit if not
properly tuned next one is using a
constant to fill the missing
data so guys filling missing data with a
constant is not present in the data
likeus 999 for instance like to
differentiate the real data from the FI
ons so often used in modeling
competition or specific algorithms that
can handle peculiar values and interpret
them appropriately the drawback of this
is that it can skew the analysis if not
handled correctly so Guys these were
some of the common ways to handle the
missing data in the python now for me I
would like to prefer the imputation
because imputation combined with
indicator variables especially for data
sets where missing values are
informative so guys in this way it can
yield a better result thanks for
