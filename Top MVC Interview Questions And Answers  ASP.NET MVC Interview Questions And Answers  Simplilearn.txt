hey everyone welcome to another video by
simply learn in this video we will go
through asp.net mvc interview questions
if you're looking for a job that
involves knowledge of asp.net mvc here
are some of the important asp.net mvc
interview questions and answers
that will help you get confident and
feel better while giving an interview
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn
so without wasting any further time
let's get started
we will start with the beginner level
asp.net mvc interview questions and
answers
what is mvc
mvc is a software architectural pattern
that divides an application into three
major components
mvc stands for model view and controller
the model represents the shape of the
data and stores the data that it
retrieves from the database
view view is a user interface used to
represent the data of the application as
tables charts and diagrams it also
communicates with model and controllers
easily
controller
the controller in mvc holds the user's
request it handles the http request made
by the user
explain the lifecycle of mvc
lifecycle is a series of steps used to
handle the request to change the state
of the application
the lifecycle of mbc is divided into two
categories
application lifecycle and request
lifecycle
application lifecycle runs the iis
application until it stops
the request lifecycle handles the http
request of the application
list the advantages of using mvc
mvc has a lot of advantages with
building the application some of them
are mvc provides separation of
components that allows the reuse of
applications across the several
platforms
mvc allows applications to change
features like layouts fonts and colors
without affecting the entire
architecture of the application
mvc uses asynchronous techniques to
build applications that can be easy for
a developer to build application in a
faster and secure way
what are the actions and list a few of
them
action methods in mvc execute the
request and generate the response
actions have one-to-one mapping with the
user
here is a list of few of the actions
content result it returns a string file
path result it returns the file path
content file content result it returns
file content
javascript result it returns the script
for execution json result it returns
json formatted data view result it helps
to receive a response for the view
engine
and file stream result it returns file
content and redirect to result it helps
to redirect to the specified url
what are actions filters and list the
types of action filters
action filters are attributes that apply
to the controller or a controller action
that helps in modifying the executed
actions
mvc framework includes several actions
some of them are
output catch output catch catches the
output of a controller at a specific
time
handle error handle error handles the
error when it executes an action
authorize authorize enables you to
restrict access for a control
what are action verbs
action verbs are http request applied to
the action methods to work for http
request methods
some of the action verbs are http post
http get http put and http delete
what are code blocks in mvc
code blocks in mvc are used to enclose
c-sharp statements
this is an example for code blocks it
starts with the symbol at the rate and
encloses with curly braces code blocks
work with loops and keywords in
different ways
what are helpers in mvc and is the types
of helpers
helpers in mvc are html classes that
help to create html control
programmatically
html helpers in mvc generate html and
result as a string
some of the different types of helper
methods that asp.net provides are create
links
create links is to get the information
from the routing tables
create inputs this helps to create text
boxes and buttons create form
handle post back to an action on a
different controller
what are non-action methods
non-action methods are attributes used
when a public method in a controller
does not want an action method
here is an example that shows how to
create a non-action method in mvc
what is model binding
model binding in mvc allows mapping the
http request data with the models using
the data sent by the browser in an http
request
model binding also acts as a bridge
between the http request and c-sharp
action methods
using model binding it automatically
transfers post and get into a specified
data explain the process of validation
in mvc
validation in mvc is used to check the
user input and provides a set of
validation that is easy to use and
powerful to check the errors of the user
what is a partial view
partial view is a view that is rendered
from the another view which helps to
break the larger view into smaller views
a partial view is also used to reduce
the duplication of the common markup
content across the markup files
what are logic layers
the logic layer defines and decides the
information needed to solve the assigned
problems
logic layers in mvc are divided into
three types
business layer display layer and input
control layer
what are the drawbacks of mpc
there are many advantages and
disadvantages of using mvc applications
you will now understand some of the
disadvantages of using them
mvc is not suitable for large type
applications the complexity of the
applications is high using mvc
it is difficult to understand the design
pattern in mvc
deployment of applications is hard
compared to the other applications
what are file extensions for razer view
laser is a view engine used to write the
mix of html and server side
it is also a general purpose template
engine that does not provide any ties to
the mvc which allows the creation of
view engine inside the application razer
in mvc contains razer markup c-sharp and
html
file extensions of razer view are
divided into two types
dot cs html used for c-sharp dot vb html
used for visual basic
what is an unobtrusive ajax
it is a progressive enhancement that
focuses on the delivery of the content
ajax calls in unobtrusive ajax which are
made through built-in helpers to
eliminate the need to add the blocks of
code
what are get and post actions
get in mvc is used to request the data
from a specific resource it is the most
common http method
below is the syntax of get action
post is used to send data to the server
to create and update a resource
below is the syntax of post action
now let us look at intermediate level
interview questions
what is a razor
razor is a view engine used to write the
mix of html and server side it is also a
general purpose template engine that
does not provide any ties to mvc which
allows creating a view engine inside the
application
below is the syntax
in c sharp it is dot c s html in visual
basic it is dot v b html
what is exceptional handling in mvc
exceptional handling in mvc is used to
execute the action methods using try and
catch blocks
it is the process for responding to the
exceptional condition for the special
processing
for example here in this program you
will create an exception for the
application that shows an error on the
web page that displays a custom error
message or custom error pages
what is a layout view layout view in mvc
allows creating a common site template
that inherits multiple views to provide
a consistent look for an application
the layout view has the same extension
as other views which you can store in
the shared folder
esp.net mvc layout allows the child
views using some methods like render
section method and render body method
what are web apis
web api is a platform used to build
restful applications using dotnet
frameworks that include small and large
application for devices tablets and
mobile devices
here is an example for web apis this is
a basic program to add the configuration
of web api in the configuration folder
of the mvc application using the name
web api config
what is form authentication in mvc
form authentication in mvc is
responsible for users credentials like
sign up sign in login and log out
it also provides a way to handle
authentication using custom logics in
asp.net applications
you can do form authentication using the
sql database to provide the user
credentials and information
it is used to edit the web configuration
files and
add a login page to authenticate
explain bootstrap and its use
bootstrap is a front-end framework tool
used for web applications to build a
user interface using html css and
javascript
it was first developed by twitter
developers for personal use and became
popular with the designer and developers
with flexibility
bootstrap provides all pieces of layouts
menus fonts widgets and other many
features you can find bootstrap files in
the solution explorer as bootstrap.css
and bootstrap.js
what are glimpse in mvc
glimpse in mvc is a free and open source
nugget platform used to perform
operations like performance debugging
and diagnosis for the applications it
allows users to find information about
every action by the server including the
azure test in the application
list the types of action results in mvc
action result is an action method used
along with an action it is the result of
action execution the action result is a
return type
action results are divided in mvc into
three categories status results content
returning result and redirection result
status result provide the status of the
code to the browser content returning
result is responsible for returning the
content
and redirection result redirects the
specified url
what is a request lifecycle
request lifecycle is a sequence of
events that occur when the application
handles the http request
request lifecycle involves 5 steps
routing mvc handler controller action
invoker and result execution
routing is used to map the incoming url
to the router and creates request
content and sends it to the next layer
mbc handler is responsible for creating
the controller instance
controller is used to deal with the
request and implement the controller
interface
action invoker is used to execute the
action method sent by the controller
result execution is responsible for the
execution of action method in the
controller
explain the ways of adding the
constraints to a router
constraints to a router in mvc are added
in two ways
using the object that implements the
router constraint interface
or using the regular expressions
explain routing in mvc
routing is the process of mapping the
browser request to the controller and
responding back
router handles the information and url
patterns in routing and it stores all
the configured files to the application
in the routing tables
routing in mvc is divided into two types
convention based routing and attribute
based routing
this is an example of registering the
routing with different custom routes
using the name default
the default maps with the url pattern in
the routing table
what is output caching
output caching is responsible for
improving the performance of the
application
it also enables you to remove unwanted
actions
below is the example for output catching
mention the benefits of areas
areas in mvc allow to organize the
models views and controllers into a
separate function in the application
like building support etc
let's see some benefits of using areas
in mvc
using areas it is easy to perform unit
testing it allows you to separate the
functional sections of the applications
it also helps in communicating with the
other areas by creating another area
what is a view start
view start is introduced by a view
engine that applies to all views
automatically below is an example for
reviewed sort
what is attribute routing
attribute routing is a type of routing
that provides more control over the url
by defining routers directly on the
actions and controller in the
application
some of the advantages of using
attribute routing are it reduces the
chance of errors in the application
it is easy to map routes pointing to the
same action it provides more control
over the url
how to change the action names in mvc
the action name attribute is used to
change the action name in mvc
explain data annotations
data annotations in mvc are responsible
for providing the instance checking for
the client side
mvc provides various data annotations
some of them are required is used to
indicate the property of the required
field
string length is used to indicate the
string length
bind is used to include or exclude the
binding parameters
email address is used to value the email
address
what is the difference between mvc and
web forms
mvc is based on a design pattern that
helps to create the application faster
web forms are based on functions and
code behind
mvc provides html helpers to create the
controls whereas in web form every
control in web form has server control
mvc is used to create partial views
and web forms are used to create user
controls there is no view state in mvc
view state in waveforms is used to
maintain the state
it is easy to use jquery javascript and
css in
web forms use a little jquery and
javascript
differentiate between view bag and view
data
view bag is used to transfer the
temporary data from the controller to
our view
view data is used to transfer data from
the controller to the view
view bag is a type of object whereas
view data is a key value collection
view bag is slower than view data and
view data is faster than view back
view back works only on dot net 4.0 and
above
view data works on dot net 3.5 and above
view bag is used as dynamic so no need
for type conversion
whereas in view data type conversion is
required
explain scaffolding in mvc
scaffolding is a technique used as code
generation for asp.net web applications
it also generates code for crude
operations using the entity framework
models
it reduces the time and generates clean
code while creating the application it
is automatically installed in visual
studio 2013 and above versions
explain the difference between temp data
and view back
temp data is a key value collection
whereas view bag is a type of object
temp data is used to pass data between
two consecutive requests
view bag values becomes null
temp data works during the current and
subsequent request view back works only
at the current time temp data works on
dot net 3.5 and above view bag works
with dot net 4.0 and above
explain the difference between render
page and render body
render page is a layout page that
contains content filled by the other
pages
whereas render body is a method of
master page or razor commonly used as a
layout page
render page is obviously present in the
layout view
render body doesn't have a fixed path
render page does not include any
parameters
but render body always includes the
parameters like boolean
multiple methods are not allowed in
render page
render body allows multiple methods
list a few rules of resourcing resource
is a view engine used to create web
applications by combining the features
of mvc
there are certain rules to be followed
for the razor they are
razor block having c sharp and enclosed
with
curly braces
variables are always declared with the
var keyword
variables and functions within line
always start with the symbol at the rate
c sharp file has an extension of dot cs
html
scored statements always end with
semicolon
now let us look at the advanced level
interview questions
what are bundling and minification
bundle is a logical group of physical
files used to improve the performance of
the application by providing the inbuilt
features bundled into a single file
which improves the performance using
http request known as bundling
this program below shows all the bundles
of css files present in the folder of
only
minification is a technique of removing
the unnecessary comments and characters
from css and javascript to reduce the
size to improve the performance of the
application
below is the example of minification
it alerts if the number is even or if
the number is odd
what is json binding
json binding is known as javascript
object notation binding that supports
mvc3 using json value provider factory
it allows action methods to accept and
model bind data in json
binding this is a simple program that
shows how to bind data using json
binding
what is cross domain ajax
hx cross domain sends a request to
refresh the url domain of the web pages
there are many ways to implement and use
the cross domain ajax the most commonly
used cross domain ajax are send json
pre-request and cross domain resource
sharing
explain the usage of remote validation
in mvc
remote validation is the process of
validating specific data posting to a
server without posting the entire data
to the server
this program on remote validation helps
in checking the validation of the user
using the parameter username and the
displays the message name already exists
list the standard html helpers in mvc
standard html helpers in mvc are used to
render the html controls like label text
box password checkbox etc
some of the standard html helpers in mvc
are html text box it is used to create a
text box html password this is used to
create a text box with password identity
next we have html check box it is used
to create the property in the check box
html radio button it automatically
displays the property in the radio
button
explain the implementation of ajax in
mvc
ajax is asynchronous javascript and xml
client-side script that communicates to
the database without any need from the
postback it also speeds the response's
time in the application
below is the syntax
of ajax in mbc
explain about mvc model binders
model binders in mvc allow mapping http
request with the model
it works when a user requests the data
from the browser to the controller at
this time model binding works on
middleman to map the incoming request
with the controller action method
update model method function observes
the request and updates the model class
this program is process of adding the
controller with the index action method
to the mvc
explain areas in mvc
areas in mvc allow organizing the model
view and controllers into a separate
function in the application like
building support etc
it is mainly used for large applications
when the developer or user is working
with the area it is important to
register with the areas
the syntax for registering the areas is
as follows
in this each mvc has its own area folder
that allow it to keep controllers models
and views separately
explain the roles of presentation
abstraction and control in mvc
presentation obstruction and control is
an architectural pattern that separates
mvc interactive system into three types
of components
presentation
presentation in mvc is responsible for
formats of the visual and audio
presentation of the data
abstraction is responsible for
retrieving information and processing
the data
control handles the flow of control the
communication between two components
explain the uses of keep and peak in mvc
keep in mbc is used to preserve the data
of stem data after the value is read
peak in mvc is used to read the value in
temp data without clearing the data
here are some differences between keep
and peak
key provides two overloading methods
whereas peak provides
no overloading method
once the data is read by the keep then
the data is erased
the data in peak remains the same after
the operation is successful
in keep redirect to result and redirect
to route result are called to get the
items back
in peak there is no action called by the
peak internally to retrieve
