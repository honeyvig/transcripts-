hey everyone welcome to Simply learn
today we'll be discussing the road map
to become full stack professional or
developer so let's understand this with
the help of an example imagine having
the ability to build an entire web
application from the userfriendly
interface that people interact with to
the powerful serers side logic that
processes and stores their data for
instance think about creating a popular
app like Instagram as a full step
developer you would design the front end
including the layout mes and interactive
elements while also developing the back
end that manages user accounts stores
photos and handles data securely full
stock development is all about
versatility and mastering a range of
skills across both the front end and the
back end this comprehensive knowledge
allows you to ensure that every part of
your application works seamlessly
together providing a smooth and engaging
user experience it's a journey of
continuous learning and practice but the

expressjs react and nodejs along with
Git HTML CSS and JavaScript to build and
deploy interactive applications and
services you can check out the link in
the description box and pin comment so
let's get started so let's get started
with introduction to fullstack
development so guys fullstack
development involves working on both the
front end and the backend web
applications as a fullstack developer
will handle everything from user
interfaces to server management making
you a versatile asset in the tech
industry and if we talk about frontend
development so it focuses on the part of
the application that users interact with
directly this includes the layout design
and interactive elements of a website or
app you'll use languages like HTML CSS
and JavaScript to create a seamless and
engaging user experience on the other
hand backend development deals with the
server side of the application and this
includes managing databases server logic
and application architecture and you
will work with serers side languages
such as nodejs python or Ruby and handle
data storage with databases like MySQL
or mongod TV and as a full stack
developer you combine both these skill
sets allowing you to build complete
applications from start to finish and
this versatility makes you a valuable
asset because you can understand and
manage both the client side and server
side of applications ensuring they work
together smoothly now we'll start with
the road map and the first thing to
learn to become a fullstack developer is
learn the basics of web development so
to start your journey as a full step
developer you need to learn the basics
of web development and this includes
understanding the core technologies that
form the foundation of web applications
so the topics to cover are number one is
HTML that is hypertext markup language
and this is the standard markup language
used to create web pages it structures
the content on the web page that is you
can learn HTML with the understanding
the basic tags and how they structure a
web page and for the HTML project you
can create a simple web page with
headings paragraphs links and images now
moving to the next technology that is
CSS that is cascading stylesheets so
this language is used to describe the
presentation of a document written in
HTML it controls the layout colors fonts
and overall style of the web page and to
learning that you can explore how to
style your HTML using CSS learn about
selectors properties and values and you
can style your HTML Page by adding
colors fonts and layout adjustments and
then comes the JavaScript so it's a
programming language that allows you to
create dynamically updating content and
you can control multimedia animate
images and much more and you can
understand the basics of JavaScript such
as variables functions loops and events
and you can add interactivity to your
HTML Pages such as form validation for a
simple image gallery and with a solid
foundation in the these basics of web
development that is HTML CSS and
JavaScript you can now move on to
mastering front-end Frameworks and
libraries that will enable you to build
more Dynamic and responsive applications
so now you have got the basics of web
development it's time to dive deeper
into frontend Frameworks and these tools
help you build more complex interactive
and efficient web applications so you
can cover the number one that is react
so it's a JavaScript library for
building user interfaces particularly
single P applications where you need a
fast and interactive user experience and
then comes angular that is a platform
and framework for building single page
client applications using HTML and
typescript and then we have vuejs that's
a progressive JavaScript framework used
for building user interfaces and single
page applications if we talk about how
you can learn them so you can learn
react you can start by understanding The
Core Concepts of react such as
components GSX State and propes and you
can build a simple application like a
to-do list or a weather app to get
hands-on experience and if we talk about
angular you can explore angular's core
features such as modules components
services and dependency injection and
you can create a simple project like a
task manager or a data dashboard to
practice these Concepts now talking
about VJs you can get familiar with VJs
reactivity system directives and
components and you can develop a small
application like a not taking app to
apply what you have learned and you
could have another examples and use
cases that is for react you can build a
dynamic user interface that updates in
real time and similarly you can go with
angular and vuejs now with a strong
grasp of front-end Frameworks and
libraries you have now equipped to
create engaging and dynamic user
interfaces next we will explore the
backend development to understand how to
manage server side operations and
databases so understanding backend
development so after mastering the front
end it's essential to understand backend
development and this involves handling
server side operations databases and
application logic which are crucial to
building fully functional web
applications and we can cover number one
is serers side languages so you can
learn languages such as node.js python
or Ruby so these languages allow you to
write the logic that runs on the server
and after that we can learn the
Frameworks and you can explore
Frameworks that simplify backend
development like expressjs or nodejs
Jango for Python and Ruby on Rails for
Ruby and then comes the databases so you
can understand both SQL that is my SQL
or post SQL and no SQL that is mongodb
databases which are used to store and
manage data now we talk about learning
serers side languages here comes the
nodejs that's a JavaScript runtime built
in Chrome so you can enable JavaScript
to be used for server side scripting and
you can start by building simple server
side scripts for example create a server
that responds with hello world when
accessed
and if we talk about python you could
have a versatile language known for its
readability and efficiency you can
explore basic scripting and automation
task and talking about SQL databases you
can learn to interact with relational
databases using SQL and create and
manage tables and write queries to fetch
data so with a solid understanding of
backend development you are now equipped
to handle serers side logic manage
databases and build complete web
applications next we will look into the
how to manage databases more efficiently
and integrate them with your
applications so now we learn database
management so to become a proficient
fullstack developer understanding
database management is essential and
databases are critical for storing and
retrieving the data that your
application use you can start with SQL
databases like MySQL and post SQL which
use structured query language to manage
data in a structured format like table
rows and columns and learn how to create
and manage databases and write queries
to insert update delete and retrieve
data designing relational databases for
various applications is crucial for
managing structured data efficiently for
instance you can design a database for
an online bookstore with tables for
books authors and ERS this will help you
understand how to structure data and
perform operations like joints and
aggregations to retrieve complex data
sets now coming to no SQL databases so
on the other hand we can explore no SQL
databases like mongodb which which store
data in a flexible Json like format
making them suitable for unstructured
data you can gain skills in creating and
managing Collections and documents and
perform CED operations to handle data
efficiently for example building a
database for a blogging platform where
each blog post is a document in a
collection will give you hands-on
experience in managing unstructured data
this is particularly useful for
applications requiring flexible schemas
and high scalability and you can
integrate databases with applications
that are third option so integrating
databases with your application is also
crucial you can learn how to connect
your backend server to the database
using om that is object relational
mapping tools like SQL I for nodejs SQL
Alchemy for python or active record for
Ruby on Rails so these tools help
simplify database interactions and allow
you to work with database records as if
they were objects in your programming
language for example creating a restful
API that interacts with the database to
manage your user data for a web
application will give you practical
experience in building full-fledged
applications that can handle Dynamic
content and user interactions now that
you have a good understanding of
database management system with learning
all three formats that is SQL no SQL and
integrating database with applications
the next step is to get comfortable with
Version Control which is essential for
managing and tracking changes in your
code so Version Control is essential for
managing and tracking changes in your
code you can start by learning git that
is a widely used version control system
that helps you keep track of different
versions of your code and collaborate
with others you can use platforms like
GitHub gitlab or bit bucket to host your
repositories and manage your code online
you can practice creating repositories
making commits branching and merging
changes understanding these Concepts
will allow you to work effectively in
teams contribute to open source projects
and ensure your code is organized and
error free for instance for instance
create a GitHub repository for projects
to track changes and collaborate with
others seamlessly and with a strong
understanding of Version Control you are
now ready to explore DeVos practices and
deployment which are crucial for
delivering your applications efficiently
so after Version Control you should
learn this that is understanding devops
so devop practices and deployment are
crucial for delivering applications
efficiently devops combine software
development that is Dev and it
operations to shorten the development
life cycle and provide continuous
delivery you can learn about continuous
integration and continuous deployment
cicd pipelines which automate testing
and deployment processes you can
familiarize yourself with Cloud
platforms like AWS Azure and Google
Cloud which offer services to host and
manage your applications and practicing
deployment on a projects on these
platforms will help you understand how
to manage servers databases and
networking ensuring your applications
are always available and scalable and
with knowledge of devops and deployment
practices you well equipped to deliver
robust applications next let's focus on
building projects and creating a
portfolio to Showcase your skills so
building real world projects and
creating a portfolio are essential to
Showcase your skills and attract
potential employers so start by
developing projects that incorporate
both front-end and backend Technologies
examples include an e-commerce site a
Blog platform or a social media app
document your projects well highlighting
the Technologies used and the challenges
you overcame create a personal portfolio
project or website to display your
projects share your resume and provide a
way for others to contact you this
portfolio will serve you as a testament
to your capabilities and make you stand
out in job applications now that you
have a solid portfolio you are ready to
start applying for jobs and advancing
your career as a full St developer so
