company every candidate must have a
thorough understanding of computer
languages it will enable you to advance
in the it field programming has been a
very safe profession for many in the it
field for nearly two decades now and be
assured that's not going to change
today's video will guide you if you are
a beginner in the programming domain and
want to know exactly how to get started
hey everyone you are watching simply

the Celtic coding bootcamp by simply
learn and master industry relevant
skills the course is perfectly catered
For Beginners with no previous coding
knowledge required check out the link in
the description for more detail but
before we begin with the topic I have
one simple question for you guys and the
question is which of the following is
not a valid name for a variable and the
options are int a floatware underscore a
cash Str int 5 ABC if you know the
answer please leave them in the comment
box below now without any delay let's
get started with the agenda first let us
know why learn to code next we will
understand how to start coding then
let's have a look at Which languages to
choose advancing we will look at the
career path after that let's understand
the basics of programming and finally to
get things a little more interesting
let's have a look at the projects a
beginner can get started with so I hope
I have clarified the agenda and we are
good to start now let's begin with why
learn to code to help expand your skill
set to increase one's income when one is
interested to pursue a career in
software development or if you want to
change your career path and it also AIDS
in enhancing confidence now that we know
why to learn coding let's move ahead and
understand how to start coding set your
goals which means figure out why you
want to learn to code and select the
languages and tools you will need to get
started begin learning the fundamentals
of the languages you have chosen then
begin developing the basic application
so I think you got a good understanding
of how to start coding okay so let us
move on to which language to choose a
few languages that a beginner should
learn are Java C C plus plus Python and
HTML it is not necessary to learn all of
them but you can get started with any
one of them and seek a thorough
understanding of that language before
you start choosing and learning
languages I recommend that you first
choose a career path and then decide
which language you want to learn based
on the field you have chosen so now
let's have a look at the career path you
can choose to become a web developer a
programmer using client server
architecture to create World Wide Web
application is known as a web developer
few languages that will help you to
create a website are Java JavaScript
HTML CSS angular and scalar next game
developer video game developers assist
in the transformation of games from a
concept to a playable reality few
languages that will also help you to
develop games are C C plus plus Java
JavaScript HTML CSS and C sharp then we
have mobile developer to create
applications for the IOS and Android
mobile platform using swept Java and
flutter languages next machine learning
Engineers machine learning is a branch
of artificial intelligence and computer
science that defines a mission's ability
to mimic intelligent human behavior
machine learning allows computers to
build models to automate decision making
processes Based on data inputs python is
a language that a beginner in machine
learning should use next up we have data
science data science is the study of
massive amounts of data and the use of
relevant tools and techniques to derive
valuable data a data scientist
day-to-day work entails Gathering
analyzing and interpreting data to
assist businesses in achieving their
objectives in short it accepts the data
and predicts some value for that
particular data if you are new to data
science stick to python algorithms and
basic math concepts now that we have
some idea about which career to choose
let's have a look at some basics of
programming a variable is a name of a
memory location used to store a value
that can be modified and reused many
times during the program execution
example a car name Etc advancing we have
decision making statements which allow
us to decide the order of execution of
statements like if statements if
statements and elsif Ladder statements
simple if statements are carried out to
perform some operations when the
condition is only true in effect
statements if the condition is true then
if block will be executed otherwise else
block will be executed the lcif larger
statement contain multiple elsif when
either of the condition is true this
statements under that particular if will
be executed otherwise these statements
under the else block will be executed
after that we have Loop control
statements that allow us to iterate
through a part of the program several
times the for Loop is also known as a
pre-test loop from the following syntax
expression 1 is an initialization
Expression 2 is the condition expression
and Expression 3 is an updation the
variables can be initialized in for
statement itself a while loop is also
known as an entry Loop because in a
while loop the condition is tested first
then the statement under body of the
while loop will be executed the door
while loop is also known as an exit Loop
because in the Dual Loop this statements
will be executed first then the
condition is checked next we have arrays
in arrays same types of elements are
stored under one name called array name
also the arrays of elements stored in
consecutive block of memory beginners in
programming can start with the simple
projects like how to create a web page
and then work on more complex project
once the basics are strong so here are
few project ideas for beginners build
your own calculator using Java Library
management system using C to do list
using C plus plus develop app clone
using HTML CSS and JavaScript game
development using python for example
