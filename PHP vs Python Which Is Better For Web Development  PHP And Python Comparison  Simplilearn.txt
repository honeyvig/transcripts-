in today's coding world there are tons
of programming languages to learn
but among so many languages let us talk
about the differences between the top
two
first php and the next is python
now you must be wondering amongst these
two which one is the best for developing
an application or which one is going to
give you the best written on your
development time
let us first discuss php
so what is the need for php and why is
it one of the most popular languages
is an easy to learn language that runs
on diverse platforms like windows unix
linux mac os etc
it provides compatibility with servers
such as apache and iis
it runs applications efficiently on the
server side however it is open source
and free to download in simple words php
creates dynamic web pages it helps in
building viewing writing deleting and
closing files on the server
that was all about php now let us talk
about python
python syntax can be comprehended
quickly and is easy to debug and so its
source code is relatively easy to
maintain
this programming language comprises
multiple pre-built libraries resulting
in simple application development
the language consists of an interactive
shell encouraging users to test
functions before implementation process
however python is database friendly and
encourages graphical user interface
in simple words python has interpreted
high-level functional programming
language
it is mainly used in web development
software development and system
scripting
moving forward let us discuss the
differences between
php and python
let us first talk about the purpose
developers use php for building dynamic
websites whereas
python programming language is a high
level object-oriented programming
language utilized by developers to
create for rapid applications
next comes frameworks php has numerous
frameworks thus helps in building web
development faster and easier on the
other hand python has a small number of
frameworks now let us talk about the
syntax this is syntax for php and python
php has a wide range of naming
conventions whereas python gives the
clear and concise syntax of codes
next let us discuss the key features of
both the programming languages
php is an open source language with
characteristics of easy deployment and
continual improvements on the other hand
python is an open source language with
advanced features like dynamic typing
and high portability
after this let us talk about the main
feature that is security an important
aspect that is important during the web
development process as security from
vulnerability according to the net
solution sql injection cross site
request forgery and cross site scripting
are the most critical web application
security vulnerabilities
php is secure but vulnerability can be
created due to malicious code however
when we talk about programming languages
we have found that organizations prefer
python over php python is the first
choice by developers to avoid cyber
attacks the python function django
provides high security which helps in
protecting the systems from any cyber
threats
moving on to the next feature let's talk
about performance
the page speed matters a lot when we
focus on performance and fluidicity
according to google 53 of mobile users
leave a web page when the load time
takes more than three seconds
python helps developers to build a
website with high performance
but on the other hand php's new version
zen engine results in a better
performance rate however the speed is
twice faster than its predecessor that
is all about performance now let's
discuss a few key differences between
the two programming languages let us
start with the popularity first
php is a language of choice for web
development by many web developers
whereas python is widely used in ai data
science and the scientific community
next comes database connectivity with
php it is easily possible to access
multiple databases
on the other hand python does not
support database connectivity as broadly
as php
now let us talk about community support
currently php has vast community support
each release branch of php is fully
supported for two years from its initial
stable release meanwhile the errors and
security issues are resolved on a prior
basis however the community for python
is not as great as php but python 2 is
growing at a faster pace
next comes the learning curve which
means which programming language is in
demand based on the research by india
today due to the covet crisis many have
lost jobs but at the same time there are
a few jobs that are still in demand
amongst those data scientists with
python knowledge have a greater demand
whereas php comes in the top 5 positions
however python is considered better in
long term growth and php has a low
learning curve
moving forward let's talk about
readability
php language is highly documented and
follows a classic approach php has a
readable function
the function checks if the file is
readable or not on the other hand python
uses indentation enforcements the
function makes it readable too
now let's talk about the companies that
are using these languages
food suit viber and accelerator use php
and companies like uber pinterest and
mozilla prefer python however
with the help of php viber is able to
deliver messages and phone call services
at a very rapid pace
next let's talk about github stars stars
on github matter a lot but what are they
well
developers on the github website mark or
start other people repositories thereby
saving them in their list of start
reports which means they liked how the
code is structured now considering that
we have found php has 30k stars whereas
python has 30.4 k stars however the
number differs based on the trend too
moving forward let us discuss about ppyl
ratings
the ppyl or popularity of programming
language index ranks programming
languages based on how often these
languages tutorials are searched on
google by users however php ranks on
sixth position and python makes first
position
finally the last difference we will be
talking about is salaries
according to glassdoor.com we found that
the average salary of a php developer in
the us is 77
235 dollars per annum and in india it is
25
192 rupees per month on the other hand
the average salary of a python developer
in u.s is 1 lakh 10
342 dollars per annum and in india it is
43 504 rupees per month
now you must be wondering which
programming language is the best choice
isn't it the two programming languages
that is php and python serve different
purposes
as i have already said php is widely
utilized in web development and python
is used for performing a series of tasks
in software or web development however
both these languages have their
respective advantages and disadvantages
you can choose any language based on
your requirement and interest
with that we have reached to the end of
this php vs python tutorial i hope it
