Listen to What a happy Learners say
about our courses
I am currently a test engineering
manager and I support the material
mechanical testing in my role I manage
multiple projects the course in project
management through UMass has really
helped me enhance my overall performance
at work
hi I'm Lisa Lou Casey my expertise lies
in developing fast effective and
relevant strategies I was in the medical
device industry for 15 years
one of the projects that I'm very proud
of is the development of wound dressings
for severely bleeding injuries for the
military we will are able to get the
second fastest FDA approval and awarded
the 2004 top 10 greatest army inventions
career growth is not an option without
great teams taking this project
management course was an opportunity for
me to develop those skills
[Music]
the five parts
upon completion of this course I was
able to pass my PMT through the project
management Institute and my agile scrum
Master certifications upon the first
attempt
my favorite part was the Capstone
project at the end this gave me the
opportunity to apply my learnings
practically and this is very useful for
my current role
I've struggled with mental health
challenges throughout my life and sports
have been a way for me to work through
those challenges
as an adult I started taking karate with
my daughter and earned my black belt
when I was 40 and my second degree black
belt when I was 45. I have co-authored
two books focusing on the mindset of
athletes the first one is maximum
composure
and the second one is Lucidity in sports
and this year we have a new book coming
out when I am encouraged and supported
to embrace my diverse skills and
experiences I'm able to tap into my
superpowers as a fast learner adaptable
team leader
as a mother of two my greatest dream is
for my children to find their
superpowers
and to create a Wonderful Life and a
better world for everyone around them
like me they are excited for what their
future holds
so without any further Ado let's begin a
project manager is supposed to fulfill a
Project's requirements that is to
deliver a unique output in a timely
manner it starts in the form of an idea
that is approved by a project initiator
or sponsor the project manager and the
project team then elaborate their
understanding of the requirements and
produce the final deliverable which can
be a product a service or a result
throughout the project the project
management team needs to ensure that the
stakeholders are engaged in the project
and their expectations are being managed
the project management team also needs
to ensure that there is good
communication between the project team
and the stakeholders in addition the
team should make sure that the
constraints of scope cost time quality
and others are balanced in addition to
producing deliverables a project
generates data such historical data
archives or records are important for
planning future projects there are five
major process groups in project
management in the next screen we will
discuss how these process groups are
related to each other the five process
groups in project management are
initiating planning executing monitoring
and controlling and closing processes
the image shows how these process groups
interact with each other the initiating
processes occur only once during a
project or phase within a project at the
beginning whereas the closing processes
occur only once towards the end however
planning executing and monitoring and
controlling processes are repeated
several times during a project the
planning processes take information from
the initiating processes and help to
prepare an initial Baseline version of
the plan as the team starts execution
they understand the ground realities
better the deliverables produced and the
data of the progress are fed into the
monitoring and controlling process group
in the monitoring and controlling
process group the information generated
during execution is processed and
utilized in three different ways firstly
it can be used for revising the plan
which is termed as re-planning secondly
it can be fed back into execution as
defects or corrective and preventive
actions or approved changes and thirdly
the information can result in the
cancellation of the project or the
successful completion of the project
upon validation of the deliverables
produced while discussing processes
consider it from the perspective of
project manager or as part of the
project management team this implies
that you are essentially functioning in
the integration management knowledge
area the initiating process includes two
steps which include getting the project
Charter approved and identifying
stakeholders click each tab to learn
more
a project manager is concerned about
getting the charter for the project
approved project Charter sets the
beginning of the project where the
management has decided in its favor and
is ready to commit resources for it
the other process in the initiating
process group is identifying
stakeholders the project manager and the
project team should know the
stakeholders and their requirements
which is the starting point for planning
you may get concept-based questions in
the PMP exam so study the initiating
process to answer such questions easily
planning accounts for most of the
processes in the project management
framework as many as 24 out of the 47
project management processes belong to
the planning process group the basic
objective of the planning processes is
to produce the project management plan
collectively the developed project
management plan under integration
management assimilates the output of all
the planning processes under various
knowledge areas the project management
plan is the collection of all subsidiary
plans that address different aspects of
the project the project management team
integrates all these plans and ensures
that they are in harmony with one
another the team also prepares a
blueprint of how the project needs to be
executed controlled and closed the
planning process starts with scope
planning which is to understand exactly
what you are trying to achieve this is
translated into a project scope
statement which can be decomposed into a
work breakdown structure or WBS which
forms the basis of other planning
processes any change to the scope
invariably has a bearing on other
parameters that can affect the project
following the same logic it is easier to
understand how the planning processes
and other knowledge areas such as
quality cost and time can influence the
time that will be taken the cost that
will be incurred and the way quality
will be managed to satisfy the scope
cost time and quality equilibrium the
project team needs to manage
Communications risk stakeholders
procurements and Human Resources this is
where the planning processes under these
knowledge areas come in all these
planning processes interact with each
other planning is an interactive
activity that gets elaborated refined
and adjusted as more and more
information about the project is
discovered planning without execution is
futile but execution without planning is
fatal however in execution processes the
project team spends a lot of time
putting the plan into action when you
perform the executing processes you
often blend the execution and
controlling processes execution is all
about performing the plan that is
producing the deliverables and providing
information on the progress processing
of this information and the validation
of the deliverables is a Control
Function the executing process is the
direct and managed Project work where
the project manager essentially puts
certain mechanisms in place to ensure
that the work is being carried out the
project manager primarily focuses on
ensuring that the procurements are
conducted these procurements are
deliverables or services that the
project needs to buy from external
sources the project manager also needs
to ensure smooth flow of communication
within the project team and with the
external stakeholders the manager should
make sure that stakeholders are engaged
in the project and that the processes
for managing quality are being followed
correctly it is important for the
project manager to make sure that the
right team is being used they have the
knowledge and competencies to do the job
and they work together as a team the
project manager should also manage the
team to make sure they are positioned
for success
monitoring is observing and getting data
about how things are going within the
project whereas controlling is taking
actions to bring things back on track
monitoring and controlling apply to
different aspects of project management
the image shows the various areas of
project management where monitoring and
control applies however the knowledge
area that has a corresponding Control
process is human resources because Human
Resources should be managed not
controlled an important aspect of
controlling is having an elaborate
mechanism to handle changes
closing processes bring a project or a
phase within the project to an orderly
conclusion only two knowledge areas
include a closing process these are
integration management and procurement
management closing a project or phase
falls under integration management and
applies to the overall project before
the project is formally closed all the
procurements are contracts that are
entered into for the project must be
formally closed as well study the
closing processes in detail to answer
concept-based questions in the PMP exam
prospects by enhancing your project
management expertise with PMP
certification so what are you waiting
for hurry up and enroll Now find the
course Link in the description box there
are 47 processes in project management
grouped into 10 knowledge areas and
mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the first
knowledge area that is Project
integration management and its processes
in the next screen let us understand the
concept of project integration
management
project integration management involves
unification consolidation articulation
and integrative actions that are crucial
for successfully completing the project
the project integration management is
high-level work that project manager
does and it involves managing
interdependencies among the other
knowledge areas the other nine knowledge
areas involve detailed work in a
specific direction for example project
cost management Deals Only with how to
manage cost in a project
the project management processes do not
happen independently for example a new
resource added to the project may
require changes in cost or schedule or
both in dealing with such situations the
project manager integrates the processes
of project management the need for
integration drives much of the
communication and the work of the
project manager let us discuss the key
role of project manager sponsor and team
in the next screen
project manager team members and project
sponsors have different roles to play in
a project
the project manager is supposed to play
multiple roles in the project the key
rule is to perform integration the
project manager puts all the pieces of
the project together into a cohesive
whole in doing so the project manager
tries to ensure that the project is done
faster cheaper and utilizes resources
optimally while meeting the project
objectives
as the project progresses the team
members work on completing the project
activities the role of the Project's
sponsor is to protect project from any
unnecessary changes and to ensure that
it has the required resources for
completion the Project's sponsor is the
champion for the project within the
Performing organization that is the
organization in which the work is being
performed
in the next screen we will cover the
project selection methods
an organization can undertake a project
under contract with an external
organization or take up a project driven
by internal business needs
there should be a formal process of
selecting project in all organizations
to ensure that it is making the best
possible use of limited corporate
resources
for example if the organization has an
option to take up any one out of the two
projects both of which use the same
corporate resources the organization
would naturally select the one which is
more profitable
there are two broad ways to select a
project one way is the benefit
measurement method where one project is
compared with other competing projects
another approach is based on
mathematical models wherein you examine
the most optimal selection of projects
by trying to optimize a goal for example
maximize operating profits such methods
may be called constrained optimization
methods
there are different methods under both
these categories and you should be
familiar with the names of these methods
broadly the benefit measurement methods
focus on ascertaining the costs and
benefits of undertaking the project
the methods under benefit measurement
method include murder board where a
panel of experts shoots down a new
project idea peer review scoring models
economic models and benefit compared to
cost the constrained optimization
methods rely on mathematical modeling
techniques to determine the best
selection of projects to achieve certain
business objectives the methods of
constrained optimization method include
linear programming
in reality you might not have seen these
methods to be followed in Project
selection
often personal relationship with the
sponsor may be more important than
anything else this is quite normal and
any organization worldwide works this
way however as a certified project
manager it is important for you to be
familiar with more scientific methods of
project selection
a typical question on the capm exam
could be what type of project selection
technique is peer review and the right
answer is benefit measurement method you
need to understand the characteristics
of various project selection methods to
answer scenario-based questions
in the next screen we will focus on the
project selection methods
an organization has limited resources
they cannot execute all the projects
that come their way they can take only
those projects for execution which are
financially sound for the organization
there are various parameters used in
making such decisions
some of these terms are present value
Net Present Value internal rate of
return payback period benefit cost ratio
return on investment and opportunity
costs
click each tab to learn about the
parameters
present value is today's value of future
cash flows in order to reduce future
cash flows to present values a discount
Factor has to be applied
what this essentially means is if a
project can give a return of say one
hundred dollars per year
two hundred dollars next year and two
hundred fifty dollars the third year
what is the value of all these returns
today
250 return in the third year will not be
the same as 250 dollars today due to
inflation or any other constraint
click close to go to the process
selection methods dashboard
Net Present Value npv is the present
value of the total benefits income or
Revenue less the costs over a Time
therefore if multiple items are involved
add the present value of all of them to
arrive at the Net Present Value problems
where a project has to be selected over
other projects on the basis of their Net
Present Value can be expected in the
exam
let us take an example of a typical
question that we might encounter in the
exam you have two projects to choose
from Project X will take two years to
complete and has an npv of thirty five
thousand dollars project y will take
five years to complete and has an npv of
ninety five thousand dollars which one
will you choose the answer is Project y
because it has a higher npv do not get
confused with longer duration of the
project it is important that npv be more
click close to go to the process
selection methods dashboard
another term used in evaluating a
project is internal rate of return or
irr
irr is the rate of discounting at which
the present value of costs matches the
present value of benefits it is the rate
inherent in the project
let us look at an analogy to understand
the concept of irr consider a project
similar to depositing money in a bank
account and earning interest you will
prefer the bank that gives maximum
interest similar is the project
choose from Project A and B where
project a has an irr of 25 percent or
Project B has an irr of 15 percent
the answer is Project a as the irr is
better for project a it is obvious
higher the irr the better
click close to go to the process
selection methods dashboard
payback period is the number of time
periods it takes to recover your
investment in the project before you
start making profit on the investment
made and the project
you have two projects to choose from
Project a with a payback period of five
months or Project B with a payback
period of 12 months which one would you
go for the answer would be project a
it is evident that lesser the payback
period the better click close to go to
the process selection methods dashboard
benefit cost ratio is the ratio of the
present value of benefits to the present
value of costs
a benefit cost ratio of more than one
means that benefits are greater than the
costs
if the benefit cost ratio of project a
is 2.5 and benefit cost ratio of Project
B is 1.5 which project would you select
the answer is Project a as the benefit
cost ratio is higher in Project a
click close to go to the process
selection methods dashboard
return on investment or Roi is commonly
used in financial parlance to indicate
how profitable a project is
return on investment is the average rate
of return or benefits expected as
compared to the initial investment if a
project involves an initial investment
of one hundred thousand dollars and
generates an average return of twenty
thousand dollars per year
it means the ROI is 20 000 by 100
000 or 20 percent
higher the ROI the more profitable the
project is
click close to go to the process
selection methods dashboard
opportunity cost is yet another term
used in evaluating competing projects
that you might see in the exam it means
the opportunity given up by selecting
one project over another
problems where a project has to be
selected over other projects on the
basis of their Net Present Value and
opportunity cost can be expected in the
exam for example you may come across a
question such as what is the opportunity
cost of selecting Project B if project a
has an npv of fifty five thousand
dollars and Project B has an npv of
eighty five thousand dollars
the answer is fifty five thousand
dollars this is the npv of project a
which was selected over Project B
Ick close to go to the process selection
methods dashboard in the next screen let
us look at the
there are six project management
processes which are part of project
integration management knowledge area
they are the develop project Charter
done in the initiation process group
develop project management plan
undertaken in the planning process group
direct and manage work carried out in
the executing process group Monitor and
control project and perform integrated
Change Control undertaken in the
monitoring and controlling process group
and close project or phase done in the
closing process group
let us look at each of these processes
in detail in the next screen let us
understand how to read process related
information
as you can see in the project management
process diagram these elements within
the knowledge area represent the inputs
from the same knowledge area these
elements represent the inputs from other
knowledge areas these represent the
tools and techniques used in the process
these are outputs of the process these
represent the output within the same
knowledge area whereas these outputs are
fed into the knowledge areas other than
the one that the process is a part of
you can observe that the process and the
image is color-coded based on the
process group
initiating process group is in yellow
planning process group is in blue and so
on you can read the processes and their
color codes in the legend box on the
bottom left of the screen the process
group affiliation is also indicated in
the text of the description
it is important to understand the
process group context to appreciate what
the process does
in the next screen let us look at the
develop project Charter process
develop project Charter is an initiating
process a project Charter is essentially
a document that authorizes a project
once a project has received a charter it
means that the project manager can start
employing the organization's resources
for the project activities
let us look at the key inputs to be
considered in preparing the project
Charter
the first input is the project statement
of work this is created by project
sponsor or the customer describing their
needs project scope and how the project
fits into their strategic goal if the
project is taken up under a contract the
request for proposal that is RFP can be
considered as project statement of work
the next input is the business case this
document establishes whether the
investment in a project is worth from a
business point of view the business need
for the project and the cost benefit
analysis it provides important
information to the project manager about
the goals of the project and the
boundaries in terms of the desired
results cost Etc
if the project is being undertaken as
part of a contract or agreement the
agreement provides an important input
for the project manager that establishes
what must be done in the project
the next input to be considered for
project Charter is Enterprise
environmental factors
any project to be executed within the
organization has to deal with the
organization culture and existing
systems you can consider this as an
organization baggage that comes with the
project this is the reason a project
being executed in two different
organizations may be done differently
another factor to be considered is
organizational process assets
this is a broad term and includes all
the organizational processes procedures
and policies corporate knowledge base
and historical project information
every organization develops a set of
processes procedures and policies that
are based on the best practices learned
by the organization over time the
historical information includes past
project management plans risks Lessons
Learned Etc of similar projects executed
now let us look at the tools and
techniques used in this process
the first technique is expert judgment
expert judgment is an invaluable input
to the process of formally authorizing a
project because an expert can provide
insights into why a project makes
business sense or why it does not from
experience they may be able to shed
light about the validity of the business
drivers feasibility assumptions and
constraints that need to be considered
for the project
facilitation techniques is another
technique used the chartering process is
often a collaborative activity involving
many influential stakeholders in an
organization
facilitation techniques help bring all
these stakeholders together and engage
in fruitful discussions in order to
arrive at an informed decision whether
to go ahead with a project or not
the only output of this project is the
project Charter let us try to understand
what the project Charter might contain
the project Charter usually contains the
high-level project requirement and it
should be created by the project sponsor
and handed over to the project manager
the project manager can do the
groundwork to prepare the project
Charter but it must be signed by the
project sponsor or somebody in the
Performing organization who is higher in
Authority than the project manager
it is important to point out that a
project Charter is not a project
management plan the detailed risk
schedule cost analysis Etc is part of
the project management plan and should
be done during the project planning
phase when there is more detail on the
availability of the project to do so the
charter should be sufficiently high
level to accommodate the minor changes
that might arise in the project
in the next screen let us discuss the
second process under project integration
management develop project management
plan
this is the process of documenting the
actions necessary to Define prepare
integrate and coordinate the subsidiary
plans
examples of subsidiary plans are project
time management plan project cost
management plan project Human Resource
Management plan Etc
the project management plan does not
just describe when the project would
start what activity should be done and
when the project would get over it is a
detailed document and describes how the
project would be executed monitored and
controlled and closed
many people think that project schedule
developed using Microsoft Project is the
project management plan however that is
not true project management plan
contains all the subsidiary plans and
their Baseline value it also contains
the allowed variance in the Baseline
value performance measurement based line
of projects time is the total of project
Baseline time and the agreed time
variance for the project for example the
time management plan section would have
mentioned the time taken by a project
the period mentioned in the project
management plan is 180 days
this 180 day period is also called the
Baseline time value therefore the
Baseline value is the initial agreed
value in the project management plan
so if the time variance agreed in the
plan is 10 the project should be
executed in maximum 180 plus 180
multiplied by 10 percent is 180 plus 18
which is 198 days
whether the Baseline time value should
be 180 days or 300 days is decided by
analyzing the project activities and it
should not be decided arbitrarily in the
next screen let us look at the various
inputs outputs and tools and techniques
of this process
let us look at the inputs considered in
developing the project plan
projects Charter from the previous
process is an important input the other
inputs include output of the other
planning processes because the project
management plan is supposed to integrate
all of these plans
the examples of other plans are time
management Plan cost management plan and
quality management plan
Etc
all of these plans are developed over a
period as the project progresses these
will be discussed in detail later in
this tutorial
in addition to these Enterprise
environmental factors and organization
process assets are also inputs to
developing the project management plan
in fact these two factors have more
influence in developing project
management plan than in developing
project Charter it is recommended that
you understand these inputs outputs and
tools and techniques clearly as most of
these will be repeated in other
processes as well
the two tools and techniques employed in
this process are expert judgment and
facilitation techniques the very obvious
output of this process is the project
management plan
in the next screen let us look at some
of the key terms which are crucial in
understanding these processes
let us look at a few key terms to
understand project management processes
the first is the work authorization
system there should be a formal process
of authorizing work within the project
so be it internal team members or
project contractor there should be a
formal process of giving go ahead to
start work on the project
the next two related terms are
corrective and preventive action
you will come across these terms
throughout this PMP tutorial
corrective action is any action taken to
bring expected future project
performance in line with the project
management plan
for example if a project Milestone is
delayed as a corrective action you
include additional resources to ensure
that the final project deadline is not
delayed
while corrective action involves
implementing actions to deal with actual
deviations from the performance
baselines preventive action deals with
anticipated or possible deviation from
performance baselines for example to
ensure that projects are not delayed you
do a proper estimation of the work and
assign enough resources to the project
so that they are not delayed
a very important system that needs to be
established early on in a project is the
Change Control System since projects are
executed in a dynamic environment it is
quite natural to expect changes in the
project requirements the Change Control
System is the formal documented
procedures paperwork tracking systems
for authorizing changes therefore the
Change Control System analyzes each of
the incoming change requests and decides
whether to accept the change request or
reject it
a configurable item is any product
service or result within the project
whose characteristics need to be
identified documented and placed under
Change Control mechanism
examples of configurable items are
project documents source code physical
parts such as tools recommended settings
for Machinery Etc when a formal
configuration management system is put
in place it is essentially establishing
a control system that can preserve the
characteristics of these items
now let us look at the next process of
the project integration management
knowledge area which is direct and
manage Project work
direct and manage Project work is the
process of Performing the work defined
in the project management plan to
achieve the project objective this
process marks the performance and
completion of activities in a project
the input to this process is obviously
the project management plan since the
project is executed as per the project
management plan
the other inputs to this process are any
approved change requests that need to be
implemented these could be in the form
of corrective or preventive actions upon
which the team has decided to work
the other two inputs are Enterprise
environmental factors and organizational
process assets
let us look at the tools and techniques
expert judgment is an important tool
used in this process as well
another technique is the project
management information system or pmis
the pmis is a combination of documents
dashboards software tools Etc where the
data and information related to the
project gets collected as the work is
being done
during execution it is natural to expect
that plenty of meetings will take place
among the team members and among other
stakeholders as well
there are several outputs from this
process project deliverables are
produced as the deliverables are being
produced there would also be data
related to the project performance that
will be generated such as what was done
how long did it take how much did it
actually cost Etc
along with these key outputs there are
changes that new change requests May
emerge this could be because during the
execution phase the team or the
stakeholders May realize that what is
being produced is not meeting the
expectations or needs and that something
else may need to be done
in the process project documents and
project management plan get updated
let us look at Monitor and control
project work in the next screen
Monitor and control project work is the
process of tracking reviewing and
regulating the progress to meet the
performance objective or objectives
defined in the project management plan
now the estimated time performance
measurement Baseline is 180 days and 10
percent
the Monitor and control project work is
the process area that tracks whether 180
days and 10 Time Performance Baseline is
being met or not
let us also look at the key inputs for
the Monitor and control project work
process
project management plan is the key input
as the performance measurement baselines
are part of the project management plan
the other key input to Monitor and
control project work is work performance
information it is the status of the
project that is the status of the
project deliverables the cost incurred
the time elapsed in the project
Etc along with the work performance
information
forecasts related to the cost and time
form important inputs upon which the
project manager has to act validated
changes confirms that the approved
changes have been appropriately
Incorporated Enterprise environmental
factors and organization process assets
are also inputs to this process expert
judgment analytical techniques project
management information system and
meetings are the various tools and
techniques
one of the outputs of this process area
is change requests change requests could
be in the nature of corrective and
preventive actions or defect repair if
the performance measurement baselines
are not being met this process ensures
that project manager takes appropriate
corrective and preventive action to get
close to the performance measurement
baselines along with the recommended
corrective and preventive action Monitor
and control project work also results in
identifying defects which must be taken
care of
during the defect repair process many
reports related to the performance of
the work of the project will be produced
project management plan and project
documents are also updated in the next
screen let us focus on perform
integrated Change Control process
perform integrated Change Control is the
process of reviewing all change requests
approving and managing changes to the
project deliverables
organizational process assets project
documents and the project management
plan this is where all the
recommendations for changes corrective
actions preventive actions and defect
repairs are evaluated across all the
knowledge areas and either approved or
rejected the inputs to this process are
similar to that of the Monitor and
control project work process
project management plan work performance
reports Enterprise environmental factors
and organizational process assets
the only additional input is the change
request since the perform integrated
Change Control process is supposed to
take care of managing the incoming
changes
to make a judgment about the change
requests project management plan and the
work performance reports are also
referred to another important tool and
technique used in this along with expert
judgment and meetings is Change Control
tools and most important among them is
Change Control Board the team takes up
the ownership of analyzing each of the
incoming changes and also does the
impact analysis for the changes and
finally approves or rejects a change the
project manager project sponsor and a
few of the important stakeholders and
team members may be part of the Change
Control Board
the process should produce change
requests that are approved
a log of change requests processed
requests that were either approved or
rejected and a few updates to the
project plan and other documents
change management and change control is
the theme recurring in many questions in
the examination you can expect questions
in the exam which test a project
manager's response to a particular
change in the project in the next screen
let us take a closer look at functioning
of this process
now let us look at the process of change
first the project manager should
determine that a change has either
already occurred or if the change is
necessary one of the important qualities
of a good project manager is that they
will push back on unnecessary changes
the next step is to evaluate its impact
on the project in totality the team
needs to understand what would be the
impact on the time cost quality risk
resource requirements and so on
once the impact is known the project
manager along with the team should look
for various possible options to
accommodate the change for instance in
order to accommodate an increase in
scope it may be necessary to extend
timeline add resources increase budget
or a combination of the above
once the impact analysis and exploration
of possible options are completed the
project manager should present it to
internal as well as external
stakeholders for their approval
it should be presented to internal
stakeholders first because the
management of an organization may decide
to absorb the change within the
Project's reserves without opting to
build the customer
if the project will have an impact on
the agreed baselines of time cost scope
and quality one needs to get in touch
with the external stakeholders and the
customer these steps are an important
aspect of a project manager's job and
the ability of a project manager to
manage change will be tested in the capm
examination
in the next screen let us look into a
business scenario to understand this
concept better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer
close project or phase is the last
process of the project management
integration knowledge area this process
ensures that the project or a phase is
formally closed after completion
remember that PMI expects a mature
organization and a trained project
manager to be diligent in following
closure formalities
without going through the formal closure
formalities the project cannot abruptly
be closed the project should be formally
closed even if it is terminated due to
some problem
the key input to this process is the
accepted deliverables the deliverables
have to be brought into a state that
they can be properly transitioned
transition means they are handed over to
the organization or group that will be
responsible for operations maintenance
and support
the other inputs are project management
plan and organizational process assets
expert judgment analytical techniques
and meetings are the commonly used tools
and techniques
the closure of a project or phase
results in a product service or a
transition
in the process one of the important
outputs is updates to the organizational
process assets
these include the actual performance
against the plan the key lessons learned
during the project the risks identified
the updates to the skills and experience
of the team members Etc
updating these assets is mandatory as it
helps the organization gain maturity and
learn from the experience
in the next screen let us look into a
business scenario to understand this
concept better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer
here is a quick recap of what was
covered in this lesson
project integration management involves
unification consolidation articulation
and integrative actions that are crucial
for successfully completing the project
integrating the project activities is
the key role of a project manager the
project team focuses on completing the
project activities and the project
sponsor warrants the team against
unsolicited changes
benefit measurement methods ascertain
the costs and benefits of undertaking
the project while constrained optimism
methods rely on mathematical modeling to
select the best projects that achieve
business objectives
various project integration management
processes are develop project Charter
develop project management plan direct
and manage work Monitor and control
project perform integrated change
control and close project or phase
and welcome to capm certification course
offered by simply learn in this lesson
we will focus on Project scope
management let us begin with the
objectives of this lesson
after completing this lesson you will be
able to Define project scope management
differentiate between project scope and
product scope identify the key terms
used in Project scope management
explain work breakdown structure
describe the project scope management
processes
in the next screen let us take a look at
project management process map
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the
second knowledge area that is Project
scope management and its processes let
us begin with the first topic of this
lesson that is Project scope management
project scope management includes the
processes required to ensure that a
project comprises all and only the work
required to complete the project
successfully the project scope
management is concerned about the scope
what is not there in the scope is also
clearly identified
in the next screen let us look at the
Key activities performed under project
scope management
let us look at a few of the typical
activities that happen as part of the
project scope management
constant monitoring is essential to make
sure that all the project work is being
completed the gradual uncontrolled
increase in scope of the project is
referred as scope creep
it is necessary to define the project
scope boundaries and not let people
randomly add to the project scope
gold plating is doing more than what is
required as part of the project scope
this has to be avoided in projects
as per the published statistics about
projects done globally less than 40
percent of projects can be considered
successful therefore the focus should be
on what is required rather than
squandering around with what is not
required forty percent might be
considered less but a project is
classified as successful only if it
meets all its objectives and is done
within time and cost budgets
in the next screen let us understand the
differences between product scope and
project scope
project scope management deals with
managing both the product scope as well
as the project scope
product scope refers to the features and
functions that characterize a product
service or result
the word product may also include
creation of a service for example in the
banking industry each of their services
is called a product
likewise a savings account is one of
their products mutual fund is another on
the other hand project scope is the work
that needs to be accomplished to deliver
the output of the project which could be
a product service or result with the
specific features and functions
for instance to deliver a product you
may also need to produce a requirements
document or a design document
these are not part of the product scope
but it may very well be part of the
project scope
in the next screen let us discuss a few
key terms used in the project scope
management
WBS stands for work breakdown structure
it means breaking the project
deliverables into smaller and more
manageable components called work
packages the last level of work in such
subdivision is called work packages and
the whole structure is called WBS
for example a typical software
development project would have various
activities like finalizing requirements
designing the new system coding testing
and going live with the new system each
of these translates into high level
deliverables which can be further
subdivided into smaller activities which
are more predictable
WBS dictionary like any dictionary
contains the explanation of the terms
used in WBS
a typical WBS dictionary has details
like the control account name of the
work package description of the work
package resource assigned if there are
any assumptions or dependencies to
complete the work package the due date
to finish the work package Technical
dependencies and so on
WBS dictionary is useful for the person
or group working on the work packages as
it further elaborates the decomposed
work package
control account is a level within WBS at
which management wishes to exercise
control for example perform earned value
analysis Track Performance
Etc in the next screen let us cover work
breakdown structure in detail
along with the scope statement and the
WBS dictionary the work breakdown
structure forms the scope Baseline of
the project that is it should reflect
the entire scope of the project any
deliverables that are not reflected in
WBS are not part of the project
the creation of the WBS should involve
the whole team the creation of WBS
creates common understanding about the
scope and therefore leads to team buy-in
during decomposing the deliverables you
must ensure that each level is complete
that is it includes all the work in the
project before you start to decompose
further
decomposition continues until the lowest
level deliverable cannot be logically
subdivided further or they can be
estimated with reasonable accuracy
WBS is a deliverable oriented
decomposition it should only contain
deliverables and not activities while
developing the schedule converting the
deliverables into activities is one of
the problems as WBS does not contain
activity level details
concept-based questions on work
breakdown structure can be expected in
the exam so it is essential to have a
clear understanding of the concept of
WBS in the next screen let us look into
an example which shows how WBS is
derived
work breakdown structure of a core
banking software development project is
given on the screen
the scope of the project has been
divided into WBS elements like
requirements documentation design and
architecture Code test and go live
further these elements are decomposed
into work package level to make it
easier to manage the deliverables in
terms of scope cost and time it also
helps to estimate or assign the specific
work packages to team members or groups
the design and architecture has been
decomposed to model and prototype
similarly code is decomposed into work
package 3.1 and 3.2 test into work
package 4.1 and 4.2 and go live into
product installer and warranty sheet WP
3.1 can be represented as model 1 and WP
3.2 as model 2. similarly WP 4.1 may be
test strategy document
and WP 4.2 a test plan document the
number here indicates work breakdown
code
in the next screen let us discuss how
project scope management is actually
accomplished
there are six project management
processes which are part of project
scope management knowledge area
these processes are plan scope
management collect requirements Define
scope create WBS validate scope and
control scope
the first four processes that is plan
scope management collect requirements
Define scope and create WBS are part of
the planning process group and the
remaining two processes validate scope
and control scope are executed as part
of the monitoring and controlling
process group
in the next few screens we will look at
each of these processes in detail let's
begin with plans scope management
plan scope management process creates a
scope management plan that documents how
the project scope will be defined
validated and controlled it is usually
the starting point of the planning
processes on a project understanding the
scope and how it will be managed is
fundamental to planning the other
aspects of the project
let us review the list of inputs to this
process
the project management plan provides
other subsidiary plans and will help
guide the scope planning activities on
the project
the project Charter provides an overall
context and the high-level product and
project description which may help
determining the approach for the scope
management
Enterprise environmental factors provide
the organizational context to the
project including the culture of the
organization the infrastructure key
personnel and so on
organizational process assets provide
inputs such as policies and procedures
historical information and knowledge
base now let us look at the tools and
techniques employed in this process
expert judgment refers to input received
from knowledgeable and experienced
resources meetings may be organized to
determine the scope management plan
everyone responsible for the project
scope management such as the project
manager sponsor customer and other
stakeholders must attend these meetings
now let us look at the outputs of this
process
the scope management plan describes how
the project scope will be defined like
who will be involved in the process
whose inputs will be sought what
techniques may be used to get these
inputs Etc developed that is in what
form will the scope be elaborated and
documented monitored and controlled and
verified the plan may also describe how
WBS will be created from the scope
statement how changes to the scope will
be managed how deliverables will receive
formal acceptance
Etc
the requirements management plan is a
subsidiary of the project management
plan that describes how requirements
will be analyzed documented and managed
a requirement is voiced by a customer or
a stakeholder whereas scope represents
what the project team will do or deliver
in order to meet that need
the requirement management plan may also
describe how the configuration
management of requirements will be
carried out how they will be prioritized
how the metrics will be used to
rationalize these choices and how the
traceability of the requirements will be
maintained throughout the project
you may got questions in the capm exam
based on the inputs tools and techniques
and outputs of plant scope management so
understanding of these topics will help
you to answer concept based questions
correctly in the next screen let us look
at the second process collect
requirements
collect requirements is the second of
the six project scope management
processes it is the process of defining
and documenting stakeholders needs to
meet the project objectives
let us look at the inputs to this
process
scope management and the requirements
management plan provide Clarity on how
the team should go about collecting and
documenting the requirements for the
project
the stakeholder management plan provides
insights into the stakeholders
communication requirements and the level
of stakeholder engagement needed the
stakeholder register May provide useful
guidance about which of the stakeholders
could provide the requirements for the
project
it is very important that all the
stakeholders expectations are captured
adequately and represented in the
requirements document
the project Charter provides high-level
requirements and expectations and may be
used to detail out the requirements
now let us look at the tools and
techniques that can be employed to
collect the requirements
it is important for the project team to
use a combination of techniques that
will give them maximum clarity about the
requirements some of the techniques may
include direct interaction like
interviewing forming focus groups
conducting workshops and using group
creativity techniques like brainstorming
and group decision making techniques
it may also include some offline
activities like conducting surveys via
questionnaires Etc
observation can be a very powerful way
to capture requirements that may be
difficult to state or articulate
prototyping is a powerful technique
where the team comes up with a model or
sample artifact that helps the users
visualize and gain more clarity about
what is being developed
benchmarking is useful for understanding
and learning from the industry and
organizational benchmarks about the bare
minimum expectations
use of context diagrams and analyzing
the documentation provided can also help
in collecting requirements
requirements documentation is one of the
most important output
the second output of this process is
requirements traceability Matrix
this table helps Trace whether the work
has happened on the requirements whether
all requirements are reflected in the
final product of the project
Etc
in the next screen let us look into a
business scenario to understand this
concept better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer

you may got questions in the capm exam
based on the inputs tools and techniques
and outputs of plant scope management so
understanding of these topics will help
you to answer concept based questions
correctly in the next screen let us look
at the second process collect
requirements
given on the screen is an example of the
requirements traceability Matrix
it lists all the requirements recorded
in the requirements documentation in the
first column
in the subsequent columns it traces how
the requirement is being met by specific
sections or objects in the subsequent
stages
in case of a software development
project the requirement about enabling
multi-user access may require changes in
multiple places these are specifically
called out in the columns titled design
coding testing Etc
this ensures each requirement is
specifically addressed through all the
stages of the life cycle and also
provides a backwards traceability by
clarifying why a particular change is
made at each stage that is which
requirement is driving these changes
a typical question in the capm exam can
be one related to the creation of WBS so
understanding the requirements
traceability Matrix will help you to
answer concept-based questions in the
next screen let us look at the third
project scope management process Define
scope
given on the screen is an example of the
requirements traceability Matrix
it lists all the requirements recorded
in the requirements documentation in the
first column
in the subsequent columns it traces how
the requirement is being met by specific
sections or objects in the subsequent

a typical question in the capm exam can
be one related to the creation of WBS so
understanding the requirements
traceability Matrix will help you to
answer concept-based questions in the
next screen let us look at the third
project scope management process Define
scope
the next process in the project scope
management is Define scope
Define scope is the process of
developing a detailed description of the
project and product collect requirements
lists for all the different requirements
or needs expressed by the stakeholders
Define scope deals with the detailing
these requirements and determining what
will be in the scope of the project and
what will not be it belongs to the
planning process group let us look at
the inputs to this process
the scope management plan provides the
details about the process of capturing
and documenting the scope of the project
Charter which describes the business
need of the project and requirements
documentation developed as part of the
collect requirement process also form
inputs to this process
organizational process assets are also a
part of the defined scope process
organization templates may be used to
write the project scope or refer to the
lessons learned from previous similar
projects
for projects which have product instead
of a service as an output product
analysis is a commonly used technique
this defines what is required in a
Project's product
Alternatives generation is a technique
used to see if the project requirements
can be completed in a different way
similar to lateral thinking
expert judgment is a technique using an
expert maybe an external consultant to
look at various requirements and come up
with the project scope statement
in order to define the scope you may
also conduct specific workshops that are
facilitated to generate ideas around the
project scope
the output of this process is the
project scope statement which describes
in detail the Project's deliverables and
the work required to create those
deliverables therefore the project scope
statement has projects product scope
description product acceptance criteria
project deliverables and project
constraints
this process also results in updating
the requirements documentation and
requirement traceability Matrix
developed earlier
let us look at the next process create
WBS
the final planning process within scope
management is create WBS create WBS as
the process of subdividing project
deliverables and project work into
smaller more manageable components it
belongs to the planning process group
the WBS is created with project scope
statement and the requirements document
as input
the scope management plan provides the
details about the process of capturing
and documenting the scope of the project
and how the deliverables should be
decomposed in the form of a WBS and how
it should be maintained the templates
and standards related to the industry
and The Specific Enterprise may be
useful in creating WBS
if there is an organization's template
for writing down WBS that is also used
the other two inputs are organizational
process assets and Enterprise
environmental factors
decomposition is an important technique
used in this process in decomposition
the project deliverables are subdivided
into smaller more manageable components
until the work and deliverables are
defined at the work package level
the work package level is the lowest
level in the WBS and is the point at
which the cost and activity duration of
the work can be reliably estimated and
managed the level of detail for work
packages vary as per the size and
complexity of the project
another technique used is expert
judgment the output of this process is
scope Baseline
the project scope statement WBS and WBS
dictionary are collectively referred to
as scope Baseline scope Baseline is part
of project management plan
this process also results in Project
document updates implementing WBS may
result in getting more clarity about the
requirements itself
the requirement document or the project
scope statement developed earlier should
be updated
in the next screen let us look at the
validate scope process
validate scope is the process of
formalizing acceptance of the completed
project deliverables
validating scope includes reviewing
deliverables with a customer or sponsor
to ensure they are completed
satisfactorily and obtained formal
acceptance validate scope is closely
related to quality control as well
however scope validation is primarily
concerned with acceptance of the
deliverables whereas quality control is
primarily concerned with correctness of
the deliverables and meeting the quality
requirements specified for the
deliverables
quality control is generally performed
before scope validation but these two
processes can be performed in parallel
as well
let us look at the inputs to this
process
the project management plan provides
information about how the deliverables
will be validated and accepted by the
customer and other stakeholders
the requirements documentation acts as
the basis on which the validation
activity is to be carried out
the requirements traceability Matrix
documents how each of the requirements
has been implemented and how it can be
validated the fourth input is verified
deliverables and implies that the
verification activity is first carried
out by the team under the control
quality process and only then the
deliverable enters the validation
process
work performance data gives more inputs
on the deliverables that may be useful
in validating and getting acceptance the
technique used to validate scope is
inspection and group decision making
some of the typical activities that are
done as part of inspection are measuring
examining and validating to determine
whether the work and deliverables meet
requirements and product acceptance
criteria
group decision making techniques may be
employed if a team is working on the
process of validating the deliverables
it helps in arriving at a decision by
either consensus or majority or any
other method the output of this process
is the accepted deliverable
sometimes deliverable might be
acceptable and that results in another
output that is change request
due to the validation process the
information about the deliverables which
have been accepted and any observations
during the validation process may be
recorded
some documents like report on status of
the Project's product is updated as a
result of this process and listed as one
of the outputs
in the next screen let us look at the
control scope process
control scope is the process of
monitoring the status of the project and
product scope and changes to the scope
Baseline
controlling the project scope ensures
all requested changes and recommended
corrective or preventive actions are
processed through the same perform
integrated Change Control process the
inputs project management plan
requirements documentation and work
performance data are the same as the
inputs for control scope and validate
scope
work performance data has information
about progress of work on the different
deliverables
the other input is requirements
traceability Matrix which lists the
requirements included in the
requirements document
organization process assets also
influence control scope in a sense where
an organization would have standard
templates for monitoring and Reporting
scope related updates
scope control is performed using
variance analysis the variation is
measured from the original scope
Baseline which decides whether any
corrective or preventive action is
required the key output of the control
scope is work performance information
which is planned versus actual technical
scope performance
if any part of the scope performance
does not meet the acceptance criteria it
may result in change requests which is
the other major output of this process
all of these may result in updates to
the project plan as well as other
project and organizational process
documents business scenario based
questions on scope control can be
expected in the capm exam so
understanding the concept of scope
control is essential
boost your career prospects by enhancing
your project management expertise with
PMP certification so what are you
waiting for hurry up and enroll Now find
the course Link in the description box
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the third
knowledge area that is Project time
management and its processes
let's begin with the first topic of this
lesson project time management
the purpose of project time management
is to ensure that the projects get
completed on time
this knowledge area is primarily
concerned with developing a project
schedule and ensuring that project goes
as per the agreed schedule
if there is a need to change the project
schedule the change should happen by
following a proper change control
procedure another term used in the PMP
examination is schedule management plan
schedule management plan is part of the
project management plan and has
information on the planned project
schedule and its management and control
let us discuss the Key activities of
projects time management in the next
screen
the Key activities that are part of the
project time management include
identifying activities estimating time
and resources and sequencing activities
it is important to identify a list of
activities that would be a part of the
project next an estimation of time and
resources required for completing the
identified activities are done
finally these activities need to be
sequenced as per the dependencies in the
next screen let us discuss project
schedule
project schedule represents the time
dimension of the project plan and has
information like when the project would
start when each of the project
activities would happen in what order
the project activities would happen when
project would be completed
Etc
usually Software System is used to
develop the project schedule
the project team can enter the list of
activities in the software as well as
their dependencies and the software can
produce the project schedule as the
output Microsoft Project is the most
popular tool used for project schedule
development generally project schedule
is considered similar to project
management plan
project management plan is different
from Project schedule project management
plan not only has information about the
Project's schedule but also other
important project related plans like
Risk Management Plan cost management
plan
Etc let us focus on Gantt chart in the
next screen
Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that
illustrates a project schedule it shows
the dependencies between the project
activities as well as their percent
completion
a sample Gantt chart is shown on the
screen
two summary elements of the work
breakdown structure are depicted to
complete those elements there are a
number of activities under them some of
these activities have dependencies for
example activity B and C have a
dependency activity C can start only
when activity B is completed
the chart gives you an idea about when
specific activities are planned to
finish and when the overall WBS element
will get delivered create tasks and work
with the Gantt chart this will make
answering Gantt chart-based questions
easy and fun in the next screen let us
understand the relationships that exist
among project activities
Network diagram is extensively used in
the project time management knowledge
area to plot the activity dependencies
this is a graphical representation of
the project activities in the form of a
network
there are two ways to draw a network
diagram
in precedence diagramming model PDM or
activity on node Aon boxes represent
activities and the arrows indicate the
dependency this type of network can have
all four types of relationships between
the activities
in Arrow diagramming model ADM or
activity on Arrow AOA the arrows
represent activities the relationships
and sequences can be inferred from the
direction of the arrows and linkages
between the activities
and such types of network only finish to
start relationships can be shown
such diagrams may need to make use of
dummy activities to indicate some
dependency between the activities
there may be questions in the PMP exam
based on the network diagram so create
and work with the diagram this will make
answering Network diagram based
questions easy and fun
in the next screen let us look at a
network diagram
a sample Network diagram is shown on the
screen activities A and C can happen in
parallel B and D require both A and C to
complete whereas e requires both B and D
to complete activity on Arrow Network
diagram makes use of hammock activities
they are used to show a comprehensive
summary activity combining several other
activities underneath for control and
Reporting purposes in the next screen
let us look at a few important terms in
time management
when a successor activity can start
before the predecessor activity can
complete it is considered lead for
example you can start preparing the test
environment two weeks before the
development activity finishes
when the successor activity has to wait
for a few days after the predecessor
activity has been completed it is
considered lag for example one needs to
wait for two days for the foundation to
settle before work on the pillars for
the next floor starts
rolling wave planning is an iterative
planning technique in which the work to
be accomplished in the near term is
planned in detail while the work in the
future is planned at a higher level it
is a form of progressive elaboration
in the context of estimating techniques
analogous estimating is based on the
previous project data therefore if the
last five similar projects took six
months to complete the next one will
also take six months this technique
employs expert judgment
another estimating technique is
parametric estimating this technique
uses a mathematical model to calculate
projected time for an activity based on
the historical records from previous
projects and other information
a few common parameters are identified
based on the previous project data and
that parameter is used to predict the
time required to complete the next
activity or project for example you can
normally complete 10 kilometers of
Highway construction Lanes a week
effort is the total amount of work
required to complete the activity
duration is the amount of time it takes
in terms of a lab store calendar days if
you have an activity that requires 10
people to work for five days the total
effort is 50 person days but the
duration is only five days
in the next screen let us look at the
project time management processes
there are seven project time management
processes they are plan schedule
management define activities sequence
activities estimate activity resources
estimate activity durations develop
schedule and control schedule
the first six processes are executed
during the planning process group
the ultimate goal of these planning
processes is to develop the project
schedule the seventh and the last
process is a part of the monitoring and
controlling process group
in the next few screens let us discuss
these processes in detail we will begin
with plan schedule management
as defined in pmbok guide plan schedule
management is the process of
establishing the policies procedures and
documentation for planning developing
managing executing and controlling the
project schedule
it belongs to the planning process group
let us look at the inputs to this
process
the project management plan provides
other subsidiary plans and will guide
the schedule planning activities on the
project
the project Charter provides an overall
context and the high-level product and
project description which might help
determine the approach for schedule
management few projects might have
scheduling constraint for example
projects of Olympics 2016 should be
completed at the same time
Enterprise environmental factors provide
the organizational context to the
project including the culture of the
organization the infrastructure like
scheduling systems available key
personnel and so on
organizational process assets provide
inputs such as policies and procedures
templates past performance data and
estimates historical information and
knowledge base now let us look at the
tools and techniques employed in this
process
expert judgment refers to input received
from knowledgeable and experienced
resources
experts can draw from their previous
experiences the proper approach to
govern the schedule on a project
meetings may be organized to determine
the schedule management plan
anybody responsible for the project
schedule management such as the project
manager sponsor customer and other
stakeholders must attend these meetings
several analytical techniques may be
used to determine the schedule
management plan these may include
different planning approaches and
philosophies such as rolling wave
planning or different scheduling
software that allowed to build what-if
scenarios and study the effect of
advanced scheduling techniques like
leveling fast tracking and crashing
now let us look at the outputs of this
process
schedule management plan is a component
of the project management plan that
describes the criteria and activities
required to arrive at the project
schedule as well as how the project may
be baselined monitored and controlled
in the next screen let us define
activities process
define activities is the process of
identifying the specific actions to be
performed to produce the project
deliverables it belongs to the planning
process group the important input for
the define activities process is the
scope Baseline scope Baseline is a term
used collectively to refer to project
deliverables constraints and assumptions
of the project
in addition to the scope Baseline the
other inputs in this process are
Enterprise environmental factors
organizational process assets and
schedule management plan
a reason why Enterprise environmental
factors is an input to define activities
is because the organization might be
using project management software to
define activities and that may influence
the activity definition process
the knowledge base containing historical
information regarding activities lists
used by previous similar projects is a
good example of organization process
assets applied to scheduling
the tools and techniques used in
defining activities are decomposition
and rolling wave planning the last
technique is expert judgment where the
experience of project team members is
used in developing detailed activity
lists
the output of the process is activity
list activity attributes and Milestone
list
activity list contains a list of
identified activities activity
attributes are the additional
information about the activity itself
a milestone is a significant point or
event in the project a milestone list
identifies all the milestones and
indicates whether the Milestone is
mandatory or optional
let us move on to the next process
sequence activities
sequence activities is the process of
identifying undocumenting relationships
among the project activities and is also
part of the planning process group
for every activity and Milestone except
the first and last one is connected to
or at least one predecessor and one
successor
the inputs to this process are activity
list activity attributes and Milestone
list all these are the outputs of the
Define activity process
the other inputs are schedule management
plan and project scope statement
schedule management plan provides
guidance in terms of methodology to be
employed for many of the scheduling
activities on the project
organization process assets are also an
input to sequencing activities because
the organization might have some kind of
knowledge base for scheduling project
activities
the Enterprise environmental factors
relevant to this process may be
scheduling Tools in use project
management information systems work
authorization systems Etc
one of the important tools and
techniques used in sequencing activities
is the Precedence diagramming method
in this method the activities are drawn
on a network diagram and all the
different kinds of dependencies between
the activities are determined
while determining activity dependency it
is important to identify the type of
relationship or dependency between the
activities
the other technique is leads and lag
which is widely used for sequencing
activities
the output of the process is the project
schedule Network diagram which is a
graphical representation of the project
activities in a form of network which
also shows the activity dependencies
while designing the network diagram new
activities might be identified and that
would result in some of the project
document updates especially the ones
that list all the project activities
in the next screen let us look at the
estimate activity resources process
after sequencing the activities the next
step in Project time management is
estimating the resources required to
accomplish each of the identified
activities
estimate activity resources process also
belongs to the planning process group
here resources do not mean only the
human resources but includes all other
resources like equipment raw materials
Machinery Etc
schedule management plan is the first
input schedule management plan provides
guidance in terms of methodology to be
employed for many of the scheduling
activities on the project
the other inputs to this process are an
activity list and activity attributes
that are the outputs of the time
management processes
risk register is another input risks to
the project May influence the decisions
about the resources that need to be
deployed hence risk register becomes an
input to this project
in addition activity cost estimates are
another input cost and resource
estimates on a project are interrelated
and influence each other
for example the cost might dictate the
number and type of resources that can be
employed or the time might dictate the
cost that may need to be incurred
along with this the resource calendar is
also an important input because it has
the information about the availability
of each of the resources
some of the Enterprise environmental
factors that can influence estimating
activity resources are availability of
required resources within the
organization
the organizational process assets is
also an important input as the
organization might have standard
policies for Staffing or for hiring
contractors on the project
with all these inputs available for
estimating activity resources there are
various techniques used for estimating
the required resources the first
technique is using expert judgment
in this technique an expert in resource
planning and estimating can estimate
each of the activities
the next technique used is alternative
analysis in this the activities are
analyzed to identify different ways of
completing them this is to ensure only
the required resources are assigned to
each of the activities this helps in
resource optimization
along with the two techniques many
organizations routinely publish their
estimating data and this could be used
in activity resource estimation
another technique that is routinely used
in activity estimation is bottom-up
estimating which is decomposing the
activity further down to understand it
in more detail and estimating at that
level later all such estimates are added
to arrive at the estimate of the
activity
in real projects one has to use all the
estimate each of the activities
sometimes the project management
software also helps in estimating
the software estimates are based on the
inputs provided to It software should
only be considered as a supporting tool
in estimation and never fully rely on
its output
clearly the output of this process is
the activity resource requirements along
with this resource breakdown structure
is also prepared the resource breakdown
structure is the categorization of all
the required resources in various
categories that is human resources
equipment raw materials
Etc
in the process of estimation several
other project documents may also be
updated
for example the resource estimates are
directly correlated with cost estimates
let us now move on to the next process
estimate activity durations
the next process is to estimate the
duration required to complete each of
the activities
the duration estimation should be done
by someone who is familiar with the
project for example the same activity if
done by a high skilled resource would
take less time compared to a less
skilled resource
this may vary regardless of the resource
used due to the project requirements
in addition the activity duration
estimation should be updated
continuously as you move ahead with the
project because as the project
progresses there will be more clarity on
the project the inputs of this process
are similar to the ones in sequence
activities process
schedule management plan is the first
input schedule management plan provides
guidance in terms of methodology to be
employed for many of the scheduling
activities on the project
for instance it may contain information
about the estimation techniques to be
employed and the people who need to be
involved in the estimation process
activity resource requirements is also
an input to this process because
resources assigned to an activity would
significantly affect the activity
duration that is the lower skilled
resources would take more time than the
high skilled resources
the other inputs include activity list
activity attributes and resource
breakdown structure
resource calendars are also an input to
this process the type and skill set of
resources available to the team may have
an impact on the time it would take to
complete the activities
risks to the project May influence the
decisions about the time required to
complete the activity hence risk
register becomes an input to this
process
the project scope statement defines the
constraints and assumptions affecting
the project duration
an example of Enterprise environmental
factor that can affect duration is
organization's productivity metrics
which is collected based on the
experiences from multiple projects
the last input in this process is
organizational process assets
now let us look at the tools and
techniques used for estimating activity
durations first is the expert judgment
which means using previous project
experiences and estimating the current
project duration this can be used with
other estimation techniques and used to
reconcile differences if different
techniques result in different estimates
three-point estimating is a method where
three estimates are used instead of one
it is part of a project management
philosophy known as program evaluation
and review technique pert
estimating activity durations is often
done as a team exercise as each activity
may require multiple skill sets to be
applied
therefore it is important to use group
decision making techniques to arrive at
a consensus or at least an estimate that
is acceptable to all the team members
Reserve analysis adds buffer into the
project schedule to deal with any
uncertainty the contingency reserve may
be added as a percentage of the activity
duration or fixed number of work periods
the other tools and techniques are
analogous estimating and parametric
estimating
the outputs of this process are the
activity duration estimates and project
documents updates
the activity duration estimates is
represented in terms of the range of
possible results for example 10 days
plus minus two days that is the activity
would take minimum eight days and
maximum 12 days in the next screen let
us look into a business scenario to
understand this concept butter
after reading the problem statement
click the solution button to look at a
possible answer
develop schedule is the process of
analyzing activity sequences durations
resource requirements and schedule
constraints to create the project
schedule
it belongs to the planning process group
generally scheduling software is used
for developing the project schedule
entering the activities durations and
resources into a scheduling tool
generates a schedule with planned dates
for completing project activities
developing a project schedule is an
iterative process revising and
maintaining a realistic schedule is a
task in itself and it continues
throughout the project as the work
progresses
the most of the inputs of this process
are the outputs of estimate activity
durations process
they are risk register project scope
statement project staff assignments
resources calendars organizational
process assets
Enterprise environmental factors
schedule management plan activity list
activity attributes project schedule
Network diagrams activity resource
requirements resource breakdown
structure and activity duration
estimates
various tools and techniques are used to
develop schedule process
schedule network analysis is a technique
that generates project schedule
it employs various analytical techniques
such as critical path method critical
chain method
modeling techniques and resource
optimization techniques to create the
project schedule
the other tools and techniques include
leads and lags schedule compression and
scheduling tool
let us now look at the outputs of this
process
the project schedule consists of a
minimum plan start date and planned
finish date for each activity
although project schedule can be
represented in tabular format it is more
often represented graphically using
either bar charts or network diagrams or
a combination of the two
the final schedule which is the output
of the developed schedule process is
also called schedule Baseline once the
schedule is baselined it can be changed
only through formal approvals meeting
the schedule Baseline is one of the
measures of project success
scheduled data produced may include
number of resources key Milestones Etc
project calendar specify the available
working days and the number of shifts in
each day it indicates how many hours and
days are available for the work of the
project to be completed
project management plan updates are a
result of the develop schedule process
many of the other subsidiary plans of
the project plan may get impacted which
may include cost management plan scope
management plan risk management plan Etc
this may also result in other project
documents being updated
in the next few screens let us discuss
schedule network analysis techniques
it is essential to know if the required
resources are available at that time
along with the time estimate of each of
the activities
since schedule is calendar based it
helps in estimating the same
schedule network analysis technique
generates project schedule there are
various schedule Network techniques
critical path method relies on
determining the critical path on a
project schedule
critical chain method is a variant of
the critical path method wherein the
critical chain is determined based on
The Logical resource and other kinds of
dependencies between the activities
what if scenario analysis is about
trying to vary a certain parameter to
observe the impact on the schedule for
instance you may want to check result if
you put in more resources on a
particular activity to reduce its
duration
resource optimization techniques try to
arrive at the optimal utilization of the
resources used on a project
ideally you would want the resources to
be fully utilized but you would also
want to build in sufficient buffers in
case a certain resource is not available
due to various reasons
in the next screen let us look at the
program evaluation and review technique
program evaluation and review technique
is based on three-point estimates for an
activity
the pessimistic estimate refers to the
worst case scenario
whereas most likely estimate is what you
expect to happen in a realistic scenario
the optimistic estimate on the other
hand represents the amount of time an
activity would take in the best case
scenario
based on these three estimates the
expected duration of the estimate is
calculated as per the formula given on
the screen
the formula for calculating standard
deviation of an activity and variance of
an activity is also given
there is no question asked on variance
but the formula is important because if
the standard deviation of the whole
project is to be calculated the process
is to calculate the variance of the
whole project and then take its square
root to calculate the standard deviation
of the project
concept-based questions on pert can be
expected in the PMP exam so make a note
of the formula while you prepare for the
exam
in the next screen let us understand
Purge with an example
let us now figure out how we can apply
the three-point estimation that pert
uses in order to draw some useful
conclusions
assume that the optimistic pessimistic
and most likely estimates are 20 70 and
30 respectively using these values you
can determine the expected duration and
the standard deviation as indicated
now if the causes of variation are
random you can assume that the actual
values would be evenly distributed about
the mean and we'll follow the normal
distribution sometimes referred to as
the bell curve further you can use the
properties of the normal distribution
there is a 68 probability of the actual
value falling within first Sigma from
the mean
95.4 percent probability for the second
Sigma and 99.7 probability of the actual
value falling within third Sigma
extending this Logic the notion of Six
Sigma is reaching a level of confidence
that only 3.4 times out of a million
would the actual value fall outside the
stated range part allows you to plan
based on the intended level of
confidence in the outcome and determine
buffers accordingly
let us discuss the critical path method
in the next screen
critical path is defined as the longest
duration path through a network diagram
which determines the shortest time to
complete the project float can be
considered as a buffer time available to
complete an activity
float is calculated once the network
diagram is ready
it is also called as slack there are
three kinds of float the first being the
total float which is the amount of time
an activity can be delayed without
delaying the project end date or an
intermediary milestone
the second type of float is free float
which is the amount of time an activity
can be delayed without delaying the
early start date of its successor or
successor's activities
the last type is independent float which
is the amount of time an activity can be
delayed if all the predecessors finish
at their latest finish dates and you
want to start all the immediate
successors at their earliest start dates
the slack of the activities on the
critical path is zero because there is
no scope to delay activities on the
critical path
critical path actually represents the
project duration delaying activities on
the critical path is as good as delaying
the project duration
concept-based questions on critical path
can be expected in the exam so it is
essential to have a clear understanding
of the concept
in the next screen let us learn how to
calculate float
float of an activity can be calculated
by two methods however the first step in
critical path method is to identify the
critical path of the network once the
critical path is identified follow the
forward pass to find early start and
early finish for each activity
the float of the activities on the
critical path is zero so they represent
the overall project duration
use forward pass or backward pass to
calculate the total activity time
calculate late finish and late start
using backward pass method note the
total float formula before you start for
the exam
in the next screen let us look at
forward pass and backward pass methods
in detail
in forward pass you can either go
through the network starting with time
zero and keep calculating the time
required to complete each of the
activities until you reach the last
activity of the project
the starting time for each of the
activity in this approach is called
early start and the end time for each
activity is called the early finish
alternatively in backward pass you can
travel through the network from the
project end date and calculate the time
required to complete each activity the
end date in this approach is called the
late finish and the start date of the
activity in this approach is called the
late start
the float of the activity is either the
difference between the late start and
early start or the difference between
the late finish and early finish
both the differences work out to be the
same before the start of the PMP exam
please make a note of the total float
formula
let us understand the critical path
calculation with an example in the next
screen
let us look at an example for critical
path
there are five activities in this
project and two paths in the network
diagram
start one two four five and is One path
and start one three five and is the
second path since the duration of the
path start one two four five end is 18
days which is more than the duration of
the path start one three five and the
critical path of the project is start
one two four five and
let us take Activity three as an example
first calculate the early start and
early finish dates
Activity 3 can start only after Activity
one since the early finish of Activity
one is three it becomes the early start
of Activity three
Activity 3 cannot start earlier than
three because Activity 1 can be
completed only by then
therefore early start of Activity three
is three since the duration of the
activity is four D's the early finish of
Activity three is three plus four equals
seven days
now let us calculate the late start and
late finish of Activity three
late start of Activity 5 is 14 days the
Activity 3 happens just before activity
5. so the late finish of Activity 3 is
14 days to calculate the late start you
can subtract the duration from late
finish therefore the late start of
Activity 3 is 14-4 equals 10.
in the next screen let us focus on
schedule compression
look at the four activities in the table
the normal cost of executing each of the
activities as well as how much each of
the activities can be crashed is also
provided which activity would you crash
to reduce the project Time by one day
activity a will be crashed if the
duration of the project is reduced by
one day as the per unit cost of crashing
the activity a is the least
all the activities are assumed to be on
the critical path here while crashing if
you end up Saving Time on a path which
is not the critical path you will not
end up Saving Time on the project
in the next screen let us look into the
impact of schedule compression
different schedule compression
techniques have different impact on the
project
the impact of Fast Track leads to risk
additions and increase in management
time for the project manager
crash leads to cost addition and
increase in management time for the
project manager
reduce scope on the other hand saves
cost and resources but increases
customer dissatisfaction
likewise cut quality saves cost and
resources but increases risk
resource reallocation does not add cost
or increase risk
in the next screen let us look into the
other techniques used in scheduling
there are several techniques that are
used in scheduling projects
what if scenario analysis in this
technique questions like what if a
particular scenario changed on the
project would that produce a shorter
schedule are put forth to understand the
impact of specific changes on the
schedule the goal is to produce a
realistic schedule
Monte Carlo analysis in this method a
computer simulates the outcomes of a
project making use of randomly generated
values that map the probability
distribution of the input variables
together these two techniques are called
modeling techniques
resource optimization techniques
these are also used to produce a
resource Limited schedule resource
optimization results in more stable
number of resources used in the project
critical chain method this technique
develops the project schedule that takes
into account both the activity and
resource dependencies
in the next screen let us look at the
last process in Project time management
control schedule
control schedule is concerned with
determining the status of the project
schedule determining that the project
schedule has changed and managing the
actual changes as they occur
the project schedule is an important
input to this process it is the actual
schedule that needs to be controlled
scheduled data contains information
related to the schedule that may need to
be monitored in order to take actions to
bring the project back on schedule
project calendar describes the working
hours and days for the project
work performance data has information
like which activities have started their
progress and which activities have
finished
the other inputs of this process are
project management plan and
organizational process assets
the key tools and techniques of this
process are the performance reviews
performance review is measuring
comparing and analyzing schedule
performance such as actual start and
finish dates percent complete and
remaining duration for work in progress
the other tools and techniques include
resource optimization techniques
modeling techniques schedule compression
leads and lags scheduling tool and
project management software
in development schedule process these
techniques are used for the first time
to develop the project schedule whereas
in control schedule process these
techniques are used to update the
project schedule the key output of the
control schedule process is the work
performance information this is
represented in the form of schedule
variance SV and schedule performance
index SPI
as a part of the control schedule
process the project team will generate
forecasts likely schedule for
forthcoming activities and project as a
whole
the other outputs include organizational
process assets updates change requests
project management plan updates and
project document updates

waiting for hurry up and enroll Now find
the course Link in the description box
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the
fourth knowledge area that is Project
cost management and its processes
in the next screen let us understand the
concept of project cost management
project cost management involves
activities like estimating the cost of
each of the project activities adding
the cost estimates of the related
activities to arrive at the cost budget
and controlling the cost to ensure that
project activities are completed within
the defined budget in the next screen
let us discuss cost management plan
the cost management plan is a vital step
in Project cost management it contains
information like planning the project
cost managing and controlling the
project in relation to the cost Baseline
and managing cost variances project cost
management plan is a part of the project
management plan
the methods used in estimating the cost
of each of the project activities are
similar to the ones used in estimating
project time for example time estimation
methods like expert judgment analogous
estimating bottom-up estimating and
Reserve analysis are few of the
techniques that are also used in
estimating activity cost let us discuss
control account in the next screen
control account is an important Concept
in the project cost management project
cost is generally estimated at
individual activity level it becomes
difficult to manage cost at the activity
level in large projects therefore the
cost is managed at a higher level this
requires related activities to be
clubbed and their cost being managed
together as one unit this unit is called
control account
while estimating the project time WBS is
created to break down the project into
smaller deliverables these deliverables
are broken down into work packages and
these work packages are in turn broken
into activities control account is
defined at a level higher than the work
packages for example if five work
packages are part of the one control
account the cost of all activities
belonging to these five work packages
are managed as one unit in the next
screen let us discuss the project cost
management process
project cost management has four
processes
they are plan cost management estimate
costs determine budget and control costs
the three processes Plan cost management
estimate costs and determined budget are
a part of planning process group and
control cost process is a part of
monitoring and controlling process group
let us look at each of these processes
in detail
let us begin with the first process that
is Plan cost Management in the next
screen
managing costs on a project is a
critical exercise if the activities are
planned well it becomes easier to
achieve harmony with the overall cost
and budget of the project Plan cost
management is the process of
establishing the policies procedures and
documentation for planning managing
expending and controlling the project
costs let us look at the inputs required
for this process
the project management plan provides
other subsidiary plans and guides the
cost planning activities on the project
the project Charter provides an overall
context and high-level product and
project description
which help determine the approach for
cost management for example for some
projects budget could be a constraint
whereas for others budget would not be a
constraint but subject to the other
objectives
Enterprise environmental factors provide
the organizational context to the
project including the culture of the
organization and the infrastructure for
instance the scheduling systems
available the key personnel and so on
organizational process assets provide
inputs such as policies and procedures
templates past performance data and
estimates historical information and
knowledge base
now let us look at the tools and
techniques employed in this process
expert judgment refers to input received
from knowledgeable and experienced
resources experts can devise an approach
to govern the costs on a project by
using their previous experiences
meetings may be organized to determine
the cost management plan everyone
responsible for the project schedule
management such as the project manager
representatives from the appropriate
accounting or financial organization
sponsor customer and other stakeholders
must attend these meetings
several analytical techniques may be
used to determine the cost management
plan these techniques help to map the
impact of various decisions on cost for
example how do risk management processes
impact cost
Etc
cost management plan is the primary
output of this process it establishes
the units of measure levels of precision
organizational process links control
accounts to be used rules for
performance measurement and Reporting
frequency and methodology of monitoring
the costs and various other details that
lay the overall framework for cost
Management on a project
in the next screen let us discuss the
second process under project cost
management
estimate cost
estimate cost is the approximation of
the monetary resources required to
complete a project activity
cost of a specific activity is estimated
based on the information available at
that point of time as the project team
gets more information about the project
the activity cost estimation may change
let us look at the inputs of this
process
scope Baseline is the most important
input as it details out the Project's
scope of work
along with that project schedule is also
important this contains information like
when and which resource is required for
the project
it is good to remember that the same
kind of resources may have different
costs at different points of time
Human Resource Management plan is
another important input various elements
like Personnel rates Rewards or
recognition programs Etc are covered in
the human resource management plan which
is important in approximating the cost
estimate Human Resource Management plan
will be discussed in detail in the human
resource management knowledge area
risk register is also an input because
risk mitigation costs should be
considered in cost planning
more information on risk and its effect
in the project will be looked at in
detail in Risk Management knowledge area
another input Enterprise environmental
factors provides organizational context
to the project
organization process asset is listed as
an input as organizations might have
standard set of cost estimation policies
or templates
cost management plan is another
important input the cost management plan
lays the framework for the cost
management processes in the project
it provides guidelines such as the units
of measure accuracy desired
methodologies and tools to be used Etc
let us now look at the tools and
techniques used in this process
expert judgment Reserve analysis
analogous estimating cost of quality
parametric estimating project management
software bottom-up estimating
three-point estimating vendor bid
analysis and group decision making are
the various tools and techniques used in
this process most of the tools and
techniques used here are similar to the
ones used in the time management
knowledge area
vendor bid analysis is a technique used
to estimate project cost
for example a project requires material
procured externally through suppliers in
order to get that you invite bids from
three or four suppliers and assess their
quotations based on their quotations you
can get an idea of the cost that will be
involved in getting the material for the
project
group decision making technique is
another important technique for project
cost estimation
cost estimation is an exercise which may
be carried out by a group or Committee
in order to gather well-rounded input
therefore group decision making
techniques may be used to arrive at a
decision that team can work with
the outputs of this process are quite
straightforward
estimates of each of the activities are
arrived at basis of the estimate
includes things like how the estimate
was developed what were the assumptions
made in estimating Etc
project document updates is also one of
the outputs because the cost estimates
may result in updates to other aspects
of the project for example quality risk
time
Etc
in the next screen let us discuss the
third process under project cost
management determined budget
once the estimate of each of the
activities is arrived at the next
project cost management process is to
determine budget
it is the process of aggregating the
estimated costs of individual activities
or work packages to establish an
authorized cost Baseline this is where
the control account concept comes into
picture
the estimated costs of the activities
are aggregated to arrive at the cost
budget at the control account level
once approved this cost budget becomes
the cost Baseline of the project
cost performance is measured against the
cost Baseline that is how much more
would the project cost be compared to
the original cost Baseline the cost
Baseline includes all authorized budgets
but excludes management Reserves
the inputs used in determining the
project budget are the activity cost
estimates and the basis of estimates
which are the output of the previous
cost management process
the cost management plan lays the
framework for the cost management
processes in the project it provides
guidelines such as the budgeting cycle
tools and techniques used to prepare and
approve the budget
Etc
in addition to these two important
inputs scope Baseline is also looked at
project schedule provides aggregate cost
in a particular calendar period to
ensure how much money can be made
available during that time
similarly resource calendar provides
information on the resource which is
assigned to the project at a particular
point of time this information is then
used to indicate resource costs over the
duration of the project
risk register gives an understanding of
the overall level of risk on the project
and therefore the level of contingency
reserves that need to be built into the
budget
agreements entered in two with the
suppliers are also required to finalize
the budget again organizational process
asset is an input because organization
may have few policies for reporting the
cost budget or there might be some cost
budgeting tools being used there are
various tools and techniques used in
determining budgets
cost aggregation technique involves
adding up the cost and aggregating them
at the control account level so that the
cost can be managed in a better way
in reserve analysis once the costs are
estimated some extra amount is added to
the estimate as a management Reserve to
take care of any unplanned activities
expert judgment is a technique in which
an expert's help is sought to estimate
the activity cost expert is someone who
might have worked on a similar project
in the past and has a good idea to
estimate the activity cost involved
historical relationships are used to
predict the total project costs using
mathematical model
this is similar to analogous estimate or
parametric estimate method
funding limit reconciliation technique
is used to ensure that cost on the
project is budgeted or spent as per the
availability of the fund for example if
the project can get the funding of only
fifty thousand dollars a month the
project budget should be planned
accordingly
the output of this process is the cost
Baseline this is an authorized project
budget over a period this is used to
measure Monitor and control over all
cost performance of the project
in addition to this the Project funding
requirements are also arrived at funding
requirements means how much fund the
project requires monthly quarterly or
yearly for the execution
the last output of this process is
Project document updates an
understanding of determining budget may
be useful when answering questions in
the PMP exam so make a note of the
inputs tools and techniques and outputs
of determining budget in the next screen
let us discuss the last process of
project cost management that is control
cost
control costs is the process of
monitoring the status of the project to
update the project budget and managing
changes to the cost Baseline
updating the budget involves recording
actual costs spent until date any
increase to the authorized budget can
only be approved through the perform
integrated Change Control process
some of the typical activities that
happen as part of the control cost
process are ensuring that cost
expenditure does not exceed the
authorized funding monitor the cost
performance to understand variants and
monitoring the work performance against
the funds expended
the inputs to the process are project
management plan organizational process
assets Project funding requirements and
work performance data
work performance data contains the
information about the project progress
the important tools and techniques used
in controlling costs are earned value
analysis management
forecasting to complete performance
index
other important aspects of controlling
costs are the review the performance
analyze the reserves to make sure the
project has enough budgetary reserves to
meet the expenses and project management
software which helps in tracking and
managing costs
now let us look at the output of this
process
the key outputs of this process are work
performance information in terms of cost
variance CV schedule variance SV and
earned value EV and forecasts about the
cost performance
this process may also result in change
requests arising out of cost control
measures as well as updates to project
documents the project management plan
and organizational process assets
business scenario-based questions on
Project cost control can be expected in
the exam so if you have questions on
these Concepts get them cleared as that
will help you score higher in the next
screen let us learn about earned value
management and its related terms
earned value technique is an excellent
way to track the project progress
against the project plan it is a method
of measuring the project performance
objectively and comparing it against the
project Baseline results from an earned
value analysis indicate deviation of the
project from cost and schedule baselines
Baseline is the initial approved value
along with approved changes therefore
schedule Baseline is the first approved
project schedule along with approved
changes
there are various terms used in earned
value technique
planned value is the authorized budget
assigned to the scheduled work
earned value is the work performed in
terms of budget authorized for that work
actual cost is the cost incurred in work
performed budget at completion is the
budgeted amount for the total work
estimate at completion is the expected
total cost for the project
estimate to complete is the expected
cost to finish all the remaining Project
work
variance at completion is the projected
budget surplus or deficit at the end of
the project all the parameters displayed
on the screen are measured in terms of
cost you may come across business
scenario based questions on earned value
Management in the PMP exam so ensure
that you develop a clear understanding
of this topic let us look at an example
of a planned value in the next screen
planned value is the estimated value of
the work planned this value is measured
in terms of currency say dollar if the
plan value is three hundred forty
dollars then the work plan is worth
three hundred forty dollars
how do you calculate earned value the
solution is add the budget allocated to
each of the activities that have been
completed at the point of time the
resulting value is the earned value
in the next screen let us look at the
formula used to calculate earned value
in cost variance negative means the
project is over budget positive means
the project is under budget similarly in
schedule variance negative means the
project is behind schedule whereas
positive means the project is ahead of
schedule
the value of the next two parameters
cost performance index CPI and schedule
performance index SPI values vary
between 0 and 1. for example a CPI of
0.8 implies that 80 cents of work is
obtained for every dollar spent in the
project similarly if SPI is 0.9 it
implies that project is progressing at
only 90 percent of the speed originally
planned the next parameter is estimate
at completion or EAC
there are different ways of calculating
the EAC value the method used depends on
how the cost and schedule variances are
expected to play for the rest of the
project BAC by CPI is used if you expect
that the current cost performance will
continue until the end of the project
AC plus BAC minus EV is used if you
expect that the rest of the project will
be managed at the budgeted rate
AC plus vac minus EV by the product of
CPI and SPI is used if you want to
factor in the impact of the cost as well
as schedule variances
AC plus Etc is used if you want to
re-evaluate the Project based on a
forecast value for the estimated cost of
the remainder of the project
the next parameter is estimate to
complete or
Etc which is the cost of project from
this point to the end
this is calculated by subtracting the
actual cost from the estimate at
completion
in addition variance at completion can
be calculated by subtracting the
estimate at completion from the budget
at completion variance at completion is
the cost estimation whether it is over
or under budget
another parameter is the to complete
performance index or tcpi this is the
cost performance needed to achieve a
desired outcome
for example if the project needs to be
managed to the original budget BAC then
tcpi that is the CPI that must be
maintained for the rest of the project
is calculated as BAC minus EV by BAC
minus AC
similarly if it has to be managed within
a revised Target say EAC then tcpi is
calculated as BAC minus EV by EAC minus
AC before the start of the PMP exam
please make a note of the formulas of
earned value technique in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer
let us take the example of a software
development project there are four
phases and each phase takes a month to
complete and is expected to cost ten
thousand dollars the phases are planned
to be completed one after the other the
status of the project at the end of the
month 3 is summarized in the table
requirements definition is completed and
actual spending on this is ten thousand
dollars
architecture and design is done and
actual spending on this is twelve
thousand dollars development and unit
testing is only fifty percent done
though it was supposed to be completed
by Third month it has cost nine thousand
dollars until date
system testing and go live has not yet
started
Note S indicates start time F indicates
finish time and PF indicates that it is
partly finished at the end of the month
based on the above information calculate
the CV SV CPI and SPI of the project
let us look at a solution in the next
screen
before we end this lesson let us also
look at a few definitions that might be
useful for your PMP examination
law of diminishing return this means the
more you put into something the less you
get out of it for example doubling the
number of resources working on a project
will not necessarily have the time
working capital the amount of money the
company has to invest on the project and
the day-to-day company operations
funding limit reconciliation the process
of comparing the planned expenditure in
a given period with the available
funding for that period
large assets purchased by the company
lose value over time this is called
depreciation there are two forms of
depreciation straight line and
accelerated
same amount of depreciation is taken
every year for instance a car with a
price tag of ten thousand dollars and
useful life of ten years is depreciated
one thousand dollars per year at the end
of the tenth year the value of the car
is considered zero for all accounting
purposes accelerated depreciation
depreciates faster than the
straight-line depreciation for instance
a car with a price tag of ten thousand
dollars depreciates three thousand
dollars the first year one thousand five
hundred the next year one thousand the
third year and so on
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into ten knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the fifth
knowledge area that is Project quality
management and its processes in the next
screen let us understand what quality is
the project manager is responsible for
quality in a project however it is also
the responsibility of each and every one
in the project to ensure that whatever
they do meets project quality
expectations quality is defined as the
degree to which a set of inherent
characteristics fulfills requirements a
project is said to meet quality
expectations when all the project
requirements agreed in the beginning of
the project are met and the resulting
product is usable usable means that the
intended users can use the product
without any problem in the next screen
let us look at some quality related
terms
it is important to discuss a few terms
to understand the concept of quality
better customer satisfaction is defined
as conformance to requirements and
fitness for use it is important to
understand the subtle distinction
between quality and greed grade is a
classification based on technical
characteristics low quality is always a
problem but low grade may not be a
problem rather it would be a matter of
choice similarly it is important to
understand the distinction between
precision and accuracy precision is the
granularity of measurement that is how
fine-grained can you measure the outcome
accuracy is how correct you are that is
how close you are to the desired value
in the next screen let us understand the
concept of optimal level of quality
quality comes at a cost more effort put
in quality will give better results
however you cannot keep on investing on
increasing the quality as there is no
limit to how much a product can be
improved investment in quality is
determined by knowing the optimal level
of quality
optimal level of quality as shown in the
diagram is said to be achieved at the
point where the incremental revenue from
Improvement equals the incremental cost
to secure it suppose you are the
manufacturer of toys but the toys are
below quality and the sales are low to
improve the quality you invest in
identifying the demands of children
sharing few samples and recording their
feedbacks once all these are captured
and implemented in the products you lure
the parents to buy them as the
investment is increased to manufacture
good quality toys the cost will
therefore increase and it might become
prohibitive for parents to buy optimal
level of quality is reached at a point
where you get maximum number of buyers
for the toys manufactured now that we
are clear on the concept of quality in
the next screen let us discuss quality
management
quality management involves performing
activities like creating standard
policies and procedures and ensuring
that those standard procedures are being
followed properly in the project it aims
to ensure that project meets all the
initial agreed requirements without any
deviation and that the specified
approach to Quality is implemented on
the project
three broad activities are done as part
of quality management they aren't
quality planning quality assurance and
quality control
quality planning is the first step when
quality related activities of the
project are planned quality assurance is
the next stage of implementing those
quality plans and quality control is the
last stage when periodic checks are done
to see if project quality is improving
in the next screen let us look into the
differences between the three aspects of
quality management
it is important to understand the
different kinds of activities that come
under quality planning quality assurance
and quality control once the quality
planning is done the quality management
plan is ready this quality management
plan has standards templates policies
and procedures to be followed in the
project it contains information on the
level of quality being aimed and the
plan to achieve that level it is the aim
of quality assurance activities to
ensure that the activities planned under
quality planning phase gets executed for
the project it is the task of quality
assurance to determine if the project is
complying with the organizational as
well as project policies and procedures
this is ensured by conducting regular
process audits to identify deviation
from what is planned in the quality
management plan
these audits are generally done by
quality Department of the organizations
quality assurance focuses on the process
not on specific products the role of
quality control is to measure specific
project data or results against
standards to inspect and verify the
Project's product defect repair and
measure whether quality indicators are
improving quality control is about the
product and data for example it was
planned as part of quality management
that project would get completed plus or
minus 10 percent within the cost budget
three months back when the measurement
was done project was over budget by 20
percent
when the measurement was done a day
before it was only 15 percent over
budget
therefore the project has showed an
improvement of five percent in the last
three months and it is quite likely that
over the next three months project may
get within the planned limit of 10
percent
instead of showing Improvement if the
data shows cost increase then corrective
and preventative actions are required to
get the project within the 10 limit this
is quality control
in the next screen let us discuss a few
quality management Concepts
let us look at some terms that are
commonly used in quality management
parlance total quality management or tqm
is a quality management philosophy that
involves holistic thinking about meeting
the objectives of an organization it
places the responsibility of quality
squarely on the management Kaizen is a
Japanese term that stands for change for
butter Kaizen philosophy is one that
should always be looking for small and
continuous improvements in the process
deeming cycle or pdca cycle that is plan
do check Act is a process control and
Improvement approach propagated by the
famous quality Guru Edward deeming it
means you plan for something executed
check the output and based on the
lessons you act to bring the deviations
under control
kanban is a pool based management system
that originated in Japan based on just
in time jit Inventory management
the idea behind kanban is to minimize
the work in progress and achieve a
smooth flow in the process from start to
finish
because building up inventory only to
paper over the imperfections in the
system tends to hide the problems
in the next screen let us focus on cost
of quality
cost of quality is the cost that needs
to be incurred to make a quality product
the sum of all the costs incurred is
ensuring that project conforms to
requirement is cost of quality
cost of quality can be broken down into
two major categories first is the cost
of conformance or the money spent during
the project to avoid failures this can
further be subdivided into prevention
costs which is the cost to prevent
errors like training the team creating
documents on equipment and in time to do
it right the other subdivision is
appraisal costs or the cost for
assessing quality like testing
destructive testing loss and inspections
the second category is the cost of
non-conformance it is the money spent
during and after the project because of
failures this is subdivided into
internal failure costs it is the cost of
failures that occur before the product
is released to customers for example
rework and scrap the second subdivision
is external failure costs it is cost
incurred on failures that occur after it
has been least by the team for example
liabilities warranty work and lost
business concept based questions on cost
of quality can be expected in the exam
so please make a note of the categories
of cost of quality let us look at the
project quality management processes in
the next screen
there are three project quality
management processes of which the first
process plan quality management is done
as part of the planning process group
the next process perform quality
assurance is done as part of the
executing process group and the last
process control quality is done as part
of the monitoring and controlling
process group in the next three screens
let us look into each of these processes
in detail
the aim of the plan quality management
process is to identify the relevant
requirements or standards to execute the
project effectively to achieve the
desired quality level
quality planning results in the creation
of the quality management plan
aim of the plan quality process is to
identify the standards a standard is an
agreed upon process to work or achieve a
result a standard can be set from within
the organization or government once all
the standards for the project are
identified the aim of the quality
planning activities involves determining
what work needs to be done to meet those
standards
before adhering to the standards you
should question their relevance with the
project implementing all possible
standards applicable to the project in
random will have cost and time
implications
let us look at the inputs to this
process
the project management plan provides the
scope schedule and cost Baseline all of
which have an implication on the quality
management plan
quality plan has a direct correlation
with these it might also have an impact
on and be impacted by other subsidiary
management plans such as risk management
the stakeholders of the project may have
specific requirements and Views about
the quality parameters of the project
and these have to be considered
the risk register gives an indication
about the kind of risks that are
inherent in the project and also those
which must be considered while planning
the activities to ensure quality the
requirements for the project need to be
considered for planning quality related
activities because quality is all about
meeting the requirements in addition to
these Enterprise environmental factors
and organization process assets are also
listed as inputs because the standards
can be either from within the
organization or from government or other
external bodies standards from within
the organizations are usually the best
practices learned over a period while
executing numerous projects an example
of government standards can be standards
to control air pollution by the motor
vehicles which vehicle manufacturers
must adhere to to accomplish quality
planning first analyze the benefits
versus the costs of meeting quality
requirements next identify the cost of
quality and confirm if that kind of
investment in quality is Justified
in addition to these two benchmarking
helps in analyzing the quality of
activities of similar projects executed
in the past this helps in identifying
the particular quality of output of the
previous project which in turn acts as a
basis for the current Project's quality
planning
design of experiments can also be used
for Quality planning this is a
statistical way to determine what
variables will improve quality the most
for example in case of manufacturing
doors it can be determined that
increasing the quality of the wood can
have Maximum Impact on improving the
quality of the tour in addition the 76
quality tools also known as the seven QC
tools are used to determine the plan to
achieve the desired level of quality
statistical sampling as a tool becomes
relevant whenever the quality plan
cannot be applied to all the artifacts
produced for example if destructive
testing is a requirement then it can be
carried out only on a sample not on the
entire population
statistical sampling helps in arriving
at a representative sample that can give
useful information
other additional tools such as
brainstorming force field analysis Etc
may be used to determine the quality
management plan for the project
conducting regular meetings is another
important tool the quality management
plan has to be determined in a
collaborative manner by Consulting the
team members and other stakeholders
quality management plan is a key output
of this process
checklist is a list of items to inspect
for example many of the office buildings
have housekeeping checklists to ensure
that all floors cabins Etc are cleaned
checklists are created during quality
planning and used in quality control
metrics are Project Specific data that
need to be measured to check the status
of the project the simplest project
metrics can be cost and schedule metrics
are also decided during quality planning
and used in quality control one of the
roles of the project manager is to not
only manage the project but also improve
processes in the project to decrease the
instances of defect which in turn saves
time and money such activities are
listed in the process Improvement plan
which eventually becomes part of project
management plan
as a result of the planning activities
other project documents may also get
updated for example the quality
management plan may result in updates to
the cost or resource requirements there
may be questions in the PMP exam based
on the plan quality management process
so please ensure you have a fair
understanding of the concept before you
take the exam
in the next screen let us discuss the
second quality management process
once the quality planning is over the
next process and project quality
management is quality assurance which
involves determining whether the
standards are being met and the
processes are being followed therefore
the input for this process is the work
that has been completed during the
quality planning stage
they are project documents quality
management plan process Improvement plan
quality metrics and quality control
measurements let us look at the tools
and techniques used in this process
quality audit is the process to check
whether the project is complying with
the organization policies standards and
procedures and determine whether these
policies standards and procedures used
are efficient and effective
so a good audit not only looks at this
compliance but also for the new Lessons
Learned From the current project that
can help make the future projects better
process analysis involves using the
lessons learned from doing the initial
few work to make the remaining work more
efficient
for example if the project involves
installing a software package then the
lesson learned from the first few
installations can be used to improve the
process on remaining installations
apart from these all the quality
management and control tools such as the
seven basic quality tools will be
relevant to this process
the key output of this process is
Project documents updates to ensure that
if there is any deviation from agreed
standards it is corrected also if there
are any lessons learned that can help
improve the future projects the
organization process assets get updated
this quality assurance may result in
Improvement suggestions change requests
may be generated and the project
management plan may need to be updated
understanding characteristics of quality
assurance tools and techniques may be
useful while answering the exam so
prepare this topic well before you take
the exam in the next screen let us
discuss the last process of quality
management
the key focus of the quality control
activities is on the correctness of the
work
quality control helps answer questions
like is everything okay with the project
does the project plan require changes to
successfully execute the project will
the project succeed
Etc
let us look at the inputs to this
process the quality metrics measurements
are done continuously to see whether the
project quality is improving the project
deliverables are inspected against the
planned checklists quality control acts
upon the deliverables and work
performance data produced in execution
it also refers to the project management
plan for understanding deviations from
the plan it also considers the approved
change requests information from other
project documents and organizational
process assets there are seven popular
tools and techniques used in doing the
quality control activities they are
collectively known as seven basic tools
of quality other relevant tools are
statistical sampling inspection or
testing and review of the approved
changes quality control activities
result in quality control measurements
the verified deliverables validated
changes information about the work being
performed recommended changes and
updates to the organizational process
assets project management plan and other
project documents in the next screen let
us look into a business scenario to
understand this concept better after
reading the problem statement click the
solution button to look at a possible
answer
Six Sigma is a highly disciplined
process that focuses on developing and
delivering near perfect products and
services consistently if large volume of
data is plotted over a period of time
you would most probably have a
bell-shaped graph such graphs are also
called normal distribution graph it's
called as normal distribution because
any large volume of data is plotted with
the intent to track variations would
most probably be in a bell-shaped curve
the line corresponding to the top of the
bell curve is the median of the data
sample standard deviation concept is
used to measure how far any data is from
the mean standard deviation is also
called Sigma one standard deviation from
the mean covers 68 percent of the data 6
Sigma means six standard deviations from
the mean this would cover
99.99966 percent of the data
we will look at an example of Six Sigma
in the following screen to understand
Six Sigma let us look at an example a
tire Manufacturing Company produces one
hundred thousand tires a day it is not
possible to verify each and every Tire
manually to ensure it is defect-free
instead random sample of these
manufactured tires are taken and checked
for defects assuming that the thickness
of the tires is a parameter to measure
defect any tire that has a thickness
more than or less than 10 millimeters is
considered to be defective now if you
measure the actual thickness of all one
hundred thousand tires manufactured
daily and plot them on a graph you get
normal distribution graph one standard
deviation from the mean covers 68
percent of the data meaning if the
thickness of the one hundred thousand
tires are plotted 68 000 of them lie
within one standard DVD Asian above or
below the mean now if a company operates
at Six Sigma level they would ensure
that all tires that are up to six
standard deviations from the mean are
defect free therefore in such cases you
can expect only three defective tires
out of a million tires manufactured let
us now check your understanding of the
topics covered in this lesson
here is a quick recap of what was
covered in this lesson
a project is said to meet quality
expectations when all the project
requirements agreed in the beginning of
the project are met and the resulting
product is usable
quality management includes creating and
following policies and procedures that
meet the Project's defined quality needs
quality planning defines the standards
templates policies and procedures
quality assurance determines if the
project is complying with the policies
and procedures quality control measures
specific project results against
standards
plan quality management perform quality
assurance and control quality are the
three project quality management
processes
seven basic quality tools are used to
plan and achieve the desired levels of
quality
at Six Sigma level there would be only
three defects out of a million units
manufactured

project Human Resource Management
includes the processes that organize
manage and lead the project team
one of the key elements of human
resource management is that each of the
project team members should have clear
assignment of their roles and
responsibilities
in addition even the team working on
project management tasks should be a
part of the project team and they are
responsible for project management
functions like initiating planning
executing monitoring and controlling and
closing along with other leadership
activities in the next screen let us
understand the difference between
functional and project manager
an organization may have both functional
managers and project managers the
difference
functional manager is the one who
handles a business function or
department for instance the HR manager
is responsible for the HR department in
an organization therefore an HR Manager
will be a functional manager generally a
functional manager is also a subject
matter expert
the roles and responsibilities of the
functional manager depend upon the core
business of the organization and overall
organization structure functional
managers normally own the resources and
provide the projects with necessary
resources they also negotiate with the
project manager regarding resources the
project manager on the other hand is
responsible and accountable for the
success or failure of a project and the
quality of the project they are not
technical experts the project manager
may not have authority over the
resources depending upon the
organizational structure they often have
to negotiate with the functional manager
for the resources and are responsible
for the product quality a project
manager will credit the team with the
success of the project and accept the
blame for the failure now let us look at
an example to understand the roles
played by functional and project
managers the CEO of an organization
initiates a new project to secure an ISO
9001
2008 certification for the company now
this project would require team members
from each of the company departments and
whoever is the project manager of this
project will have to request the
functional manager to assign one of
their team members to the project
resources assigned to the project go
back to their respective departments
once the project is completed
let us now discuss the project Human
Resource Management processes in the
next screen there are four project Human
Resource Management processes the first
process plan human resource management
is done as part of the planning process
group the next three processes are part
of the executing process group these
processes are acquire project team
develop project team and manage projects
team let us now look into each of these
processes in detail in the next screen
let us begin with plan human resource
management
plan human resource management is the
process of identifying and documenting
project roles responsibilities required
skills reporting relationships and
creating a staffing management plan this
process is part of the planning process
group in addition to that finalizing the
project hierarchy of who reports to whom
and designing the Staffing management
plan is also part of this process
the first input to this process is the
project management plan there could be a
lot of information in the project
management plan and subsidiary plans
that may be relevant to the creation of
the human resource management plan for
example the Project Life Cycle processes
the timelines how the work will be
accomplished
Etc the other key input for this process
is the activity resource requirement
team members can be identified based on
these requirements in addition to this
Enterprise environmental factors like
current employment Outlook Etc are also
important for example if the economy is
booming and there are Apple job
opportunities for the team members the
reward and recognition system can keep
the project team interested in the
project organizational process asset is
also an input to this process an example
of the organization process assets can
be templates or a form to request for a
new resource let us now look at the
tools and techniques used to develop
human resource plan
the roles and responsibilities are
captured in the form of organization
charts and position descriptions there
are various ways to draw this chart it
can be either hierarchical chart which
shows the reporting function or it can
be text based the other technique used
for developing the human resource plan
is networking this involves formal or
informal interactions within the
organization and outside by the project
manager to identify the best team for
the project depending upon various
interpersonal factors
organizational Theory helps to
understand how individuals come together
and function as an organization
expert judgment and meetings are
required to put the human resource plan
together
the output of this process is human
resource management plan this plan
contains documents like Staffing
management plan
project organization chart and roles and
responsibilities Matrix
the Staffing management plan is a
comprehensive document that describes
when and how team members would be added
to and released from the project
another component of the Staffing
management plan is the recognition and
reward system
recognition and reward system helps
project managers motivate their team the
Staffing management plan is relevant to
the projects of a functional or Matrix
organization where project team members
are always caught in a dilemma about
prioritizing Project work against
regular departmental work in the next
screen let us discuss organization
charts and role descriptions
a project manager needs to make sure
that there is an organization chart
prepared specifically for the project it
should clearly identify the roles and
the reporting relationships between them
a sample organization chart is shown on
the slide
another way of clearly delineating
responsibilities among team members is
by using a responsibility assignment
Matrix one form of responsibility
assignment Matrix is the raci chart in
the raci chart R stands for responsible
a for accountable C for concerned or
consulted and I for informed for each
important activity or deliverable on the
project it needs to be clearly
identified who is responsible or
contributes to it who is ultimately
accountable who is merely concerned
about the success and who needs to be
informed or kept in the loop an example
of the raci chart is shown on the screen
in this case project manager John is
accountable for the project plan and the
other team members Chris Sally and Ting
are responsible for completing the plan
similarly you can note the roles of each
resource in the other activities
in the next screen let us understand
resource histogram
resource histogram as a method of
depicting how many resources are
required for the life of a project if
You observe the chart shown on the
screen it indicates that the number of
Staff hours required on the project
increases to a peak in 2014 and then
slowly tapers off especially for long
running projects the level of Staffing
needed may vary considerably over a
period This has implications for other
parts of the plan as well for example
the cost will vary as the number of
resources change this piece of
information helps a project manager to
understand at what time they need to
onboard and off-board resources on a
project in the next screen let us look
into the second human resource
management process that is acquire
project team
acquire project team is the process of
confirming human resource availability
and obtaining the team necessary to
complete project activities
this process belongs to the executing
process group
acquiring resources may not be required
in the planning phase therefore it is
done in execution phase though you may
plan to acquire few in the planning
phase major acquisition is done in
execution phase this may be true where
large projects are run spanning over
many years with several detailed
activities the key input is the human
resource management plan Enterprise
environmental factors help understand
which team members will be available to
work on the project
how much they will cost
Etc organizational process assets will
help understand the hiring procedure of
the company the policies that govern the
use of team members on the project
Etc the key technique for acquiring the
project team is negotiation as a project
manager you have to negotiate with the
company's Senior Management resource
manager or with prospective candidates
to secure the most suitable resources on
the project sometimes the resources may
be pre-assigned to a project this
typically happens when they are the key
resources without which the project
cannot take off sometimes the project
team is acquired by getting required
resources through external vendors most
of the bigger organizations have
approved a list of vendors who provide
resources on a contractual basis
nowadays the concept of virtual team is
also quite popular to get a project team
so even though the project is being
conceived in one country a big big part
of the team can be in another country
for example if the project is conceived
in the USA majority of the team can be
in Germany and both the teams can
coordinate over the phone email chat Etc
multi-criteria decision analysis is also
an important tool to achieve the
objectives while acquiring the human
resources for the project it is
important to consider a number of
factors such as availability cost skill
set experience attitude relocation needs
Etc these criteria have to be considered
in totality and balanced out against the
Project's requirements the output of
this process is Project staff
assignments resource calendars and
updates on project management plan let
us now discuss the next process develop
project team
once the project team is acquired the
next step is developing the project team
develop project team is the process of
improving competencies team member
interaction and overall team environment
to enhance project performance
this process belongs to the executing
process group the inputs to this process
include project staff assignments
resource calendars and Human Resource
Management plan one of the techniques
used in developing project team is
interpersonal skills it is more of an
art than a science and this is where
individual characteristics of project
managers matter a lot if the project
manager genuinely commands trust and
respects the team members developing the
team becomes easy team members look up
to the project manager not only for
getting Project Specific Instructions
but also for their career advancement as
well social activities like celebrating
a team member's birthday going for
parties outside the office
Etc helps in team building training is
also an important tool for developing
the project team as it helps in
increasing the knowledge of competencies
of the team members sometimes
co-locating the team members at a single
place also helps in developing team
bonding this is especially important if
team members work from different
geographical locations knowing a person
face to face does help in reducing
conflict project managers can also
encourage the team members by providing
recognition and rewards Personnel
assessment tools give the project
manager insights into the strengths and
opportunities for improvement in the
team members these tools also help in
understanding members aspirations so
that the project manager can better
align the project goals with the
individual aspirations finally the
project manager should also set some
ground rules in the project to ensure
that team performs their work without
any problems some such rules can be
everyone should reach office for daily
meeting by 9 30 am sharp if there is
more than a 10 percent delay in
completing any activity assigned it
should immediately be escalated to
project manager if there are any
unforeseen circumstances it should be
immediately brought to the notice of the
project manager Etc the output of this
process is team performance assessments
this is done by the project manager to
evaluate and enhance the effectiveness
of the team as a whole this is a
document which explains team
Effectiveness as information about the
team evolves the Enterprise
environmental factors may also be
updated questions that test a project
manager's role in developing a project
team can be expected in the PMP exam so
ensure that you have a fair
understanding of the role before you
take the exam in the next screen let us
discuss the manage project team process
managing the project team is different
from developing the project team though
it is also done during the execution
process group it relates to measuring
team members performance providing
feedback resolving issues and managing
changes to optimize project performance
to measure team members performance the
manager should know the work assigned to
them as well as their performance on the
assigned work hence project staff
assignments and team performance
assessments are listed as input to this
process the human resource management
plan serves as a guideline for managing
project teams some organizations have
template and procedures to do such
assessment and that being the reason why
organization process asset is also one
of the inputs to this process the work
performance reports as well as issue
logs will be inputs because the team
management activities have to be
performed in this context observation
and conversation is a technique where
the project manager monitors and
discusses the tasks done by the team
this does not imply formal project
status reports but having an informal
interaction with the team before
documenting the project status report
knowing about the issue early helps in
resolving them early formal performance
appraisals are helpful in evaluating the
team members performance on the project
the project manager creates these with
the help of the team supervisors it is
an established practice in most
organizations to evaluate team members
for their work this may have a bearing
on their future assignments salary
promotions Etc since the power of
appraising lies within the project
manager the project manager can use this
as an effective tool for managing the
team since multiple resources work on a
single project it is quite natural to
expect conflicts it is the
responsibility of project manager to
resolve conflicts Conflict Management
has been discussed in detail later in
the lesson you can expect questions on
Conflict Management in the exam
the other tool is interpersonal skills
the output of managing a project team
includes corrective action
recommendations like which team members
to be changed implementing some reward
system to motivate the team Etc updating
the project management plans documents
organization process asset and
Enterprise environmental factors are the
other outputs of this process there can
be questions in the PMP exam that test a
project manager skill in managing a
project team so ensure that you are
aware of the inputs tools and techniques
and outputs of managing a project team
let us discuss Team Dynamics in the next
screen any team naturally goes through
several stages as it gets together these
stages are forming storming norming
performing and adjourning informing
stage a team formally comes together for
the first time in storming stage
disagree payments start to surface this
is followed by norming when the teams
start working together and trusting each
other in performing stage they are able
to deliver results as a team finally the
team is adjourned when the work of the
project is completed or the project is
terminated
in the next screen let us discuss
conflict management
many organizations look for people with
diverse background to get different
perspectives about work if people with
diverse backgrounds and culture work on
a project it is quite natural to expect
conflict conflict often results in
opportunities for improvement the root
causes of conflict can be scarce
resources scheduling priorities and
personal work Styles while the popular
belief is that personality or ego can be
the key reason for conflict it is the
least possible reason for conflict as a
project manager if you find yourself in
between a conflict with a team member
sit across the table and resolve it if
not they should get their immediate
managers involved and try to resolve it
to avoid conflicts a project manager
should let everyone involved have
complete clarity about the project
assign the roles and responsibilities to
each of the team members clearly ensure
that there are no overlapping
responsibilities which could be a
possible cause for conflict sometimes
boredom at work can also lead to
conflict so one of the responsibilities
of project manager is to keep motivating
the team members and let them work on
interesting and challenging assignments
business scenarios based questions on
Conflict Management can be expected in
the PMP exam so it is essential to have
a fair understanding of the topic in the
next screen let us look at conflict
resolution techniques
there are five techniques of resolving
conflict they are withdraw or avoid
smooth or accommodate compromise or
reconcile force or direct collaborate or
problem solve in withdraw or avoid one
Retreats from a potential conflict
situation or defers the resolution to a
later date this does not resolve the
conflict but allows for more time in
smooth or accommodate areas of agreement
are emphasized to reduce the intensity
of the conflict again this does not on
its own result in a resolution but it
may succeed in changing the perceptions
about the situation in compromise or
reconcile there is some give and take in
order to bring some satisfaction to all
parties depending on how the process
went this may be perceived as a when
when or a lose-lose situation because
none of the parties really get what they
want enforce or direct a person in a
position of authority directs how the
matter should be resolved it may be
necessary to do this when the matter has
to be resolved immediately however this
may result in upsetting one or more of
the conflicting parties in collaborate
or problem solving the parties in the
conflict are asked to come together to
collaborate and look for a resolution to
the problem this offers the greatest
likelihood of a satisfactory and
permanent resolution and should be
resorted to whenever possible business
scenario-based problems where a
resolution technique has to be selected
can be expected in the PMP exam
so understanding the conflict resolution
techniques is essential in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer one of the key
responsibilities of a project manager is
to get work done by the team there are
certain powers that a project manager
can use to get the work done a project
manager has to use a combination of
techniques to get this accomplished
various powers of a project manager are
legitimate or formal reward penalty
expert and referent in legitimate or
formal project manager can formally
assign a work to a team member that he
or she has to do project manager can
reward and recognize the team members
the reward could be as simple as
assigning challenging or sought after
work to a team member this can motivate
good performers on the project sometimes
project manager can penalize the team
member numbers for poor performance some
project managers are able to command
Authority because of their expertise in
a certain field project manager can be
considered as a reference of higher
authority to get the work done sometimes
referent Authority also arises from the
personal charm or Charisma of the
project manager legitimate reward and
penalty are the powers derived from the
project manager's position in the
company expert power exists when the
project manager is an expert on the
subject matter reward and expert are
usually the best forms of authority to
use penalty is the worst way of
influencing and managing the team a
project manager should resort to this
only as a last option regardless of the
project manager having formal reporting
authority over the team they are
naturally looked upon as the leaders for
their projects project managers need to
be familiar with the leadership styles
and be able to tailor their style
according to the needs of the project
and that of the team there are three
leadership styles the first one is
authoritarian or autocratic in this
style the leader sets clear expectations
of the team and expects complete
compliance in a participative or
Democratic style the leader offers
guidance but also involves the team in
decision making in a delegative or
laissez-faire style the leader leaves
the work to the team without offering
much guidance in most circumstances you
would want your leader to employ a
participative style but there may be
occasions when other styles might be
appropriate in the next screen let us
discuss McKenzie's 7s framework
a popular framework in management
science is the McKenzie's 7s framework
there are seven elements that are
divided into two categories an
organization working on a project will
have these elements already in place and
hence these become the hard elements the
first three elements of the 7s framework
are the strategy structure and systems
the leader or project manager is
expected to step in and exhibit soft
elements to earn the mantle of
leadership
the next four elements are shared values
Skills style and staff there are 47
processes and project management grouped
into 10 knowledge areas and mapped into
five process groups in this lesson we
will look at the seventh knowledge area
that is Project Communications
management and its processes in the next
screen let us understand communication
communication can be best defined as a
two-way process of exchanging
information between two entities as you
can see on the screen if project is an
entity the project needs to communicate
with other entities in the organization
like project managers Senior Management
of the organization and any other
stakeholder of the project similarly
these entities may also have to
communicate with the projects the
communication between project and the
stakeholders is always two-sided project
manager is responsible for ensuring
proper communication to and from the
project in fact a project manager spends
almost 90 percent of his or her time on
communication you can now understand how
important it is for a project manager to
plan this activity well in the next
screen let us discuss communication
methods
communication can be done in two ways it
can be done written or verbal both
written as well as verbal communication
can either be formal or informal formal
means communicating by following some
basic rules whereas informal means
taking a casual approach these two
combinations result in four different
communication methods they are formal
written formal verbal informal written
and informal verbal formal written
method is used for project management
plans project Charter and over long
distance communication formal verbal
method is used during presentations
whereas informal written method is
applicable while writing notes or emails
informal verbal on the other hand is
applied during conversations
you can expect questions in the PMP exam
which require choosing a communication
method for a given situation so a fair
understanding of the communication
methods can help you score higher in the
next screen let us look at the various
communication Technologies
communication technology refers to the
different media used for communicating a
few such Technologies are listed on
screen among which email fax and
telephone are a few popular
communication Technologies in the next
screen let us understand the
communication Channel with the help of
an example
communication takes place between four
people in a team the lines across the
members represent there can be six
unique channels of communication
existing within the team now if the team
comprises 10 members how many unique
channels of communication will be
calculated you can use the formula n
multiplied with n minus 1 and the
resulting sum divided by two n is the
total number of people involved in
communication in this case n equals to
ten if this is put into the formula you
will get 45 as the result
therefore 45 unique communication
channels exist in a team of 10 people it
is difficult to manage such a large
number of communication channels
therefore it is important to structure
communication otherwise everyone starts
communicating everything to everyone and
it can become a real chaos in the
project in the PMP exam you may be asked
to calculate the number of communication
channels in a scenario-based question so
please make a note of the formula to
answer the question correctly in the
next screen let us discuss the basic
communication model
project Communications management
includes the processes required to
ensure that information about timely and
appropriate generation collection
distribution storage and ultimate
disposition of project is prepared and
circulated to all project stakeholders
it is the responsibility of a project
manager to ensure that the information
requested by the stakeholder is
communicated to them the frequency at
which the information needs to be shared
may also vary from stakeholder to
stakeholder for example think about a
simple process of sharing a project
status report with the customer and
Senior Management this knowledge area
explains how it should be done as per
PMI in the next screen let us discuss
the project Communications management
processes
there are three project Communications
management processes
process is carried during different
process groups plan communication
management is done during planning
process group manage Communications is
done during executing process group and
control Communications is done during
monitoring and controlling process group
in the next few screens we will cover
each of these processes in detail
plan Communications management is the
process of developing an appropriate
approach and plan for project
Communications based on stakeholders
information needs and requirements and
available organizational assets
this belongs to the planning process
group stakeholder register is an
important input to this process it is a
list of all the stakeholders the project
management plan has information about a
large number of the project requirements
and the stakeholders who need to receive
communication of various kinds are
therefore a critical input to this
process in addition to these two
organization process assets and
Enterprise environmental factors are
also inputs to this process many
organizations have standard templates to
prepare communication management plan
which are part of the organizational
process assets and Enterprise
environmental factors the first
technique used in this process is the
communication requirements analysis
where the communication requirements of
each of the stakeholders are analyzed
and categorized in this you try to find
how many of the stakeholders need
similar kind of information which can be
grouped together if you send information
through an email system all those
stakeholders who need similar
information can be marked in CC in the
email next you can decide on the
communication technology these days
email is the most widely used technology
but in few cases you might have to send
information using some other technology
like fax or registered post for example
all government Communications are done
using registered post to keep a written
record finally you need to understand
how communication really happens that is
the communication models and the various
communication methods used you may need
to conduct meetings before agreeing on
and finalizing the communications
management plan the communications
management plan is the prime Mary output
of this process which lays down the
procedures around Communications in the
organization communication management
plan has information like which
stakeholder needs what kind of
information at what frequency and how as
a result of this process some other
project documents may also get updated
there may be questions in the PMP exam
based on the planned Communications
management process so a fair
understanding of the process will help
you answer such questions correctly in
the next screen let us look into a
business scenario to understand this
concept better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer
manage Communications is the process of
creating collecting Distributing storing
retrieving and the ultimate disposition
of project information in accordance to
the communications management plan it
belongs to the executing process group
managed Communications is done
throughout the Project Life Cycle
everything cannot be planned during
communication planning so manage
Communications takes care of responding
to unexpected requests for information
as well Communications management plan
is an important input work performance
reports have information regarding
project performance and Status
information organizational process
assets are the standard templates
created for the status report by
organizations in some organizations
there are guidelines for communication
distribution Enterprise environmental
factors are the other inputs to this
process various tools and techniques are
used in this process Communications
technology represents the means of
technology that is email instant
messaging telephone conferencing Etc
that are used to exchange information
the use of communication models helps
you determine the technique that is best
suited for a particular situation
communication methods are the various
methods used to communicate for example
whether it is interactive or offline
whether information is being pushed by
the provider or pulled by the recipient
Etc Information Management systems help
design a framework for managing the
information within a project that is how
it is acquired where it is stored and
how it is distributed and destroyed in
performance reporting all the
information is synthesized in the form
of performance reports that are later
distributed to the appropriate
stakeholders and forms an important part
of the communications strategy on a
project the first and primary output of
this process is the communications
messages that are generated during the
project the other outputs include
project management plan updates project
document updates and organizational
process assets updates in the next
screen let us discuss controlled
Communications process control
Communications is the process of
monitoring and controlling
Communications throughout the entire
Project Life Cycle to ensure the
information needs of the Project's
stakeholders are met it is part of the
monitoring and controlling process group
the inputs to this process are the
project communications project
management plan and issue log which has
a list of issues that are raised by
different project stakeholders data
related to the work being performed on
the project and various other project
documents which may have to be
communicated other inputs include work
performance data and organizational
process assets let us look at the tools
and techniques in detail the information
management systems provide tools to
collect consolidate and present the
information in the form of code concise
Communications expertise must be sought
from different stakeholders on how you
should go about this process several
meetings may be needed to ensure the
efficiency and efficacy of the
communications the major outputs of this
process is the work performance
information which indicates that the
work performance data has been analyzed
interpreted and presented in an easily
comprehensible form this process may
also give rise to change requests
updates to the project management plan
project documents and organizational
process assets in the next screen let us
look into a business scenario to
understand this concept better after
reading the problem statement click the
solution button to look at a possible
answer project risk management includes
the processes of conducting risk
management planning
identification analysis response
planning and controlling risk on a
project
it has been mentioned in practice
standard for project risk management
that project risk management aims to
identify and prioritize risks in advance
of their occurrence
and provide action-oriented information
to project managers
project risk management is an integral
part of the project management
it provides an approach through which
uncertainty can be understood assessed
and managed within the projects
effective project risk management is
essential for the success of a project
let us discuss the interdependencies
between project risk management and
project management in the following
screen when you say risk management is
an integral part of project management
it means that they are dependent on each
other
the output of many project management
processes can be considered as an input
for risk management and vice versa for
example by getting the information about
the project progress in terms of
schedule you realize that it is not in
line with the expected progress which
can become a risk for the project
so risk management plays an important
role to decide what response must be
given or what actions are to be taken
similarly based on the response of risk
management the project management plan
with respect to the deliverable will
change as you already know all the
projects have uncertainty
project management can be seen as an
attempt to control this uncertain
environment through the use of
structured techniques like estimating
planning cost control
activity allocation earned value
analysis monitoring and review meetings
project risk management provides an
approach by which uncertainty can be
understood assessed and managed within
projects
so effective project management is a
critical success factor for project
success
let us continue this discussion on
Project risk management and project
management in the next screen the
management or project manager should not
look at project risk management as an
optional activity or overhead
the interface between project risk
management and other processes of
project management must be cleared to
address the uncertainty
the outputs of project risk management
should be considered within the project
management processes
they can impact various aspects like
estimating resources cost or duration
assessing the impact of scope changes
resource allocation and project progress
reports to the stakeholders
the effectiveness of project management
process is increased by using the
information and results from Project
risk management on the other hand some
of the outputs of other project
management processes such as work
breakdown structure WBS estimation of
schedule and cost and assumptions are
important prerequisites for project risk
management
let us first discuss how we can make
risk management process effective in the
next screen you make risk management
more successful effective or consistent
by using processes methodologies or a
set of activities
however before using these processes you
should keep some points in mind
risk management process should be
scalable to meet different elements like
available resources methodology and
processes used tools and techniques used
supporting infrastructure review and
update frequency and Reporting
requirements
it is important to have a clear
understanding of the risk threshold that
defines the views of key stakeholders on
acceptable levels of risk
it is equally important to identify the
framework to manage the risk starting
from the initiation stage to its
successful implementation
project risk management activities
resources and attention should be
appropriated to the project
since different projects warrant
different levels of risk management
application
some of the actions required for
tailoring are
defining objectives against which risks
will be identified
defining how the elements like resources
methodologies tools infrastructure and
communication are scalable for the
project
and defining risk thresholds tolerances
and the assessment of framework
the outputs should be documented
communicated reviewed to ensure common
understanding of the scope and
objectives for the project risk
management processes in this screen we
will look into the high-level activities
carried out in the six project risk
management processes
the first process is plan risk
management
in this process you define the scope and
objectives of the project risk
management processes
the key output of this process is the
project risk management plan
the second process is identify risks
in this process you identify maximum
possible known risks
you will be focusing on the tools and
techniques used in the process of
identifying risks
the key output is the risk register
the third process is perform qualitative
risk analysis
this process is about prioritizing risks
and ranking them as high medium and low
for further action
the focus will be on tools used to
prioritize risks
the fourth process is perform
quantitative risk analysis
in this process you evaluate the
combined effect of risks on the overall
project outcome
the risks are Quantified numerically
the fifth process is plan risk responses
this process helps us determine
appropriate response strategies and
actions for each individual risk and for
overall project risk and integrates them
into overall project management plan
the sixth and last process is control
risks
this process focuses on implementing
risk response plans tracking identified
risks
monitoring residual risks
identifying new risks and evaluating
risk process Effectiveness throughout
the project
in the next screen we will look into the
flow of all these six processes and how
it works logically
with PMP certification so what are you
waiting for hurry up and enroll Now find
the course Link in the description box
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the 10th
knowledge area that is Project
stakeholder management and its processes
in the next screen let us understand who
stakeholders are
a stakeholder is anybody who has a stake
in the project a stakeholder may be an
individual a group or an organization
who may affect or be affected by or
perceive to be affected by a decision
activity or outcome of a project further
the nature of the impact can be positive
or negative thus giving rise to the
notion of positive or negative
stakeholders irrespective of whether a
stakeholder is positive or negative it
is important to engage with the
stakeholders and get them involved in
the project this can make a critical
difference to the success or failure of
the project a single disgruntled
stakeholder can bring the entire project
to its knees whereas an actively engaged
and influential stakeholder can have the
opposite effect let us understand who
the common stakeholders of a project are
there are several categorizations of
stakeholders the project managers
themselves are important stakeholders
the project team members represent
stakeholders in the project the Senior
Management of the organization which is
working on the project has a stake in
the project the sponsor that is the
person or entity that provides the money
and resources for the project and
essentially Champions the project is an
important stakeholder the customer which
may be different from the sponsor is a
stakeholder as well for instance and
many of the projects in the social
sector the sponsor may be the government
or a development agency whereas the
customers would be the people who
actually benefit from it the end users
which may be different from the
customers or the sponsors are
stakeholders too the vendors or
suppliers who provide goods or services
to the project are important
stakeholders people whose lives may be
impacted by the output of the project
are also stakeholders for example if a
highway project requires possession of
privately owned land people whose land
is being taken away are the stakeholders
if the construction of a dam or water
reservoir benefits the downstream
farming communities they are the
stakeholders here competitors who
provide alternative goods or services
are stakeholders too sometimes
environmentalists or other social groups
may become stakeholders the government
or political leadership may become
stakeholders for projects in the public
domain it is sufficient to state that
there could potentially be hundreds of
stakeholders for a large project it is
in the interest of the project manager
and the project team to clearly identify
all such stakeholders up front and then
actively manage them throughout the
project in the next screen let us
discuss the classification models for
stakeholder analysis
not all the stakeholders have the same
amount of influence or power over the
project therefore the way to manage each
stakeholder needs to be calibrated based
on a proper classification of the
stakeholders this is the role of the
classification model you can come up
with a grid that Maps the power of the
stakeholders the interest they have the
influence they may have or the impact
that they can have on the project
through the power interest power
influence or influence impact grids it
can be represented by mapping
stakeholders to a power or interest grid
the diagram on the screen has x-axis
which represents interest level and
y-axis which represents the power level
based on the various combinations of
power levels and interest levels the
grid can be divided into four quadrants
the stakeholders on the top right
quadrant with high power and high
interest need to be managed closely that
is you have to monitor their involvement
and engagements very closely the
stakeholders on the bottom right
quadrant with high interest but low
power need to be kept in the loop that
is you should share information with
them and keep them regularly informed
the stakeholders on the top left
quadrant with high power but low
interest can be managed by keeping them
happy for example by making sure that
their interests and opinions are taken
into consideration the stakeholders on
the left bottom quadrant with low power
and low interest may be managed less
actively by simply monitoring how things
are going with them the salience model
describes classes of stakeholders based
on their power ability to impose their
will
urgency need for immediate attention and
legitimacy appropriateness of their
involvement level this is a useful
framework to guide the stakeholder
management strategy on a project
practice creating power grids for
business scenarios this will help in
understanding the level of Engagement of
project manager needs to maintain with
various stakeholders
in the next screen let us discuss the
stakeholder engagement assessment Matrix
the stakeholder engagement assessment
Matrix allows visualizing the current
and desired states of a stakeholder's
involvement in the project the five
levels of involvement are as unaware
resistant neutral supportive and leading
unaware is where the stakeholder is not
aware of the project or its impact
resistant is where the stakeholder is
aware of the impacts and is resistant to
change neutral is where the stakeholder
is aware of the project and is neither
supportive nor in opposition to the
project supportive is where the
stakeholder is aware of the project and
its impact and is supportive of the
change leading is where the stakeholder
is aware of the project and impacts and
is actively engaged to ensure that the
project is successful
let us now look at the Matrix the table
has one row per stakeholder identified
you place C in the column which best
indicates the current level of
Engagement for that stakeholder then you
place D in the column which best
indicates the desired state of
Engagement this table can be a quick
visualization tool that helps understand
where work has to be done in the
stakeholder management activities in the
next screen let us discuss the skills
required for stakeholder management
stakeholder management is both an art
and a science
since it involves dealing with people
and people are inherently non-linear and
unpredictable there is no one size that
fits all strategies or tools that will
work while managing them
however a project manager may use a few
traits and techniques while managing
stakeholders which are classified as
interpersonal skills and managerial
skills a project manager must possess
good interpersonal skills that is must
invest the time and energy to build
trust this involves multiple things such
as establishing a personal Rapport
following through on commitments being
punctual Etc once the trust is
established it helps in smoothing many
difficult bends conflict management is
an important skill for a project manager
while communicating with stakeholders
the project manager must practice active
listening they must not assume that they
have all the answers
instead they should spend some time to
understand the issues and the
stakeholders points of view this alone
can go a long way in smoothing ruffled
feathers and building constructive
relationships resistance to change is
natural a project manager must know how
to convert that into a positive energy
in its favor managerial skills that may
help in accomplishing the project
objectives a project manager must be
able to build consensus among the group
while absolute uniformity may not always
be possible or desirable the project
manager must use techniques to ensure
widespread discussions and arrive at a
path that the group can buy into the
project manager must be able to
influence people often without
necessarily being in the position of
authority the project manager must be
skillful to negotiate agreements the
project manager must be able to
understand and modify organizational
behavior in order to move the project in
a certain direction here we wrap up this
