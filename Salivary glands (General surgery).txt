hi students myself dr saithi team mds
conquer
so today's topic of discussion is on
general surgery related to salivary
glands
okay this is given in the chapter of
head and neck pertaining to the general
surgery
so uh the histology aspects the clinical
features
as well as the anatomy path have already
been discussed before
so an ad part is being discussed in
anatomy and the astrologian clinical
features and the important diseases
of salivary glands have been discussed
in oral medicine as well as opat
so this particular discussion is going
to enhance and going to focus on the
diagnostic as well as the surgical
related treatment modalities
for the salivary gland diseases okay so
if you have already gone through that
uh you can if you have a good idea of
the clinical the histological as well as
a
related features before then you can
directly attend this discussion or else
you can just have a glance
and coming and you can attend this
discussion okay
and one more thing i feel i hope you
have done very well in your
oral surgery exam that has happened
recently but even if you have not
uh not so well or even if you think that
you are not up to the mark
don't get disheartened okay this period
of especially during the lockdown
is like it is actually uh
challenging for every student because
sitting at home for hours together and
preparing is not that easy for everyone
but
what i say is this you have you have
perhaps got the very best time in your
hand right so
excel yourself the excellence has to be
brought up in your hand
the subject whatever you're gaining now
get the grip of the subject
if you excel yourself in the subject in
your skills and also in your work
obviously the success will follow okay
the success remember one thing it's not
a destination it's always a long journey
at every step of your life wherever you
go the success
or your goals towards a success your
modalities towards the success will
change
right so it's only your uh thing what
you can do right now is being excellent
on whatever you're learning
that's it so whatever you're learning
now make a good notes of that
if get the entire concept of the subject
wherever it is
if that it's memory based put again some
nice mnemonics and something
which is related to that this will never
go waste
if you are excellent in whatever you are
preparing obviously
with any cost inevitably the success
will follow you
so be confident be cool don't get
disheartened even if you have done well
don't get over excited
all the ups and downs are common in a
student's life unless and
until you achieve whatever you want keep
on going
okay so at every step of your life not
only talking about the neet exam need is
a first success definitely
and again the success that journey goes
on till you reach your final destination
okay
so keep going students now let's start
the discussion
so coming to the most commons which have
been given in your general surgery
related to general surgery exam also
that's include the most common neoplasm
as we know it is pleomorphic adenoma and
malignant tumor of salivary glands is
muco epidermide carcinoma
neoplasm of the salivary gland in
children it's malignant
sorry neoplasm of salivary glands in
children is hemangioma
whereas malignant tumor of salivary
glands in children is
the epidermoid carcinoma so malignant
tumor
is muco epidermid carcinoma the most
common whereas neoplasm in children
is hemangioma okay and the last but not
the least very important the malignant
tumor of the minor salivary glands is
adenoid cystic carcinomas so this most
commons are very important students
do make a note of it okay
so coming to the various causes of the
salivary gland tumors
so which amongst these what i feel to be
the most
important causes are the first one that
is if there is a constant radiotherapy
to the hedonic region then that
particular patient can develop
the mucoidemic carcinoma of the salivary
gland so this is one of the most common
related to the dynamic
and also the epstein-barr virus
infection for the lymph epithelial
carcinoma
apart from that all these are the other
causes just have a look
whether it could be exposure to silica
whether it could be increased risk in
females with early monarch
whether it could be triosomy five in
primary mucoid pyramid classroom of
minor salivary glands
and also the translocation involving the
chromosome 11 in mucoipidamide carcinoma
so these two
are related to mucoidemic carcinoma
and polysomy of 13 and 17 in eggnog
cystic customers so these are the
various causes
so just have a look so coming to the
important
aspects again is the best diagnostic
modality for a parotid swelling is an
fnac that is fine
needle aspiration cytology okay it's the
best diagnostic
whereas open incisional biopsy is
actually contraindicated why because it
can cause
tumor cell implantation as well as
formation of the parroted fistula
so that's the reason the open incisional
biopsy is contraindicated
and the best investigation is the mri
but if they ask which is very economical
cost effective in
investigation for uh salivary gland
neoplasms then you have to go for
ultrasound okay
it is actually not that clear when
compared to mra
but it is very cheap mri is very costly
whereas
ultrasound is very cheap so if they ask
in that
perspective you have to go for
ultrasound or else ultrasound is not
that good when compared to mri mra will
clearly give the anatomical structures
also the
perfect delineation of the structures
and related to the anatomical structures
also will be given
so mra is perhaps the best imaging
investigation okay
ah whereas ultrasound can only
differentiate whether it's benign or
malignant it cannot
correctly give the anatomical landmarks
and also the perfect
structure it's of the tumor is not given
in an ultrasound
if it is homogeneous it's said to be
benign if it is heterogeneous it's said
to be malignant
so it is like that so if they ask the
best imaging modality
you have to go for mri provided it is
costly if they ask which of the
following is very cheap or cost
effective or economical modality for
salivary glands then you have to go for
ultrasound
okay so coming to the famous tumor
of the salivary glands which is the
gleomorphic adenoma we know
it's a parotid gland the superficial
lobe or the palated tail is a
common site for that and it is
encapsulated but it has finger like
projections
that's the reason enucleation should not
be done if it is done then it causes
recurrence so this point is very
important so e nucleation is not the
treatment modality
next fnac is diagnostic of the paratroop
swelling
treatment aspect is a superficial parrot
tradectomy
okay this dissection is actually made
on a patis facial venous plane i'll be
explaining that further
and commenced at the posterior inferior
border of the parotid gland whereas the
main trunk of the facial nerve
is found out so here only the
superficial lobe of the parotid gland
where the tumor is not in
involving or encroaching the facial
nerve that can be removed so most
common treatment for the pleomorphic
adenoma the treatment modality is the
superficial parotidectomy excision of
the whole gland
is done if it is involving the
submandibular gland
if it is a parotid gland only the
superficial parotidectomy
if it is a submandibular gland then the
whole gland is being removed
okay so the complications of the
pleomorphic adenoma could be
slight malignant change about three to
five percent which is called as
carcinoma x prio morphic adenoma
next is a recurrence if particularly
after the e-nucleation so if
e-nucleation is done
there is more chances of recurrence okay
so these are the important points
next can you can see here this is a
petty's facial
venous plane okay so as we as we know
the parotid gland has a
superficial lobe and a deep lobe that is
separated by a head
shaped isthmus which is a granular
tissue it is h
shape as you can see in the picture okay
so here
this plane is called as a petty facial
venus plane okay here is a place where
the branches of the facial nerve will
come
and uh lies there okay so here
petty's facial venous plane has the
branches of the facial nerve
that's the reason the surgeons use this
plane
for performing the uh superficial
peritonectomy and they remove the
superficial lobe
okay where the tumor lies in so this is
how you have to
have a look so this is also called as
petty's operation so superficial
parotidectomy also called as petty's
operation
so we can see as in the pictures the
superficial and deep lobe is surrounded
by heads shaped
isthmus which is a glandular tissue
wherein the
branches of the facial nerve lies in so
the this plane
is being used by the surgeons to remove
the parotid tumor
that's the thing you have to remember
okay so
coming to the picture as you can see so
as they can
uh the incisions are given and the
superficial lobe is separated and the
facial nerve will be
there like that as you can see okay so
that they can
preserve the main trunk of the facial
nerve so this is the most
important parroted gland treatment or
parotid tumor treatment that is
superficial parotidectomy
also called as petty shop operation
so we can see most of the benign tumors
they are
actually lies superficial to the cell uh
facial nerve as you can see this
yellow thing is a facial now so they lie
superficially
so when they perform this petite
operation or superficial parotidectomy
they remove this off and they preserve
the main trunk of the
facial nerve if it is inside you can see
if it is uh inside or in the deep lobe
or
and also enclosing the facial now then
superficial parotidectomy
will not be that effective okay
so but most of the parotid tumors or
most of the benign parrot tumors occurs
in the superficial lobe
so the best treatment modality is
perhaps the superficial parotidectomy
okay so the incisions which are being
given are these incision students very
important
so you have to go for this which is
modified blades incision so it runs like
this
as you can see so from the ear towards
the neck it runs
and then the other incision which is
equally important which is latest
followed is this modified facelift
incision so it runs
below the pin of the ear and literally
towards back of the air and runs down so
they can post these pictures and they
can ask
so this is a traditional facelift
picture as you can see
so these two are very important the
modified blades as well as a modified
facelift also called as
the minor parotidectomy incision this is
also called as a minor parrot rectum
incision so
these two are very important so they can
post a picture and they can ask the name
of the incision so have a look
so coming to the radical parotidectomy
so in case if i said
very rare if the tumor occurs in the
deeper lobe
then it involves the resection of all
the parotid gland even
along with the elective sectioning of
the facial nerve usually to the main
trunk
okay so this is rarely done because
rarely the tumor occurs in the deep lobe
or encroaching the facial nerve
so the most common treatment modality
for the parotid gland tumors especially
like priomorphic adenoma
or what instrument is superficial
parotidectomy because the tumors only
occurs in the superficial lobe so the
surgeons take that petty's
plane as a as their guidance and based
on that
plane they remove the superficial lobe
and they treat the disease after removal
they give any muscle graft from the
nearby sternocleidomastoid area
and then they do the grafting so this is
how it is done
okay so in order to reconstruct the face
and the structure of the parrot area
though they do the grafting
so that's its students next coming to
the what instima
so we know it is the second most benign
tumor it is common in males that you
have to remember it's not common in
females it's more common in males
okay and we know it is derived from the
salivary
tissue inclusions in the lymph nodes
okay so that they can arise
that from the cervical nodes so it has
histologically if we see that it has a
lymphoid component
and one more important thing is it
exclusively occurs
in the parotid gland it is exclusively
occurs
which of the following tumors
exclusively occurs in the parrot gland
then it is what instrument
okay almost towards the angle of the
mandible
it occurs lower portion of the parotid
overlying the angle of the mandible
next it consists of epithelial as well
as lymphoid elements and thus it is
known as adenolymphoma
okay so since it has a lymphoid
components as well as epithelial it is
called as adenolymphoma next
it is mostly associated with smoking
bilateral
occurs in 10 percent and it never ever
involves a facial nerve
okay so very important points which we
have missed in other
discussions so that have included here
it never
involves a facial nerve it is associated
with smoking and is also well
encapsulated
slowly growing and never turns malignant
it also never turns malignant whereas
pleuomorphic adenoma has three to five
percent of getting turned into carcinoma
x pleomorphic adenoma
what is tumor never turns malignant it
never involves a facial nerve
and the double layer lining of the cells
is distinctive
with the palisaded layer of columnar
cells resting on the cuboidal and the
polygonals polygonal cells
this you can remember if you want so
these two lines are very important do
remember
and fnac is the best diagnostic
superficial parotidectomy
is a treatment modality okay
so next coming to the most common
malignant tumor is the
muco epidermid carcinoma so
so it again has a low grade and a high
grade so these are the differentiating
features
so low grade it is well circumscribed
having cystic mucinous material
whereas the high grade is grossly
infiltrative and has less tendency to
form cystic
or it is heart tumor next mucin
predominating
nucian producing cells are predominating
here the squamous cells are
predominating
this is well differentiated this is
poorly differentiated
this is more common in children actually
this is less common
okay so these are the differentiating
features so treatment of choice
for the low grade type of the
mucobidomide carcinoma is either
superficial or total parotidectomy
here it is total peritotectomy
less or minus the radical and neck
dissection so if there are lymph nodes
involved
then even those lymph nodes have to be
dissected okay
so this treatment modalities as per the
surgery point of view are very very
important so do make a note of that
these two
the one which have highlighted in red
color do make a note of that
and the others also you can just make a
note okay
so coming to the adenoid cystic
carcinoma this is the most common
malignant tumor of the minor salivary
glands so it is minor salivary glands
and it has we know perineural invasion
is the most commonly tendency to invade
into the perineural tissues and also
lymphatics
thus causes pain which can be a
prominent and
early symptom and also has facial nerve
paralysis so
patient can present with a pain as early
symptom
so based on that you have to answer that
patient has pum complained of pain and
has developed
a swelling in the ultra oral minor
salivary glands area so the questions
can be asked like that
okay then it's the second most malignant
tumor second common most
after the muco epidermid carcinoma but
for the minor salivary glands it is the
most common okay next it has the
neurotropic properties
it also involved nerves are mostly the
facial nerve followed by the v3 that is
modular division
and the maxillary divisions of the
trigeminal nerve you have to remember
this
and the site of origin is usually the
minor salivary glands located especially
the heart palette followed by the cyano
nasal tract so this we have to remember
students
okay so
next again important is the skip lesions
so skip lesions means it will not
involve continuously
it will be like skip here and there okay
so skip lesions along the nerves are
actually common
because of which the treatment is very
challenging and
the treatment usually tends to fail
because
difficulty including the full extension
of the invasion
it is not continuous so they can ask
which of the following
tumors of the salivary glands have skip
lesions
then you have to go for adenoid cystic
carcinoma okay which of the following is
really challenging
and difficult to treat full extent
because of the skip lesions even that
you have to answer for
adenoid cystic carcinoma okay and also
it can grow
along the havisarian system of bone
without showing the bone destruction
one more important point and it is a
trickiest tumor
as as it appears to be benign even it
when it is malignant so it is actually
betrays it is
it cheats the surgeon it appears to be
benign but
even when it is malignant it appears to
be benign okay
sorry so that is very important
so best diagnostic modality fnac high
incidence
of distant mutasticism is there okay
and radical resection even uh
even if it appears to be benign the
radical excision with largest cuff of
the normal tissues which is surrounding
the borders of the tumor
is very important though it is benign
you are not supposed to go with simple
superficial parotidectomy the radical
resection has to be done
okay because it is poorly encapsulated
with infiltrating nature
so along with the normal tissue
surrounding that the entire tumor has to
be
entire gland which is affected has to be
removed okay so very important treatment
modality you have to
remember okay this one that very
important radical resection is very
important
and post op radiotherapy should also be
given if you feel the margins are
positive the margins are positive
the post or plato therapy has to be
given so as per the
surgeon surgery point of view the skip
lesions
is causing the treatment failure number
one important point
number two it is very tricky tumor it is
very cheating tumor because it appears
to be benign even when it is malignant
next third important point the radical
excision along with the normal uh
tissues has to be done
even even if it appears benign because
it is impurely encapsulated with
infiltrative nature
the last one is post-op radiotherapy has
to be given even if the margins are
positive
that's it so coming to the very much
important key point students
so the malignancy varies inversely
within the size of the gland
so malignancy the mostly the minor
salivary gland tumors are malignant okay
whereas the benign tumors common in
parroted land right so where but
malignant tumors are
inverse next parotid gland 25 percent
are malignant
submandibular and sub sublingual 50
percent are malignant
whereas minor salivary glands 75 percent
are malignant okay
open surgical biopsy is actually
contraindicated because uh it can cause
tumor seeding of the tract
also remember that the surgical biopsy
open surgical incisional biopsy as we
have discussed
is it is contraindicated next most
common
salivary gland tumors sorry mostly the
salivary gland tumors are
radio resistant okay these are the other
important key points that you need to
note okay
so this one this one and also the
malignancy of related to the specific
glands of salivary glands
next the last very important is a
neutron boron neutron therapy has been
used in management of
unresectable salivary gland tumors so
they can ask as a true or false
statements
so do have a look of these students okay
so why are they radio resistant we know
the totally highly differentiated cells
which has least mitotic figures which
are least dividing are always radio
resistant
whereas the fastly dividing cells okay
they are not they are radio sensitive
they are not radio resistant so that's
the reason they are
muscle very gland are actually radio
resistant and they are not radio
sensitive because they like they have
less dividing cells okay next coming to
the in
indications of radiotherapy so these are
the various indications that could be
high grade tumors large primary lesions
wherever there is perineural invasion
bone invasion cervical lymph node
metastasis and also positive surgical
margins
okay no role of chemotherapy in salivary
gland tumors
this point very important due to
incomplete and
short-lived response without any
survival
advantage so there is no role of
chemotherapy as such
so surgery followed by radiotherapy is
important so these are the indications
of radiotherapy
and there is no particular role of
chemotherapy so don't make a note
next coming to the surgery parotid gland
malignancies
so coming to the treatment again so
superficial parotidectomy with
preservation of the
facial nerve and total parotidectomy
with
nerve preservation if deep lobe is also
involved
okay next so if it is a
parotid land malignancy the surgeries
include these so
while preserving the nerve main trunk
even it can be done so
if deep love is involved then entire
superficial and deep lobe has to be
removed
with nerve preservation whereas
superficial parotidectomy is the
preservation of the facial nerve and
only superficial lobe is
being removed then other salivary glands
n block
excision of the tumor involved the gland
and neck dissection of the lymph nodes
if they are clinically palpable nodes
and in high grade malignancies
okay so coming to the various
complications of the parotidectomy
so as you can see here so it could be
the facial nerve paralysis
and also sensory abnormalities
associated with the sacrifice of the
greater allocated nerve
greater or clear now parroted fistula
okay
so newman and c brock operation can be
done
so in order to reconstruct the duct that
we'll be discussing next slide phrase
syndrome
so we know the phrase there will be
gastricly sweating
so how it is being diagnosed is a uh
minor starch iodine test so it is also
called as oracle
nerve temporal syndrome okay so here
uh minus starch iron test is that where
the affected area of the face is being
painted with the iodine
and then it will be allowed to dry after
that a starch is being applied on the
face
and the starch turns blue on exposure to
iodine
if there is a sweat okay so in presence
of sweat the starch will turn into blue
so that is the diagnosis for the phrase
syndrome and the treatment you can give
any anti-perspirations
perspirants bottle in toxins and also
surgical interruption of the secretary
fibers by
tympanic neurectomy in non-responding
cases okay
so these are the various complications
and the respective treatment for the
phrase syndrome
so this is a new man and the c brock
operation as you can see
so here first uh the dilated end of the
transected duct and this is the proximal
end of the
transected duct as you can see and then
in order to reconstruct the duct a stent
will be placed silactic stent which is
red in color you can see
that will be placed so this is operation
that is done in order to preserve the
duct
if there is a fistula that is formed as
a consequence of parotidectomy
okay so coming to the major surgical
landmarks
so even these are important for the
surgeon so it is tympano mastoid suture
line which is the most common
uh surgical landmark here you can see
that is a tympanom and
tympanomastoid suture line okay
here tms as you can see there
this one okay and then the triangle
pointer the posterior value of digastric
the retromandibular vein as well as a
styloid process so these are the major
surgical landmarks
so coming to the other key points only
we are almost close so lingual nerve
this is not related to
tumors as such but in general the key
points
so lingual nerves lies in close
association with the duct of the cell
submandibular that is a wart and stuff
so it is more prone to
more prone to damage during
submandibular gland surgery okay
and if the stone is proximal to the
lingual nerve at the hilum of the gland
then stone retrieval via intraoral
approach should be avoided
because there is a high risk to damage
that
lingual nerve there during the
exploration in the posterior
lingual gutter okay that's the reason if
it is closely
associated with the lingual nerve so we
are not supposed to do it
retrieve the stone via intraoral
approach so these are the important
points this is one of the important
point
next the stone is actually removed by in
giving incision
over the stone in the long axis so
directly over the long axis it can be
given incision can be given and it can
be removed
excision of the submandibular gland when
the stone is present in the gland if the
gland has a stone then you have to
excise the
submandibular gland and for jogging
syndrome
the minor salivary gland biopsy is
always the diagnostic so it is very much
essential to go for a diagnosis for the
jogren's syndrome so these
are the various key points coming to the
last
it is ackerman's tumor which is a
variant of well differentiated squamous
cell carcinoma
okay that can develop in any mucosal
surface of the upper respiratory and the
digestive tract
it's also called as varicose carcinoma
and the risk factors include
the frequent use of tobacco and a hpv
infection
so ackerman's tumor is nothing but like
varicose carcinoma especially in the
upper respiratory and the digestive
tract
okay so so far it is simple
