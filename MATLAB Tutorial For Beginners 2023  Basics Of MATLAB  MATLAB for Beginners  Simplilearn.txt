software and how to use it and if you
haven't subscribed yet please subscribe
to our simply learn YouTube channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update from us agenda for today's
session is as follows
first you will understand what is Matlab
then we will look at the Matlab GUI and
understand the software in detail next
we'll understand the Matlab variables
next we will learn the types of
variables in Matlab and how to execute
them then we will see the Matlab data
types Matlab operators and we'll learn
how to create scripts in Matlab next we
will execute some of the basic math
operators and then learn the Matlab
functions at last we'll understand how
to define Matlab functions and how to
execute them now let's speak in the
session by understanding what is Matlab
Matlab is a versatile computer program
that performs mathematical computation
visualization and programming a tight
speed
you will be amazed to discover more
about the software once you begin to use
it
even if you are not a coder or know
nothing about coding you should not be
worried because Matlab is a beginner
friendly software now let's see Matlab
GUI that is a graphical user interface
the GUI of Matlab is very user friendly
and interactive here
you will see the available tools where
they are and how to use them and also
get familiar with the Matlab software
now we are in the Matlab software and
this is how it looks like Matlab
software has a three tabs like ohm plots
and apps coming back to home
the ohm as a five section files
variables code environment and resources
in files we have options to create a new
script create a new live script open any
of the script which exists upload a
script go to file search for a file and
menu in variables we can import a data
we can save a workspace we can create a
new variable open a variable which is
already created clear all the variables
and the values given to a variable in a
workspace and in code we have options to
put any of our code or favorites clear
all the commands and in environment we
can create layouts and in resources via
options to learn Matlab and its software
and where I have a help button where it
will give us a online documentation to
any of our queries next we have a
current folder where it should show the
folder in which you're working with via
workspace which will show the variables
and the value Ascent of variable and we
have a command video where we will
perform any types of comments or execute
any types of programs this is the
graphical user interface of a Mac it's
time to understand Matlab variables here
we will see what is Matlab variable how
to create them and what are the
applications in them generally a
variable is used to store a data and can
store any kind of data like scalar
vector and Matrix basically
there are three methods to initialize a
variable in Matlab you need to assign a
data to a variable in an assignment
statement secondly take input data from
the keyboard and at last read the data
from a file now let's understand all
this in the platform let's see how to
assign or restore a variable for example
if you are trying to assign a value to a
variable a you can do that by doing a is
equal to 10.
see now we have assigned a value 10 to a
variable a and also it is displayed in a
workspace like variable a is greater and
a value for it is 10.
now we can let me try in a different way
for example like C is equal to
4 plus
5 minus 1.
we can see that it's a 4 plus 5 minus 1
is a calculation we have assigned this
calculation to a c now the answer of
this calculation should be stored in C
4 plus 5 is 9 9 minus 1 is 8 and we have
created a variable in the if you see in
the workspace there is a variable C and
a value 8 is assigned to a or that
variable
now what if I am not assigning a
variable to a calculation and just
giving a calculation to the software
will the software take up its
calculation and give me the answer
let's try I'll just give the calculation
directly to the software without
assigning it to a variable that is 5
plus 6
minus 1.
see if you are not assigned this
calculation to any variable still you
will get an answer like that will be
stored in the variable answer and the
answer is 10. one more calculation like
6 Plus 5.
see as you can see the variable answers
value is updated like the answer was the
first it was 10 now it is not updated to
11. you can see like in the workspace if
it will be a value where it is recently
updated for example you first the
answers value was 10 now it recently
added to 11.
you can also change the value of any
other variable which is already created
for example a is already created and its
value is 10 you can also change this
value by a is equal to
10 plus 1.
sorry
C now the value of a is changed to 11.
like this you can see like you can do
any types of you can create any how many
types of variables you you can want and
you can also assign enhancements as any
values you want the value which is
recently assigned to that variable will
be displayed in the workspace
now let's see how to insert a vector or
a matrix into a variable for example
I'll consider a variable y
and I am I am now inserting a vector or
a matrix to a variable y
to do to do that I'll use Y is equal to
square brackets
and Space 4 space 5.
and then press enter see as you can see
I have inserted a vector for a variable
Y which consists of element 1 4 5 and is
also created in the workspace
to create a vector to a variable you
should give the various values in within
the square bracket and should there
should be a one space between the
variables
within the values that you enter you can
also give it as Y is equal to instead of
giving space you can use comma
see the value is updated now the value
is updated from one four five to
separate it as one two three now let's
see how to assign a n Matrix to value
for an variable for example I am taking
a variable X is equal to using square
brackets I'll give one two three space
and to separate one column from the
column you will use semicolon
then the elements for the next row that
is 5 space 6 space
then close the square bracket and enter
now you can see we have a x variable
which has a 3 cross 3 Matrix which
element one two three for the first row
four five six for the second row 7 8 9
for the third row
you can also do this using commas for
example I'll update the X X is equal to
open square bracket 1 comma 2 comma
three
and you use semicolon to separate the
rows 7 comma 8 comma 9
semicolon 4 comma Phi comma 6 squares
close the square bracket and press enter
see now the the values on The Matrix X
has been updated these two rows has been
interchanged as per the given input
now what if if I don't want the values
in any of the position for example I
don't think the value in the second row
first position in the position of when I
don't want any value to be come there I
want it to be a 0 or blank position how
to insert a matrix like that
let's try X is equal to
First Row 1 Space 2 Space 3 semicolon I
don't want any value in this position so
I'll give only two values for that row
that is
8 Space 9 semicolon and the last row as
it is four space five Space six
close the square bracket and enter
see
we will find a error year
because the arrays dimensions are
completely different the software does
not consider the change of elements in
the rows and columns like as we entered
three elements in the first row and
three elements in the last row the
middle row must should have three
elements in the middle row and if you
don't want any element in that first
particular function you can do it as X
is equal to where bracket I'll take the
same elements 1 Space 2 Space 3
semicolon now I don't want any element
with this position so I'll mention it as
0
for the space 8 Space 9
semicolon 4 space 5 space 6
closest square bracket and it see in the
place of survey now it is operated as
zero
if you don't want any value in any
particular position you can just mention
0 in that particular mention and give
the value to the variable
now what is if you want to create any
Matrix or assign a value for a variable
way that Matrix contains a random
numbers like without a user input you
should be a random for that we can do it
as let's take a variable Z
is equal to we will use a keyword called
Magic
Magic
in the parenthesis you can see with like
if it is a three cross three we can give
three if it is uh if you want two cross
two you can give two it's up to you and
close the bracket and press enter
now you can see this uh zMAX place as of
elements which is a random elements from
one to nine
you can also do it the same to the two
cross two like I'll take it as uh
f is equal to
magic of I will give two it will get 2
cross 2
Matrix see this mattress contains
elements from one to F with within five
this four one two
three four it will
arrange randomly you can if you want any
number of maths any in math 3 cross 32
cross two four cross Romantics with you
with the random number you can use magic
keyword to create them
now what if can we create a mattress or
a better without assigning them to a
variable
let's try
open a square bracket one space two
space three
comma 4 space 5 space 6 or 7 comma each
base 9 Space 1 close bracket end
C
we can also create a matrix without
assigning to a variable as we as I said
before it will print as answer is equal
to that element and it will be updated
in the workspace as we see and so before
it was as we did in the did it in the
UPS up and before like answer was 11 now
it is updated as a matrix that is we
enter the element like one two three
four five seven and eight nine one
like this if you you can create a matrix
without assigning to a variable also
now let's see can we create two cross
three or three cross two Matrix it is
without having an even number of rows
and columns
let's take it as Y is equal to square
bracket 1 2
only 2 rows sorry two columns
three take again two and four comma 5
and 4 and 5 Square printed close
we can also create without having a even
number for example without having three
cross three two cross two we can also
create two cross three or three cross
two Matrix like again uh trying for one
more Z is equal to where brackets I'll
take one five four
one six
seven square bracket close and see
we can do it we have already learned how
to create variables in Matlab now let's
see the types of variables in Matlab
and the first one is numerical variable
here we can assign a numerical value to
a variable and the second one is a
string variable here we can add words or
a combination of sentence and a
characters to a variable and the third
one is a logical variable it is a
variable that has only two logical
values that is 0 and 1. let's see how to
implement all these in Matlab if it is a
numerical variable we can directly
assign a value like as we did before a
is equal to 10
it will be assigned or
C is equal to 10 divided by
Phi
like this for numerical variable
directly you can assign a value to a
variable
and it comes for string variable we can
assign a string variable to a variable
like B is equal to we'll use a semicolon
and enter
hello
hello close C we now we are we are
giving a string variable or a string
value to your variable B
we can do this using string a keyword
for example I'll update the value of B
like B is equal to I'll use string
and inside the bracket
using semicol then we will give 5.
now
the B value is updated as I you can
either give using semicolon or you can
also use the variable string to give a
string variable value to a variable
for creating a logical variable we use a
logical keyword like for example D is
equals to
logical
open parenthesis in square bracket we
have to enter the value we know logical
layer variable contains only two values
it is zeros and ones I'll do one comma 0
semicolon 0 com 1 square practicals and
and this equals see D is equals to A 2
cross 2 logical array
as we have creating a two cross two it
will say two cross to logical array
which contains 0 1
and 1 0.
now what if if we give any other numbers
like 5 6 7 in the place of the real
values like zeros and one what happens
let's see
MGA taking a variable e is equals to
logical
I comma six
seven comma
see
while creating a logical variable if you
give any value apart from 0 and 1 it
will take it as 1. for example if you
give a logical value here instead of
giving 5 if you give 0 it will take as 0
apart from zero if you give any numbers
from 1 to 9 it will automatically treat
it as one and print it as one
for example let me say one more scenario
x f is equal to
instead of giving other numbers I'll
give 0 for the first number and then
give 5 for second one I'll give eight
and nine
see if you give zero an in logical it
will take sorry like I forgot to mention
logical let me repeat it
0 comma five semicolon 8 comma 9 is
see
in the place of zero it directly takes x
0 apart from zero if you give any
numbers from 1 to 9 it will treat it as
one only and take it as 1 and print it
as 1. now let's understand Matlab data
types
in Matlab we have different types of
data types like care complex double int
logical single struct unit and fixed
Point Let's understand how to implement
all of them in flat verb with an example
now while implementing the data types
first we'll consider as a character data
type like we will assign a character
type must be also considered consist of
an alphabets for example we can do that
using Y we will take a y is equal to
within the semicolon within the annotate
commas we will give the values like
double comma I'll give a low
and enter
you can see now we have uh given a
variable y with a value which is a
character type using a double ended
commas you can also do use do this using
a string variable as you did before
when we have to assign a complex value
for an variable now then we can say like
Z is equal to 4 plus 6 I where I
represents the complex step when we
press enter you can see if Z is assigned
with a complex number
but similarly you can do this for the
other radio types like integers floating
Point etc for integers if you want
particularly want some integer 16 byte
value to be assigned for a variable for
example X is equal to I need int 16
bytes
value to be assigned for a variable X
now for that I'll give a value 6. now
you can see the variable X as a value 6
which is of in 16 data type
you can do same for the in 32 like X is
equal to
int 32-bit
or file give four
x value is updated as 4 which is of in
32 data type till now we have saw what
is the Matlab GUI variables and data
types now with let's understand the
Matlab operators and operator is a
symbol that tells the compiler to
perform a various numerical or logical
operations there are several operators
in Matlab like automatic operator
arithmetic array operator rational
operator relational array operator
logical operator and bitwise operator
now let's see all these implementations
in platform along with the size and
whose operations
before we continue with the operators
you can see there are many variables
created in the command window as well as
in the workspace so many variables and
values
now how to clear them all as we don't
need them like how to clear them all to
clear all the like variables name and
the values in the workspace we can use
the command clear all
like
clear all
you can see all the names or variables
and its value which is assigned are
which are used previously has been
cleared from the workspace now how to
keep all the commands in the comment
window for that you can use clear screen
command this CLC
all the work all the work commanded is
that you have done previously in the
command window has been cleared
today we'll start with the automatic
operator
we can perform the basic automatic
operator like assigning or directly
entering the value like eight plus five
we are doing addition operator like it
is 8 plus 5 is 13 and you can also do 5
minus
2 that is 3 and you can also do division
like 24 divided by two
it is 12 all these we can do without
assigning to a variable where we can we
have we already know that is the answer
variable will have I have the answer or
I will contain the value of the
operation we can also do this by
assigning a value or a variable to a
value like a is equal to
34
divided by 2 like a will be a 17.
similarly for multiplication I can do
like
C is equal to a into
sorry a into
now what we did is we already have a a
variable which is a containing a 17
assists answer which has been with given
a calculation that is 34 divided by 2
available as a value of 17 now
we are multiplying this 17 that is the
value in the variable into 2 and assign
it to a c
so 7 2 so 34 that c is assigned with the
value of 30 34. like this you can also
give now for example you can also
perform division for like I'll take a d
variable now I will divide the D
variable
now I will give the D variable should
contain a value that is C divided by 2.
it is 17.
the C variable should have Isaac's value
of 34 now the D variable should have a
value which is of calculation of C
divided by 2 as we know says 34 34
divided by 2 is 17. like this you can
give a performer arithmetic operator
addition subtraction multiplication
division any kind of automatic operator
without assigning to a variable or with
ascendant to a variable
now we will see automatic operations
with arrays
we can create two Matrix as I already
created one Matrix using a magic command
3 which I have a random numbers of
elements and one more Matrix which I
have created you giving a user input
now let's see the arithmetic operations
for these two matrices
now what if if I want to add this is
these two Matrix
like I'll do X Plus
y
X Plus Y is 8 plus 1 is 9 1 plus 2 is 3
6 plus 3 is 9. likewise every each
column and each row has been added X and
Y elements and and printed the Matrix as
an answer we can also do subtraction
like x minus y like
a nine minus again it divided 7 minus
eight minus 1 is 7 and 1 minus 2 is
minus 1 and 6 minus three is three and
again it assigned one answer
like what if if I want to multiply these
two Matrix
X
into y
C
this entire Matrix has been multiplied
like these two Matrix has multiplied
eight one what is if I want to multiply
a single Matrix with a particular number
for example let's say x Matrix I'll
print again this x Matrix I want this x
to be here multiplied by an single
number like element wise multiplication
for that how to do
for that I can do it as X
into I'll put dot into I want this
multiplied by 3.
see
now this entire X Matrix is multiplied
by three like single element is
multiplied by three
likewise I can do it for y also first
I'll print a y y Matrix this is a y
Matrix now this entire y Matrix should I
want this each element of Y Matrix to be
multiplied by 2.
see the ones are two Tutus are four two
threes are six likewise each element of
that Matrix has been multiplied by two
similarly we can also give the power
transposition or I can do division of
matrices for example I can divide X by y
I have got the floating Point values by
dividing X by y I can also divide y
divided by X
now we can also uh next let me print X
Matrix
now we can also power like give the
power raised to 2 3 or any numbers for
each element element wise power we can
also give we can do that by using x dot
cap I want this to be each element to be
power 2.
you can do the same for y why I'll print
The Matrix
why in dot power of 3.
this is how we can do arithmetic
operations for arrays now let's see for
the relational operator for relational
operator now I'll create a two Matrix
that is two cross two my two that is a
is equal to from 1 2 3
um
sorry and one more row I'll include four
six seven
and one more B is equal to
some random numbers like four
three
one then again four
one and six
now you can see this other two matrices
A and B which I have been created using
uh the
usual methods of creating the Matrix
as we will check whether the Matrix a is
equal to Matrix B that is a equals
equals B
C
as we did press enter we so we can see
there is a true cross three logical
array has been created
now
this array contains only 0 and 1 logical
real values
like how is it possible
when we are performing an relational
operators of into any Matrix in Matlab
if the each element matches then it will
print as one this does not matches it
will print as zero for example as we see
since the first element in Matrix a is
one and the second first element in the
Matrix B is 3 which is not matching so
it is as printed as zero and the last
last that is of in the position 4
is first element in the second row and
this first element in the second row of
both Matrix A and B are equal so it is
printed as one if the elements are
matching in the both the Matrix it will
print it as one if else it print as zero
we can also perform other logical or
sorry other relational operators like
is
greater than or equal to B
if it is 2 it will print it as 0 if it
is if it has one if it is false it
displayed as zero now we can also check
it for a is less than or equal to B
we can also see
a is not equal to
C
if a is not equal to B then it will
print 1 if we A and B are equal it will
print to zero
if it's between a is equal greater than
or equal to B and what is the difference
between a is greater than or equal to B
for example C I'll print a is greater
less than or equal to B
it is a logical array which has 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 like first we will print what is a
okay and well let me see check what is p
you can see the first element
in the a is one and the first element in
the base 3.
is 1 Less Than 3 yes so it printed as 1.
and similarly for other elements so what
if if you print a less than b
C
if when we are printing a less than or
equal to B if the values are less than
it will check for first condition and
second condition it will check if it is
equal for example when we say when we
see the element 4 in the A and element 4
in the B are matching it will print 1 in
a less than or equal to B in the case of
a less than b it will only check if the
first value of element a is less than
second value of element B
if it true it will print 1 if not will
print zero
now while performing The Logical
operator first we'll create a two Matrix
of logical elements or real values let
me take it as Z is equal to
1 0 and 1.
1 0 and 1.
and one more element I'll one more multi
so I'll take B
or H is equal to
1 1
0
0 1 1.
now we have two real value Matrix that
is a logical Matrix now let's see how to
perform The Logical operators to this
Matrix first we will perform logical and
said
and
as we know how to how the logic logical
and or or anything will perform so as
per the values we have given it will do
the calculations
now to know the size of a particular
variable we can use a keyword called
size for example as I took as I we know
we have created a variable called Zed
we'll print that variable and makes you
print size of Z it will give the size of
a variability so it's a two cross three
Matrix you can also do it for one more
variable that is size of
I'll take it as y
see the size of Y is a 3 cross 3 Matrix
you can do for any variable that you
have created if you want to know the
size of that particular variable we can
get it by using a keyword called size
now what if if you want to know more
about the variable apart from the size
in that scenario we can use whose
keyword that is
whose favorite holes here they will give
what are the variables or the name of
the variables which have been created
while working or in the workspace and
the size of that variable that is a 2
cross 3 or what is the size what is the
number of bytes which class which they
have created the entire details of the
variables created in the workspace now
it's time to see how to create scripts
in Matlab now let's see how to create
scripts before getting into our scripts
let me clear all the command window and
the workspace by giving
clear all
and clear screen from it
Now to create a script in Matlab first
we have to go to the new script which is
in the home button in the file section
we have a we have a space or we have
button called new script click on the
new script now you can see our Command
window is divided into two parts one is
into a script part and one one has it as
a command window
now you can write any kind of scripts or
a program anything inside the script for
example I'll write a is equal to 5
is equal to 6
I want C is equal to a minus B
now when we press enter it won't run
as we were doing in the command window
for example in the command window if you
give a is equal to Phi
and press enter it will show the output
but in the script if you press enter it
will go to the next line
to get a output to get a run in the
script you have to press it on the Run
button
as soon as you press on the Run button
automatically it will ask to save the
file
you can save the file with any
particular name you want and you have to
mention dot m dot m extension extension
is for Matlab then press on Save now you
can see your file has been saved as a
particular name we have given and inside
the folder which I've been working I am
working inside the Matlab inside the
Matlab this file name has been saved
saved with the extinction here
now to get an output of this code you
should just press run
see as you can see first it will print
the file name the file name it has been
printed next it will print what is the
variable age what is the value assigned
to the variable that is Phi then what is
the next variable that is B it is the
value since the variable that is 6 and
at last what is the calculation you are
giving or what is the
comment that you are giving foresee that
is AC is equal to a minus b c is equal
to a minus P that the answer is minus 1.
now when you see our Command window you
can see we have the input and the output
both like the input which I have given
by the user is also printed and also
output is printed like now what is if
you want if you don't want it input to
be printed you just want the answer to
be printed in the command window
to that so after giving and assigning a
value for example a is equal to 5 after
assigning a value close using semicolon
the both the input values then run
you can see again it will print the file
name and it will print only the output
only the value C is equal to -1 like
that you can avoid printing the input
values in the command window
like this you can also create n number
of scripts as you want how many scripts
and number of scripts you can create I
can you can perform any operations like
you can perform any basic programs by
writing that code inside this
and script and if you don't want it to
be uh your inputs to be printed in
command window you can enclose them
using a semicolon and if you want your
command line to become inputs to be
come in the comment section you can
erase the semicolon and just press enter
using scripts you can write any basic uh
programs like addition of two numbers
reversing a function or two parent room
uh prime number or not like that any
basic programs you can write in the
script function or using creating a new
script you can
use it if you after creating all this if
you don't want to your script to be
displayed in the window you can just
cancel it if you want it you can see the
changes if you don't want you can just
delete it and your command window will
be back let's have a look at some of the
basic math operations in Matlab now
let's perform some of the basic math
operations in Matlab
before doing that Let Me Clear My
Command window and
the workspace
to perform a basic math operations I'll
create two matrices that is a is equal
to
I'll create one three cross three Matrix
of
and B Matrix with the element
six seven eight
and I don't want uh to be any element in
this first element of second row like
I'll just give it as 0 4
5.
so then
one close the bracket and hit
now we have two Matrix
basic operation first we'll do addition
I'll say C is equal to a plus b
C is equal to a plus b each element like
1 plus 6 is 7
snap 2 plus 7 is 9 3 plus 8 is 11. same
process will be taken by the middle row
and the last row
now what if I want to perform a
subtraction like same wise I'll do it as
C is equal to a minus p
our a first element was 1 minus 6 was
minus 5. 2 minus 7 is also minus 5 3
minus 8 is also minus 5.
now what if I want to do multiplication
of these two Matrix it is C is equal to
a into
that is five
our first met is seven
now the matrix multiplication three row
and column as the matrix multiplication
takes place it will expose the first row
First Column second row second column
and third row third column well the one
of the important point that you have to
keep in your mind while doing Matrix
Matrix multiplication is to maintain
unit uniformity in the number of columns
number of rows and number of columns for
example if you have two Matrix that is a
and b that should contain same number of
rows and same number of columns because
as we know matrix multiplication will
takes place as per the first row First
Column second row second column and
third row third column to append the
matrix multiplication the each Matrix
should have a same number of columns and
same number of rows
for example let me take a matrix that is
z is equal to one two three four five
six
and I'll take one more Y is equal to
one
one four one
six five
six five six four five
enter now I have two Matrix that is z
and Y which is of two two cross three
two cross three
now as I said before to do a matrix
multiplication the number of rows and
the number of columns should be same
now let me see
can I multiply
Z into y in the matrix multiplication be
happened between these two matrices
no error because the number of rows in
the columns within the Matrix set does
not match the number of columns in the Y
because it has 2 3 Dash 2 so to to do
matrix multiplication the number of rows
in one Matrix would match with the
number of columns with another Matrix
for example if I update the Y is equal
to to 1 comma 2
2 comma 4.
and 4 comma 5
and now perform a mattress
multiplication between Z
into y we will get the value
so keep in keep in your mind that
whenever you perform a matrix
multiplication the number of rows of one
Matrix should be always equal to a
number of columns with the other Matrix
now what is if you want the two Matrix
of different rows and columns should
have to multiply each other what to do
in that case for example let me take let
me print uh Z what will be what is z z
was is a two cross three Matrix and I'll
print y
and I'll just change the values of Y
into a 2 cross 3 Matrix that is one two
three comma four five six
now our Y is this and our Z is this I
have two Matrix of two cross three now I
want these two Matrix to be multiplied
what to do for that I'll do it as
assigning this to a one more variable
called D is equal to
Z dot star of Y
see now the every each element of Y has
been multiplied with every each element
of set
like this you can you can multiply the
elements which are of different
velocities which does not follows the
rules of matrix multiplication it does
not have a number same number of rows
and columns
let me take one more example and explain
like for example let me see for one more
example let me say x is equal to I'll
take us 1 2
and 4 5. it will be a 2 cross 2 Matrix
and one more I'll take take test Y is
equal to
4 pi
6 and 7.
now I want to multiply I every element
of X with the every element of Y
that will do it as assigning D is equal
to X
star
dot star of
y every element of X has been multiplied
with every element of Phi and it is
assigned to a d variable
it was for multiplication what if you
want to divide two matrices for example
let me just clear all my Works workspace
clear call
and see let's see now I'll take one more
Matrix it is z is equal to with
elements one two three four five six
seven and eight
and one more as y
is equal to four five six
comma seven eight nine comma 3 comma 2
comma 1.
now we have a two Matrix
X now I have to divide X by y that is C
is equal to x divided by one now you see
how to divide this
to divide this Matrix x divided by y we
have to do it as X is equal to sorry C
is equal to assign this to any variable
C is equal to X
dot divided by y
now every element of X is divided by
every element of Y
like this you can do the division of two
matrices and assign to a variable
without us into a variable so we can do
like we can do it as x dot
division of
it will assign to a variable called
answer now it's time to understand the
Matlab functions since other task or a
set of tasks that are performed on a
given set of input that converts the
input into a preferred output some of
the common functions in Matlab are
trigonometric functions exponential
functions logarithm functions square
roots let's learn how to implement these
functions in platform in trigonometrical
function we know we have multiple
functions like sine cos tan cosine
cosecant and secant and also I have got
now let's see how to implement or how to
use all these trigonometry functions in
Matlab
first let me take sine sine of
sorry
sine of inside bracket LC sine of 0 what
is the value of sine of 0 sine of 0 is 0
let me check it for cos
pass off zero
is what
now we know tan is signed by cos
now let me see what is the value of tan
of 0.
tan of 0 is also 0. the 10 like 10 is
caused by a sign that is 0 by 1 is 0.
now these are some of the basic
trigonometrical functions let's move on
to the exponential before moving on
let's clear
all the workspace and command window
you can also go for some of the other
trigonometrical functions like cosecant
cot secant
and when it comes for exponential we
will try some of the exponential
comments how to do exponential uh
operations in Matlab
the exponential in Matlab is they
represent or can be written as using ESP
now let's see what is the exponential of
1 the exponential 1 is
2.7183 like that you can also check it
as what is the exponential of
Phi
the exponential of Phi is
148.41 like select that you can also
give for what is the exponential of
so take it as degree the exponential of
180 is 1.4 something imaginative values
now what if you want to find the log
values for example what is the value of
log of 1 log of 1 is 0 and what is the
value of log of
2
log of 2 is
0.6931 you can also find of log of
exponential of 1.
what will the log of exponential of 1
like there is no log of exponential of 1
because I am not closed the bracket let
me try it once again
log of exponential of 1 is 1. you can
also use it as log of let me send log of
exponential of 0 close 2 brackets
and log of exponential 0 is 0.
now what if in case if you want to find
the square roots of a number for that
you will use as sqrt
where root of for example take it as
100
squared of 100 is 10 we can also try it
for one more that is
square root of
4 I'll take it as four
square root of 4 is 2. like this you can
find the square root logarithm function
or exponential value of any numbers that
you want now we will see how to create
or Define our own functions in Matlab
now let's see how do we able to create
or how do we able to Define our own
functions
by just mentioning or Define that
particular function the soft will
understand that you are giving the
command to perform that particular
functions in this command or in this
operation
to create our own function just go to
the Home Tool and in the file section we
have a button called new in that we have
function click on the function we have a
function in the output one and output
parameter replace it has why I am giving
as y then I should name my
function I am naming my function as my
fun and inside that I am passing a
variable called X
next we have to save what my function
should perform
I am printing this here like we will
I'll give Y is equal to
X Plus
or Y is equal to 30 plus X
first we have to take a create a new
function in that we have to replace a
function by a function name and pass one
variable then as assign that variable to
a one move function variable now
inserted function we have to write what
operation that that function should
perform
now I am writing that my function should
perform that should add 30 for every X
inputs for every input I give it should
add by 30.
now first we have to now we have to
click on run it will automatically ask
us to save the file while saving any
function keep this point in mind the
function name and the file name should
be same
the function name of my
my function name is fun
my fun and my file name should be my
fund dot dot M is for extension of
Matlab see now you can see my function
name has been saved now why I got got
here is here because I have created one
variable my function of X now I have to
pass a value for that my function so
I'll do it as
my
function
inside bracket I'll pass it as 20.
C my function y is equal to 50 that is
my function I have passed x value as 20
and why it is already has 30 30 plus 20
is 50. you can also again we can pass my
function
of
100
it is printed as
the 130 as it has already has 30 and it
is printed as 100. now
you won't want this y y is equal to 30
and answer is equal to 38 don't want you
you don't want this to be repeated for
that you can mention semicolon here and
then if you run like my function fun of
and red
only the answer will be displayed here
the Y value won't if you don't want your
function to be displayed in your windows
you can increase it by a semicolon like
this you can create a function and you
can name your function you can you can
pass in any num n number of variables
you want your function and then Define a
simple equations as I mentioned a simple
equation is y is equal to 30 plus X you
can mention any kind of your
equations to your variable and if you
don't want that to be print in your
command window in close it with the
semicolon till now we have learned how
to create variables operators how to
create new scripts functions and how to
define a function now let we will learn
how to write a basic programs using this
variables operators in Matlab for that
first we'll take a new script
and the first program in first program
will take a variable and will assign a
value and find the squares cubes and the
square root of that particular variable
for that I am taking a variable a which
is equal to 3. and I am taking a
variable B which is equal to a star a n
which is a square of a then I'll take a
variable C which is a star a star a
which is a cube of a then I'll take a
variable D and I'll give it as
square root of K
and to print I'll use statement F printf
within the quotes
I want this variable to be print and the
value in the variable to prevent also
I'll use four bytes of hands and
integers which says
query
equals
and again
just do the same thing
with a real number and end
I'll read a variable a
and B
same thing I'll just copy
and I'll use it by replacing a square by
Cube
Cube
and the variable B
by C
again I'll do same
I'll just press enter and I'll just copy
paste
here I want to print the square root of
[Music]
move
of a that is a two bytes of unsigned
variable
is
I'll read that variable as a floating
point that is six point
four F
and I'll just read the variable as
d
save the file and run it
we can say 3 square is 9 3 cube is 27
and the square root of 3 is 1.73121
like that we we found the square root of
our value 3 which is into a variable a
now one more uh we'll see a program on
array where it will take a two array
extract some elements in an array and do
addition in that elements first I'll
take a variable a is equal to within
square brackets 3 4 and 7.
and end with the semicolon and next one
is B is equal to I'll take a 4 elements
1 4 6 and 8. and the semicolon in
variable C I'll give a of 2
must be added with B of 3.
and we'll just
you can see the answer is 10. a of 2 is
4 P of 3 6 4 plus 6 is 10.
like this you can write any basic
program which is based on arrays Matrix
variables like matrix multiplication
addition of two number subtraction of
two numbers matrix multiplication many
more basic programs in Matlab with this
we have reached the end of this session
today we learned what is Matlab its
graphical user interface how to create
variable scripts and functions in Matlab
some of the basic operations in Matlab
