hi everyone this is dr. Mann's me from
Columbia's conquer so now I'm going to
discuss about the sterilization in the
disinfection in this video which is very
very important in the present scenario
so you have to make a note of all these
points so this is the contents of the
video so this is the disinfection and
sterilization disinfection includes it
is a process of eliminating the most
harmful microorganisms okay whereas the
sterilization it includes like it will
kill the microorganisms and also the
resistant bacterial spores this
disinfection can be used only in the in
arm in enemy animate subs substances or
the surfaces so this infection process
includes two steps you can make a node
that is first step will be of your
vigorous scrubbing but and the second
cell will be of wetting the surface with
a disinfectant then there are of two
techniques one the technique is spray
wipe spray technique and the technique
second technique is vibe and discard
vibe so here the spray wipe spray
technique includes the mechanical
cleansing with a paper towel then
followed by a chemical action of the
disinfectant solution whereas wipe
discard wipe technically first wipe
remove the microbes and the second wife
will provide the disinfectant so these
are the sterile and this I mean level of
disinfectants given in this table which
is very important so if you take the
sterile and it will destroy all the
microorganisms and this is the examples
and they'll you have to use the
sterilant and the high level
disinfectant its definition examples and
the usage whereas intermediate level
disinfectants its definition examples
and they usage
whereas the last thing will be of your
low level disinfectant what is the
definition and example and these are
examples where you have to use and this
the usage of this and these are a
disinfectants type of disinfectants you
are you going you use in the daily
practice this further alcohols exist the
examples include
and the mode of the action will be
mainly by the denaturation of the
proteins and this is the advantages and
disadvantages of the alcohols very have
to mention your exam then coming to the
phenols that will work by the
precipitation of the proteins and this
is the advantages and disadvantages of
the phenols and aldehydes mode of action
is denaturation of proteins and nucleic
acids advantages and disadvantages and
therefore the chlorides this is the
interferes with the cellular metabolism
it is that it has a oxidative action and
it has a lipid and fatty acid
degeneration these are the advantages
another dessert disadvantages then
coming to either force it will disrupt
the nucleic acid and protein structure
this is the advantage the scientists the
disadvantages quaternary ammonium
compounds it will impair the bacterial
cell wall permeability advantages
disadvantages and these are the examples
then coming to the sterilization this is
the physical agents of sterilization
which include sunlight dry heat drying
moist heat filtration radiation and
ultrasonic and sonic vibrations and this
is the chemical agents which are used so
this is the steps in the decontamination
process first is the cleaning
then the mole of deborah's then the
manual cleaning automated cleaning or in
Iran mental protection agency is used so
the instruments how to disinfect is
first step will be of your pre soaking
it will prevent the drying in saliva of
the blood then then one should place
loose instruments in a perforated
cleaning bear a basket and plays in the
holding solution this is the pre soaking
so in dentistry there are four acts
accepted methods of sterilization that
is autoclave chemi clean dry clear and
ethylene oxide sterilization if you take
a dry heat dry heat sterilizer will
transfer the heat energy to the
instruments
and more of our action will be of your
protein denaturation oxidative damage
and toxic effects or elevated level of
electrolytes and these are the types
static air at 160 degree Celsius for two
hours and forced air type for 9 190
degree Celsius for 6 to 12 minutes so
this these are the instruments which can
be used there and in the moist heat to a
sterilization these are the steps and
this will saturate the steam comes into
contact with the cooler and condenses
the water and gives up the latent heat
to the surface so there will be of large
dextran volume sucks in more steam to
the area this is the process of moist
heat sterilization then this types are
of down displacement or a gravity steam
sterilizer or a vacuum steam sterilizer
and coming to the sterilization cycles
is the standard cycle and for the fast
cycles these two important things you
have to mention then there will be of
results are consistently reliable good
penetration time efficient but the
disadvantages includes blunting and
corrosion of sharp instruments and
damage to certain rubber goods then
coming to the unsaturated chemical vapor
sterilization there are a harbor a
harvest advisory kami clave and where
the 0.23% of formaldehyde is active and
seventy two point three eight percent of
ethanol acetone ketone water and other
alcohols are used advantages of this
thing and disadvantages coming to the
ethanol oxide sterilization it is a
flammable so the mechanism of action
will be fear alkalization of the protein
DNA and the RNA okay then this gas
concentration this the temperature used
and the exposure time mentioned
then coming to the glass bead
sterilization temperature mansion your
maintain will be of 420 220 degree
Celsius and time will be of ten seconds
mostly used in your
endodontics files burrs and rotary
instruments then with the radiation
radiation will be of two types
ionizing and non-ionizing radiation so
this is the ionizing radiation and this
will be of called as a cold
sterilization and act by the free
radicals which includes gamma rays
x-rays and high-speed electrons
disadvantaged thing is there are
potentially dangerous to the human cells
then non ionizing radiation mono mode of
action will be destruction of nucleic
acid through inaction of time and angles
use for the operating rooms isolating
rooms and biologic safety cabinets
disadvantages will be your food
penetrating energy then instrument
reprocessing so those are things about
the infection and I mean disinfection
and the sterilization of her ass dental
instruments then contains instrument
reprocessing so this instrument re
processing is the starting with the
cleaning then disinfectant inspection
packaging sterilization transport
storage use again transport for clean so
this is the cycle where the this thing
is processed instrumented processed so
these are the two steps that is cleaning
and the packaging then after that
sterilization storage so those are the
important steps you have to mention with
the reprocessing of your instruments
coming to the base management management
which is very important so management of
management of biomedical waste will be
of your general office waste or a bio
medical waste okay biomedical waste
again includes so if any anatomical
waste nor anatomic
waste or a plastic waste so these things
this color mentioning code are very very
important you have to mention near
examination if they give an infection
controller a sterilization question so
this the black is for the cytotoxic
dragon chemical waste readies for the
soil waste yellow is for anatomical
waste
Louise were infected plastic and sharps
for the needles and the card glasses
even you can color your thing with the
light colored things okay so this is
these things you have to mention your
exam and finally these are the
references of this video or the topic so
I think you are clear clear how to
mention or what to write if an infection
control sterilize and disinfection is
given for you
