hey everyone i am pepper khandelwal and
i welcome you all to our simply learns
youtube channel today we will be going
over the sorting algorithms in c sharp
but first let me remind you that we have
our daily updates on numerous
technologies so if you are a tech geek
looking for a latest technological
innovation then try subscribing to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon so you never miss an
update on simpion
so now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin our session with the
discussion on what is sorting
then we will briefly discuss some of the
basic sorting methods which includes
using a sort function
or a comparative method or using a
delegates we will also try sorting using
link library functions
and an iterative sorting method
finally we will discuss some sorting
algorithms like bubble sort insertion
sort selection sort and quick sort with
the help of our demo
so let's get started with the discussion
on what is sorting
first up sorting is the technique of
putting the items of an collection in a
certain order in c sharp
an array a list or any other data set
can be considered as collection
next
the collection may contains item of both
simple
and complex kind a simple type can be an
array of integers it can be a text
floating point values and so on
whereas a complex type might be a
collection of objects of user defined
kinds like employee student and so on
complex types are frequently nested
which means that the objects may have
several characteristics
at last we have a c-sharp sort function
includes built-in methods for sorting
collection c-sharp sort function may
sort an array list or any generic
collection depending on the comparer
given
next let's go over some of the basic
sorting methods
we'll go over various sorting methods
so first up we have sort method
let's go to our visual studio and try it
out
let's start with
declaring and initializing an array so
in
we will have bracket
arr
equals to
new
end
box
we will have normal box
then we will have curly braces and we
will give it
the values so let's have 16 comma 29
comma 6
comma
17 comma 35 comma 19.
now
let's try to print this unsorted error
first so console dot
write line
so unsorted
array
then after that we will have a four inch
loop
with end
item
in
arr
here we will have
another console statement console.write
we will have
this item
plus
and have
so these values separated by a space
now let's call our sort function
so we will call array
dot sort
in argument we will have arr which is
our array
semicolon to close it
now
let's print this arrow so console
dot
write line
slash and slash n
then we have sorted
array
then we will have a four each loop
and
item
in
ar
and we will have console
dot
write
item
plus
now let's save it
and run it
as you can see
it is first printing our sorted error
unsorted error
then it has sorted this complete array
using the sort function
let's get back to our slides
next up we have compare to method
so let's get back to our visual studio
and try this one as well
here we will have
repeat
we will start with
declaring an array so end
arr
equals to
new
and
braces
then in curly braces we have
our
array so 29
comma 6 comma 17
comma 35 comma 90
i'm using the same data set so that we
we will have a clear understanding of
how things are working
so next
let's print the array first
so console
dot
write line
unsorted array
then we will have a 4 inch
then we will have
end
item
in
arr
and we will
have console
dot write
item
plus
to subtract them by the space
now
let's use the comparative method
so we will sort this array from first to
last we will compare every element to
each other so
we will have
array
dot
sort
then we will have int
so arr
comma
new
comparison
and
then in braces i will have
i1 comma
i2
equals to
i1
dot
compared to
i2
then we will try to print this
so
console
dot
write line
sorted
array
then we will have 4 each
and
item
in err
and we will have
console
dot
right
then item
plus
and we will save this
let's try this out
as you can see it has first printed out
unsorted array then it has sorted this
out
that's how you can work around whether
compared to function
now
let's get back to our slide and check
out what we have to learn next
next up we have using a delegates method
so let's get back to our visual studio
code and learn how to use delegates
to
to do a sorting
here
let's start by initializing an array
so we will have end
braces
arr
equals to
new
end
braces
16
comma 29 comma 6 comma 17 comma 35 comma
19.
data set
then
we will
print out
this unsorted array
console.writeline
then
unsorted
then after that we have our 4-h loop
and
item
in arr
then we will have console
dot right
here we will have item
plus
then a space to
separate them
next we will start our sorting process
so we will sort this array from first
class
so to do that we will use
array
dot
sort
and we will use end
then we will have a r
comma
delete
and
m
comma
and n
then in curly braces we will have return
m minus n
next we will
print out a result so console.writeline
sorted
array
then we will have
our 4 each
and
item
arr
console dot
write
item
plus
a space
to separate them
now let's save it and run it
as you can see it is printing our sorted
array unsorted error
within sorted array
now let's get back to our slides and
check out what are other methods that we
will be learning next
next up we have
using link methods
so now let's get back to our visual
studio and learn that
here
we will start
with initializing and declaring a new
array
so int
braces
arr
equals to new
end
braces and curly braces
in curly braces i will have 16 comma 29
comma 6 comma 17.
35 comma 19
next we will
print out this unsorted error so console
dot
right line
unsorted
then we have a 4-h loop
and
item
in
arr
we have console
dot
write
then we have item
plus
a space
now we will do our sorting process
so
to sort the array in increasing order we
will use
arr
equals to arr
and order by function
which is stored in our link system
libraries
so c is equals to
c
dot
to
array
next up we will print out the sorter
error
i will i'm just gonna use reuse this
code
and
just change a few things
let's save it and run it
as you can see it has printed out and
sorted and sorted
now let's get back to our slides and
learn our last method
next up we have using an iterative
method
so
let's get started
let's go back to our visual studio code
so now we will start
with
creating an array
so
end
arr
then braces
equals to
new
end
braces
then curly braces
we will have
our
set
sex
17
35 19.
next up we will also declare a variable
temp
so it's an integer variable
now we will try to print the unsorted
array so
we have
console
dot
writeline
unsorted array
then we have our 4 inch loop
and
item in arr
then i have console
dot
write
item
plus
a space
now
let's try to sort this array
so
we will traverse 0 to arrays length
so we will start with a 4 loop
and
i
is equals to 0
i less than
ar dot
length
minus 1
and i plus plus
then we will traverse from i plus 1 to a
its length
so
for loop
let's give it a tap so that it will be
easy to understand
end
j
is equals to
i
plus
1
then j less than
a r
dot
length
then j
plus plus
now we will compare array elements with
all next elements so if
arr
bracket i
is greater than
arr
bracket j
then
we will have a swap
so temp is equals to
arr
i
so basically we are saving the value of
ar i
in time
then we will change the airwise ic value
with arrj
now we will store
the temp value in arg
to complete the swapping process
equals to temp
now let's print out the sorted array
so
we will use the earlier code
we will just
rename this
sorter
control save
let's try out this code now
and here as you can see we have
successfully printed out our unsorted
and sorted arrays let's get back to our
slides
so now that we have looked over some of
the basic sorting methods it's time for
a little quiz
so comment down below the answer which
sorting algorithm is used in the sort
function
which we just use
so now let's move on and let's check out
some of the sorting algorithms we will
have a look
at
the algorithms
like bubble sword
insertion sword
selection sword and the quick sword
so let's discuss them one by one
first up we have bubble sort
so we will start with the first two
elements and compare them
and if the first one is bigger than the
second then we will switch them
so as you can see in this image we have
4 and 2 so we will check if 4 is greater
than 2
if it is then we will switch them
so the next array will become 2 4 1 8 3
then we will move on to the next pair
and we will repeat this with the next
set so now
the array was 2 4 1 8 3 so we will check
between four and one
and if one
is less than four then we will switch
them so new array will become two one
four eight three
now we will not go back to two and one
we will
come continue on to the next pair so
next year will be four and eight
if we will see if these are
thus correct pair yes it is then we will
move on to next one and we will switch
between eight and three
in eight and three the 3 is smaller so
we will switch them so new array will
become
2 1 4
3 8.
so let's get to our next slide
and here as you can see a new array is 2
1 4 3 8
so now we will repeat the same step in
the second iteration so we will start
with 2 and 1
so we will switch them so it will be 1 2
4 3 8
then we will have 2 and 4
we don't have any swap between them so
we will go to the next pair we have swap
between four and three so we will swap
them so it will become one two three
four and eight
then we have to go to our next pair it
is four in it there is no swap between
them
so let's go to the next slide
and here the all the swaps are done
so now this array is sorted but
we know that but our algorithm doesn't
know that yet so we will go to a final
iteration
with this
array so it will check between one and
two there is no swap
it will go to two and three there is no
swap three and four no swap four and
eight no swap so now when the algorithm
registered that in the complete
iteration there were no swaps
then it will declare this array as
sorted
let's try this in a visual code studio
here is our code for the bubble sort
so first let's go to our bubble sort
function
here i am declaring an n with an error
length
then
for the let's start from the start in a
bubble sort we have argument as array
so we have already passed down array in
this function
so first we are declaring its length in
an variable n
then we will have a nested for loop
which will run from i is equals to 0 to
n minus 1
and j is equal to 0 to n minus i minus 1
then we will have us if statement which
will check arj is greater than
arj plus 1 that is it is basically
checking if the this is the first
element is greater than the second
element or not if it is then it will
swap them
it is utilizing a variable called temp
to swap these two
then we have
another function which is a print array
it is basically responsible to printing
out the array
next we have our mean function in this
we are declaring an array 42183
this is the same data set which we used
during our logic explanation
so now
first we are printing out unsorted array
just for the aesthetics then we are
utilizing the print error function to
print out this unsorted array
then we are using a bubble sort function
which is responsible for sorting
this
then we will print out sorted array to
print out the actual answer
let's add another end so that
i don't think it needed because we will
be using here right line
then we have print array to print out
the sorted array let's run it
as you can see it has first printed out
the unsorted array which was our
use case
then we have a new sorted array this is
one two three four eight
so now let's get back to our slides
next up we have insertion salt
so in insertion sort
let's say we have this error
we have an array called 65423
we will start with traversing this array
from index i to n minus 1 that is i
to 5 minus 1 that is 4
so while traversing we will compare the
elements in the current index to its
predecessor
so we will be comparing six with five
sorry five with six
now if the data at the current index is
smaller than its predecessor then we
will compare it with the element before
that so basically right now we compared
it
we felt like the five was uh great uh
less than six so we will
we will check before six but there was
no element before six so we just will
swap them next we moved on to the next
pair now we have six and four
now we are checking between four six and
four now four is smaller than six so we
will obviously switch between them but
let's just check
for the element before that even so
before that we have 5 so we check if 4
is less than 5 and yes it is so what we
will do is we will
completely shift four
behind the five and six
so in the next array it will become four
five six and two and three
and as you can see it has changed
now
we will shift the bigger elements to an
index up to make space for the swapped
element that's what we just did now we
will activate the same steps again to
sort the complete array so basically
what we will do we will check
if 2 is less than 6 yes it is then we
will go and check 2 if 2 is less than 5
yes it is then we will go check if 2 is
less than 4
then yes it is
so we will switch 2 to the complete and
same thing we will do with the three we
will check if three is
uh smaller than six yes it is then we
will check if it is smaller than five
then with four yes it is then we will
check if it is smaller than two no it's
not so we will not shift 3 before 2 we
will put it after 2 and that's called
insertion sort
now let's try it with the code
explanation in a visual studio code
so let's get back to our visual studio
code
here is our insertion sort code
so first we have a function to sort this
array
this is called a sort function
here we have first declare n to this
array which is which was passed as an
argument
then we have a for loop which runs from
i is equals to 1 to i is i is less than
n
then we have declared a key
which stores the ar i
now
we have an integer j is equals to i
minus 1
now
what we will do is we will move elements
of air array from 0 to i minus 1 that
are greater than key
so basically we have declared one key
we will change this key on each
iteration of for loop so basically it is
declaring
this this key is the one which will be
shifting
so now we will check every element
before that so what that is what we are
doing
using this while loop to check every
element before key if it is greater than
key
now as soon as we figure out yes it is
greater than key so we will
just
swap that position and shift all the
elements
and then we will
put the value at that keys location
next we also have a utility function to
print this array so we have a print
array function which will print out the
complete array
next we have our main loop
here we are declaring this r array it is
the same
use case code which we use during a
logic explanation
then we have a console and the print
array line to print out the unsorted
array then we declared an object
to our insertion sort
program
this class
then we have we used that object to call
the function sort
then we we use console and the print
array to print out the sorted array now
let's run it to check if this works
and yes it works
so we have an unsorted array six five
four two three and a sorted array two
three four five six
now let's get back to our slides
next up we have selection sort
in selection sort we have an array
which is
42183
now
first we will divide this array into two
sub-arrays
an unsorted array and sorted array
then we will find the minimum elements
from unsorted array
and
swap it with the leftmost element of
this unsorted array
after that we will add it to the sorted
so what we did here is we first
divide the first
the array array line just focus on the
line with array tag
and we will divide this array into two
parts as unsorted array and a sorted
array so the first part
which will be the left most part will be
the sorted part
and the right most part will be the
unsorted part so here
our sorted part has nothing and the
unsorted part
has all the array so basically we are
representing the sorted part with the
green color and the unsorted part with
the blue color so right now we have
42183
in the blue color so that basically it
means it is unsorted
now what we did is we checked the
minimum element from this unsorted array
so basically four two one eight three we
find the minimum number between them
which was one so we basically picked it
plug that out and put it in a sorted
part so now in the first
tag we have one in a sorted
uh portion and we have 2483 in the
unsorted portion
now
we will keep repeating this process
until there are no elements left on this
unsorted so basically what we did it
did this
is we
plugged two
which was the minimum from the unsorted
part and put it in sorted part so now
in the second tag we have 1 and 2 in the
shorter part and 483 in the unsorted
part
now we will keep repeating this process
we will keep repeating it like in our
third fourth and fifth iteration
basically what first we plugged out
three the
next minimum uh letter and put it in the
sorted then we plugged out four and put
it in the next menu then we plugged out
eight since it was the last element left
so here our algorithm stops
now let's try this algorithm
in a code
so
let's move on to our visual studio code
and here
is our selection sort code
let's start with the sort function
so first we are declaring
an
array length and in an variable n
then we will one by one move boundary of
this unsorted sub array so basically we
are
having a for loop
then we would we are declaring a minimum
index that that will have value of i
now i is the
iterator for this for loop so it will go
from zero to n minus one
so basically it will
one by one
put an element
first to the zeroth location then for
loop iteration work then it will go go
uh look for the first location then the
second then the third that's how it will
work
then we have a for loop which will which
will basically check
the minimum number so we have integer uh
from j i plus one so basically it will
look from the current locat uh it will
neglect any uh number before our minimum
index
that's why it is starting from i plus 1
so that it will only look for the
unsorted part
then we have an if element it will check
if the it is uh if that array is smaller
than our minimum index
if it is then it will assign that j as
the minimum index next and now we have
found the minimum element so it will be
swapped with the first element
so now the temp
will have the minimum index which was
our new
j
and then the errors minimum index
will be switched with this array i
then we have a print array function this
will print out this array
then we have a main function which will
print out first
which has first array declared
is the same use case set which we used
during our logic explanation
then we have console and printer
lines to print out the unsorted array
then we have sort function run so that
it will sort this array
then we have our write line and print
error to print out the sorted part
let's run this
and understand
what it did
as you can see it has been first printed
as unsorted part then it has printed our
sorted part
so we can be assured that this popping
mechanism work
now let's get back to our slide and look
at what is our next in the line to
understand
next up we have quick sort
now in case of quick sort let's say we
have
an array
first we have to select a pivot
now we can select either the first
element the last or the median or any
random element as pivots so for our
array we have 69523 now we can choose
any element as pivot
this pivot will dissect the array in two
sub-arrays then we will shift all
smaller elements from the pivot element
to the left and all the bigger to the
right so now we have three as a pivot
location so now it will shift all the
small element to its left
so basically the only element smaller
than 3 is 2 so it will be on the left
and all the bigger elements will be
shifted to the right
so now
here it is so it has shifted
2 to the left and 5 six nine to the
right
now what we will do we will apply the
same operation for the left subway so
basically it has dissected the array
into two parts the left sub array and
the right server so we will do this for
the left sub array since there is only
one element two
and there is nothing which is which was
smaller bigger than this so it will stop
there then we will do this same for the
right side
so we will go for the five six and nine
now it will find another pivot element
let's say it found 6 as the new pivot
element so now it will check
and every element for the right sub area
only
which is smaller than six so it found
five was smaller so it shifted five to
the left
and nine to the right
now
since it has its own sub array
so now it will check for the five no
five has nothing here so five will
remain there then it will check for the
right
right there is nothing so now it will
conclude that yes it is sorted
now let's check out a simple code to
understand the quick sort logic
let's go back to our visual studio code
and here it is our code
first we are starting with a swap
function this is completely responsible
for swapping two element we are using
our same old the concept of using temp
to swap the
elements next we have a function which
will do the partition part
so basically it will take the la
uh it will take the last element as
pivot we can
configure it to use
according to our wishes if you want to
put use the first one or the
median or anything else
i'm using it as a last element as pivot
now
we are
passing out three
variables as its
argument so we are passing out the array
the low and the high this low and high
will basically
define so
which is the area's lowest number and
which is the highest
index
now why it is
showing this why we can't do it
manually during the code part is because
what if we want to do the partition for
our sub errors which we will do
as you have learned during our logic
explanation for the quick sort that's
why it is using low and high
now we will
use pivot equals to array high now
this is the point where you choose the
pivot now if you wish to choose the
first element you can use array low
but you have to configure the rest of
the code according to that you want to
choose the median so you can basically
choose array
low high minus low by two
now uh let's
uh follow
now the index for the smaller element
and the
that and indicate the right position of
a power pivot found so far
so we will have in i
is equals to low minus 1 now why we are
choosing low minus 1
uh it will basically signify that
uh
basically what we will do is low will be
our one so it will basically choose one
before that
so that it will start from
before
next we have for loop
int j is equals to low and j
through j less than equals to high so it
will start from the low to the high
minus 1
then j plus plus
now if the current element is smaller
than the pivot
so it will check this if array will
check if the current element smaller
than the pivot then it will increment
the index of the smaller element by i
plus plus then it will swap these two
then after that it will do the swap
array i plus 1 and high
then it will return i plus 1
now we have our quick sort algorithm
now this main function will implement
quick sort so it will have array which
which is the array to be sorted
the low which will be the starting index
and the high which will be the ending
index so now if low is less than high
this is a base case uh situation
which which is always checked
now if pi is partitioning
let's say pi is partitioning index and
array p is now at the right place so in
pi
is equals to partition of array low
comma high
now it will separate the sorted element
before partition
and after partition so now we will apply
so basically it has partitioned the
array in two parts
the left sub array and the right sub
array now we will use this pi
to apply a quick sort in the first
partition and the quick sort the next
partition
now as you have noticed we have used
this quick uh these quick sort uh
calls in a quick sort function so
basically this is an iterative method
oh sorry recursive method
next we will have a print array function
this will print print out the array
then we have our main function here we
have first declared our array
then printed out the unsorted array
before that we have also
stored array length in n
to utilize it using
for our print array function then we
have our quick sort function
as you have noticed we are using the
zero the which is the low and high as n
minus one which is the errors last index
then we have our
console write and print array to print
out our sorted
sorted array part
now let's try it
now as you can see it has printed a
sorted array then it has printed out of
sorted array
now let's get back to slides
