having us back here with part 4 in which
I'm going to discuss about the treatment
plan of both acute as well as chronic
maxillary sinusitis so coming to the
treatment of acute phase of maxillary
sinusitis is you need to go ahead with
broad-spectrum antibiotics which are
going to cover both arabic as for less
than aerobic bacteria so nasal drops are
used antihistamines are given regularly
dr. levo citizen is a choice steam
inhalation okay and anti-inflammatory
given I mean most of the things are well
known by coming to the chronic phase so
whenever you have a chronic phase okay
you need to find out the etiology so
underlining cause should be treated
first so if the underlining cause is a
the dental infection or foreign body or
a pollen you can see nasal polyps
sometimes X turning into this sinusitis
or sinus phases or it may be due to the
nasal infection that is being
transmitted to this they should be
identified and they should be treated
first etiology should be treated first
so you can do an tur wash similar to
your gastric Nevis with an antiseptic
solution or you can perform nasal and
throw to me I have already discussed
which is done in the inferior meters or
you can go ahead with a card will look
operation to remove these polyps as well
as the foreign bodies which are inside
so apart from this you can go with an
anti-inflammatory and antibiotics and
the important thing to be added is the
advanced treatment that is Fe SS that is
functional endodontic sinus surgery okay
maybe Ames or or the latest based if you
see the recent knee to zero to zero I
think they have chances that they can
ask questions related to this recent
advanced techniques that is Fe
okay so the next important aspect is
about the auto antral communication says
already discussed it is a communication
between the antrum and the oral capped
and it is called as Ora and Rufus Tila
whenever the epithelium is formed
between this two spaces
okay so fistula how do you know the
definition of fistula which is a
communication between the two cavities
so these two cavities are the one is
Antrim and the second one is oral cavity
so whenever there is an epithelium
lining form then it is called as fistula
so theologists can be while extracting
the posterior T especially first and
second first and second molars or
whenever while removing the broken root
piece of these teeth from the sockets or
periapical lesions of the upper
posterior teeth or mid facial trauma or
osteomyelitis of maxilla or sometimes
the malignancies that are involved in
the maxilla or magnetism scientists can
lead to this communication and there are
few tests which helps in confirmation of
these communication one is probe can be
used to detect and confirm the
communication you can use a bubble test
or you can use a nose blowing test okay
so so these are the important things
that you have to make a note about the
confirmation and the sequel of this aura
anthem communication is due to the sinus
formation and it's spread formation of
fistula then the patient will complaints
of voice incompetency food particles
entering into the sinus past discharge
pleural discharge halitosis lots of
things will be further radiographically
you can see okay this is a maxillary
first molar area okay and there is some
foreign body in the maxillary sinusitis
the confirmation of form
in the maxillary sinusitis so the
treatment is oriental communication is
benefit education is less than 0.5
millimeters just suture the marginal
gingiva on either sides of the socket
and protect the area by giving a partial
denture and these are the different
flaps that are used one is buccal
advancement flap most commonly asked
question the other names a shell is that
is parallel flap buccal pad of fat
combination of both that is from the
buccal side as well as from the parallel
side you can use tongue flap or in the
case some cases you can use a foreign
material like gold foil or acrylic block
to protect this communication so the
general principles that are follower
followed of general things make sure
that a flap should have adequate blood
supply to prevent the flap necrosis
always try to give insertion of the
sound bone and whenever the wound is
there make sure that the wound should
not be sutured under tension and the
flap design should be adequately visible
and accessible the next comes is already
discussed these are the flaps that are
used a combination of both buckle as
well as the palatal so these are the
diagrams okay this is a buckle flap
which is reflected from the buckle side
okay so one is sliding flap and one is
advancement flap both these are the
buckle flaps the next comes is the
parallel flap where you wear a parallel
flap is taken and extended okay this is
a parallel flap the next course is
rotational advancement parallel flap
where the flap is taken and it is
rotated and I'd want to this space the
next one is submucosal connect to tissue
flap and hinge flap okay so these are
the parallel flaps and the last verse is
the combination of both means both the
buckle as well as the paradigm see this
both the buckle is a combination of both
the flaps out of which by pedestal flap
means
this is a communication area where
you're going to give an in session
okay and you're going to drag this and
you're going to suture this so where
you're going to leave an uncovered area
uncovered area for the granulation
tissue formation so this is a biped
assault flap so apart from this the
limited size of the local flaps makes it
difficult to close the larger fishless
so if it is smaller one you can compare
it so therefore distance flap has been
used flaps taken from so the flaps taken
from foreheads tongue
temporalis buccal fat extremities can be
used as a distance flaps so I hope you
remember one is buccal flat one is
parrot and flap different buccal flaps
different parallel flaps combination of
both and finally the distant flap the
next one is even if you are not able to
take a distant flap then you need to go
for a foreign metal that is a low
plastic crafts that can be a gold foil
titanium foil or it can be a poly methyl
methyl acrylate that is an acrylic plug
or you can use a Collison or
hydroxyapatite block or the fibrin do
any of these can be used and make a note
I hope you remember this antral packing
lock once the surgery is done you're
going to pack the complete space with
the antrum and vile packing that you
have to use this whitehead varnish ok
the composition of whitehead varnish and
this whitehead varnish is a commonly
asked question and given in 2017 it okay
so this was repeated so give some
importance to this area ok next comes is
the post-operative instructions most of
the instructions will be same as your
extraction that is advice not to blow
the nose as it creates the pressure and
at the site of the closure of the
communication advice not to open mouth
bite because stretching of the sutures
norine Singh gargling no smoking avoid
sneezing limited mouth opening advice
nasal drops sutures should be removed
after seven days auntie most of things
are well known ok there's nothing new to
be either to your notices and sometimes
the root tips or the roots may enters
into the sinus because I have shown you
I will be aware you can see a foreign
body in the maxillary sinus similarly
roots can enter so you have to confirm
it on clinical on that particular case
by observing the root tips and
radiographically by taking an IRB for
the confirmation and the roots in the
sockets are removed by various methods
ok different methods can be tried out of
which the last and the important one is
card will look okay so you can try
different one like socket apexes is
widened twice the size of the root FX
and you can you can try to pull it off
or irrigating with lots of saline and
pushing into the socket so that so so
that the flush out can remove the one or
a thin long rubber gaze is pushed into
the sinus through the socket and removed
in a single jerk by which it can get
locked or it can be removed or by using
a high vacuum session or they can be
different approaches okay but mainly we
need to focus more on the operation so
I'm going to discuss this in the next
part so indications it is a technique
that is used to remove remove the teeth
or root or any foreign body in the sinus
nothing new everything is known in the
case of trauma the mid facial fractures
when the roof of the sinus is fractured
and the floor of the orbit is rocked
okay it is the best way of correcting so
this is a specific condition where you
how to make it and you know that it is
used to remove the sinus wall or the
nasal polyps in the case of your chronic
sinusitis already discuss nothing new
and it can be used in the removal of the
cysts in the sinus removal of polyps in
the sinus known and management of
hematoma of the sinus mainly occurring
from the nose bleeding small Magnus is
so most of the things are already known
all these are known the only thing that
you have to focus on this
okay how the procedure either you can go
for la or general anesthesia the lip is
elevated vertical incision digital to
that of the lateral as well as the
distal to that of the first molar are
made okay make sure you give a ginger
clearing session or a horizontal
insertion made few mm above the attached
gingiva in the given job okay so the
next all is make sure you prevent the
damage to the tough inferior or not
okay make a note about this this is an
important right next on the facial wall
of the sinus with the help of a bar and
a hand this make a opening of 0.5
centimeter in mostly it is at the can I
in força aérea then the opening is done
antiseptic solution isn't it everything
whatever that is there opening process
operator is then the sinus is irrigated
with antiseptic solution flap is placed
back and switch it over the book okay so
I was talking about FES that is
functional endoscopic sinus surgery so
this is this is a diagram based question
they can give so here he is trying to
operate the ethmoid sinus okay so
through the nose with an endoscopic
surgery that is Fe SS so Fe SS is also
called as intranasal endoscopic Technic
okay that allows the establishment of
adequate sinus dryness and it helps in
clearing all the blocks and removing the
things okay so this is an important area
where they can ask a new advanced based
questions for now I'm done with
maxillary sinus few parts I think this
is more than sufficient both from the
anatomy histology applied aspects as
well as the clinical features with the
treatment plan and with some latest
advances so this is dr. shreek on
signing off from team MDS conferred
