Coast and I explored what's new in the
market simply learns data science boot

about data science so I opted for simply
learned data science boot camp in
association with caltech's ctme

excellent I especially liked the online
portal and access to the lab and the
knowledge

very
knowledgeable the program helped me
expand and broaden my understanding of
data science I now feel well equipped
with multiple tools and applications of
