today we are running a very fast design
process and constantly building and
testing and making a way through work by
processing several steps repeatedly and
bringing a closer look to success in the
angle we can do this quickly and easily
with the help of prototyping in figma
so what is prototyping and what is mean
by prototyping in figma
we will discuss everything you need to
know about so hey everyone and welcome
to Simply learns YouTube channel you are
already watching simply learn and today
we bring you this informative video
about prototyping in pig before we begin
if these are the videos you'd like to
watch hit that subscribe button and the
bell icon to get notified and if you are
a tech geek here is a brain teaser for
you
a prototyping Model start with what
analysis
is it data
requirement
dummy system
or model let us know your answer below
and get a heart from Simply learn
without any further delay let's get
started with the session
now let's take a quick look at the
agendas first
we will start by understanding what is
figma and then what prototyping is
moving forward we will discuss how
prototyping Works in figma followed with
we will see how prototyping is useful
so let's understand what is figma
stigma is the great tool for prototyping
in UI and ux Design
that allows you to create an interactive
flow and that allows users to interact
with your design
prototyping is important for different
reasons setting the workflow for the new
users and examine and getting feedback
from users
so now we will see what is prototyping
mapping is important for many reasons
and you can examine new users workflow
prototyping is what allows designers to
design in the air of digital products
prototyping is the interactions between
the users and the interface
prototyping is a process of how the
final product works and this allows the
product team to test their Design After
understanding what is figma and
prototyping we will see how prototyping
Works in figure
so the first one is we can add prototype
flows
add interaction
fixed position
and overflow scrolling and how to
present and share prototype so the first
one is at prototype flows
in the figma file you can have one or
more than one prototype flows on each
page and they should have their starting
point and unique name so like the first
frame you want to appear in your flow
and then click the add icon right to the
flow starting point and after adding you
can rename the Flow by clicking on the
name input and can add a description by
using the point by clicking the delete
icon next to the flow starting point
and the next one is
our interaction
iterations are used to build a prototype
and can be used to show a different
Behavior a pattern of navigation and
outcomes
and they work by connecting two
different layers and then we'll examine
how these two layers will interact with
each other by adding animations act and
triggers
interactions can be simple and easy but
sometimes it's more complex too as
animated elements move and change their
properties
interactions can be done in three steps
instant interaction
animated interactions
and the smart animated interaction so
the first one is instant interaction
use instant interaction animation to let
the action to be taken and place without
movement or effect it will be helpful to
navigate between the pages or model
example navigation between the pages
with an instant animation you can
navigate by just tapping a button
the next one is
animated interaction
use animations to add movements in
interaction that helps move in move out
slide in slide out Etc use different
features that are available
and last one is smart animated
use Smart animations to examine matching
layers on different frames and animate
the differences these differences can
include a change in color size and
position
fixed position
fix the position of an element in the
Prototype so that it will easy to stay
in the same place while scrolling and it
is helpful for the element that wish to
be in the view example navigation for
top and bottom configure the design
panel set
the next one is ADD overflow scrolling
it allows scrolling through each frame
inside the Prototype it is very helpful
for prototyping components or UI region
that have their own property of
scrolling example menus table list Etc
and it is important to have a frame with
content overflow files using overflow
scrolling
and the next one is how to present and
share prototype
first select the icon press an icon near
the top toolbar that presents the
Prototype and if there are multiple
flows on a single page switch them
between the sidebar and here comments
can be mentioned as notes tasks and
questions although you can leave
feedback too prototyping can be shared
by clicking on shared prototype in the
presentation toolbar
after understanding how prototyping
Works in figma we will see how it is
useful
using prototype is a great method
we can use it in user flows and
interaction in advance
idea sharing and Improvement
we can get the feedback from the users
and also we can test the user's
interactions
and the last one present your concept to
the interested users
you may preview a user's journey and
experience with your ideas by creating
several flows for your prototype on a
single page with figma's prototyping
features so in this tutorial we will
look at the how to create prototyping
with figma figma is a powerful design
and prototyping tool that you can use
for both your ux and UI projects if you
are new to figma I recommend you to
check out the tutorials I created on how
to create mockups in figma first which I
will link to it in the description below
in this tutorial we will make some
interactive prototype so we will get
started by opening up the figma file
with this fireframe here we have few
static Pages including the home page and
the uh women's category page and the
product page and I will walk you through
in this tutorial is how to connect these
pages so users can click through just
like they would on the real products so
the first thing we want to do is enter
the prototype in the figma yeah and you
can do that and that by clicking on the
Prototype tab in the top right corner
now you will notice that nothing really
changes except for the content in the
right sidebar yes the sidebar so we will
start there and there are the settings
for your prototype these are the few
things you want to change uh depending
on your device or sorry your design so
the first setting that you may want to
change is the device
and device refers to the device that
your prototyping is presented in so in
this case we are designing for the
desktop so we are probably would not
want to present these design inside in
any additional uh device I think
so uh but
uh wait let me do it in that yeah
but uh if you were designing for mobile
instance it would be nice to show these
designs
oh yeah these designs uh inside an
iPhone
iPhone but for our case we will design
it for the desktop so let me back with
the none okay
um another setting that we want our we
can change is the background color and
this refers to the background color of
our prototype that appears where you are
presenting the mode or this present mode
so if I open up
present mode here is a top right
hand corner that's right so I can see
the design here
yeah
I can see the design here there are some
few margins these stock margins on the
side that are currently look black and
that because here is a background
another setting that we can have is the
background color and this refers to the
background color of your prototype that
will appear in your present mode when
you look like it in this and you can
present it and you can have that color
of the background if if you are
suppose
yeah this is the color of the background
that is black and you can change it
so
yeah so that if we'll do it as a white
color so it it's not
more than a natural feels like there is
not uh that awkward cut or the sides of
the design if it is a black color so let
it be white
so yeah
so uh so now so now that we have set up
our prototype and adjusted the settings
then we can actually start the
connecting these different uh screens
and the way you do it is by just
creating the connections uh so to create
the connection we will actually have to
go here to the home page
yeah this is the home page
for instance right so and let's imagine
that we want to connect this woman link
to the woman's women's category this is
the women's category right so uh page
which is on here like like to do that I
would like to click on the women
you will see that the right of the woman
there is a little
White
uh this one there's a little white
circle appears and that's what known as
a node and nodes allow you to connect
these links to other pages so if I click
on the Node and the white circle
yeah and and I will drag it one minute
yeah wait
if I'll drag it
I can now drag to many other pages in
this file so I can drag to this category
page
or I can drag to another page which is
further on this file so if I drag it to
the category page of this women you will
see that there is a connection created
right
uh wait it's not created I think
I can connect it once more
yeah it's connected right so
there is a line revealed here that shows
that there's a there when you click on
in the women
see when you click in the women it's
going to take you to the women category
page and another thing
uh that pop up when I created uh that
connection was a little arrow
yeah this one here in the top left and
this is known as the starting frame
indicator and allows this and all these
indicators is which a frame of a
prototype on or which one of these
screen will be the first screen that
people see when they open their
prototype right
um so uh right now it's set to uh the
home home page home but if I wanted to
change as it I would just click it on
the arrow and drag and then change it to
another screen so in this case uh when
people open your prototype they will
start on the women category page but in
our case we actually want users to start
on the home page so I will
click that Arrow again and drag it back
to the home page
yeah
um so now let's create another
connection So currently we are having a
connection from the home page
to the women's category link uh to the
women's category page right but now
let's create a way for users to get back
from women's category page to the home
page so what we want to do is just
select
IC shoe
and then you can see the node appear
right here to the right you will want to
click in on that node and drag it over
about one minute and drag it over to the
home page so that
uh let me connect it with here yeah
yeah
so
so that uh way when you the when the
users on the same on uh when the users
on the nice shoes logo it will take them
to the back to the home page of the
women's category that will be this one
um so before we create more connections
here in our own prototype let's make
sure that the connections are already
created uh working correctly so to do
that and to preview your prototype what
you do have to do you have to go to the
right of the corner and there is a play
button so it will open up open it up
yeah right present mode this is known as
the present word right
and you have already looked at the
screen previously and there is a
there is your actual
prototype and this is what you did you
want to share with your users client
image Etc so in in this present mode
there are few things to know we will see
the present mode is just another tab
right
in your figma file so if you want to go
back to your design you just click on
the tab to the left of you can go
yeah this one and to the another tab to
the right side an enter present mode
again
and you can do the present mode right
and what's really nice about this
present mode is that it updates
automatically as you uh as you update
any uh as as you update any of your
prototype here in the left this tab here
just updates automatically you don't
have to keep opening up a new prototype
every time you want to preview something
so in your case you want to preview all
of the connection we just created so to
do that we just have to click anywhere
so uh you will see that the little
triangle
sorry a little rectangle appears
overlaying in the women
so and that's what are known as a hot
spot and that indicates that there is an
interactive element that we have to
click and we can click on so if we go
ahead and click as we already clicked on
the women elements we can uh women that
takes us to the women's category page
and this is the category page right
fall down and this page check out the
content like a normal website and then
we can also want to click again to see
if there is any other hot spot in this
page so
yeah so if we click here we will see
there is a hotspot on the logo which is
uh we know as we created
uh uh and that will take us back to the
same page if we'll click on that yeah
so it's look like uh both our
connections are working correctly right
let's create few more
okay
uh the next connection uh we will uh we
want to make is
yeah
okay uh sorry the next connection I will
want to make uh is from women's category
page right to the product page product
details and where we want to add the
connection is here to the button
it's a post button in the top case for
the women's as a specific product right
product name
top cakes for women
so I could just go ahead and select the
image and
drag the node and bring it over to the
product page but but what I actually
want to do is to make this make this
whole card clickable so this image here
or this block and then this title as
well as
so to do that what I want to do is
Select both the elements
here and then hit the Ctrl G
one minute
yeah
on the window okay you have to hit the
Ctrl G on the window and what does uh
what that does it uh that will group
both the elements together and create
one single node for this entire group so
now this whole card is clickable and
uses just the rectangle and now I can
take this node
yeah and this node and drag it to over
to the product detail page right and we
will see that there is a connection now
and now when I it go back into previous
mode I will go over to the women page
scroll down
let's wait
yeah
and when we scroll down
and if I click anywhere
yeah
he's the Prototype I will see that the
hotspot is for the entire car so if I so
I can go ahead and click that and that
takes it to the product
yeah product page
this is the product so the next thing I
want to do is uh give users way back to
the women's category page so actually I
want to include a right uh include a
link right here so
uh yes
or connecting that link back to the
women's category page or to do so that I
will go back to the web design file and
then I will select this
women
here by
double clicking
on that yeah when I select the woman the
selection box or this boundary box is
actually pretty large and I will show
you what that means when we go to our
prototype so if I click in on that node
and will connect it to the women's
category
page I will zoom out see yeah
so you can see what uh when we go back
to the Prototype
that the selection box is actually the
same as our hotspot
yeah
is actually pretty large as well as it
would be fine for the most cases that
product I find in this cases because
it's just a couple of pages
and we are just thinking back and forth
but if we had a more complex prototype
where you want to include a link include
a link on women's and then another link
on a sneakers that's really wouldn't
work so to fix this
um
and to make this hot spot slightly
smaller what you would do you have to go
back to your design file
and then we have just drag click to drag
the selection
on women's hair
you have to drag it slowly
and make sure it only covers the women
link and now when you go
and now when you go back
to our prototype we can click anywhere
you can see that the prototyping
uh let's wait one minute yeah
Okay one minute
yeah actually uh yeah after prototype we
click anywhere
uh we can see that the hotspot is
exactly are the size of the women legs
and the sneakers below right
um so last connection that I want to
make here is a connection from the
product page
this product page uh
which is speech uh
product page which is uh the page way on
the back on the home page so to do that
I will create a connection here on the
logo of
nice shoe
yeah logo that links back to the home
page uh so we will go over this design
file
design file is this one
yeah
I will just could just select the nice
shoe logo drag
drag the no drag it over to the home
page but I am actually going to show you
a trick to speed up this process of
creating uh connections especially when
it comes to navigation element so what
can I do is go to another page
and I can select this element and then
simply
paste it into another page so first I
will copy this
and now we wish notice that when I paste
it in the actually pastries the
connection as well as see this one and
it gives this one to so you have a
connection on the women's category page
which made before
um and we have uh this new one in the
product page and this is amazing
especially when you are working with
things like menus because
um when you have menus with 10 different
links that you want to do that each
piece and create more connections like
um to do uh on each one of the your link
instead you can just copy and you can
copy the entire and you paste it on the
new page and those connections uh will
already be made
and now we will look at how to edit your
prototype in other words I did some of
the connection that you already made
yeah
uh doing this in figma is super
straightforwarding all like you have to
do is Click uh on one of the connection
so in the first case the connection from
uh women's to women's uh category page
this one category page I will click on
that
yeah and now you have a few options uh
or vertical interaction details on this
specific connection and there appears a
little pop-up here to the right call in
directions details and there are few
things that you can do here is uh when
you can manually change
what screen you're navigating to so for
that if you are due for the instance I
could choose product page instead of
women
right
right which I will touch on briefly but
few cool features that figma has to
offer so first off animations between
the screen so when I click on this link
and that makes me do the uh let's make
me
to the category of women's category page
um this is the animation or the
transition that happens between these
two screens
so right now it's Set uh it's set to
instance so uh yeah the animation it
sets to instance so you can see when I
click on the women so instantly it's
taking me to the women's category
um but I could actually change that to
something like uh dissolve
uh I want uh that does is instead of
what's just flashing to the women's
category page there is actually a nice
resolved transitions
uh let's click in on this
is this one uh that's a dissolved
transitions between the screens and this
is just one basic animation style but
figma has a few more advanced features
uh that are really amazing actually so
if you choose smart animations for
instance
let's see for the dissolve
yeah suddenly it dissolves right that
effect and uh actually if you choose a
smart uh animation for instance let's
choose
okay so we set it as a smart animation
let's
play
and if I hit the women
there's a smart animations for instance
if I hit
the women it will go with the smart
animation of instance
and if you can see that some elements
start to shift and that was not very
smooth because these were not a lot of
common elements from page to page but if
I do something like that takes so the
women page uh duplicate that and then
we'll actually make this duplicate
for one minute
foreign
[Music]
if I change this
changes to demand
make a little small
and then pen repeat then and to this
page and I will
connect this
and if I link men to this new page and
now I preview
uh
this let let me connect it
with this
yeah
and see it's set to Smart animate
already if I preview this
and let's preview this one
here here what I looks like is so as you
can see that the line automatically
animate
see and it's menu Link in the case if it
is also gets smaller I mean that what
smart enemy uh can does that's really
basic example
and it gets a lot more complex when you
are working with different elements but
it's uh it's really a quick way to
create transitions between the screen
and it works especially when things like
an app where you are pulling up sheets
or pop-up and yeah figma offers some
amazing features when it comes to
animations and it's really uh powerful
so I definitely encourage you to play
around with some of these features in
the interaction details panel
um so the next thing I want to talk
about here is how to share your
prototype so you might want to share
your prototype with a client or a
teammate that involved on the project
and to do that in the Fig mites actually
are super straightforward and so the
first thing you want to do in is you
open your present mode you if it is not
open then you can click it on the right
side of this one or otherwise we already
open the prototyping
um present mode so you could know that
when you open up this tab you already
open then you have to hit the share
prototype now your important note that
you make sure you are not hitting share
from the actual design file because in
this case you had to share a design file
not the Prototype so when you are
sharing just prototype make sure you are
not doing it from present mode so will
you go ahead and hit this share then
repeat and hit share for the drive and
that gives us a few options right so the
first option is to invite access
um and you can do that by entering email
here or here and just they will get you
get an invitation to the Prototype and
they will get open that up with that
that's one way to do it but the way uh I
actually prefer to share out your
prototype is by hitting this uh copy
link option and then just open copies a
link to your clipboard to this prototype
that can share out in the message or the
personal message or by email or by FP or
Facebook messages or really whatever you
want yeah but just too mindful that if
you are doing this copying method I
guess you want to make sure that this is
a set to this is set to anyone with a
link because if it said to only people
invited to this file when someone
receiving that links and they are not
invited to this file they may not be
able to open it so if you are sharing
out your link make sure you set it to
anyone with a link hope you enjoyed this
tutorial and if you are interested to
learning about more you eggs are
becoming a ux designer please check out
the link below of for the ux design and
we will cover the fundamentals of ux
design with this we have come to the end
of this session where we understand the
basics of prototyping in figma and the
continuation of the prototyping in figma
will make it simpler quicker and more
joyful for designers to convey their
ideas
