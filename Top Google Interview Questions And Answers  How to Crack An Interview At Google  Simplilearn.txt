you can prepare for a job interview by
studying weeks in advance but still
there is no guarantee that you won't be
asked a question you have no idea how to
answer the trickiest and the most
important questions are designed to help
employers gain a deeper understanding of
beyond what's listed on your assuming a
potential sales candidate for example
might be asked to talk through how they
would approach short sale cycle
differently than a long sales cycle a
candidate interviewing for a managerial
role might be asked how they'd handle
customer objections or a team conflict
these questions aren't always easy and
they often cause most people to stress
and freeze up
so we bought you this video to get a
better understanding of how tricky the
questions are designed for google
interview hey everyone welcome to
another exciting video from simply learn
in this session we will be discussing on
tricky google interview questions
however before we begin the session make
sure that you have subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to
click that bell icon so you can never
miss an update from simply learn so
without further ado let's get started
with the first question of this session
and
we have why do you choose google
answer when a question is asked in the
interview like this come up with a
unique answer like this
impressive record and impressive history
of the company
some of the best products that are
released by google and used by everyone
in the world and helping everyone in
several areas
clearly committed to building a diverse
workforce which is good to choose google
and the second question in the list is
do you think google should be charging
for its productivity apps
the best answer for this question is if
google charges for its productivity
applications like gmail or many more no
one is going to choose
so instead of that making a freemium
model with enhanced functionalities can
help better for the people and make them
choose google
and the next question in the list is
which number does not belong to this
series 2
3
5 8 11 13 21
the answer for this question is if we
observe the series clearly it is based
on adding the adjacent number in the
series so the number which is not
related in the series is 11. let's have
a look at the next question in the
series
and we have what does the significance
of dead beef mean
usually people respond to this question
with an answer like beef always is dead
wrong answer the correct answer is that
dead beef is a hexadecimal value that
was used in debugging back in the
mainframe or assembly days as such it
was easy to see when marking and finding
specific memory in pages of hex dumps
most computer engineers are aware of
this term
the next question we have is is your iq
more than 130
avoid this question by answering yes
the question is put to check
intellectual humility and yes could be
the worst answer to this
remembering your iq score sends a wrong
message of your insecurity and
self-aggrandizement
let's have a look at the next question
in the list
there are months with 30 days and others
with 31 days then how many months do we
have 28 days
don't try to give the answer as february
as your answer because all months have
28 days and more
now let's have a look at the next
question in the session
how many times would you need to fold
the one millimeter piece of paper in
half for it to be high enough to reach
the moon try to give an answer like
folding a one millimeter thick piece of
paper in half 42 times will make the
paper 4 million 398 46 kilometers height
which is more than the distance from the
earth to the moon
and the next question in the session we
have is why do manholes are round in
shape
the answer for this question is
it would make it harder to fit with a
cover you'd have to rotate the cover
exactly the right way therefore
many manhole covers are round so they
don't need to be rotated
there are no corners to deal with
also a round manhole cover won't fall
into the hole because it was rotated in
the wrong way
so it's safer when they are rounded
now let's have a look at the next
question in the session why do you think
that the google search page is so mainly
blank
the answer for this question is
when google was invented the founders
did not know much on web designing and
development so they left much of the
pages empty with only bare bones
designing and they left as blank
and the next question of the session is
how much should you charge to wash all
the windows in new york
give a definitive answer like 15 dollars
per window a specific answer is better
instead of a guess
next question in the list is
explain what is database to a 10 year
old kid
for these kind of questions giving an
answer like database is a machine that
stores all the information that people
used to remember and identify
and the next question in the session is
tell something about you which is not
included in your resume
for this kind of question answer the
question like mention something you have
achieved in your current job role that's
recent and not included in your resume
or talk about a volunteering experience
that you can relate to the position or
stress a strength or skill that's
essential to the current position
the next question in the list is
who do you believe as google's main
competitors answer this question with
answer like google has several
competitors like microsoft facebook
netflix and several others depending on
the specific space
one of the main difference is google's
ability to integrate its services
creating a cross-platform experience
now let's have a look at another
question in the list
how do you explain programming and
programming languages to a 10 year old
kid the answer is
if a question is asked like this give an
answer like programming allows us to
teach computers to do specific things
a programming language is like a
language that is understandable by
computers so that makes a good
impression
the next question is
if the day before yesterday is three
days after friday what day is today
so the answer for this question is three
days after friday is monday
so the day before yesterday is monday so
the day before yesterday was tuesday and
yesterday was wednesday so today is
thursday
the next question in the session is
how 5 minus 2 equals 4 explain
the answer for the above question is if
you observe the question it is clearly
mentioned that 5 minus 2 is equals to 4.
so when you remove f and e from the word
5 then it then it becomes i we or in
roman it is 4 represented as 4.
the next question we have is which of
the following sets doesn't belong to the
series a b
c
d
a e b g
z i a b
j k
l m
the answer for the above question is j k
l m doesn't belong to the series the
three remaining sets are a part of
series because all of them have a b
subset in common
and the next question in the series is
what is the biggest threat that google
faces
the answer for the above question is
that facebook is the biggest threat
facing google these days because it has
over 1 billion active users every month
the next question in the series is
how many times does a clock hand overlap
per day
so the answer for this question is clock
hand overlaps 22 times per day
now the next question in the series
describe time
where you have failed at something
how do you recover
so the answer for this question is while
i was managing a project for one of the
biggest clients in my previous company i
was so eager to please them that i told
them we would finish the project within
three weeks
so i took this experience and used it to
become much better at managing the
expectations of client during project
and this was all for today's session i
hope now you guys have an idea of how
the questions are asked in the google
interview
