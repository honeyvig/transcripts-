agenda that is how to eliminate page
break in excel
now we are on the spreadsheet
so here what exactly are page breaks so
page breaks are something which help you
during your trying to print your data or
present your data in the form of a web
page right in those times you cannot fit
your entire excel data in one
spreadsheet or one paper or one web page
right so in those scenarios excel will
try to eliminate a few parts of your
spreadsheet or it will try to split the
spreadsheet
so how exactly it looks like so go to
the view option and
click on the view and click on page
break preview here you can see the
dotted lines right so these are the
things which separate your data in form
of pages so that it can be printable on
one single page
so some of the times the user or the x
user
manually inserts a page break right so
how do you insert it just go to the page
layout and here you can see the page
breaks insert a page break and you have
successfully inserted a page break again
go to the view go to page break view and
here you can see the solid line so these
solid ones are the ones which are
inserted by the users or anyone who had
the access to the data now how do we
eliminate them right so we can eliminate
them and we can try to you know get the
shade back of the normal way
so all you have to do is click on the
cell which has the page break which is
right under the pastry
go to the
insert
page break yeah page layout menu
go to the breaks option click on remove
page break and there you go you have
successfully eliminated the page break
and page break preview to make sure that
the page break has been successfully
removed so you cannot see that anymore
so that's how you try to insert or
eliminate a page break in excel now with
