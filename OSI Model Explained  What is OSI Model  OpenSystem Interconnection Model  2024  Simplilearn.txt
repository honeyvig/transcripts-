hello everyone and welcome to today's
video on OSI model at and in this video
we are going to explore its key function
including how it ensures a reliable data
transmission between the devices we will
also study about the differences between
connection oriented and connectionless
services so you can definitely
understand how a data is securely and
efficiently transferred across the
networks so guys whether you are new to
networking or just looking to brush up
your knowledge this video has got you
all covered craving a career upgrade

below dive into the link in the
description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back but before we move on just a quick
info guys simply L has got a
post-graduate program in cyber security
this program is designed to equip you
with the skills required to become an
expert in the rapidly growing field of
cyber security the cyber security
program aims to help you stay a breast
of all the latest trends in cyber
security as well so let's get started so
guys let us first understand what is OSI
model so guys OSI stands for Open System
interconnection model it is basically a
conceptual framework which is used to
understand and standardize how different
networking protocols interact to enable
communication over a network it was
developed by intern National
Organization for standardization or ISO
in 1984 it breaks down the complex
process of data communication into seven
distinct layers each with its own
specific function now let us try to
understand each of this layer one by one
so guys the first layer which we are
going to study is a physical layer
moving ahead we are going to understand
about the data length layer then we will
go through Network layer moving ahead we
will have the transport layer then we
will have the session layer then we will
the presentation layer and finally we
will have the application layer so now
let us try to understand first what is a
physical layer so guys the physical
layer is the lowest level of the OSI
model handling the actual physical
connection between the devices it is
responsible for transmitting data in a
form of individual bits from one device
to another when data is received the
physical layer converts signal into
binary bits zeros and ones and passes
them into the data link layer which then
resembles into Data then into frames now
let us discuss more about what are the
key functions of physical layer so guys
the key functions of physical layer are
the first one is bit synchronization so
actually guys this layer ensures that
bits are synchronized by providing a
clock that coordinates with both the
sender and receiver maintaining
synchronization at a bit level then you
get bit control it basically defines the
rate at which bits are transmitted the
number of bits per second then you get
the physical topologies the physical
layer it specifies the arrangement of
devices or nodes in the network such as
a burst star or mes topologies then you
get the transport mode in which you
determine how data flows between the
connected devices with possible modes
including Simplex in which is a one way
half duplex which is two-way but not
simultaneously and in full duplex you
have two-way simultaneously so guys at a
physical layer you encounter devices
like hubs repeaters modems and cables to
oper at this layer now let us move to
our next layer that is the data link
layer so guys the data link layer is
responsible for the direct transfer of
data between nodes on a network its
primary role is to ensure that data is
delivered error free from one nodee to
the next over the physical layer when a
packet arrives at a network device the
data link layer handles its delivery to
the appropriate host using devices Mac
address the data link layer consist of
two sub layers so guys the first layer
is logical length control and the second
one is Media access control so let us
get a little bit deep about it when a
packet from the network layer reaches
the data link layer it is further
divided into frames on the based of the
frame sizes which is supported by the
network interface card the data link
layer also adds the MAC address of the
sender and the receiver to the frames of
the header to determine the receiver's
Mac address the data link layer uses the
address resolution protocol or ARP it
sent sends out an ARP request asking who
has this IP address the device with the
matching IP address then responds with
its Mac address now I hope so you would
have got idea like when a data is
received from the network layer what has
happened in the data link layer so we
have two sub layers which are
responsible for doing these tasks The
Logical link control layer and the
medium Access Control layer now let us
try to understand what functions are
involved in this layer the first one
that we have is Framing and physical
addressing if we talk about framing guys
this function involves encapsulating
data into frames with special bit
patterns at the beginning and at the end
to Mark the start and end of the frame
ensuring the receiver can correctly
interpret the transmitted bels then you
have the physical addressing the data
link layer adds the Mac addresses of the
sender and receiver to header of each
frame enabling accurate delivery of the
frame to the correct device then we have
the error control it provides a
mechanism to detect and correct errors
in data transmission such as
retransmission frame that are damaged or
lost so guys this is under the error
control next you have the flow control
to prevent data loss due to mismatched
data rates flow control manages the
amount of data sent before receiving an
acknowledgement ensuring there is a
consistent data transfer rates and
finally we have the access control when
multiple devices share a single
Communication channel the max sublayer
determines which device can use the
channel at any given time avoiding
conflicts and ensuring orderly
communication now let us move on to our
third layer that is the network layer so
guys the network layer is responsible
for transmitting data between hosts that
are located in different networks it
manages packet routing which involves
selecting the most efficient path for
data to travel from the source to the
destination the network layer also
handles addressing by placing the IP
address to both of the sender and
receiver in the packet header now the
functions of the network layer are the
first one that we have all over here is
routing this function involves
determining optimal path for the data to
travel from the source to the
destination routing protocols helps to
find the best route among several
available paths to ensure efficient data
delivery then you have the logical
addressing basically guys a network
layer defines an addressing scheme to
uniquely identify each device across
networks it assigns the IP addresses to
both sender and the receiver which are
included in the packet header this
addressing scheme allows devices to be
distinguished and located across the
entire network so guys in this we have a
packet so in the network layer the data
unit is called packet and it is referred
to as segment of the data that is routed
across the networks we talk about the
networking devices the network layer
functions are implemented by devices
such as routers and switches which
handles packet routing and forwarding
between different networks now let us
try to understand about the transport
layer so guys this is our fourth layer
basically this layer ensures the
complete and accurate inin transmission
of messages between devices in this
layer data is transferred to as segments
the transport layer handles
acknowledgement of successful data
transmission and retransmits data if
errors are detected now there are two
types of services which are provided by
the transport layer the first service is
connection oriented service and the
second one is connectionless service so
guys if we talk about connection
oriented service so in this a connection
is first established between the sender
and the receiver before data
transmission begins then once the
connection is established then the data
is transmitted in an organized manner
the receiving device sends an
acknowledgement back to the sender after
receiving each packet or a group of
packets ensuring that the data has been
received correctly now after the data
transmission is complete the connection
is properly terminated to free up the
resources this type of service is
reliable and secure because it ensures
that data is delivered accurately in a
correct order with mechanisms to detect
and retransmit lost or corrupted packets
if I talk about the connectionless
service or it is one phase process in
this data is sent from sender to the
receiver without establishing a
connection first the sender simply
transmits the data and the receiver does
not send back any acknowledgement upon
reip this approach allows for faster
communication between devices and it
eliminates the overhead of establishing
and terminating a connection and waiting
for acknowledgements while faster
connectionless service is less reliable
than connection oriented service because
it does not provide mechanisms for
ensuring that all data is received
correctly in a correct order now if we
talk about the functions of Transport
layer guys the first function is
segmentation the transport layer
receives the complete message from the
session layer and breaks it down into
smaller and manageable units call
segments now after that each segment is
assigned as a header that contains
essential information for a proper
delivery so that is reassembly at a
destination the transport layer
reassembles these segments back into
original message ensuring that the data
is correctly reconstructed for the
receiving application now the next one
is service Point addressing to ensure
that the message reaches the correct
application process on receiving the
device the transport layer adds a
special address known as the service
Point address or a port address to each
segment header this addressing allows a
transport layer to direct the message to
the appropriate process such as specific
application or service running on the
device ensuring accurate delivery so
these were the functions of Transport
layer now let us move on to our next
layer that is session layer the session
layer manages the connection between
applications on different devices it
ensures that communication sessions are
properly established maintained and
terminated additionally it handles
session security and synchronization now
let us discuss the functions of session
layer so guys the first one is session
establishment maintenance and
termination this function allows to
application to set up use and close a
connection it ensures that the session
remains active during a communication
and is probably terminated when it's
done next we have the synchronization
the session layer adds checkpoints or
synchronization points within the data
stream these points help manage error by
allowing the data to be resynchronized
and ensuring that no messages are lost
or cut off prematurely the third one we
have the dialog controller it controls a
dialogue between two systems enabling a
communication in either half duplex
which is One Direction at a time or full
duplex both directions
simultaneously so the session layer
along with the presentation and
application layer is combined into
single application layer in the tcip
model this is something notable which
you should know and these functions are
typically managed by the network
application itself these layer are
referred to as upper layers or software
layers so if I talk about example
includes net bios or pptp now suppose
let us take an example imagine a user is
sending a message through a Messenger
application in their web browser the
Messenger application provides an
interface for the user to write and send
a message then there will be data
processing the message data is
compressed and optionally encrypted for
security then you have the session layer
which manages a connection between user
browser and managing service ensure that
session is maintained throughout the
message transfer and properly closed
afterward then you have the data
transmission the message is converted
into binary bits zeros and one for
transmission or the network with
synchronization points ensuring data
integrity and successful delivery so
till here you can understand how the
data flow is happening now let us move
on and understand about the presentation
layer the presentation layer also known
as as a translation layer is responsible
for transforming data from the
application layer into a format suitable
for Network transmission it ensures that
data sent by application layer is
correctly formatted encrypted and
compressed the functions of the
presentation layer are the first one is
the translation it converts the data
between different formats or character
sets for example it can translate text
from ASCII to ebcd I encoding ensuring
that data is readable and usable by
different syst systems then you have the
encryption or decryption it basically
encrypts the data to secure its
transmission and decrypts it upon
received encrypted data or Cipher text
is transformed into readable format or
plain text using cryptographic keys next
we have the compression compression
basically reduces the size of data to
minimize the amount of bandwidth
required for transmission this helps
speed up the data transfer process and
reduce Network congestion now let us
talk about the protocols of formats
available aailable at this layer common
examples include jpeg for image
compression MPEG for video compression
and JF for image format now let us
discuss about the application layer so
guys the application layer is a topmost
layer of the OSI model and directly
interacts with the network applications
it provides Network Services to the end
user applications and facilitates the
communication between software and the
network the functions of the application
layer are as follows the first one that
we have is Network virtual terminal
basically it enables a user to log onto
a remote host allowing interaction with
remote system as if it will local now
let us discuss about the functions of
the application layer the first one that
we have all over here is Network virtual
terminal it basically enables a user to
log onto a remote host allowing it for
interaction with the remote system as if
it were local next you get a file
transfer access and management ft this
basically provides capabilities to
access retrieve and manage files on a
remote host it enables operations like
file transfers and remote file
management and finally you have the mail
services basically this layer handles
email communication by providing
services for sending receiving and
managing email messages so Guys these
were some of the applications of
application layer so for example you
have applications like web browser Skype
messenger and email clients which
operate at the application layer the
application layer is also referred to as
a desktop layer so common protocols
includes SMTP simple mail transfer for
email services and there are many more
protocols which are available at this
layer now let us take a recap on how
data travels actually through the OSI
model so guys something like this the
first step is sending the data from
sender to the receiver to at the
application layer the sender suppose
Alex writes an email using his email
application like G email then the email
application formats and encrypts the
email content which is happening at the
presentation layer then the data will
move to the session layer where a
connection is established between Alex
and his friend device then you have the
transport layer where the email is
broken into segments with error checking
added then the data moves to a network
layer where each segment is packed into
packets and routed through the internet
using IP addresses then the data finally
moves to the dat link layer where the
packets are framed for local network
transmission and error is checked and
finally to the physical layer where
frames are converted into signals and
transmitted over the network like
through an ethernet cable or Wi-Fi now
let us take a look at the receiving data
from receiver back to the sender so at
the physical layer Jam's device or his
friend's device receives signals and
converts them back into the frame then
at the data link layer the frames are
unwrapped to extract packets and error
detection is performed then the data
moves up to the network layer where the
packets are reassembled into segments
and directed into the J's email server
then the packet moves to the transport
layer where the segments are reassembled
into original email and error checking
is completed moving ahead the data moves
up to the session layer where session
connection is maintained and managed
then finally the data moves to the
presentation layer where the email
content is decrypted and formatted and
at the application layer Jim's email
ation displays the received email so
guys East leer plays a very crucial role
in ensuring that data is transmitted
efficiently and accurately across the
network so guys basically the OSI model
provides a clear and structured approach
to understand the network communication
facilitating interoperability between
different systems and Technologies it
helps in troubleshooting network issues
by isolating problems to specific layers
and also allows for development of
modular and scalable Network
Technologies so guys this was all for
