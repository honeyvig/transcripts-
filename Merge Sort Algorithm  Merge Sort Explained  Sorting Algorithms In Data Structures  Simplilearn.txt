hey everyone welcome to simply launch
youtube channel in this session we will
learn about merge sort in data
structures
now let us quickly look into the agenda
for today's session
we will first begin with understanding
what exactly is divide and conquer
algorithm next we will try to define the
merge sort algorithm after that we will
understand the working of merge sort
algorithm later we will learn the pseudo
code of merge sort algorithm after that
we will understand the complexities of
merge sort algorithm
next we will see some of the real-time
applications of merchant algorithm and
finally we will wind up the session by
understanding some of the important
drawbacks of merge sort algorithm but
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you are a tech geek
in a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn so without further ado
let's get started with our first topic
that is what exactly is divide and
conquer algorithm
a divide and conquer algorithm
iteratively divides a problem into two
or more sub problems of the same or
relative type until
they are simple enough to be solved
directly the sub problem solutions are
then integrated to solve the original
problem
there are three steps involved in the
divide and conquer principle that is
divide
conquer and combine the first step is to
divide the significant problem into
smaller sub problems
the second phase is to conquer the
solutions to all divided sub problems
then the final step is to combine and
merge all of the solutions to create a
definite solution
we will understand this by an example
right here on my screen
suppose we have a large problem we can
use divide and conquer technique to
divide it into n number of sub problems
such as problem 1 problem 2 problem 3
problem 4 and so on until we reach the
problem n
then we conquer all the solutions to the
specified sub problems as solution 1 2 3
4 and so on and finally we match all the
solutions to get one definitive solution
now that was divide and conquer
algorithm followed by that let us get
into merge sort algorithm
so merge sort is one of the most
efficient sorting algorithms it is based
on divide and conquer strategy merge
sort continuously divides a list into
numerous sub-list until each sub-list
contains only one entry then merges all
those sub-list into a sorted list
there are four elements on my screen
we have seven and three in the left half
and five and two in the right half after
dividing the four elements in half we
combined all the items in ascending
order that is two 3 5 and 7.
in the next segment we are going to
understand how it happened and we are
going to learn the working procedure of
merge sort algorithm
there are two approaches to implement
the merge sort algorithm the first
method is top-down approach and the
second method is bottoms-up approach the
first method that is the top-down
approach implies that it begins with the
large picture from then it's broken into
smaller chunks
now the second method that is the
bottom-up technique which starts with a
specific number of jobs and works its
way up to the general
let's have a look at how to implement
the merchant algorithm using top down
approach the top down merge sort
approach is the methodology that uses a
recursion mechanism it starts at the top
and proceeds downwards splitting the
array into two halves making a recursive
call and merging the results until one
gets to the bottom of the array for a
better understanding of the top down
approach method
consider the following scenario right
here on my screen we have an example of
an array of size 6 consisting of
elements 7 3 9 5 6 and 4 starting with 0
and ending with 5.
using the following formula we'll divide
the array by its middle that is middle
is equals to left plus right divided by
2.
we have three elements on the left and
three elements on the right near the
middle so according to the drop down
strategy we divide the given array in
half resulting in three elements that is
7 3 and 9 on the left and 5 6 and 4 on
the right next we sort all these
elements in ascending order by doing so
the first half will be 3 7 and 9 and the
right half will be 4 5 and 6 and after
merging all of them we will have the
sorted array that is 3 4 5 6 and 9.
next we will understand the bottom sub
approach
an iterative process is used in bottoms
up merge sort approach it starts with a
single element array and then joins two
neighboring items while also sorting
them the combined sorted arrays are
combined and sorted again only until one
single unit of the sorted array elements
remains
now let us look at an example right here
on my screen in the first iteration we
will merge pairs of array sizes by one
sorting each of the two elements when
you iterate the array by size one the
elements seven and three become three
and seven similarly nine and five become
five and nine and finally six and four
become four and six
we will merge the pairs of array size by
2 in the next iteration with the bottoms
up method as a result the elements 3 7
and 5 will become 3 5 and 7 and the same
way 9 4 and 6 will become 4 6 and 9.
in the last iteration merge pairs of
array size by 3 so that after sorting 3
5 7 4 6 and 9 becomes 3 4 5 6 and 7 as
sorted arrays
after understanding the working
procedure of merge sort algorithm we
will now see the pseudo code of merge
sort algorithm
we have a function called merge sort in
this pseudo code and parameter of the
function contains an array named as
array and two variables named as left
and right
if the number of elements in the left is
greater than the number of elements on
the right we will get a middle using
formula left plus right divided by 2 the
merge sort is called and this function
now has an array a left variable and
right variable by calling merge sort we
have array left as middle plus
one and right variable and finally by
calling merge sort we have left middle
and right variables in our upcoming
segment we will implement the merge sort
method in a practical demonstration
in the next section we will discuss the
complexity of merge sort algorithm
first we will look into the time
complexity of merge sort algorithm as we
all know time complexity in data
structures is divided into best case
average case and worst case the best
case of merced algorithm is big o of n
into log n average case of merced
algorithm is big o of n into log n and
the worst case of merge sort algorithm
is big o of n into log n
the number of elements being sorted is
given by n merge sorts time complexity
is big o of n star log n in all three
situations that has first average and
best because it always divides the array
into two halves and merges the two
halves in linear time
it takes up the same amount of space as
the unsorted array as a result it is not
a good idea to use it to search big
unsorted arrays moving on to the space
complexity of the merced algorithm the
space complexity of the merge sort
algorithm is large o of n
in the merced algorithm we store the
left and right parts of the merged array
in the temporary arrays and then utilize
the original array to keep the entire
merged array in the worst case scenario
the left and the right sub arrays will
each be n by 2 in size and then the
total auxiliary space will be big o of n
resulting in a space complexity of big o
of n
following that we will look into several
applications of the merge sort algorithm
so the first application is merge sort
is an efficient way to sort linked list
in big o of n log n time
subsequent application of the merced
algorithm is for linked list
merge sort implemented without taking up
more space followed by that the mozart
method is used to count the number of
inversions in a list
last application states that in internal
sorting the merge sort is employed
now let us look into some of the
drawbacks of merge sort algorithm
so some of the drawbacks of merchant
algorithm are for smaller assignments
merge sort algorithm is slower than the
other sorting algorithms for temporary
array the merge sort technique requires
an additional memory space that is space
of big o of n
now let us look into a practical
demonstration of merge sort algorithm on
my screen we have an example for merge
sort
algorithm to define constants or micro
substitution we use the hash defined as
preprocessor directive with a constant
variable max of 10. following that two
arrays array 1 and array 2 are declared
we declare array 1 and initialize it
with elements like 8 4
7
6
2
3
5
9 10
4 and 1.
array 2 is used for temporary array then
to implement the merge sort concept we
declare a merge sort function we specify
three variables in this function
parameter that is left right and middle
the left variable is used to display the
left part of the array1 the right
variable is used to display the right
part of the array1 and middle variable
is used to indicate the middle or center
of the array in this function
we utilize the for loop in this function
setting the left 2 level 1 the middle
plus 1 to level 2 and the left to
variable i with the condition that level
2 is less than or equal to the middle
and level 2 should be less than or equal
to the right of the array we have a
condition in this for loop that if level
1 of array 1 is less than or equal to
level 2 of array 1 we will initialize
all the consecutive elements of level 1
of array 1 to array 2. else we will
initialize all the successive elements
of level 2 of array 1 to array 2.
out of for loop all subsequent elements
of level 1 of array 1 will be
initialized to array 2 until level 1 is
less than or equal to the middle all
successive elements of level 2 of array
1 will be initialized to array 2 until
level 2 is less than or equal to the
right of the array
using the loop which will run from i
equal to the left of i is less than or
equal to right we initialize all the
items of array 2 to array 1. we have
declared one more function in this code
namely sorting out of the merging sort
function in which only the left and
right variables are defined we specified
the middle function in the sorting
function with the condition that if the
left is less than the right the middle
will be calculated as left plus right
divided by 2. then we called a sorting
function passing left as middle as right
and then another sorting function
passing left as middle plus 1 and right
finally we use the merge sort function
passing left middle and right to the
sorting array 1 otherwise we would
return nothing
we entered the main function out of the
sorting function where we declared the
counter variable i and printed the array
before sorting using the printf function
in for loop
where i will run from index 0 to the
array's maximum size after that we
invoked sorting method
passing left as 0 index number and write
as the iris maximum value finally after
doing the merge sort process we will
print the array using the printf
function and for loop
we will run
from 0 to the array's maximum value then
we compile the program and run it
now let's try to quickly execute this
program and see the output
so there you go the program got
successfully executed and the list
before sorting is 8 7 6 2 3 5 9 10 4 and
1 and the list after sorting is 1 2 3 4
4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10.
and with that we have come to an end of
