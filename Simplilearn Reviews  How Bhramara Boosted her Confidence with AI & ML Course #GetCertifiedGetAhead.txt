I was a typical first rank student
always listening to teachers when I was
in seventh or eighth grade While others
were saying that they wanted to be
astronauts police officers I knew that I
would get into a typical 95 job but I
couldn't perform really well in my J
exam and that uh really hurt me uh my
parents were very supportive even though
I didn't score well they motivated me to
work hard without expecting immediate
success during intermediate uh while
other students used to copy and get high
scores uh a few friends of mine and I
were very particular about doing it on
our own I believe that hard work should
be a part of your routine just like
sleep
food post completion of the professional
certificate program in generative Ai and
machine learning my fear is reduced uh I
realized that uh Ai and ml is not as
daun as I once
thought hi my name is bramar poab batuni
I'm from Hyderabad and uh I have
recently completed my btech in U
artificial intelligence and machine
learning in malari engineering College
Hyderabad recently I have been placed at
a centure during the campus
placements I really really worked hard
during my intermediate but uh I couldn't
really get a good result in my G for 2
years I gave all of my time I had no
interest no passion no Hobbies it was
entirely fixed upon that goal so I never
really gave myself the freedom to
understand or to know what interests me
or what I'm passionate
about during the time of my major
project I realized that my skills and my
foundation in AIML wasn't really up to
the mark because we had very less time
to cover such topics such vast subjects
it was always on a hurry mode and then
uh during recession we have seen that
placements are really nil and uh I
realized that recession can happen at
any time we need to be the best of the
best so that is why I have chosen uh
simply learn professional certification
course in generative Ai and machine
learning uh with the course I came to
know that this is not a
complicated as I thought to
be I heard about simply learn through a
friend of mine who has also done a
similar course uh in generative Ai and
machine learning in IIT khur and uh when
I have gone to the industry projects uh
I found them really good uh good topics
were covered in it the course was very
helpful to me all the basic topics were
explained including the hard topics in
the electives I think the best part
about all of this is the trainers they
have been really patient I have seen
some other students in my cohort asking
the same questions repeatedly but uh
still every single time the trainers
were very patient and they have
dedicated their time and
efforts post completion of the
generative AI in machine learning
certification program uh my fear has
reduced I have realized that uh this
subjects are not as daunting as they
seem to be I have gained a clear
understanding of the
concepts uh my mother and my father they
have always motivated me they have
supported me uh we always talked about
hard work not the success part I don't
think I am successful yet but I believe
my logical thinking skills and my hard
work and perseverance will definitely
help me to succeed on day life okay
