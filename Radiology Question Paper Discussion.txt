hi everyone this is dr. Mallory from
team envyus canta I think everyone has
given exams today
and few questions in the paper are
tricky and lengthy and which are based
on diagnosis so today we'll discuss on
the radiology questions in a space paper
going into the question in this question
it is given as the condylar head as a
typical toadstool appearance with marked
flattening and apparent elongation of
the articulating condylar surface and
there is also a inclination of condylar
neck so you have to see this question is
completely based on radiological
diagnosis here it is given as a typical
toadstool appearance you can see in the
picture this is a toadstool appearance
with flattening flattening and
elongation of the articulating surface
so this is flattening and the
articulating surface is elongated and
also there is a posterior inclination of
the corner
so all these radiological features give
the diagnosis of a disease that is a TMJ
disease it is called it is known as a
juvenile are through arthrosis that is
juvenile arthrosis and this is the
common name used for this TMJ disorder
so in this question the options given
osteoarthritis borings arthrosis
psoriatic arthritis or septic arthritis
so this juvenile arthrosis is nothing
but a this borings arthrosis and he is
the person who gave the term juvenile
our process and other names of this
juvenile our process includes condyle
Isis or arthrosis D formance
so if any one of the option from these
three things you can pick the x list but
most commonly the it was called as a
juvenile arthrosis
but to give in a tricky way we have
given that other synonym of this
juvenile arthrosis
and here this juvenile arthrosis that it
is nothing but a corner growth
disturbance mostly occurs in the female
mostly occurs in females
maybe vanity illogical factories
hormonal imbalance then if you go into
this question is a statement based
question here it is given as high linear
energy transfer radiations concentrate
their ionization along the longer path
whereas second statement is given as
this the greater the physical size of
the particle higher its charge and lower
its velocity and greater is its ality
so what is this led led is nothing but a
linear energy transfer you can see here
the name indicates transfer na is
nothing but a rate of loss of energy so
this rate of loss of energy is called as
a the linear energy transfer in first
statement I caught this option of this
question is d that is the first
statement is false where a second
statement is true so if you go into the
first statement it has given high linear
energy transfer radiations will do along
the longer path but it is wrong this
high linear energy if there is a high
linear energy they will rapidly produce
iron pairs so that they will concentrate
their ionization along is shorter path
that is if they have a high linear
energy transfer they will rapidly
produce the ion pairs and they will
concentrate their ionization only in
along the shorter path that is that
energy is last frequently or completely
within a short period of time
but if there is a low energy low linear
energy transfer this ion pairs are
produced spacely that means slowly hence
that ionization will go along a longer
path so hence the first statement is
false if you go into the second
statement greater the physical size of
the particle yes if the size is large
the size is large then charge is also
large but as it is a heavy atom or a
molecule it cannot move fastly hence the
velocity is low so the statement is
correct and this all are related to
crater le T so le T is directly
proportional to size and charge whereas
University proportional to velocity so a
particle with a large size have a high
charge with low velocity will have a
greater led so molecules are a particles
with high lead I mean large size is
alpha particles that is they have le T
greater well as lo le t e is for beta
particles so here the question given is
hypoxic conditions are whether they are
radio sensitive whether they are radio
resistant or not to be constant he or
the option can be chose this they are
more radio resistance why because see in
generally the radiation will induce
ionization so this ionization will cause
free radical production which in turn
leads to DNA damage so firth is DNA
damage oxygen is required how because if
oxygen is more electron affinity kyoool
that means this oxygen will come and
bind to the free radicals produced
during ionization and they cause
permanent damage of DNA but if oxygen is
absent then that DNA is
hence the condition becomes radio
resistance that means cells cannot be
killed
hence hypoxic conditions are more
Rayleigh or resistant when you go into
this question no x-rays are generated
you can see in this diagram and this
node x-rays are generated during inverse
voltage so this inverse during this
inverse voltage that is during the heat
cycle there will be a half of the cycle
where filament will become positive and
target becomes negative that is opposite
to the normal x-ray emission so here the
filament becomes positive and target
becomes negative and the therefore no
electrons passage from the during the
cycle if no electrons pass then there is
no x-ray production no x-ray production
so during inverse voltage it is also
called as a reverse bias so during this
there is no production of x-rays
so steps in analog to digital conversion
this is nothing but the process this
analog to digital conversion is a
process for formation of digital image
so this analog to digital conversion
will have two steps that is sampling I
quantisation sampling here the sampling
is nothing but all all the voltage
values or grouped together values are
grouped together so it is a sampling I
mean grouping whereas quantization all
this sampled data a value is a saint's
value is assigned during the
quantization so there's two steps in the
process of conversion of formation of a
digital image that is analog to digital
conversion is sampling and quantization
this is a artifact image so the question
was distortion of metal structures as a
result of differential absorption so it
is coffee artifact so this cupping
artifact is due to being hardening beam
hardening in beam hardening lower energy
photons are observed so this beam
hardening is a type of artifact where
lower energy photons are absurd and
again this beam hardening is divided
into two types of artifacts cutting
artifact
whereas extinction or a missing artifact
so this capping artifact is due to the
distortion of the metal structures as a
result of differential absorption
whereas this extinction are missing
artifact is because of I mean streaks or
a dark lines are formed when the object
is present between two dense object so
dark lines are sticks are formed when
present between two dense objects it is
the extensional missing artifact these
can be seen in CB CD the coronal CT
imaging shows trapdoor appearance this
is an easy or a direct cushion here this
is a coronal CT you
here you can see in the orbital floor
fractures that the machine is trapped
between the fracture line hence it
appears as a trapdoor appearance and is
a feature you can see in the orbital
roller a blowout fracture transducer in
an ultrasound machine access so this is
their line diagram I mean internal
structure of the transducer the main
component of the transducer transducer
is nothing but a probe which is used
during the USG that is ultrasonographic
examination so this transducer consists
of piezoelectric crystals are elements
which are mainly useful further
transmission and receive receiving of
eCos and this piezoelectric elements are
mainly made up of quads then here this
because of this piezoelectric crystals
it can transmit the sound and it can
receive the sound so hence the
transducer in ultrasone mention access
both transmitter and receiver and here
you can see the pictures of transducers
various transducers this is a
curvilinear transducer it works at three
to five megahertz whereas this is a
linear trow it works at seven to five
megahertz
it is a transvaginal probe or a
transducer used at six to five megahertz
is a small curvilinear transducer used
at five megahertz and in our extra oral
imaging will mainly use this linear
transducer this is this question is type
of diagnosis and the pathology waves you
can see you're a middle-aged person
complaint of pain in the mandible
reveals a very small regular distinct
radiolucent deletions and bands Jones
protein test is positive so the most
probable diagnosis is so this pain in
the mandible
is of a clinical feature radiolucent
lesions is of a radiographic feature and
bands Jones protein test is positive is
of a pathology
test future so if you interlink all
three these three things these are
combined and can be seen in a person who
is suffering for their multiple myeloma
even is know fairly granuloma or a
metastatic carcinoma will have a
radiolucent lesions and distinct
radiolucent lesions and patients will
have a pain but you can relate with this
pathology test where a band's own
protein test is positive so you can
directly select the option multiple
myeloma so an increase in the parry
coronel radiolucency associated with an
adapted maxillary canine is the
diagnostic of so if you go into the
options there are options given our a
vote e
complex or dénouement component i don't
own this you have to see that question
was presented with a pari coronel
radiolucency even in complex and
compound or intones there will be
impaction of the teeth or that odin
tones will hinder the development of the
teeth but they will not present as a
very coronal radiolucency
only and this is among these options a
volte is present as a peri coronal
radiolucency and the one more option
given hint given is unadapted Manzanera
can I so it mostly occurs in two-thirds
of cases it occurs in it associated with
an elliptic Manzarek in it so you can
directly select the answer a booty and
here the list of peri coronal radio
licenses that is Peri coronal or a
follicular phase then dizzy resist unis
a sticker mural ameloblastoma
adenomatoid on under zanuck tumor
ameloblastoma calcifying or endure sonic
tumor or sis Emilia plastic file DOMA
this is the list of peri coronal radio
nuisances parry apical cemented
dysplasia
occurs a topical areas of non-vital
teeth or a apical areas of central
incisors tend to enlarge symmetrically
always surrounded by a well-coordinated
model
margin if you go into the periapical
semental dysplasia into it mostly i mean
it mostly not it always present at the
effects of vital incisors and mostly
seen in female patients that is Middle
East
so this non-vital option is not that
right here the vital center in sizes you
can see and he in the last option they
gave that are always surrounded by a
well-coordinated
margin but if you go into the radio
graphic features there are of three
stages first one is early stage second
one is mixed stage third one is last
days which is maturation stage so in the
first early stage the radiographic
appearances loosened in the apical
region where in the mixed stage a radio
obesity is present in the center of the
radiolucent area and you go into the
maturation is the complete Rayleigh
opacity can be seen at that apical
region so if you go under this is wrong
and this is not and they will not and
not symmetrically so the option can be
taken as apical areas of the vital
central incisor most common thing are in
sizes here which radiographic view best
displays the PACU lingual displacement
of a mandibular fracture if you go into
this thing but the question itself says
that buccal lingual so buckling well
thing can be seen mostly on occlusion
radiographs only so in Perryville apical
view and PA view we will see whether a
anterior or posterior for a inferior and
superior position but buccal lingual
position cannot be seen in this Perea
Pikul view and p.m. animal so the two
options left ur topographic view of the
mandible through occlusion both are
occlusal only so topographic is nothing
but a anterior view that is canine
okay nine whereas true occlusal is a
cross-sectional view so cross-sectional
view is also called as a true occlusal
view so in this cross sectional view we
can see their buckling wall displacement
very clearly so to select the option
option is through a fusion V of mandible
which of the statements is incorrect you
have to read properly that is incorrect
regarding the fractures so this is
regarding the radiographic features of
the fractures so there are four type of
features the first one is the fracture
may present as a radiolucent line or it
can be present as a change in change in
occlusal plane or it can be seen as a
step type defect and the last one is it
may be present as a radio-opaque because
of the overlapping of two fragments so
these are the two four features of
fractures can be seen radiographically
so you can be seen as a radiolucent line
between the fragments yes radial is
inclined is correct are seen as a
radiopaque area in overriding fractures
as during overlapping the present as I
repeat and seen like a step deformity
else but inferior Dender can always
continuous in all types of fractures of
the mandible may be in very complex
fractures it is discontinuous hence the
option C is incorrect regarding the
fractures aid and assist in maxillary
antrum appears as and here by seeing the
cyst you will be select like a
radiolucent lesion but you have to know
that is in Antrim in Antrim it appears
as a radio Opie
think radiopaque appearance can be seen
for a than the cysts in the antrum this
is an even the internal structure of the
cyst is homogeneous radio P when related
to the air sinuses and even sometimes
you can see a multilocular appearance
and within that multilocular appearance
you can see sometimes in dystrophy
calcification and the radio opacity
sometimes may mimic the bone because
extreme contrast to the radiolucent area
within the sinus y-you have to know that
radio opacity sometimes mimicked the
bone because extreme contrast to the
radiolucent air within the sinus so the
option to be selected is opacity of the
effective and here this is a clinical
scenario which is of all radiographic
and this thing clinical a sixteen year
old man reported with the chief
complaint of bad breath mobile teeth
since two months Unferth er questioning
about medical history patients reveal
pain in bones since two to three months
painless daily nature localized
intermittent aggravated and moment and
relieved on taking medication intraoral
examination revealed chronic generalized
gingivitis mobility in relation to 3 1 3
2 4 1 and photo
the patient was subjected for
radiographic investigation PA skull and
later skull which revealed multiple
punched out radio licenses if we go into
the previous question a question was
given with a two lines that is with a
pathological combination radiography
combination and a clinical that's but
that is it a direct question where you
can choose the option multiple myeloma
see you can see there are difference
between the two questions here also bad
breath mobile teeth and paint up jaws or
bones with generalized anxiety or the
movement of the teeth and the
radiographic features revealed multiple
punched out radio nuisances so all these
features of a multiple myeloma but in
the
they have given us associated with
proliferation so this is regarding into
the pathology that is multiple myeloma
is because of the proliferation of
plasma cells so you have to interlink
here like radiology pathology medicine
and even the general pathology so this
option can be selected as plasma cells
silo graphic appearance of the parotid
gland in jagran syndrome is described as
cherry blossom like because here this is
a cherry blossom light appearance and
the Joplin Syndrome you can see
weakening of the epithelium so this
weakening of the epithelium will allows
all the contrast medium outside so there
is pooling of contrast medium outside
the duct or outside the gland so here
there will be a formation of punctate
cavitate defects and this is given in
the textbook which is a direct line and
this big before the development of this
punctate carrot a tree defects there are
few I mean pooling of this contrast
agent can be grouped into punctate which
is less than 1mm globular which is 1 to
2 mm and other thing is as the disease
progress this will be of irregular and
there will be of cavitary they will be
greater than 2mm so these are the stage
is almost the stages of Selig Rafi how
the contrast agent is pooled outside
they are called as select asses so in
punctate select asses the it is less
than 1 mm I mean the contrast agent can
be seen whereas in globular it is 1 to 2
mm cavitary it is greater than 2 mm so
it is because of punctate character Tori
defects in the ducts characteristic
features of odontogenic mixing
here it is also a combination of
pathology and radiology and then options
all the things two things can be given
as like pathology tendency of local
invasion you can see in this question
all the features except tendency of
metastasis asymptomatic joy expansion
multilocular honeycomb so it will have a
local invasion but distant metastasis is
not present as it is not a malignant one
and there is a symptomatic joy expansion
and even you can see a multilocular or a
honeycomb appearance in eroded or
endogenous Maxima in vascular lesions
magnetic resonance angiography is
helpful for in identifying you can see
it is a fusion imaging where MRI plus
angiography is taken so in M by with the
help of MRI you can see the size of the
lesion and extension of the lesion where
as vessels involved can be seen with the
help of angiography helps with mr
angiography or magnetic resonance
angiography you can see the size of the
lesion extent of the lesion and vessels
involved in an inflammatory stacking on
the lateral aspect of the third molar
with an Associated history of 30
cornetist
you have to note here the important
thing is with the history of purikura
nightís and all the other two things
I mean ameloblastoma and sometimes OKC
is also associated with unadapted teeth
but for purikura nighties there is a
syscall as parrot and insist you can see
here it is an inflammatory cyst occurs
in the lateral aspect of the third mula
within history of purikura nightís so i
aspera cornet is present mostly seen in
the anger age group and associated third
molar and buccal surface or even it
covers the bifurcation also if you go
into the radiographic features it has a
well demarcated radiolucency and distal
to the partial erupted to these are the
important points to be noted for the
para dental cyst but you have more
important thing is there will be of
intact
periodontal space it reveals that that
lesion is not originated from the epochs
so this is lengthy question but this is
a statement likely if neither in the
radiation field and dose is greater than
5000 rail rats but I don't really mean
all teeth and teeth with peri a
loosens it should be extracted so here
the direct single thing is he's asking
when the teeth to be extracted before
the radiotherapy it is nothing but we
have to extract the feet two weeks
before the radiation therapy begins if
we are using a 5000 rat and even for
that I mean like conservation purpose or
a prophylactic purpose and to prevent
the post radiation we can use a
customized fluoride trace with a 0.4%
stan is fluoride it will prevent the
radiation caries and the patient has to
be called for a period of two to three
month recall after the radiation therapy
when evaluating the interaural barrier
Pikul films with structure have a
improved sharpness so this is also a
statement direct statement the include
sharpness will be seen for the lingual
surfaces on a farrier Pikul fillings
this is question is from dosimetry so
those equivalent is expressed in their
terms of so equal dose equivalent is
nothing but equal and those which will
give the biological effectiveness of
radiation so it is measured in the terms
of Seward's see what is a SI unit
traditionally sir and when you go into
the conversion one see what is equal to
hundred gram and this whole box is
important for the toe symmetry and they
can ask the definitions they can ask the
unit's traditional units or a conversion
of the units which of the following
focuses the electrons into a narrow beam
and direct the beam across the tube
towards a tungsten target of the anode
so this is the tungsten target of the
anode and this is the molybdenum cup and
this is a filament so here they asked
which of the following focuses the
electrons so this molybdenum
we'll focus the electrons towards the
tungsten iron rod whereas the filament
will release the electrons so you have
to read the question carefully focuses
his cup cup focuses the electrons
towards the anode whereas the filament
will release the electrons reverse bias
in our view is to demonstrate and it is
a direct question which is given Lehrer
climb it is given the textbook and this
reverse basilar view is mainly used for
examination of beep parotid gland a
method of obtaining a digital image for
sensor captures the image and
immediately transfers it to a computer
is termed as direct digital imaging so
here you you may be confused with
indirect or direct digital imaging so
here this is a method a digital image if
sensor will capture the image directly
so that sensor as sensor is capturing
the image directly it is a direct
digital imaging what happens in indirect
in Italy imaging that digital image
which is present already is converted
with the help of CCD hence it is the
indirect digital imaging and storage
phosphor will use them
PSP plates so your sensor is directly
capturing the image it is direct digital
imaging this is also a direct definition
hot filament of a tungsten emit
electrons at a rate proportional to the
temperature of film and this process is
called as a thermo ionic emission these
are the color coding for reneik CP
holders for fighting it will use red the
question is given for biting for
fighting it is red for anterior it is
blue color for posterior it is you know
a specialized radiographic technique
which is an electrostatic process
similar to the top used for xeroxing so
in this question the director technique
was not given here the definition was
given that is electrostatic process
similar to that of xeroxing it is
nothing but a zero radiography and this
zero radiography has advantages that is
it has high contrast the image will have
high latitude it will have good detail
and a high-end enhancement so the
correct option is good detail and this
zero radiography used for the lateral
self
TMJ problems mostly which of the
following do not have a sunray
appearance so some reappearance you can
see in osteogenic sarcoma neuroblastoma
and condos are combat osteo lytic
sarcoma you cannot see a sunray of
appearance it is mostly you can see of
lytic so you can see a mostly
destruction while taking IO PA
radiographs of the maxillary first molar
to avoid superimposition of zygomatic
arch the x-ray tube should be angulated
so this is the modification for the
normal technique here will place the
cone mesial and this vertical angulation
vertical angulation should be decreased
and we have to place more miss really
such that this super zygomatic arch will
not superimpose over the man's very
first manner if you see in normal
radiographs the top isis of molars will
have some time zygomatic arch but if you
place the cone museum with decrease in
vertical angulation that super lean
position can be avoided l NT dos
relationship gives it direct relation
with it and this is also a direct
question where you can see that Ln T is
nt
relationship Gilda radiation and cancer
Genesis LNT is nothing but a linear non
threshold hypothesis linear non
threshold hypothesis this will give the
relationship between the dose and risk
of inducing a new cancer which of the
structures hinders in the imaging of
groups of minds very molars that is
zygoma zygomatic process of Mansilla
in this you can see the zygomatic
process of minds in LA which hinders
with the roots of maxillary molars and
here you can see the inferior border of
the Zhai home also and this this thing
also zygomatic process of Missoula so
for the mind Sarah Mullins I commands I
go Matic process will hinder the app
Isis what is the role of potassium
bromide and benzo triazole in the
developer they both acts as a restrain
restrain er means it prevents developer
from developing unexposed silver halide
crystals so this is the definition of
restrainer which is potassium bromide
and when you try ozone which are present
in the developer which are advantages of
bisecting technique increased accuracy
simplicity and short exposure time here
the simplicity of the technique and
short exposure time are the only two
things which has advantages of bisecting
technique there is no increase tactic
accuracy
instead there is a distortion because in
bisecting angle technique will use a
short PID so we have to select the
options of two in3 the
to see an instrument that is used to
help the dental radiographer for
stabilizing a receptor in the mouth so
for stabilizing the receptor in the
malta instrument use this receptor
holder then what is beam alignment
device beam alignment device used to
position PID in relation to tooth i'm
receptor that is here that helps to
position position indicating device in
relation to tooth and receptor whereas
collimating device as think you people
know it is used to further restrict the
size of x-ray beam x-ray beam size so
the option is receptor holder apex of
Mines Larry sinus is formed by this apex
is formed by zygomatic process of
Mozilla whereas here you can see the
floor of the arm which forms the roof of
the maxillary sinus it forms the roof
where it forms the APICS a radiograph of
mandibular anterior teeth in patient
reveals radial lucency at the biases of
right and later central incisor nor is
options and cavities are present there
is no pain pulse are whiter and here the
answer lies everything in this single
sentence even though that is a very
lengthy question the polyps are white
and if you go into the options very
apical granuloma radicular cyst chronic
abscess here
polyps or non-vital whereas the
remaining option only thing is cimento
blastoma where the pulps are vital and
here this cement of last OMA mostly
named as a true cement tumor is also
called as a true cement OMA
so with this thing
polyps are white you can take I mean
select the option as a true cement OMA
or a cement elastomer at what
calcification electrons are emitted this
is a direct question at 70 kv p the K
shell electrons are emitted bisecting
angle technique this is also a direct
question this bisecting annual technique
is the based on a principle called as
the rule of isometry it is also called
as she's in skis rule where it states
that if two triangles are equal when
they share one complete side they have
two equal angles so this is the rule of
isometry when two triangles are equal
they share one complete size then they
have a two equal angle so this is a rule
of Phi symmetry or season skis Rule
we're bisecting angle technique is based
on ghost evasion OPG occurs when there
is a image of dense object within the
path of a being but out of the focal top
so that ghost image forms well out of
the focal trough and Barda then in part
of victor our object is within the pot
path of the beam there are other
characteristics for the ghost image
first is it has the same shape when
related with the counterpart that is
wanker related with the real image it
will have a same shape then it appears
opposite side of the real image it
appears higher when compared with the
real image more blurred when compared
with the real image
vertical actually there are two
components of the image vertical and
horizontal component but vertical
component is more blurred and always
larger here were armed is larger so more
blurred than the horizontal component
and always larger than compared with the
counterpart vertical component a gentle
depression in the maxilla near the apex
of lateral incisor
is referred to as lateral Forza but the
even the lateral force is also called as
a in sissu fossa hence then option would
be selected as d so in this picture you
can see the lateral fossa which appear
as a diffuse radial lucency in the
region of a pixel a terrain is incisor
and formed by the deep it is because of
the depression of Maggie laughs
radiography is of no use in the
diagnosis of you can easily select in
you have to remember that in acute cases
mostly there are no radiographic
findings to see the radiographic
finding that there should be that lesion
should be turned into a chronic or at
least 40 percent to 30 percent to 40
percent of demonization should take this
so in this thing
acute abscess will do not show any
radiographic findings so there is no use
of taking radiograph is a no use in
diagnosis of acute abscess x-rays cause
radiation damage primarily by their
property colours ionization so the
process of forming a a one pair is
called as ionization so this because of
this ionization effect only there will
be DNA damage here it is a application
question a patient with a unilateral
parotid swelling shows clinical
presentation of swelling redness
tenderness and vanish so you have to
know that tenderness redness malaise
everything
commander throwed Rommel symptoms so
this promise indents mainly we will see
further acute cases and enlarged radio
regional lymph nodes which of the
following radio from is not advised so
if some people may have selected parotid
swelling they have selected cell ography
but Selig Rafi I mean I mean other thing
because silo graph is not advised here
because by reading the question you can
see that patient in a acute stage so the
contraindication of sila graphic
processor is in acute infection or
inflammation
you should not select cell ography
because it may damage the parenchyma of
the clan you can do multi detector CT or
you can do us here you can do MRI in
acute conditions but you should not do
that Selig Rafi it is a contraindication
for scientific procedure for a bitewing
x-ray angulation the cone should be ten
degrees above horizontal why because to
prevent the overlapping we will make ten
degrees above horizontal the pools of
contrast agent in celebrity of
autoimmune disorder which are irregular
in shape so we have seen earlier that
our three there are three state states
like font eight Googler and cavitary
that cavatelli select asses will have a
greater than 2mm I mean that dimensions
will be of greater than 2mm contrast
agent so the option is teeth this is a
clinical scenario base question a
patient with a previous history of
sarcoidosis complaints of paintings in
the lower right back to three Asian on
examination you have seen roots terms in
the region of four eight three eight one
eight two eight and two five so as many
teeth are in wall and a they are very
roof like roots terms you'll advise the
patient to go for the OPG so on OPG you
have seen calcifications with near the
ramus cauliflower like a
and these are type of which
calcifications and you have to know that
sarcoidosis previous history sarcoidosis
a granulomatous chronic granulomatous
disorder and the so this calcifications
are of soft-tissue calcifications which
are present behind the ramus which and
they are like cauliflower like a fear
and cauliflower like appearance and
behind the ramus is the position for the
lymph node so that lymph nodes are
calcified and incidentally you have seen
that lymph node calcifications in opt so
what are the the lymph node
calcifications are a type of dystrophic
calcification so this is indirect so you
have to know what is the type of soft
education and how the and what it which
it comes and which classification so it
is a lymph node is a dystrophy
calcification these are the list of Cal
soft tissue calcifications there may be
a dystrophy idiopathic or a metastatic
dystrophic may be calcified lymph nodes
or a calcification see other tonsil
cysticercosis arterial calcification or
marker bugs medial calcio cesare a
calcified across coyote clock and you go
into the idiopathic calcification our
common side wall it is idiopathic
flyball with laryngeal cartilage
calcifications
rhino litter and relate these commander
idiopathic calcifications when you go
into the metastatic
ossification of the styloid ligament and
osteoma qts or Myositis ossificans these
are of metastatic calcifications which
image plane passes from bottom of the
eye socket this is eye socket to the top
of the ear this is nothing from outer
canthus to the tragus or a outline of
the top superior most portion of the ear
is nothing but if frankfurt
Frankfurt or a horizontal plane which
projection is best for the examination
of condyle and active
I mean and so transcranial view is
example with best example for the
examination of Cornell and articular
eminence
so in transcranial view we can see later
aspect of the glenoid fossa articular
eminence joint space and corner head
this is the list of radiographs which
are used for the TMJ and in each view a
different structures of TMJ can be
examined so this is very important and
you can note down this more sensitive
face in the cell division - radiation is
so if you go into the order of
sensitivity MFA's is more sensitive when
compared with the g2 phase then g1 phase
then overly as face is more radio
sensitive then late as well so this is
the order of sensitivity from more to
least radio sensitive so option more
sense doing this is g2 phase an area of
high attenuation in this question itself
it was Hyatt ination because of high
dense objects so the options present in
these are metal crown braids and amalgam
restorations are more dense and they
have more high attenuation when compared
with the normal bow and it will stop the
radiation from reaching the receptor so
option you can select this all the ever
which last radio materials appear
equally radiopaque this is a direct line
that is or equally radio peak will be of
gold crowns and amalgam will be of
equally radiopaque on a OPC which
statement describes the relationship of
the receptor receptor means filling to
maxillary and mandibular teeth so in
bitewing technique the mag's the filling
and the man to the missouri and
mandibular teeth and they are parallel
to each other that is the film is placed
here and the tooth will be off like this
so they both are parallel to each other
so we have to select the first option
that is sceptre under teeth
our parallel to each other interrupt the
horizontal angulation results in images
that are overlapped so for horizontal
angulation there is only one fault if
the horizontal angulation is incorrect
then the teeth will be of overlap or the
structures will be overlap you'll get
elongated the images if they're vertical
angulation is too short and you will get
four shorter if it is too much
particular angulation and for horizontal
it is overlapped following anatomical
structures can be visualized in an IO PA
except you can see here you can see the
internal oblique Ridge you can see in
the submandibular for sign even incisive
foramen
but mandibular foramen cannot be seen
and it can be used in the 3d picture or
a CB CD the purpose of flood foil sheet
in the film pocket is so you have to
know where the lead foil sheet is
present so if you take the internal
structure or layers first you'll you
will see the lead foil on the back side
that means backside that is away from
the cone this is because away from cone
and this placement of lead foil from the
away from the cone or backside will
protect the filling from back scattered
radiations the film characteristic that
is amount of radiation needed to produce
the radiograph is standard density so
this is the direct definition for the
stand speed that is amount of radiation
near to produce the radiograph of a
standard density increase in the
exposure time we'll so this exposure
will cause more number of four more name
I mean more number of photon energy or
more number of Hope energy of photons
increased
it causes increase the density of the
film and if in the immensity of the film
increases increases the darkness of the
film so exposure is high then density is
high and image appears darker and this
is a little bit application question
x-ray beam is produced using 70k vp7 MA
and 0.1 is an x-ray beam B is produced
using 70 kvp and there is an increased
MA and even there is an increased in
time that is ma s is increased for beam
B so which of the following statements
is correct option should be chosen as
beam B has a higher number of X's so if
you go into the first option beam a has
higher minerals you know because b b has
higher energy no because energy is
directly related to K V P if you go into
a and B both have 70 K will be so they
have equal energy so both statements are
correct and the maximum energy of x-ray
photons is higher for beam veno energies
we have told 70 K before both so no but
BB has higher number of extra photons
yes because ma s is the quantity of
photons that is number of photons
released so far in BB M is the number of
photons are more hence the option should
be chosen as BB has higher number of
x-ray photons which is the primary
reason to use ultrasonography s imaging
technique and all the this thing options
given over there I mean uses of us rebut
the prime reason using for the USG is a
to differentiate solid masses from the
cystic lesions and if you to map the
ducts of the salivary glands silo gruffy
values for the seeing that dot and - I
mean this space infections
mostly they are not
indicated but you can see and to
determine in the anatomic location and
adjacent saliva very glands we will not
use this us the mostest or the most
selected thing for us you are the
primary reason is to differentiate solid
masses from the cystic masses and this
is a scenario a patient complains of
swelling associated with decayed upper
left molar patient also complains you
see your decayed upper left molar and
also complains of stuffiness especially
when she bends over to pick a myth
anything so here you have to know that
in sinusitis cases the patients may
complains of toothache and also along
with the toothache the patients will
have a tenderness or a stuffiness or
fullness when we ask the patient to ban
fur bend his head so to better option
tooth I mean tools in this caution is
water suppose they have given a
valuation of maxillary sinus area so for
the evaluation of maxillary sinus area
the best option to choose is waters
projection which term describes two or
more atoms that are joined by chemical
bonds so the term describe two or more
atoms that joined by chemical bond is a
molecule whereas if atom that gains or
losses an electron and becomes
electrically unbalanced is known as a
onion and when an electron is removed
from an atom in the ionization process
and ion pair is formed and a proton
carry the positive electrical charge so
the molecule is not there describes two
or more atoms that are joined by
chemical bonds a patient is
provisionally diagnosed with some
eccentric infection to see for the
presence of media lateral expansion of
the lesion which conventional extraordin
you is advised so here this PA rotated
view who is used for two purposes that
is for the examination of
parotid gland and one more thing for
seeing this sub masseteric infections
and also for the maze your lateral
expansion of the lesion so the option is
PA rotated view which statement is
incorrect
so here the statements given all are
correct regarding the properties of
x-rays so the options there should be
Tuesdays none of their book and in this
box we have I have given all the
properties regarding the x-rays so you
have to know all these things they can
be asked in a statement type of
questions increasing which of this for
exposure parameters will increase the
intensity of the beam and you have to
see that intensity is directly
proportional to kvp milliampere age and
time but it is inversely proportional to
source to receptor distance that is
nothing but F inverse square law this is
inverse square law so here the only
these three things that is there voltage
milli ampere age and exposure time three
even choose them this thing will
increase the intensity of thanks rating
whereas the source to receptor distance
is inversely proportional to the
intensity of x-ray beam if the half
value layer is 3mm with what thickness
of aluminium is necessary it will
decrease the intensity by off I think
few people have selected option 1.5 but
you have to know that half value layer
is nothing but the thickness of
aluminium so here the aluminum thickness
is 3mm so 3 mm is needed to decrease the
intensity by half not the half of
aluminium layer quite so the half value
ladies thickness of alumina here
thickness is given is 3mm so this 3 mm
is needed to decrease the intensity of
the beam right half so option is 3 mm
which statement is cut in this statement
you have to know there are of two types
of effects short-term and long
some effects short-term means more
radiation in short period of time
whereas long-term effects means less
radiation in long periods of time so if
you see these two things the correct
option will be of long-term effects with
small amount of radiation absorbed in
long period so option D is correcting
arrange the annual sources of radiation
exposure from smallest to largest so if
you go for the cosmic thing cosmic space
here that is 11% for ridin or Thor on it
is the 73% for terrestrial soil it is 7
percent for internal nucleoid it is 9
person so their options can be chosen is
C that is 3 3 4 1/9 - so see which
statement is true for a radiation
monitoring badge and the radiation
monitoring but should not be worn by
radiographer when he is a going for
expression that means when he want to
expose himself he should not use the
radiograph part and this radiograph
badge cannot be shared between other
employees and it should be worn as this
radiograph radiation monitoring bad
should be owned at a variable when
exposing the x-ray receptor so the
option C is true for this radiation
monitoring but which term describes the
dose of radiation that the body can
endure with little or no chance of
injury so this is maximum permissible
dose that means it will know it can
endure with little or no chance of
injury and this occupationally exposed
dose is nothing but it should not exceed
an accumulated lifetime radiation dose
and if you go into the olara principle
it it states that all exposure to
radiation must be kept as minimum as
possible
which position indicating device is most
effective in reducing patient exposure
that it's nothing but a rectangular one
rectangular one will reduce the patient
exposure by sixty percent when compared
with a circular kilometer or a circular
PID a radiographer that exhibits areas
of black and white is termed as high
contrast and is said to have a short
contrast scale a radiograph that
exhibits many shades of Gray's terminus
low contrast I'd say to have a long
contrast skill to limit so this is one
statement to limit the image
magnification the longest target
receptor distance and shortest object
receptor distances used so if you go
into the first statement it is confusing
so you have to remember that long scale
will have low contrast that is you can
remember that is L and L so long scale
thing will have low contrast if I can
remember N and L where as short scale
will have high contrast long scale means
many shades of gray short scale means
few scales of green so this is so the
first option is correct to limit the
image Magne so to prevent the maximum
magnification long that means target
receptor that is a note to the film
distance should be more whereas object
and receptor film should distance should
be decreased from list below order the
following from least to most radio
people I mean from in this the least
will least radio peak will be of my
scenery sinus then it will be of bone
then it is of dentin then it will be of
enamel the needs of amalgam so the
option for 2 3 5 are more susceptible to
radiation or these muscles
I now sells there of radio resistant
whereas resistant I mean less radio
sensitive
whereas epithelial cells a radio
sensitive nucleic acids and stupid or
among all those things the neutrik acids
are more susceptible to radiations a
patient requires tooth extractions from
an area that has been subject to
radiation therapy which of the following
represents the greatest danger so for
this question we have to remember any
patient has a history of radiation
therapy you should not do the
extractions for a period of six months
after therapy because it may end up with
the osteo radio necrosis and these are
also statement questions the pattern of
stored energy on an exposed film is a
termed as a latent image this image
remains invisible until it undergoes
processing so you all know that that
stored energy will form as a latent
image and this latent image is developed
into the diagnostic image after it
undergoes processing then the second
statement is the function of developer
is to chemically reduce exposed silver
halide crystals to black metallic silver
years if you go during processing before
going into processing this is before
processing thing and if you place into
the developer this normal metallic I
mean silver halide crystals they are
converted into metallic metallic grains
your hair sistent has processed three
panoramic films to me she noticed that
films are progressively getting lighter
and lighter what should be done to
correct the problem and if you go into
the textbook statement that that they
will become lighter and lighter because
that concentration of the developer is
decreased so you have to add the
replenish your daily that replenishing
is nothing but eight ounces of fresh
developing solution and this replenish
er is mainly used for five panner of me
fillings development so option is
replenish the developer first in the
until x-ray tube number of electrons
flowing both second in the previous
questions you have seen that number or
equal quantity is nothing but milli
ampere eight so number of electrons
flowing per second is measured by milli
ampere each which of the following
supplies electrons necessary to generate
x-rays so cathode will supply the
electrons that means cathode has two
things like filler tungsten filament
this will supply the electrons so the
cathode is negative so the option will
be of negative cathode this is tungsten
tungsten filament rectification is the
conversion of direct current
TC to an AC and then the next a tube
acts as a self rectifier that in changes
DC to AC when producing x-rays no the
both options are wrong because this
rectification II will convert AC to DC
and even the dental x-ray tube will act
as a self rectifier will change that
will changes AC to DC but if you go into
the above statements they have given us
DC to AC hence the both statements are
false so this is the correct thing the
occlusion image may be used forever
of periodontal disease the bisecting
technique is a preferred very apical
exposure method for the documentation of
periodontal diseases yes if you go into
the first statement yes occlusions
images may be used because you can see
the buckling wall and sometimes in the
topographic views you can see the tooth
structure I mean along with the annular
bone but if you go into the second
statement this bisecting that technique
is preferred no the bisecting technique
is not preferred for the documentation
of periodontal disease because you can
see the image distortion in bisecting
angle technique so hence we will use
paralleling angle technique when
compared with the bisecting angle
technique it is further periodontal this
is evaluation so the first statement is
true whereas the second statement is
false
this is a clinical I mean all the
clinical features combined with the
radiographic findings they come it is of
a syndrome a patient on a examination
has download inclination of palpebral
fissures malformation of the external
ears absence of the external auditory
canal so these all are the clinical
features where you can see on the
patient so you have then you have went
for and you have given a provisional
diagnosis of one common type of mandible
of facial disasters these are the
provisional clinical diagnosis then you
will ask for the patient to go for the
radiographs and in the radiograph you
will find a finding which are
characteristic very striking feature of
this syndrome so you have to see that
downward inclination malformation of X
10 years and absence of external
auditory canal is the clinical feature
of a Treacher Collins syndrome and it is
the most common type of mandibular
aphasia loss the sister Treacher Collins
syndrome
so in tragically ng syndrome if you are
advised the radiograph the more striking
future is zygoma born high population
that means in these patients
there are hypoplastic Zygo must see here
you can see zygoma
kaliesha and here external auditory
meatus is the feature of Treacher
Collins syndrome so these type of
features these type of features can be
seen in Prasad colon syndrome a patient
on clinical examination show
brachycephaly hyperthyroidism and
orbital proptosis a feeling these
clinical features one syndrome so these
all clinical features are related to
syndrome colas Crowson syndrome because
orbital proposes a total reading eyes is
a characteristic feature of Crowson
syndrome and what will you see in Croson
syndrome on radio graphs that is sutures
synostosis so you have to interlink the
clinical features with the radiographic
diagnosis and then you have to find out
the answer a patient reported to the
department with the chief complaint of
pain will over left quadrant on clinical
examination 3 if I has deep dental
caries and tender on percussion on
radiographic investigation 3 if I has a
radiolucent lesion in the periodical
region an incidental finding was seen in
relation to 3 6 so all this thick
question was lengthy to add up for time
for you but the answer lies in the last
2 2 line lines and that is incident that
finding is seen in relation to 3 6 where
3 6 has a elongated pulp chamber and
more apically position vocation so
elongated pulp chamber RF apically
position vocation is seen in the 10
developmental anomaly called asteroid on
teaser which is seen as an incidental
finding
so this Torah don t some is a feature of
with syndrome this frequently as
associated with the trisomy 21 so you
have to interlink the clinical features
with radiographic features occidental
anomaly the radiographic feature of a
circular or oval radiopaque area with
central radiolucency
representing a apical foramen and root
can all
because most often in so this
radiographic feature is of her die
laceration so if there is a die
laceration on radiograph you can see
this type of radiographic appearance and
this type of radiographic appearance is
called as bullseye so this type of
radiographic appearance in in die
laceration which more dye laceration is
most frequently occurs in monks Larry
premolars a patient complains of
discoloration of teeth on examination
the color of the underlying dentin
imparts a louis brown color to tooth in
a lesion you have to note this thing or
you have to see this line it is
important a novel appears to be rough
smooth or glossy the crowns appear to be
under sized or fe square shape the
reduced enamel thickness also causes
loss of contact between adjacent teeth
so in this question all the clinical
features of some developmental anomaly
was given of teeth so all these clinical
features are related to the maloca
chances imperfecta and in amyloidosis
imperfecta it mean if you go into the
hypoplastic type the enamel thickness is
reduced if you go into the hypo
methylation type that animal has a
mortal appearance and if we go into the
hypo calcification that crowns will be
of in normal size and shape and enamel
is of regular thickness so in this all
clinical features are related to
hypoplastic time and the hypoplastic
type the radiographic appearance will be
of picket fence so the option we have to
choose is the picket fence hyperplastic
a patient of record has been a fight
where he was punched just below the
right eye is zygomatic complex fracture
is suspected which of the following
external so the patient has a dramatic
fracture you have to select the
radiograph and are otherwise you have to
advise the patient available then what
radiograph you'll advise water
projection is mainly further Bank slurry
sinus Riverstone protection it is mainly
further conduct later the flow matrix
further or the
antek purposes and you can see the
mandible deformity but here they have a
psychometric complex fracture which men
we clearly viewed on the semantic vertex
projection the most common oral problems
that occur following the radiation and
chemotherapy Hugh mucositis infection
pain and bleeding yes because in
radiation and chemotherapy after that
there will be of pancytopenia decreased
blood cells which leads to the increased
infection or pain and bleeding the oral
cavity is radiated during the course of
treating radiosensitive oral
malignancies yes because we will give
radiation because of malignancies like
squamous cell carcinoma so here the
board statements given here are true and
open boxes of radiographic film should
not be stored in the dark room so the
trailer graphic films are never stolen
and Arkham why because we will get a
chemical fumes from the processing
solutions will form the film and even
the continuous safe light exposure
should not be recommended because
sometimes the box may be of a little
open or it there or the box may have a
tab that may expose the film so these
are the three things which shows that we
have we should not share the
radiographic film should not be stored
in the darkroom so option is of all mo
the hydroquinone in the developer brings
out the - tones whereas alone developer
brings or the - tones and in dental
radiographs so you have to remember this
hydroquinone will bring out black and
white tone Rassilon we'll bring out gray
tone so to choose the best option is the
gray will be is in the last option and
black and white either a black or a
white tone will is given by the
hydroquinone so choose the best angeles
and city on average processing solution
should be replenished
that is processing solution should be
replenished in an average of once daily
with the eight ounces of fresh developer
so coming to the pictures see this
picture is shows the thin septa and this
is a characteristic feature of
odontogenic myxoma and this is the
direct textbook picture given from the
right hand side so you can go the I mean
or intergenic mix so mine you can read
the features and here you can see these
are the sagittal and coronal pictures of
CD and here there is a something
deformity you can see this thing the
density of the cortical this is called
as a cortex the density of density of
cortical bones increased so the density
of cortical bones is increased is seen
in page HTC's so what is this this is
the Tran appearance which can be seen in
marker works arterial sclerosis is a
type of soft tissue dystrophic
calcification
this picture they have given further OPG
Jones so we have to interpret the OPC
enough six zones so if we go into the
zones of RPG this is zone 1 which
includes all the teeth structures I mean
all the teeth at the supporting
stanfield structures and the supporting
bone
whereas zone to you it will include the
nose and the sinuses zone 3 inferior
border or the inferior of the mandible
zone 4 is for the condyles bilaterally
zone 5 is further ramus region whereas
zone 6 is for the hyoid bone so you have
to remember this zones of OPG for
interpretation so what is this thing
this radiographic appearance is dense in
vagine meters so you can see here the
radio PCT i mean all of the tooth which
is in inverted or a invaginate ER into
the tooth so don't confused with the
internal desorption this is for a dance
in virginities which is given in a
textbook and what are these
calcifications reserve soft tissue
calcifications or which are named as a
flyball lathes and these flat bullets
are idiopathic soft tissue
calcifications
so this is a type of root resorption you
can see that root resorption is piled
here so spike this type of root
resorption x' mostly sees malignancies
in this radiographic appearance you can
see the arrow mark a radiopaque line is
then seen in the radial lucency so this
type is called as snow like appearance
and which is mostly seen in the sea
Votey it's no like or a snowstorm or a
snow flake type of appearance in CEO t
so this this is whether a t1 weighted
image or a t2-weighted image so you have
to go into the differences t1 and t2 t1
will have a CSF dark and fat is brighter
but if you go into the t2 the fat will
be dark and CSF is white so here all the
fat present is dark so and even here it
shows a pathologic anomaly and
pathologies are more commonly demarcated
on t2-weighted images hence the given is
t2 weighted image sausage string
appearance in Zilog rafi scene which of
the following conditions so this is a
direct question you have to remember
that sausage string appearance can be
seen in submandibular saliva gland with
no obstruction and this radiographic
appearance you have to note that it is
near the general mandibular kunal and
which is nothing but a new
five rumor that this expansion of the
canal expansion is C so it is
neurofibroma what is a type of artifact
this type of artifacts are called as
aliasing artifacts or streaks and with
seen in CB CD and mostly occurs because
it is impossible for the scanner to take
enough projections of the object it is
you usually metallic if it is like a
metal life it is for the scanner it will
it is impossible to take or enough
cross-sections and these appear like a
dark lines which radiate away which
radiates away from the sharp corners so
which is called as a aliasing artifact
or streaks artifacts and this is a
creation area I have told at 13 years
female and a lip swelling and everything
these are the radiographic features and
these radiographic pictures you have to
identified they are the pictures of us G
that is ultrasonography and the lip
swelling is there and if you go into
these two pictures it is showing a color
Doppler which is increased vascularity
so increased vascularity and the options
one the given thing is one vascular
lesion so you have to select in mind
Yama so first you have to find out which
type of radiographic user that these are
USGS and this is us deep with Doppler
showing increase device Canara T which
is nothing but a hemangioma of lower lip
a 73 year old woman affected by multiple
myeloma previously treated with
bisphosphonates you have to remember
your multiple myeloma bisphosphonates
given radiographic images of the same
female so these are the radiographic
images from that female the possible
diagnosis is so if you go into the
history of bisphosphonates if the
patients have a history of using these
four states for a large period of time
that patients may develop osteonecrosis
or a bisphosphonate induced
osteomyelitis after some time that is if
you extract the teeth
you'll they'll have a complication of
osteonecrosis re-crossed your manatees
so the patient isn't bisphosphonates and
this for this osteonecrosis or
osteomyelitis if we do the Cintiq Rams
or a sink big Rafi you have you can see
that this is more observed that
radionuclide is more observed where
there is a necrosis
so ends you can select as an option like
osteonecrosis because the patient having
more chances of developing osteonecrosis
so remember one thing important point
patients who have used to B's
phosphonates will develop a
osteomyelitis or osteonecrosis after a
long period of time when there is a
tooth extraction OPG of asymptomatic
adult discloses ready pine 1.5
centimeters radiolucency below the
mandibular can on the lesion is not
palpable which of the following is most
likely diagnosis so that is not palpable
and it is below the mandibular canal and
you can see that like it is a saliva
gland inclusion defect where mostly the
salivary submandibular gland whose eyes
in so you can select it as a celebrity
gland inclusion defect on intraoral
examination patient reveals soft
fluctuant
tender swelling anterior hard palate
vital anterior teeth and a radiolucent
area between the roots of minds narrow
central incisors and this is a scenario
but the thing is you have to correlate
with clinical features and when you
correlate with radiographic features
either cyst is present between the
central incisors the cyst which is
presently to the central incisors with a
vital anterior teeth you have to go for
a laser palette and system radiographic
examination of left third molar region
reveal a well-defined radiolucent
area with missing third moon our
differential diagnoses include all of
the following it except so you can think
about
amyloplasts to my residual cyst
odontogenic keratosis
even in the absence of the teeth also
but when Dan
resist it is shoot associated with it
impacted tooth impacted tooth hence that
it maybe it is not a dental assistant or
a differential diagnosis for a given
scenario there are these three lesions
you can I mean you can think of these
lesions when there is an absent of tooth
on top railing scatter is it is nothing
but a scatter with a change in direction
of photon without loss of energy so in
this character there is a the direction
of the photon is same but there is no
loss of energy these are the statement
questions they have a human three
statements
the first one is heat the cathode
filament to generate electrons yes we
have to eat the cathode filament to
generate electrons establish high
voltage potential between anode and
cathode exaggerate the electron yes we
have to establish the high voltage
potential such that the electrons from
the cathode will accelerate towards the
anode and third statement is low voltage
potential between cathode and I and no
because this low voltage potential will
not accelerate the electrons towards
that and so in hence it is wrong so only
the one and two options are correct a
somatic mutation produce poor health in
the exposed individual but does not
produce mutations in the subsequent
generation yes when the somatic is
nothing but it will produce only the
exposed to individual will have the
effects it is not carried to the second
generations but when you go into the
genetic mutation that exposed person
will not be affected but because of the
mutations it will affect the future
generations hence the both statements
are correct in a given question -
systems of plant life for the
appreciations of amount of radiation
received by both occupationally exposed
individuals and the public so
this this is a NCR pea and ICRP that is
National Council on radiation protection
measurements and International Council
on radiological protection they will
induce the guidelines for the limitation
of amount of radiation which is received
by both occupationally exposed
individuals and the public you have to
remember this NZ RPA ICRP difference
between rapid processing chemicals and
conventional processing chemicals are
when there was a fern difference because
in rapid processing chemicals high
hydroquinone concentration is seen and a
high alkaline because of that high
alkaline and a high alkaline ph can be
seen in a rapid processing chemicals
high contrast is relation of CT imaging
aids in differentiating tissues whose
difference in tissue densities is less
than so in high contrast CT you can
differentiate the tissues that means you
can differentiate the densities which
are less than zero point zero zero zero
zero point zero four you have to note
this even it can difference the
differentiate between the tissue
densities of 0.04 which property of
x-rays utilized in intensifying screen
in previously I have given few
properties of x-rays the physical
property of x-ray is used for the
utilization of now utilized in the
intensifying screen so this given
picture you can see here the OPP will
get doubt whether it is a CT or a I mean
a see CT or MRI or something you can see
here this is a bony components which are
seen clearly so you have to remember in
CT bony components are seen clearly but
you can see the fat tissue also so to
enhance the fat tissue a contrast agent
is induced
so this x-rays of cec T that is contrast
enhanced computed tomography so it will
enhance the fat and because of CT even
the
phone can be seen clearly so he oh that
number five what is the given it is si
anterior nasal spine
what is this anatomical landmark it is a
Mylo hired Ridge what is this thing this
is a nutrient canal and this is a
mandibular IO PA the super concentrated
solution that is added to the processing
solution to compensate or the effects of
oxidation Eastern bars replenish our you
have to remember that replenish sure is
a super concentrated solution so this
replenish will prevent the oxidation on
the average processing solution should
be changed so that you have to remember
two statements here processing solution
should be replenished replenished daily
whereas they should be changed for a
three to four weeks which describe the
relationship of central rate to the
receptor in paralleling techniques so in
parallel in technique what is the
central ray relationship if you take
this is a tooth and this is a receptor
so these are arranged parallel to each
other and the angle central rays passed
perpendicular or 90 degrees to each
other so here the 90 degrees to the
receptor and also the long axis of the
tooth so option is B the interaction of
x-ray radiation with matter ulcerated in
the given finger demonstrate so this is
a figure given for a coherent scattering
incoherent scattering there will be of
scatter but there is of no ionization so
option is C so there is character is
present but I
zatia is absent then 27 number in the
given picture is you can see this is a
given in question and this is all the
label parts here and so the 27th one is
a unleaded glass x-ray window so you
people go through all these label parts
which are important and they can ask any
part like a Mazda based caution in the
examination the following threshold
curve explains so you should remember
that deterministic effects are those
dependent and all the threshold curves
explain that deterministic effects and
those dependency is always seen in
deterministic effect and in this picture
if you want to arrange from yes I have
told M is greater than I that is more
radiosensitive then g2g even early yes
ladies and if you go and do this thing
these are the pictures given and you
have to match with them I mean you have
to match with them this thing the
options given in the question if you go
for the this thing first one size one
receptor so this is a size one receptor
and this is a size two receptor so this
is a xcp
aiming ring for posterior you can see
this thing handle posterior this is for
anterior see this anterior placed thing
so here this is a this is a indicator
for posterior and this is a indicator
for an t do and this is block by block
for posterior and this is bite block and
idiot remember the pictures and you can
easily remember with these handles for
anteriors it is vertical or anterior it
is horizontal okay fill him hole is
given in the following image so these
are nothing but if snap ray holders in
the following figure which exhibits high
contrast we have learned their long
scale have low contrast short scale have
high contrast but short scale means low
shades of gray so in which picture you
have low shades of gray B so hence B has
high contrast the anglish in the given
image here the angulation is sixty
degrees and the pediatric occlusion
radiograph maxillary cross-sectional the
cause of others in the film this cause
is thread it is called as a ridiculous
of the film and this reticulation of
film is mostly due to sudden temperature
change and this is a light dance image
and this light dance image in the
digital radiograph is mainly because of
the noise so hence it is a noisy image
the given picture Isolators a flow graph
aroma depicting the characteristic
features oh if you see this aroma the
first here there is a enlargement of
sella turcica even the enlargement of
frontal bone and even the enlargement of
mandible so all the facial structures
are enlarged we go into all these things
if you go seen since if you see
acromegaly acromegaly is nothing but a
hypopituitarism that is there will be
most of the structures in the facial
body because of hyper petorian feudalism
there is an enlargement so this here you
have to correlate these radiological
features with the I mean with the
options and here the given with the
given pictures it depicts the latency
flow graph where all these structures
are enlarged so you can select them I
Chrome a galley the following structure
is a radiation personal monitoring
device so it consists of three
symmetrical holes each other so this is
the TLD badge given here and you have to
remember further TL 3 but the thing is
it consists of three symmetrical holes
I'll eat symmetrical hole will have it
vanished off to well mmm so you can
select the dimension of - mmm and they
are zero point mm thick and - 80
milligrams weight and it is a TLD badge
which works on
thermo luminescence
they means depict which type of grid
here so there are four types of grades
and that which is a linear grid focused
grid and the pseudo focus degrade and
the image given is of a pseudo focused
grid here in pseudo focused grade you
can see that grid height of strips he is
decreased promise you C you can see that
grid height is decreased progressively
from Center resulting in decreased grid
ratio front Center to edge and if you
see in the cross gray and the linear
grids are placed right angle to each of
them if you go into the focused grid
here the strips of leather angular
progressively that is there with is some
angulation where as a linear grades the
strips of this grid are replaced
alternately
I mean on parallel so these are the type
of greats used
extraordin radiography the Kievan
picture depicts a type of TMJ view in
which central race director at an angle
of you can see all the this is if
cranial you can see if you put picture
of cranium ethmoidal ear cells and
mashed toilets re-mastered
air CIL's and fuse i is a senses so this
repeats the transcranial view and in
transcranial view will use an angle
asian of 20 to 25 degree celsius
I'm sorry 20 to 25 degree angle ation
can be seen the following picture is it
looks like a tooth slot but it is not a
to trot it is a self developing filling
and in this finan you'll have both
developer and fix it so first thing is
you have to expose and then you have to
take that into the dark room and you
have to remove the packet of developer
then after 15 seconds again you have to
develop
I mean remove the packet or fix them so
the finally the film will be developed
inside the fill impact only at last you
have to rinse the philomene water I'm
sure you can give the patient so this is
a self developing cinema the given image
is a coronal we will see you sitting
there identify the line lock number one
so the first thing is with mindil
Sciences this is eighth moral Sciences
the second thing is superior nasal
terminate here the eighth one is
spheroid boon ninth one is inferior
orbital region tenth one is
perpendicular plate we handed my boon
eleven keys coronoid process and this is
a section twelve is a monstery
tuberosity and thirteen decent
mandibular can only this year the given
image is a CD bread are among depicted
as a feature of all the below see you
can see this this is called as a
deployed space and in this deployed
space is mostly increased in all this
telecine eeeh acromegaly and
hyperthyroidism but this is this is
decreased in the cases of osteopetrosis
so it is not a osteopetrosis the
following OPD may not be associated with
if you see the OPC you can find multiple
impacted teeth so multiple impacted
either associated with Gardner's
syndrome clear cranial dysplasia a
Noonan syndrome whereas it is not
associated with the Ellis one crevel
syndrome so option is a nice van
traveled syndrome the following
extraordin few is co the the patient
mouth is open and you can see the corner
neck and the condyle clearly so this can
be of the river stones view in waters
you you can see all the air sentences
whereas in PN ap view we will ask the
patient mostly to close the mouth the
following extraor electic is mainly used
for investigation of so here the patient
chin is touching and this type of you
ease of
waters who you and it is used for the
maxillary sinus in this extra orally oh
you can see that patient head is
touching the cassette and the x-ray beam
is passing through the base of the skull
it is nothing but a sub Mentos vertex U
and here you can see the base of the
skull the following error is you can see
if this line this is because of crazing
crazing is nothing but the Tucker's in
PSP receptors and it cannot be a current
direct digital senses
this occurs in paralleling bisecting or
a bitewing technique when using a
filament thin radiolucent line is seen
on the image and if you is a PSP
receptor it will appear as a white line
the given landmark is this given
landmark in zygomatic process switching
hinders the maxillary molar up Isis
greater preferred with ratio of so in
extra or grits are used only in
extraordinary ography and the preferred
ratio is 8 to 10 this structure is used
for the protection of you can see here
this is a lead collar type of thing and
if this is placed me in the neck region
to protect the thyroid gland the given
image is a radiographic appearance of C
you can see here a radio opposite e and
this radio opacity is hindering or
obstructing the eruption of this third
molar so this type of thing mostly
occurs because of the complex adenoma
and even the post P ossifying fibroma
very apical osseous displays she has and
he has periapical OSHA's dysplasia as a
name indicates they are of nearly in a
periapical lesion but in ossifying
fibroma z' mostly we cannot see that
unadapted teeth but in compound or runt
a more complex event oma only
there is a obstruction for the eruption
normal adaption pattern but if you see
this radio opposite it is very complex
and you cannot find the structures like
in our mail dentine so you can go with
the option complex you don't know if it
is a small radio pissah t where you can
see a structures like enamel dentine and
pulp you feel you can go with an option
of compound return Tommaso but for fer
this radiographic view it is a complex
or and AMA the given radiographic
appearance is not associated with and
this question is very tricky if you go
into the options all the three options
are same that means simple bones this is
also called as a traumatic bone cyst or
a progressive bone cyst and for this all
the things the radiographic presentation
may be of a you need ocular radial
lucency so in these three are associated
with this type of radio rosin sister
since you can select the answer that is
like none of the above option D the
following faulty radiograph is due to if
you see in the radiograph this tree
branching streaks is called as a static
electricity and this static electricity
is mostly due to low potential electric
discharge and occurs if the fillings are
taken out with a rapid force from the
filling fill in packet so done with the
radiology paper discussion and if you
have any doubts you can ask this or you
can ping okay thank you
