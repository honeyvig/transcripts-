foreign
languages that are in demand in data
science
very big python and R are top
programming languages that are in demand
in data science Community both have
their own pros and cons therefore it is
vital that you understand the crucial
differences between the two programming
languages and decide which one is the
best fit for you after watching this
video you will understand which language
is better for you in terms of different
parameters before unwrapping today's
topic I request you to subscribe to our

now let us look at what are we covering
today
we are covering introduction to iron
python parameters in RN python best
tools and libraries offered by Python
and R and conclusion to the topic
introduction to R and python let me ask
few queries regarding Python and r
our language is super superficially
related to
python
C
plus plus
Java please leave your answer in the
comment section below and stay tuned to
get the answer
and another question is which one of the
following is a python file extension
dot p
dot python
Dot py
and Dot PYT
please leave your answer in the comment
section below
coming to introduction to Python and r
R is a statistical programming language
and environment that integrates
statistical Computing and Graphics R is
powerful and stable software
python python can also be called as a
general purpose programming language for
data analysis and scientific Computing
python can be considered as the best
player in machine learning python is an
expressive language with many built-in
function
both are open source software and
platform independent
and they are platform neutral and also
compatible with all major operating
systems including Unix Windows and Mac
next we will be covering different
parameters
we will be covering learning
prefillability mathematical fundamentals
speed of both languages
visualization and graphics
data handling capacity
demand
community and customer support
employment possibility in both the
languages
let us cover it one by one first one is
learning preferability or ease of
learning
python is renowned for its ease of use
Python's notebooks offer excellent tools
for sharing and documentation despite
the fact that there are currently no
guis for them programmers find are as
difficult language as a beginner
this implies that the programmers must
devote a significant amount of time to
learn and comprehending our coding
coming to mathematical fundamentals
required
coming to python understanding
descriptive analysis is very important
in layman's terms descriptive statistics
often refers to the process of
explaining using certain representative
techniques such as charts tables Excel
files Etc
python statistics is a built-in library
for descriptive statistics
if your data sets are not too big or if
you can't rely on importing other
libraries you can use python
on the other hand R requires basic
statistics from basic status statistics
what I mean is mean mode and median are
the terms used most frequently in basic
statistics it is referred to as measures
of central tendency
probability statistics plays an
important role in handling various types
of probability distribution it includes
binomial and normal distribution
next parameter is speed
python is an interpreted language with
Dynamic typing python always executes
slowly because the code is executed line
by line
compared to Matlab and Python rsr
language is significantly slower
our packages are substantially slower
than those for other languages
now that we have covered speed
coming to data visualization and data
collection in Python
When selecting data analysis tools with
visualization are crucial and python has
some incredible visualization too
in Python to large and varied skater
plots using regression lines we can use
ggplot2 and ggplot tools
compared to draw values visualized data
is easier to comprehend therefore R has
many packages that offers sophisticated
graphic features
in R we can use
in R we can use tools like matplotlib c
bond Etc
data handling capability in both Python
and r
the new releases in Python have resolved
the issue with the python packages for
data analysis R is useful for analysis
because of the abundance of packages
accessibility of the test and benefit of
employing formulas however simple data
analysis can also be done using it the
need to install many packages
crucial part of parameter that is tools
and libraries in Python and r
as a python developer one needs to be
well versed in the best libraries
because python has a lot of libraries
that have many different uses
libraries like tensorflow scikitla numpy
plays an important role in solving many
python related problems
libraries perform a wide variety of
tasks in art that are very beneficial
for data science operations example for
that is deployer bioconductor ETC
community and customer support support
index offered by Python and r
compared to our python has a larger
community
for assistance we can contact
www.python.org
for any queries regarding Python and
help you can support uh you I repeat you
can visit support.realpython.com
for any help and queries are offers you
with our studio community
R provides assistance through its
official website
for queries and Community related issues
we can contact
www.r hyphenproject.org
next is job opportunities in Python and
r
decent survey from indeed.com predicts
that at least 55 000 python jobs in the
USA with exponential pay rates are
available with the companies like Google
Amazon Twitter Facebook requires python
developer to handle massive amount of
data
position provided for a python developer
is software engineer data analyst data
scientist and many more
career R is an excellent job opportunity
for you as a beginner
big tech companies like Google Twitter
Facebook are using are
position provided by companies as a r
developer is
data scientist data analyst data
visualization analyst Etc
moving on let us wrap up an important
topic which language to be used between
R and python there is no right or wrong
way to study both python or R both are
in demand skills that will enable you to
complete almost any data analytics work
you come across It ultimately depends on
your background interest and career
objectives that which one is better for
you but compared to R python is easy to
learn let's compare its strength and
weaknesses
it is used to handle large amount of
data
python performs non-statistical
functions and it is best suitable for
programming however python is better
when it comes to coding
whereas R is used in data visualization
graphics
R is a widespread language in the
statistical community
it is used to accomplish many
mathematical tasks
so before concluding the topic let me
answer the query that I have asked
regarding R and python do you guys
remember the question
the query was
our language is superficially related to
which language
so the answer for the question is C
language
next question was which one of the
following is a python file extension it
was an easy question
answer for that question is Dot py
simply learn offers you with the best

provide the link for this course in the
description below
data scientists for python it is a best
course for a beginner it includes five
courses in collaboration with IBM at an
affordable price courses includes python
4 data science
after that we will be covering applied
data science with python
machine learning
as well as Tableau learning
and data science Capstone and finally
receive a master's certificate with
