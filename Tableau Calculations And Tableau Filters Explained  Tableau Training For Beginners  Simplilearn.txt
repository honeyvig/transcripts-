now without further delay let's get
started with t calculations and filters
so we will right away jump into tblo
public so the data set we dealing with
TBL Sage European data set so we have
row ID order ID ship date ship mode
customer name segment City Etc right
category subcategory all the basic data
Rel related to sales so let's get back
to the sheet and now before we proceed
there are different types of
calculations let's say uh you are
familiar with the Microsoft Excel or
powerbi or any other mathematics
basically so what do we have that we
have something called as aggregate
functions B functions subtraction
addition multiplication division right
so when it comes to T we can also
implement the thing so we can also find
out aggregate functions like sum average
minimum maximum difference Etc and if
you are ought to create some other
mathematical field which is different
from the regular B mass or aggregate
functions then you can also do those so
if you are focusing on such type of
mathematical function then it can be
created using calculated fields in table
and you can write down different
mathematical statistical formulas and
even some SQL queries sometimes so today
we will drill down to the basics so we
will only focus on Aggregate and other
regular mathematical functions apart
from the SQL queries and please do let
us know if you want us to work on some
deep down uh SQL queries on some
complicated calculated fields in t which
can help you in real time so with that
uh we will also work on some of the
filters which you can Implement in tab
your dashboards let's say for example we
create some uh calculated field which U
you know finds out maximum sales from a
region or maximum sales in a subcategory
and uh let's say we also find out some
um okay we have measures with say
discount profit and quantity let's say
we want to calculate the selling price
or cost price of a certain subcategory
item then we can do it using the
calculated field and we want to find out
that particular calculation for a
specific region let's say we have region
Dimension here let's say we have five
regions and out of which we want to find
out the details of cost price selling
price and profit for the bestest region
right you can add that into the filter
segment that that means you need to drag
the region Dimension into the filters
and you can also click on the show
filter to have that filter section right
on the right side part of this panel and
you can click on the filter uh you know
regions there and extract the required
filter so even when it comes to filters
we also have different types of filters
uh let's say about FX filters so we have
extract filter data filter context
filter and uh Dimension filter measure
filter and table filter so you will be
using any of these filters based on your
requirement and also do let us know if
you want an exclusive tutorial on
filters in Tablo with all the types of
filters included and if you want a
complete end to end demonstration on
each of these filters so with that let's
proceed with our Tableau calculations
and filters with a brief overview let's
try now to find out the selling price or
cost price of a particular subcategory
item let's trag subcategory to rows and
uh drag sales to this particular table
here we were supposed to drag sales here
so it gives us a
number there you go and let's say this
as sale price and uh profit let's track
profit
here right now we need the cost price
right so how do we do it so we can
create a new calculated field over here
just select that and let's name it as
cost
price here you need to some of
sales minus profits sum of profits
there you go apply and you will have a
newly created calculated field right
over here you can see it is designated
as equal to hashtag which is a little
different from the other measures which
just start by an hashtag right you can
just drag this and uh you can drop it
over here to find out the actual cost
price so there you go so you have the
cost price profit and sales now let's
say you want to calculate the minimum
and maximum of sales that are happening
in a region so you can just quickly you
know drag the subcategory to rowes and
sales to columns just add it and now we
want the minimum sales and maximum sales
of that particular subcategory item now
you can just create a new calculated
field and uh Max sales is the name
equals
to Max so here's your function Max of
sales press tab to select and press okay
and you created a Max sales option over
there and now let's create the minimum
sales can write new calculated field Min
sales and uh here you can use minimum
press tab to select sales press tab to
select and press okay now you created
new calculated Fields over here here can
just drag maximum
sales minimum sales with that aggregate
function and now you have maximum sales
and minimum sales right
there now let's say we find the use of
filters right now let's say we want to
find region wise sales let's add region
over here and uh the sales part onto the
rul now let's say we want to find out
only the central part now what you can
do is drag that particular region into
filters and here just press okay just
check all the parameters you have or not
and then just press okay and now you can
you know click on the drop down menu use
show filter and you have it here and now
based on your requirement you can do it
and for now you can see this particular
Filter Works only for sheet number three
but not here right so to help on that
part you can click on this option where
you can apply to all worksheets so when
you click on this this worksheet when
you click on this you can find that
particular option to all the sheets okay
we were supposed to all related data
sources there you go and if you click it
here you can find out that particular
filter and just click on the drop- down
menu show filter and you can see all now
you have the uh you know Max sales
minimum sales and total sales of a
subcategory certain subcategory for all
the regions now let's say I want to find
out that data for only central region
you have it over here just click on East
you have East sales East and North you
have eastn North right and let's say we
come back to this particular sheet where
we have the cost price profit Etc let's
click on this show filter option here
and click all and we have the uh Min
sales data right here so let's say we
want to find out the cost price profit
and sales data for only central region
here you go so that's how calculations
basic mathematical calculations in table
work such as the aggregate functions
minimum maximum and bom Mass functions
so that's how the basic mathematical
functions operate in TBL and that's how
the simple filters operate in table and
with that we have come to an end of this
session on table calculations and
filters do let us know if you want an
