most people
listening to this show know what their
passion is and
and they may it could be a hobby it
could be you know they could love
reading they could love playing tennis
they could you know they'll have
passions and if you have a passion it
makes sense to spend a lot of your life
in involved in that passion and quite
often you can turn your passion uh into
a business you can see maybe there's
some aspect of your passion that people
are not doing that well and
you know you can say screw it i could do
it better um and i think all you know if
you spend your life
with your eyes open looking for
um looking for things that frustrate you
looking for a gap gaps in the market um
that's all the business is it it's
fulfilling that you know filling in a
gap and doing it better than it's been
done by anybody else and you know if
people who don't have closed minds will
most likely find those opportunities
now i suspect there will be
100 people who will have come up with
that idea before you
but those hundred people
won't have had the courage just to go
and do something about it so those few
people just say right i'm going to give
it a go often end up
you know being being successful
[Music]
and i think if you you know if you
believe in what you're doing many people
will tell you why you're mistaken why
it'll never work but if you really
believe passion in what you're doing
just just
keep going you know keep pushing on keep
pushing on until you either succeed or
at least you realize that it's just not
going to happen and then if it if you
don't succeed pick yourself up and you
know try again and ultimately you know
if you you're that determined you will
succeed in life and if you don't you'll
have a lot of fun trying
i look at everything as an opportunity
you know i'm positive about life
generally and i generally feel that you
can find ways of solving problems and
making things work and you know i'm
definitely a sort of glass nearly full
kind of person rather than a glass half
full so i think out of being just a
generally positive person
you can make positive things happen
the absolute key is how good you are
with people and
if you genuinely care about people if
you can
surround yourself with people that
genuinely excited about what you're
doing you know if you can draw out the
best in people if you're good at
lavishing praise on people and not
criticizing your people and
and inspiring your people
um you know that's that's something you
just have to do from day one never use
the i word i mean it's you're a team
we're doing this we're doing that never
ever you know let it sort of sense
center on yourself and just be a great
great leader of people and you know if
you can do that from from day one even
if you've got one other
person working with you or two other
people working with you
then
you know you can enjoy the good times
together um but there will be bad times
and those that your people will
pull around for you they'll
work day and night to try to you know
keep whatever it is you're creating
alive
and make sure that survives so
the number one lesson is be a great
people person
uh to become an entrepreneur is not easy
and a lot of people who try to become
entrepreneurs they fail along the way
but good ones pick themselves up and
they try again they try again until they
succeed and you know what what an
entrepreneur needs to do first of all is
come up with an idea that will make a
positive difference in other people's
lives and
if you've got if you've got an idea
that's going to make a positive
difference to other people's lives
you've got a chance of building a
business play hard work hard and then
you know follow certain principles in
life you know love people make make sure
you make a positive difference in this
world while you're on it
