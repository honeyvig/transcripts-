dr srikant again so now i'm going to
talk about
mount classification okay mounts
classification is
an a better version of your gb black's
classification okay so after
uh gu black's classification there are
lots of disadvantages
which includes it doesn't mention about
the intensity of
the dental care is how well the dental
gear is how deep the dental gear is
and there are many other things so to
make it simple mount has proposed a
classification called as
and size classification means it's going
to give information both about the site
where does it occur and about the size
how intensity or how
depth it is okay so before going into
the classification person who is mainly
responsible is
mount okay so mount is a father of
minimal invasive dentistry
and his classification is also called as
site
and size classification so which is
denoted by two numbers
two numbers number one is about
side and the number two represents about
the size
so we will learn what are these numbers
okay so
number one number one is pit and fissure
sealant number one
one one so one in the first number
represents
pit and fissure carries means carries
which is on occlusal surface
number two represents proximal carries
or contact keras which is present on the
proximal surface
number three represents cervical keras
means which is present on the
gingival one third according to gu black
it comes under class
five okay class five g blacks comes
under cervical one third or gingival
one-third
okay so next we are done with number one
that is
site now we will talking about size okay
minimal
is one okay if it is 1.1
it is occlusal carries which is minimal
okay moderate is 2 enlarged is
3 extensive which cannot be restored is
4 okay similarly 2.1
2.2 2.3 2.4 means
which is present on proximal surface and
it is of different intensity for if it
is 2.2 it is present on the proximal
surface
and it is of moderate keras next comes
is 3.1
3.2 3.3 and 3.4 for example if they're
giving according to mounts
classification it was diagnosed as 3.4
means it is cervical carries which is
extensive means which cannot be restored
okay
so this is about the number magic the
two number magic of
mounts classification that is called as
site and size classification make a note
first number is site and second number
is
size i'm done with this classification
will be coming up with few more videos
