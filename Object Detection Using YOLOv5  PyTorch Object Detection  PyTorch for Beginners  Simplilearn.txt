foreign
is a computer vision model that stands
for you only look once fighter Jolo is a
free and open source software tool it is
a real-time method for detecting an
object in an image to detect object in
an image the YOLO algorithm employs
convolutional neural network models the
YOLO V5 detection algorithm offers High
Speed and Performance in addition to
excellent accuracy and precision by
using one forward propagation to
identify an object in the given image so
the YOLO V5 is simple to install because
it only need the torch and a few
additional installed python libraries
models can be trained more quickly which
lowers the cost of model construction
YOLO algorithm offers quick object
deduction in real time and deliver
prices result at the end hey everyone
you are already watching simply learn
and in today's video we're going to be
learning all about YOLO V5 pytot if you

consider professional certificate
program in Ai and machine learning by
simply learn and master those necessary
skills check out the link in the
description for more detail so without
any further delay let's get started so
the first thing is to install or
download YOLO V5 repository so to do
that just type YOLO V5 and this is the
first link that you will get from the
GitHub so you can just scroll down you
can see all the files here and then
click on the code and download zip so
once you download this all the files
will be downloaded
so as I I can show you so here is my
YOLO V5 Masters so these are the files
that have got downloaded
and after that let's insert python
anaconda and pytot so to install python
go to python.org so this is the website
that you can download python so you can
just click on the python 3.11.2 version
or you can also see there are plenty of
versions here as you can see you have
the python release for Windows the
version release for Windows so you can
download any kind of python version so
the latest version is Python 3.11.2 and
so once you just click on this python
then you can just run and install it and
the next step is to install the pytot so
also we need to install Anaconda
so to download Anaconda just go to
anaconda.com
and here as you can see a green button
download for Windows
so since it's already installed in my
system I will not download it right now
and the next step is to install pie
torch in your system
so to install pytorch go to pytorch
website pythons.org
and here when you scroll down
here you will get
installed pytotch so here according to
the pytorch build with a stable or
preview just click on stable and your
operating system if you have Linux Mac
or windows so since this is Windows just
click on Windows package go with the
conda or pip
since we have installed Anaconda I
suggest you to select condom language
Python and then compute platform would
be anything according to your system
requirements if your system is having
GPU then you can go with the coda else
go with the CPU and then run this
command whatever command you got here
just run this command in the comment
prompt
to install the pi torch
so when successfully installing python
anaconda and pytots in your system
then the next step is to check whether
if everything is running properly so
open the Anaconda prompt
and just type python
so it will display the python version
and next to check
just type import torch
so if there is no errors displayed then
you're good to get started
so after this we have one command that
we need to install
so using this python API you need to
install all the necessary modules
for uh yellow V5 so I will add this in
my description so you can use it
all the modules of YOLO V5 are required
in my system so I will not uh install
once again
so open the command prompt
so as you can see I have downloaded this
YOLO V5 Masters in my desktop so to go
there
then show it once again just open the
Anaconda
and here
to go to the folder YOLO V5 just type CD
desktop
since it's downloaded inside the desktop
and then we have to go inside the folder
YOLO V5 master so for that type CD
YOLO V5 master
and give enter so now we are inside the
YOLO V5 master
to install the requirements for YOLO V5
we have one comment to run so that
command will type it here babe
install
requirement
requirements.txt so once we enter all
the required modules will be installed
so if at all displays any kind of error
so what you need to do is it will ask
you to download
the visual studio tools so you can just
type visual studio so as a so here as
you can see uh
visual studio and just click on the
first link over here
and then go to downloads and when you
scroll down here you can see tools tools
for visual studio so if you don't have
you want to install the whole video
Visual Studio software then you can just
install the required tool so when you
scroll down here you can see build tools
for visual studio 2022. so just click on
downloads and it will get downloaded
hello V5 is easy to install as it
requires only the torch and few more
python libraries installed along with it
and modules are trained faster which cut
Downs the cost of building a module and
YOLO algorithm offers a high speed of
deduction to detect objects in real time
and provide accurate result at the end
so now finally to detect object and
animate we have to run the following
command so for that open command prompt
that is Anaconda prom so here we need to
run one command that is python
just type python detect
Dot py
Thon source
and then give the path image bar so
suppose we have few images here
so go to the folder YOLO V5 master and
click on the data and here you can see
image image folders We have three images
over here so suppose
we have this image here by submit
so here when we give this image path in
our Anaconda prompt it has to detect all
the things which are in this image so if
suppose this other person then you have
it will say person and it must say this
is It's a bus
so for that
let's give a part
so we are inside the YOLO V5 master so
just keep this command
and falling to that just type data
because we are inside the your YOLO V5
master so next thing is to give data
and the data we have images folders so
type images
and then inside that we have a image
of a name bus just type bus of this
image is of type
jpg so div.jpg
and once you enter it will take some
time to process
so as you can see the results save two
runs
so go to YOLO V5 Master go to runs
folder detect
as you can see
this is our
in it
so as I said it will detect the bus
person
and all of that so suppose if you want
to delete all of this which is already
there I'll just delete it
and run once again
now I'll once again give the command
now instead of bus
let us keep
let us take one image now
so just give traffic signal
just take any one image
so suppose we want this image
if you want this image I'll just copy
paste it here
and let me rename into signal
and here just give signal
signal.jpg and give enter
your result is saved
go to your Wi-Fi folder go to run
detect and yeah
so here we got all the things
we got handbag person so since the image
is small we got it in a small size
but yeah if once again you want to check
of the bus of this image if bus
dot jpg
and we got this second image as well so
it's detecting as bus person how many
persons we have so it's directing
properly
and now if you want to you know uh
display through or detect something live
using your webcam so just on the webcam
and then place any object in front of
you and it should detect the things so
for that we have
just type
python detect dot py hyphen hyphen
source so instead of giving path of any
image we will give 0 here this is a
default so it will on your webcam
so once you give this it must on the
webcam
so as you can see it has on
so suppose if I place the bottle
so it's in water
so if I have the phone
so it will say cell phone
so then
so it should detect as remote so yeah
right now it's confused okay we got it
as a remote
so finally here is the data that is
detect one remote or whatever day it's
detecting it will just be running here
in the comment prompt
so as you can see by giving the command
python detect.py hyphen iPhone Source
zero so when you give this your webcam
will open and start detecting the
objects that you have placed in front of
the camera and give the accuracy result
or parameters
so instead of 0 if you give any other
path image I mean image path so that
will detect the objects that are in the
image and give you the result
so I hope it's very clear how to install
python Anaconda by Dodge and the tools
that are necessary from Visual Studio
and also the YOLO V5 master
