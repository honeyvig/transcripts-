hi venus this is dr srikanth now i'm
going to discuss about this particular
case based discussion which is very
common and familiar now it is after kobe
19.
so the case can be like this okay so a
coveted positive patient with usage of
antibiotics or corticosteroids followed
by you have seen something like an
orbital cellulitis
which you can see in the clinical
photograph
or maybe an infection of the sinus or
maybe the perforation of the palate or
maybe the brain absence in few of the
cases okay so this is basically due to a
fungal infection which is a chronic one
basically whenever you have an options
of a chronic infection like extended or
prolonged over a period of time then you
can think of fungal infection and this
fungal infection is nothing but the
mucour mycosis which is also called as
zygomicrosis okay so please do make a
note of the terms which are common terms
which are useful for this infection and
coming to pathophysiology of this
infection this infection primarily
starts from the primary focus that is
nothing but called as your ah your
respiratory
tract okay so basically it originates
from the respiratory tract or the nasal
cavity which is a primary focus and
followed by through the blood okay that
is called as angio invasion through the
blood it's going to reach the different
parts of the body okay so it starts from
the respiratory tract and through the
blood it's going to reach or get
spread to the different parts of the
body
as it involves the blood
this is most dangerous this is dangerous
which may lead to the death of the
patient also
right so what are the primary clinical
features which we regularly see is the
clinical photograph what i have given
that is your orbital cellulitis or
infection of the sinuses
or infection brain abscess can be seen
or perforation of the palate all these
maxo facial areas are going to be eaten
away that is the reason we are mainly
concerned surgical people are mainly
concerned with the excision and followed
by the prosthetic people are mainly
concerned with building a max of facial
processes for the surgical accession
place which is previously done
and followed by
the combination
things that they can give is a kovid 19
history or immune compromised patient or
a patient which has an infection that
leads to the wide usage of antibiotics
or wide uses of antibiotics white uses
of corticosteroids or wide uses of
antimetabolics okay so these are the
common
background history stuff they are going
to give related to this particular type
of infection of course we have discussed
so much stuff related to this particular
infection but i want to repeat it again
because this is a mandatory that there
are high chances that you can encounter
a particular question on this
case-based activity okay so stay
positive study well okay please do like
