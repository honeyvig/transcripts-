management at last we'll wrap up this
session by talking about the companies
that are hiring product managers and the
future of product management so without
any further delay let's proceed and
understand what is product management
product management is managing the
process of the product throughout the
life cycle from strategizing to design
and development to branding of the
product product management involves
strategizing of the products to enhance
business and create customers value it
also involves creating product road maps
to design and develop the product it
involves specifying functional
requirement and creating blueprints to
develop the product as per customer
requirement once the product is
developed it is important to manage the
customer feedback and only then the
price of the product is
finalized let us proceed in understand
why product management is important so
product and Market are the two
Essentials of marketing product
management plays a crucial role in the
success of the product as product
management is the voice of the market
inside the
industry product management helps in
creating customers value and business
benefits now let us proceed and talk
about the areas of product management so
product management is divided into three
key areas product Discovery product
planning and product
development let us move ahead and know
what is product Discovery and what are
the various part that product Discovery
follow the very first phase of product
Discovery is alignment where the team is
created and the task is allotted to the
team to work on a particular project the
next phase of product Discovery is
research the research work is done to
know what are the requirement of the
product and what does a user need from
the product the team researches on the
problem statement and check whether the
gathered data is correct or not the next
phase of product Discovery is ideation
the team starts to find a solution for
the problem
statement in the next phase of creation
the team starts to create a prototype of
this product and test it within the team
or maybe outside the team in the next
phase of
validation the product is validated to
know whether the product is worth
spending the resource money or time or
not after product validation the
refinement process is done the process
of product Discovery is aligned to meet
the need of the business
goals after product Discovery product
planning is the next area of product
management product planning involves
four steps number one identifying profit
the process is done to check the success
of the product and to know what would be
the profit out of it the next phase of
product planning is evaluation of the
product the product is evaluated to
check the suitability and safety of the
product for the users in the next phase
we have allocation of the resources and
time
plannings the resources needed for the
product are allocated to the team and a
particular time period is planned to
provide the product to the customers
the last phase of product planning is
complete pre-product planning so before
we start the development process it is
necessary to plan and execute every task
so that the development of the product
should be complete without any further
delay once the discovery and planning
are done the product is moved towards
the stage of the development product
development follows the process of
idea the solution for the problem
statement is already there in the Des
Discovery phase now the development team
start to work on that idea and start to
develop the product using that
idea so once you walked into the step of
product planning and you have the idea
of what to do and how to do it is
important to do some market research as
well this research will look out for a
market to sell your
product now you got the market to sell
your product it is important to do some
development of the product in the
planning phase we have already created
the Prototype of the product the
Prototype is already tested in the team
so now the development team will start
to develop the product using that
prototype once the product is developed
product validation is done the product
validation means the product under goes
the validation process where the product
is tested through every aspect of the
testing
process so that the user doesn't find
any difficulty using the services of the
product and once the product is
validated it is launched into the market
launching means to provide the services
of the product to the
users now let us move ahead and talk
about the life cycle of product
management the first phase of product
management is product framing the step
involves creating a vision of the
product and identifying problems and
defining its success
the next phase of life cycle of product
management is research research means to
learning from the people about the need
and values of product the next phase of
life cycle is
designing in this phase the team
synthesize Visions ideas and research in
the Prototype of the product in the next
phase of
plotting the testing and solution of the
product is done in the Real Time with
real people
plotting the product the product is
launched into the market launching means
to send your product into the wild and
let it flourish and once the product is
launched into the market it is important
to do the
measurements measurement means using
metrices and data to check the success
of the product and plan the improvements
for it now the question arises the what
is the difference between the areas of
product management and the life cycle of
product management so the areas of
product management describe every
subphase that come under every phase of
product management or that come under
area of product management whereas the
life cycle of product management
represents the workflow of product
management as a complete
process a lot of us tends to get
confused between product management and
project management so let us proceed and
understand the difference between the
two board ter product management leads
to the external market operations and
management whereas project management
leads to the management of internal
operations product management deals to
the project given to the whole company
whereas the project management deals
with the particular project given to the
manager or the team the life cycle of
product management is product framing
research design plot launch and measure
whereas the life cycle of project
management is initiating planning
executing monitoring and controlling and
closing in product management manager
must be good at market research
strategic thinking and Business Service
whereas in project management the
manager must be good at planning and
budget
organizing moving on to the skills that
are necessary to thrive in product
management the skills that are mandated
for a product manager are technical
skills the manager must know how to
perform some specific task the knowledge
could be of any programming language or
some specific tools presentation skills
the product manager must have the
ability to deliver the presentation in
attractive creative and informative ways
analytical skills the manager must know
how to provide the information in
shorter ways and get the conclusion
communication skills the manager must be
able to deliver the information in such

crucial in modern businesses this video
is for you we'll explore the day-to-day
responsibilities of a product manager
the key skills required and how they act
as a connective tissue between customers
technology and business goals so let's
get started so let's first understand
what is a product manager let's begin
with the basics what exactly is a
product manager at its score a product
manager is a person responsible for
guiding a product's development from its
initial concept to its final delivery
they identify customer needs align those
with business's objectives and ensure
that the product delivered value to
customer while fulfilling the company
goals product managers are essentially
the CEO of the product a term
popularized by Ben Horowitz this doesn't
mean they have direct authority over
teams but rather they are responsible
for defining the product Vision Runing
teams behind it and ensuring the product
meets a success criteria their goal is
to balance business priorities and user
experience technological feasibility now
that we have understood the broad
definition let's explore the specific
responsibilities of a product manager so
let us now understand the core
responsibilities of a product manager
the first step is to understand the
customer the first and foremost
responsibility of any product manager is
to understand the needs and the pain
points of the customer so this requires
building empathy for the end users
product managers often engage in market
research customer interviews and data
analysis to uncover user needs this
empathetic approach helps them create
products that truly solve customer
problems the second step is defining the
product Vision now once they have a deep
understanding of customer needs product
managers set the vision for product so
this vision isn't just a vague idea but
a clear road map that guides the
products Development A well-defined
Vision outlines the products objectives
the problems it will solve and what
success will look like now the third
step is prioritizing features product
managers must prioritize features based
on customer needs technical constraints
and business goals they often have to
make tough decisions about what to build
next balancing whether users want
against or what is feasible for the
development team effective
prioritization ensures that the most
impactful features are built first
maximizing the product's value the
fourth step is collaborating with cross
functional teams product managers were
closely with designers Engineers
marketers and also the sales team to
bring the product Vision to life so they
ensure that all the Departments are
aligned and working towards the same
objective for example while Engineers
focus on building the product designers
work more on the user experience and the
marketers plan the launch the product
manager acts as the glue that holds
these pieces together so as we have
covered a product manager's job is all
about coordination and Alignment but
what are the specific skills which are
essential for success in this role let's
talk about the ESS IAL skills of a
product manager the first skill is
empathy empathy is one of the most
important skill a product manager can
have so being able to put yourself in
the customer shoes allows you to better
understand the problems and design
solutions that meets user needs so
whether it's through user servs
interviews or customer feedback empathy
is what drives a successful product the
second skill is strategic thinking
product managers must have long-term
strategic vision for their product they
need to align their decision with the
company's overall goals ensuring that
the product contributes to the broader
business objectives this involves
constantly analyzing the market
competition and future Trends to make
informed decisions the third skill is
technical understanding while product
managers aren't required to be Engineers
they must have a solid grasp of
technology behind the product
understanding the technical constraints
and opportunities helps them make
realistic promises that aligns with
engineering steam capabilities the
fourth skill is having communication and
Leadership since product managers are
the key points of contact between
various teams strong communication
skills are essential they must clearly
convey the product Vision explain
priorities and resolve conflicts they
also need leadership skills to inspire
teams to work towards a common goal even
without having direct authority over
them with the skills in mind let's
explore how the product manager role
differs from other similar positions so
product managers versus product owner
the term product manager and product
owner are often used interchangeably but
they refer to different roles a product
manager is responsible for the broader
strategy and vision of the product while
a product owner is more focused on the
execution and day-to-day task of
managing the product development product
manager focuses more on setting the
product Vision defining success metrics
and working with stakeholders whereas
the product owner work closely with the
development team breaking down task into
actionable Sprints and ensuring the team
is executing accordingly to the product
Vision in aile Frameworks like scrum the
product owner is more of an operational
role while the product manager operates
at a strategic level now that we have
understood these distinctions let's dive
why these product managers are so vital
to a Company Success so why product
managers matter product managers play a
pivotal role in ensuring a product
success in the marketplace so even
without effective product management
companies risk Building Products that
either don't meet customer needs or
don't align with business goals the
product manager ensures that a product
delivers both value and customer to the
business they also bring together
different teams to work toward a common
goal creating alignment across design
development and marketing this holistic
approach leads to better more successful

addressed in a timely manner they use
techniques like mcom method which means
must have should have could have won't
have orise reach impact confidence
effort these techniques can help in
making these decisions for example guys
a product manager for a social media app
has to choose between adding a new
feature for live video streaming or
improving the app security
after assessing the impact of both they
prioritize the security Improvement to
protect user data and build trust even
if it means delaying the new feature now
let us move on to our next skill that is
agile and scrum so guys agile and scrum
are the methodologies that promote
flexibility collaboration and iterative
development in product management agile
involves breaking down a project into
smaller and manageable Parts allowing
for continuous Improvement and a quick
responses to change scrub from a
specific agile framework it uses time
box Sprints to achieve short-term goals
with regular reviews and adjustment for
example guys a product manager at a
software company uses scrum to manage
development of a new mobile app they
work in two week Sprints allowing the
team to release incremental updates
gather user feedback and make necessary
adjustments before the next Sprint next
we have guys performance metric analysis
so guys performance metric analysis
involves tracking and interpreting key
data points that indicate how well a
product is performing the skill is
essential for making data driven
decisions and optimizing the product
metrics that might include user
engagement conversion rates customer
satisfaction or Revenue growth for
example guys a product manager at Online
subscription service monitors customer
retention rates when they notice a
decline they analyze the data that find
users are dropping off and after a free
trial they introduce new feature and
offer personal discounts to improve the
retention so guys this was how
performance metrics help in product
management next let us move on to
effective communication so guys
effective communication is the ability
to clearly convey ideas expectations and
feedback to various stakeholders
including team members Executives and
customers this skill ensures that
everyone involved in the product
development process is aligned and
working towards the same goals it also
involves active listening and the
ability to adapt messages to different
audiences for example guys a product
manager at a retail company regularly
updates the development team marketing
team and Company Executives on the
progress of a new e-commerce platform by
clearly communicating the timeline
challenges and next steps they ensure
that all the teams are coordinated and
working efficiently the next one that we
have all over here is stakeholder
management so guys stakeholder
management involves identifying engaging
and maintaining positive relationships
with all parties interested in the
product success this skill requires
balancing the needs and expectations of
different stakeholders including
customers team members investors and
Executives it is all about building
trust and ensuring that stakeholders are
kept informed and involved at
appropriate stages for example guys a
product manager developing a new
educational app involves teachers
students and parents in the design
process they give the feedback and
adjust product features to meet the
needs of all stakeholders ensuring Broad
support for the app and finally we have
negotiation and conflict resolution so
guys negotiation and conflict resolution
involve finding mutually beneficial
Solutions when there are disagreements
or competing interests the skill is
vital for resolving conflicts within the
team with stakeholders or during
business negotiations a product manager
must be able to navigate the situation
diplomatically ensuring that the product
Success is Not compromised for example
guys a product manager at a
manufacturing company mediates a
conflict between a design team which
wants to use high quality materials and
the finance team which is concerned
about the cost they negotiate by
selecting materials that maintain
quality while staying within the budget
it ensures that the product remains both
affordable and well made so guys this
was the example which covers in
negotiation and conflict resolution
imagine this you're the elm of a product
that has the potential to
revolutionalize its industry perhaps a
smart home device set to simplify lives
or a Sleek app that solves a
longstanding problem the possibilities
seem endless but without a Clear Vision
and plan even the most promising ideas
can fizzle out that's where a product
management road map comes in as a
product manager it's your job to create
a strategic blueprint that guides your
product from concept to reality in this
tutorial we'll explore how to build a
product management road map that not
only charts a path forward but also
aligns stakeholders and keeps everyone
focused on the end goal so firstly we
will cover the agenda for today's
session we will have a brief
introduction to what exactly is product
management the skills required will be
the second part followed by that we will
understand the basic and important roles
and responsibilities of a product
manager and finally the most important
point of today's session which is about
how to build a step-by-step road map for
a product management now let's begin
with the brief introduction to what
exactly is product management so
introduction to product management in
today's competitive business landscape
successful product management is a
strategic road map that not only aligns
with customer needs but also delivers
long-term business value a clear product
road map ensures that all the
stakeholders from product development
teams to executives are on the same page
working towards common goals and
becoming successful so let's walk
through the essential steps in building
an effective road map before that let's
move ahead to the critical skills
required by a product manager so that
you have a clear idea where you stand so
here are the top five skills a product
manager must have firstly strategic
thinking ability to Define long-term
product vision and align it with
business objectives second one is market
research and Analysis Gathering and
intercepting data to understand customer
needs and market trends communication
and collaboration stand third which is
effectively working across teams and
stakeholders to ensure alignment and
progress prioritization and decision-
making is at Fourth which is about
making informed choices to focus on
features and initiatives that deliver
the hard highest value and lastly
technical knowledge and agile
methodology understanding product
development process and techniques to
communicate effectively with engineering
teams along with implementing iterative
process to adapt and deliver products
quickly in a dynamic environment now
moving ahead let's also go through some
of the top five roles and
responsibilities of a product manager so
some of the critical roles and
responsibilities of every product
manager are as follows so first one
product strategy development crafting a
product vision and long-term plan
aligned with business goals next road
map planning creating and maintaining a
strategic road map to guide product
development and releases third one is
cross functional team collaboration
coordinating between teams like
engineering marketing and sales to
ensure seamless execution fourth one is
where we find market and user research
Gathering insights from users and the
market to drive product decisions and
improvements and lastly feature
prioritization and product life cycle
management determining which features to
focus on based on the impact feasibility
and business value and along with
overseeing the product's journey from
ideation to launch and through
iterations or retirement now most of the
basic important part Parts like
introduction to product management
skills required and roles and
responsibilities of a product manager
are covered now we will focus on the
most important point of today's session
which is the product management road map
so first we will get started so here it
goes the road map to product management
so now the first step Define the vision
and objectives the foundation of any
product road map is clearly defined by
the product vision and objectives start
by asking key questions what the problem
is and what problem is the product
solving who is the target audience what
are the long-term goals for the product
your product Vision should articulate
the purpose and the value of the product
brings to the customers while objectives
must be specific measurable and aligned
with the business goals for instance if
your product aims to improve the user's
engagement by 20% your road map should
reflect strategies to drive that
engagement by setting a Clear Vision you
will establish a direction that keeps
your team aligned and motivated creating
a shared understanding of what success
looks like now moving ahead the Second
Step identify key milestones and
deliverables with the product Vision in
place the next step is to break down the
journey into manageable pieces this is
where you identify key milestones and
deliverables think of Milestones as
makers of progress they represent
significant achievements along with the
product development path for example a
milestone could be launching a beta
version of your product or integrating a
new feature by a certain date each
Milestone should be tied to clear
deliverables such as product features or
improvements in functionality this step
ensures that your road map is n just a
list of tasks but a structured path
towards achieving product goals it also
helps in measuring progress and making
adjustments as needed now moving ining
features and initiatives prioritization
is critical to ensure that the most
impactful features are delivered first
to effectively prioritize user framework
such as Moscow method must have should
have could have and or rise Cod ing
research impact confidence and effort
when prioritizing consider customer
needs marketing Trends resource
constraints firstly we'll discuss
customer needs which features will solve
the most pressing problems for your
users followed by that we will focus on
market trends are there emerging
opportunities for competitive threats
you should address then the resource
constraints how much time budget and M
manow will each feature require and then
the prioritization helps focus on
efforts on the features that deliver the
greatest value in the shortest time and
then prioritization helps focus on
efforts prioritization helps Focus
efforts on the features that deliver the
greatest value in shortest time this not
only satisfies customers but also
maximizes return on investment for
business now the fourth step develop a
timeline in phases a road map without a
timeline is like a journey without a map
after prioritizing features it's time to
map them onto a timeline determine
realistic deadlines for each Milestone
and organize your road map into phases
the typical phases include Discovery and
research understanding the market
customers and competitors next is design
and development which is about creating
prototypes Gathering feedback and
iterating on product features third step
is testing and quality analysis which is
about ensuring the product works and
ensuring that the product works as
intended and is free of defects fourth
one is launch and post launch releasing
the product marketing it into customers
and Gathering users feedback is all
about launch and post launch so by
creating a timeline you establish a
Cades for product development this also
helps stakeholders visualize this also
helps stakeholders visualize the flow of
product and anticipate when key
deliverables will be completed now let's
discuss the step five collaborate and
communicate with stakeholders a product
road map is only as effective as the
communication that supports it
continuous collaboration with
stakeholders including Engineers team
Marketing sales and Executives is
essential for Success set up Reg
check-ins and updates to ensure everyone
is informed and aligned transparency
Fosters trust reduces misunderstandings
and helps ensure that the road map
evolves based on realtime feedback and
changes in market conditions using tools
like using tools like jira Trello and
Arena can help in tracking progress and
keeping communication fluid now the LI
rate and adapt a road map isn't static
it is a living document that should be
revised and you're revised as conditions
change once is live Track Performance
metrics such as user engagement customer
satisfaction and revenue growth if
prioritization shifts or priorities
shift due to Market changes new
competitors or customer feedback be
prepared to adapt agile product
management encourages continuous
iteration so make sure your road map is
flexible enough to accommodate new
information and changing business needs
so it's crucial to remember that a
successful product road map is not about
sticking rigidly to the plan but about
delivering the most value to users and
the business so guys let's start by
understanding what is product Market fit
guys product Market fit refers to the
moment when company's product resonates
deeply with its Target customers it's
when customers not only buy the product
but also use it regularly and recommend
it to others
helping the product gain attraction and
sustain growth over the time this
concept is critical for any business
that wants to achieve long-term
profitability and also success
entrepreneurs and venture capitalist
like Mark Anderson who is widely
credited with popularizing the idea
describes product Market fit as finding
a good market and creating a product
that meets the needs of that market it's
not just about launching a product it's
about ensuring that the product satis
safies a significant demand within the
choosen Market without this alignment
between the product and market growth
will be significant and demand will be
chosen within the market so guys without
this alignment between product and
market growth will be stunted and
profitability will be difficult to
achieve Dan osen a renowned product
management expert developed a framework
known as the product Market fed pyramid
which helps basically companies navigate
the process of achieving this alignment
now let us try to move ahead and
understand why product Market fit is
important so guys Alice schules
Facebook's vice president of growth has
emphasized that one of the common issues
he observes in the company that he
advises is misconception around product
Market fit many companies believe that
they have achieved it when they actually
haven't why does it matter so much why
do vure capitalist frequently require
evidence of product Market fit before
investing in a company and why do Mark
Anderson divide the startup journey into
two distinct phases before product
Market fit and after product Market fit
the answer is pretty simple guys until
you confirm that your product has a
large enough market of customers willing
to pay for it your company shouldn't
focus on scaling other strategic
objectives like upselling and before
product Market fit these efforts are
premature and potentially
counterproductive for example guys is
spending money on advertising or
expanding Sal team doesn't make sense if
you haven't first proven that there's
sufficient market for your product
achieving product Market fit means that
your product has demonstrated enough
value that a significant number of
people want it it's at this point that
the business can begin focusing on
growth strategies but before reaching
this stage the primary goal is to
validate that the product solves a real
problem for the market in short guys
product Market fit is the foundation for
long-term growth without it even the
best of your sales and marketing efforts
are likely to fall short so guys as you
can see all over here so there are
certain reasons like product Market fit
is important like I have mentioned
sustainable growth resource efficiency
investors confidence customer loyalty
and competitive Advantage so these are
some of the main reasons why product
Market fit is important but now the
question arises who is responsible for
the product Market fit while product
Market fit is often associated with the
roles of product managers and marketers
the reality is that it's a company's
wide responsibility every team from
sales to customer support and finance
plays a role in helping the company
raise this Milestone the product team
may be at the Forefront of creating a
product but customer feedback from sales
and support teams can provide invaluable
insights the finance department also
plays a key role by tracking key metrics
that indicate invaluable insights and
also whether the company is making
progress towards product Market fit or
not in essence of achieving product
Market fit it requires collaboration
across all the Departments it's not just
about developing the right product it's
also about making sure that the entire
organization is aligned and focused on
meeting the needs of customer now let us
talk about a very important question
that how to measure the product Market
fit so guys there is no definitive
metric to tell a company that it has
achieved product Market fit however
several indicators can signal that you
are on the right path Andrew Chen a
venture capitalist offers some useful
guidelines for assessing the product
Market fit the first one is customer
feedback like our customers showing a
willingness to switch to your product
when your potential customers try your
product do the express a preference for
it or other competitors Market
differentiation like have customers who
previously rejected other Solutions now
turn to your product are you offering
something distinct that captures their
interest like the competitive grouping
the customers intuitively understand
which other products yours competes with
if they place your products in the same
category as leading Alternatives it
indicates you are playing right in the
market so guys as you can see all over
here now let us try to understand some
of the other measures the next reason is
product understanding like do customers
clearly grasp what sets your products
apart if they can easily identify your
products unique selling points then you
are on the right track next we have the
retention rates like how do your metrics
such as customer retention rates
compared to those of your competitors
strong retention is a good sign that you
are providing value to your customers
these signals incompass both qualitative
and quantitative measures reflecting
that product Market Market fit is just
not about numbers but it's also about
customer perception and behavior so guys
now let us discuss about some of the
qualitative measures for example we have
first one that is Word of Mouth
according to Mark and reent one of the
best indicators of product Market fit is
when customer start promoting your
product on their own they essentially
become your sales representative by
recommending your product to others next
is Media attention like we get increased
call from media outlets and IST suggest
that your product is gaining visibility
and credibility in the industry frequent
media coverage can indicate growing
Market interest in your offering by
tracking both qualitative and
quantitative metrics company can better
understand where the products stand and
want the path toward product Market fit
now the biggest question arises how to
achieve product Market fit so guys
there's no Universal formula for
achieving the product Market fit the Dan
allson book The Lean product Playbook
provides a six framework that helps team
towards this goal so guys the first is
determine your Target customer first
identify who your product is for this
involves understanding the demographic
psychographic and behavioral
characteristic of your ideal customer
without a clear target audience it's
difficult to design a product that meets
the real needs next is identify the
underserved needs it means that you have
to assess the unmet or poorly met needs
of your target audience by identifying
the gaps in the existing products you
can tailor your solutions to address
those areas this step is very crucial
for differentiating your product from
the competitor next is Define your value
proposition based on the needs you have
identified craft a value proposition
that clearly communicates why your
product is the best solution for your
target audience you have to also tell
what unique benefits does it offers and
how does it solve the C customer problem
more effectively than the Alternatives
specify your minimum viable product so
guys specifying your MVP feature set is
very very important an MVP is a simplest
version of your product that still
delivers value to your Target customers
the goal is to focus only on the core
features that addresses the most
pressing customer needs rather than
trying to build a fully featured product
Right Way by launching an MVP you can
get a feedback and iterate good Qui L
develop your MVP then once all the MVP
features set is defined the next step is
to build and launch it the initial
version of your product should be
focused on delivering the core value
proposition while allowing you to GA the
data and insights from real customer
next is test your MVP with the customers
finally once the MVP is live collect
feedback from your Target customers use
this feedback to refine and improve the
product testing helps validate whether
your product meets the needs of the
customers and market and also provides
the valuable insights for future
iteration achieving product Market fit
is an ongoing process it requires
continuous refinement of your product
based on customer feedback and market
conditions however by following this
structured approach your team can stay
focused on the key elements that drive
the product Market fit so guys we have
come to the end of this video and before
that I want to say something that
product Market fit is a vital milestone
for any company it is the point at which
your product gains enough attraction in
the market to support sustainable growth
without it even the most ambitious
business strategies are unlikely to
succeed the journey to the product
Market fit is often challenging and it
requires both a deep understanding of
the customer needs and willingness to
iterate on your product but guys once
achieved product Market fit can unlock
the potential for rapid growth and
long-term success for cracking an
interview it's First Essential to
understand what product sense is product
sense and product managers consistently
display a strong sense of the product so
let's move ahead with this session and
understand how to crack a product sense
interview but before moving ahead don't
forget to subscribe to our channel so
that you never miss an update from
Simply learn so today we'll start this
session with what is product sense and
how to develop a product sense moving
ahead we'll understand the product sense
interviews and how to gain product sense
following that we'll take a look at what
a product sense interviewer is looking
to see and some sample questions and
stick to the end because we will wrap
this session by providing you with some
tips to follow to crack the products
since interviews so let's start with the
session and understand what is product
sense understanding a product's
requirements is known as having product
sense one of the actual hard talents
that good product managers should
possess is product sense it's a key
element of product development and any
product strategy it is a crucial talent
for Designing Goods with people in mind
a product success depends on addressing
consumer demands and product sense is a
form of forsite many businesses
prioritize product sense while choosing
individuals for PM positions true
product sense goes well beyond the
design and user experience of the
solution one of the components of the
product s equation is anticipating the
downsides and trade-offs of each product
decision and knowing which ideas to
reject is also included in it
understanding why a product would or
wouldn't function is necessary and
product sense helps you identify the
issues your product resolves and how to
add new features that work similarly the
ability of PMS to understand products
has long been
mysterious now let's understand how to
develop a product sense strong product
sense is a quality that product managers
consistently exhibit they also provide
value that meets client requirements
while updating such items most product
management use scenarios have this goal
in mind though it is sometimes simpler
said than done improving revenue and
profit margins May mean sacrificing
these objectives product managers and
leaders May improve this ability and
develop their intuitive sense of user
demands in a variety of ways there are
are three components that make up
product sense number one compassion this
is the capacity to mimic several
distinct personalities who are not like
you in terms of their thought processes
having the ability to state that in this
circumstance this sort of user will
respond in this way or to assert that
our business partners would react in a
certain way or even that our Rivals will
see our move in a certain way one
crucial aspect of product sense is the
ability to honestly do that well going
above and beyond to get into user shoes
into their thinking and into their
problems helps you develop a strong
product sense talking to various people
and partners is a definitive technique
to increase your empathy don't just
converse with them and accept what they
tell you as you go about doing this the
most crucial component of developing
this empathy is to try to understand why
they're saying what they're saying
although you won't always have the user
in front of you to ask what would work
you may accurately forecast it by
knowing why they feel or act the way
they do number two originality the
ability to think creatively and generate
fresh solutions to a given circumstance
or challenge is the most elusive but
significant component of product sense
it is the responsibility of the product
manager to specify the construction
process you may develop the key Talent
of creative thinking to do this it might
be a force multiplier to be able to come
up with novel solutions to Consumer
issues in addition to providing sensible
answers the top product managers also
Inspire Innovation after all nothing has
ever been constructed before without the
use of creativity setting strategy
prioritizing new ideas and putting them
into practice all need
creativity and number three domain
knowledge when you have a deep
understanding of the industry you work
in ideas for what kind of product to
create and how to create it will
automatically come to you better and
more accurately to be more precise I'd
advise putting your attention on
understanding your users and consumers
the competitors and what they're up to
and any opportunities or constraints
presented by technology functional
expertise is concerned with the product
management process whereas domain
expertise is focused on the market I
contend that this is distinct from
talents the art of influencing is one
such influencing is a crucial ability
for PMS since they have a lot of
responsibility and limited control over
other people the market consumers
industry opponents products and Etc are
all part of the domain experience yes
some technical expertise is required but
the market is still the major concern
otherwise you run the risk of becoming
technology driven missing Market
possibilities or misinterpreting client
wants now let's move on to the basic
detailing of the product sense
interview product interviews not only
attain questions based on the product
sense but also analytical questions and
case studies in most cases the product
sense interviews hold on to the
questions like which is the product you
like the most why do you like it and
what kind of improvements do you want to
make to it or the interviewer can ask
you about a particular product maybe
just like Google Maps the interviewer
can ask about how you would improve
Google Maps and its services the
questions about actual products are
occasionally included in the product
sense interviews a product's design and
strategy might also be the basis for
these inquiries for example what design
principles would you use to create a
YouTube clone app that runs in the
background regardless of whether a
product is digital or physical the
solutions for its design or marketing
tactics always stay the same PM
interviews evaluate three key
competencies product sense execution and
behavioral competencies every employer
has a unique interview process but they
all assess the same fundamental
competencies hard as it may be to admit
most interviewers need rapid thinking
and responses quick thinking is
facilitated by Frameworks your
interviewer for the execution is
searching for if you can quantify what
matters and apply analytics to make
datadriven judgments if you can identify
and balance various tradeoffs to make
wise product selections and if you can
efficiently use your limited time and
resources to have the greatest impact
now let us understand what the
interviewer is trying to see in you or
trying to judge you on the interviewer
mostly asks you about the four things
based on a product context
prioritization creativity metrics
context the interviewer will ask you
about the context of the problem
statement do you get the context of the
problem are you able to empathize with
which context the product is going to be
used who will be the users of the
product and what will be the
difficulties the users will face with
these particular products how can we
resolve such difficulties and many more
prioritization are you able to
prioritize from all the major points
segments and use cases you have
developed the appropriate collection of
segments and pinpoints supporting your
decisions with logic and data such
questions are asked by the
interviewer creativity the interiew
interviewer will always want you to
provide a creative solution for the
problem statement because this is where
your ability to think of a creative
solution to the problem and your ability
to design comes into being metrics the
interviewer may ask if you can come up
with the metrics against which you will
judge your product intervention well
these are the four primary aspects
around which the product sense interview
will roam the interviewer is going to
check your ability to think design
strategize and create the interviewer
doesn't expect you to come up with a
solution that will change the whole face
or the product they are typically trying
to find out if you have the structure of
the product based on the problems and
their Solutions in your
mind before moving ahead here's a
question for you all what is your
favorite product and why do let us know
in the comments
below now let's know what makes a
product manager gain a thriving product
sense design in products training good
PMS are familiar with design and an MBA
is beneficial the subjects of product
design and Innovation are two of the
favorites of usual PMS some used to
create stuff and get feedback throughout
several rounds it might be challenging
to take criticism on the job seriously
and promptly case studies in marketing
academically speaking marketing includes
products product pricing location and
promotion are the four Ps the MBA
program is a marketing master class and
in the case of study simulations you
compete against other teams and in that
way you pick things up much more quickly
hard skills great PMS need to influence
without being in charge these frequently
involve knowledge of corporate
operations research techniques and best
practices in product management here
hard skills are crucial clubs happy hour
and corporate outings make up half of
the MBA your social abilities will
significantly Advance as a result
Network in the field of product
management networking generally entails
locating decision makers significant
stakeholders influencers and other
experts and forming productive
connections with them now I know people
who manage billion dooll hedge VC and PE
firms there's just no likelihood that as
a manager in technology I would know
these
folks analyzing a problem related to
metrics choosing the appropriate metrics
to track and examine results in better
informed choices being made throughout
the product development process these
metrics provide the business with
tangible proof of the components of the
product or customer experience that are
not connecting with customers this
data-driven knowledge may be used by the
product marketing and sales teams to
better understand the drivers of their
consumer profiles the corporation uses
this information to better its products
going forward measuring
impacts the next stage is to express
specifically what you expect this
adjustment to accomplish once you have
identified the relevant measurements
goals that are smart or Mt if you prefer
and make it obvious if they were
achieved are good
goals moving on let's know what your
product sense interviewer is looking to
see can you clearly articulate who you
are building for why and how it fits
into the meta Mission can you provide
thoughtful reasoning for why meta should
or should not focus on specific aspects
of the broadest possible product
opportunity at hand can you provide a
thorough vision for your desired MVP
experience to test out your hypothesis
as well as your desired instate for this
product say 3 years out this comes down
to concretely defining priori and
goals can you zoom out from your
personal user needs and think about how
this product could scale and provide
maximum value to meta's Global user base
of over three billion
people product sense interview questions
will typically be in the form of one
very deep hypothetical what would you
build for X with a series of follow-up
questions to understand your thought
process let's now have a look at a few
sample questions the interview viewer
may ask you how would you improve
Instagram stories build a Facebook
product for travel how would you build
Facebook birthday if it weren't there
how can we improve Google Maps create a
photo sharing app for Google build a
music app for Facebook moving on let's
have a look at the tips that you may
follow to crack the sense interview
knowing what the interviewer can ask you
should understand what aspect the
interviewer is looking for in you
adhere to the framework the product
sense interview is all about following
the structural framework to provide an
ethical and practical solution to the
problem given to you it's not every time
about creativity the solution should be
more practical the interviewer is
majorly looking for your structural
approach to provide the
solution questioning the approach is
your interviewer's main area of emphasis
you are not required to respond as soon
as you hear the question from the
interviewer it's acceptable to take a
break and ask the interviewer a
clarifying question if you're having
trouble comprehending what is being
asked of you this will help you realize
exactly what the interviewer needs to
know even if you think you understand
the question you should nevertheless
paraphrase it to make sure you're not
missing any important details reiterate
the structure you're going to use after
a brief pause of 10 to 20 seconds and
give a layout while responding to the
question so the interviewer can see your
response more clearly research the firm
and become acquainted with its main
offerings it's the firm that's hiring
you so at least they are going to ask
you about their concern product as well
being familiar with their products will
give you a vision of what exactly the
company wants from you and you will be
able to structurize your opinions so
before going for the interview you must
go through the company's background its
workings and its products
be versatile most interview discussions
don't go as expected so never impose a
framework by checking in with the
interviewer regularly and stopping you
may make the dialogue casual and free
flowing Define the product goal instead
of using a statistic Define the product
goal in terms of the customer problem
metrics are only a way to measure
progress they are not the driving force
behind product development people's
issues are resolved through products for
instance Google map's objective is to
assist users in navigating the world not
to boost the volume of Route

question for you all what does a tool
stand for do let us know in the comments
below software for product management is
an administrative tool used to produce
and enhance a company's Goods rapidly
and effectively along with successfully
enhancing business profits these tools
allow product managers and their teams
to gather fresh Concepts and develop
detailed strategies to turn them into
actual products although these
Technologies are typically utilized by
product managers and product teams they
also give other departments such as
marketing and sales additional Clarity
and insight into product development
product management is used for product
analysis development tracking and Road
mapping whenever we concern tools for
product managers we often mean the basic
handful of tools that the majority of us
use daily these product management tools
typically consist of software for
product analytics development tracking
and Road mapping however a product
manager's duties go beyond simply
Gathering product perspicuity surveying
the backlog and evaluating the product
plan whether you are a beginner or an
experienced product manager you should
utilize the right tool to ensure you are
not overlooking a crucial aspect of your
job product managers are frequently in
charge of organizing the examination
choice and purchase of product
Management Solutions for usage inside
their company it might be challenging to
choose the best product management
solution though now let's move ahead in
our session and know what considerations
should be taken before choosing tools
for product management depending on the
requirements of the business each
product firm will have a unique
collection of tools in its accumulation
the set of tools that the product team
employs to manage their operations is
known as product management tool
accumulation these tools are frequently
integrated ated where they perform well
together and complement one another the
product development efforts May succeed
or fail greatly depending on the choice
of product management tools so to have a
successful product there should be some
considerations to follow up on before
choosing a management tool so let's take
a look at the concerns one must heed
before choosing a product management
tool the very first consideration that
should be taken is to recognize the
demands of your product management staff
making a charter with a list of
questions for your new product
management tool is an intelligent method
to assess the requirements of your
product management team the charter will
Aid in outlining particular demands and
may be used as a benchmark for assessing
items the next consideration that should
be considered is to do some product
research it's time to research the
various product possibilities after you
have a clearer idea of your demands and
criteria for a product reading product
reviews and seeing product
demonstrations are the most significant
ways to accomplish this you will have a
deeper grasp of the features and how
each product functions by doing the
research for the product moving on we
have to consider items depending on
product needs following your research
it's time to analyze the items in light
of your unique needs start by grading
each item according to how effectively
it satisfies your needs to rank the
various items you may add a column to
each need to rank the various items this
stage will enable you to evaluate and
contrast several Solutions and decide
which product management Suite is best
for your team the next consideration is
to aim to stay within your budget when
looking at product Management Solutions
budget is always an important
consideration but if you work for a
startup or a smaller firm it's much more
crucial keep in mind that some of the
top Goods could have steep asking prices
as well as ongoing costs the simplest
method to achieve this is to set a
predetermined budget for your product
tool and use it as a guide when weighing
various
possibilities then we have to make sure
that the tool is with effortless use
make sure the tool you use is simple to
use before you buy it although it should
be obvious certain Technologies are
quite complex and need users to undergo
many days of training the technology
that works best for you and your team
will be the one one that you find simple
to use many tools allow you to try them
out for free so you may decide whether
to buy them before you use them the next
consideration is reporting in real time
find a product tool that offers
real-time reporting to save time
creating reports that reflect the
product's current condition will gather
data from many parts of the product
management systems moving on we have a
reputable interface although there are a
lot of tools available some of them
appear somewhat dated expandability
needs to be your main Criterion When
selecting a tool opting for something
attractive looking doesn't hurt either
the last consideration that should be
taken is security scalability is great
but if your data isn't secure neither is
the Integrity of your product examine
the security features that your desired
tool supplier offers to keep your client
data private and isolated from everyone
else's choose a different dedicated
hosting platform
let's proceed in our session and know
what top tools are used for product
management how do you assess and
determine which tools are best for your
team consider your firm and product size
and development stage as a starting
point a tiny firm with one product
manager for instance probably won't
require or have the funds for numerous
tools you could pick a few applications
that provide a wide range of
Integrations and features a huge
organization on the other hand would
require specific tools created for
complex work streams and several
teams the very first functioning of
product management is user tracking and
Analysis user tracking enables you to
follow online visitors while they browse
your website anonymously and Via a
variety of methods a product manager's
research creation process includes user
tracking in terms of analysis a wide
range of tools is accessible for
tracking and Gathering data about the
demands of the user for the product
these tools may be quite useful for
gathering information and understanding
how users of your software or visitors
to your website interact with your
offerings and content platforms for
product analytics collect and assist you
in analyzing what those customers do but
merely what they say and think you'll
want a product management platform such
as done dun that provides distinct
analytics and insight into how customers
utilize your product user tracking and
analytics can be done using
pendo the tool used for user tracking
and analytics is pendo pendo assists
businesses in determining who is using

features people like and don't like as

may examine how product adoption differs
depending on an account a user's job or
their attitude their objective is to

negotiating abilities and data-driven
planning that make product management so

approach to do a task that many PMS
ignore but really

benefit from having a greater
understanding of the whole client
experience with your business after
creating a customer Journey map a
correctly made Journey map will display
every interaction a person has with your

purchase and use of your product the
tool used for flowcharting is Microsoft

capabilities can be useful for outlining
any particular elements of a user's
workflow or experience with your product
the flowcharts you generate using these
tools may help you get insights into how
to strategically prioritize your product
road map since they provide a visual
representation of that workflow or
experience rather than just a list of
the stages your client will take apart

let's start with the session and know
about product management metrics and
kpis like other company teams product
management teams utilize key performance
indicators or kpis to set clear goals
and natural choices recognize success
and spot risks and problems a lack of

it challenging to evaluate and learn
from past work and make it difficult to

streams when progress fears off course
the product manager often defines these
kpis depend on what they think are the

report on the product's success and the
product management process are
ultimately measured and improved using
product
kpis the breadth of the product
manager's kpis might vary depending on
the organization's procedures and
product type the kpis could
significantly favor the design and
manufacturing of the product for
instance if the team's primary goal is
product development however if they want
to recognize the influence on the
customer the kpis might be more broad to
include use and consumer behaviors the
decision making process about the kpis
that matter must ultimately be left to
the product team leader although it
should be highly influenced by the
organization's top level goals let's Now
understand what are product management
metrics metrics for product management
give product managers The crucial
information they require to monitor the
performance and health of their products
your product is more likely to offer
accurate insights on what adds value to
your current users and help convert
potential users by setting and tracking
the proper metrics product metrics are
used by product managers to recognize
which features are most used underused
or completely ineffective finding out
how customers interact with a product
find out how frequently people return
after registering test how well your
product is received by customers
identify the user cohorts that are power
users and others there are five basic
metrics that are used to measure the
success of a product the very first
metrics of product management are growth
and activation in product management
growth refers to boosting the utility
and user base of an already existing
product product management seeks to make
an existing product more successful as
opposed to Conventional product
management which focuses on managing all
operations necessary to bring a
lucrative product to the Market to
maximize user retention during
onboarding and the initial hours or days
the term activation is used onboarding
customers with less friction educating
them about the benefits of your product
and gaining their early commitment are
all examples of activation goals this
holds several kpis number of users per
session traffic churn rate the next
metric used for product management is
retention the capacity of a business or
product to keep customers over time is
referred to as customer retention if a
business or product has a high customer
retention rate it implies that consumers
keep utilizing or repurchasing that good
or service low customer retention refers
to the rate at which consumers
discontinue utilizing or purchasing a
company's Goods or service effects of
retention total company growth and
client loyalty when considering extra
products or Services loyal clients are
more inclined to stay with a reputable
business retention as a metric holds crr
CLTV the next metrics we're going to
discuss is engagement measuring user
involvement enables you to determine
whether customers value your offering
logins downloads and the amount of time
people spend on your website are all
indicators of engagement engagement
holds daily and monthly active users
session duration moving on we have user
happiness as the next metric used in
product management since user happiness
is a self-reported statistic asking
users to estimate their happiness rather
than observing their behavior is
necessary happiness in the context of
products and services refers to a
gratifying or enjoyable user experience
contentment joy and Delight are
additional nouns that can be used to
denote happiness user happiness is a
self-reported assessment thus rather
than observing people's actions you need
to ask them how happy they are that also
implies that Prejudice and feelings are
present in this situation user happiness
holds NPS rating on the App Store and
the last metric used for product
management is revenue revenue is the
cash that a firm generates via its
operations depending on the accounting
technique used there are several ways to
compute Revenue sales made on credit
will be included as revenue for products
or Services provided to the client under
acral accounting Revenue may be
recognized following certain standards
even though payment has not yet been
made the cash flow statement must be
examined to determine how well a
business collects debts cash accounting
on the other hand only counts sales as
Revenue when payment is made Revenue
holds CAC mrr arpu now let's move ahead
in our session and understand what are
product management kpis the success of a
team may be measured using kpis for
product management product management
sales and marketing team as well as
other business experts use these kpis to
set objectives track development and
address problems because they offer
advice on setting priorities and
assigning tasks kpis are beneficial for
product managers and other team leaders
the creation and management of
highquality products for a corporation
depend on these metrics product managers
can carry out the following tasks thanks
to kpis establish goals track
development take notes on prior work
make sensible choices manage competitors
resolve issues deliver highquality
products the very first product
management kpi is monthly recurring
revenue or mrr a company's predictable
income stream from month to month is
measured by its monthly recurring
Revenue this metric's main objective is
to compare performance between different
subscription terms or packages each with
unique features and costs for companies
that provide software as a service or
saas or make money by selling
subscription services
this type of technology is ideal these
sales activities are recurring and
simpler to predict than onetime
purchases product managers May monitor
the business's Financial Health and
track the rise or drop of monthly
Revenue using Mr this gauges a product's
monthly gross sales if you wish to
compute this you must take into account
the mrr at the beginning of the month
add the income from new customers and
subtract the number of customers you
lost for subscription BAS businesses
like saas where no further sales are
made after a client becomes recurring
mrr is simple to evaluate monthly
recurring income is calculated by
multiplying the average monthly Revenue
per user by the overall number of users
for a particular month the next product
management kpi is the customer retention
rate it is the proportion of clients who
remain clients after a specific amount
of time the length of time you can keep
clients will be measured using this KP
pi and product management you should
also check to see if steps are
consistently done to keep clients if the
number of customers departing starts to
fall without a retention plan it is
common for firms to focus solely on
recruiting new clients while utterly
disregarding their current clientele
asking your former clients why they
choose to stop doing business with you
is another strategy you may employ to
lower the retention rate always remember
that acquiring new consumers is harder
than maintaining relationships with your
current clientele older customers are
more likely to spend more money with you
than new ones additionally it is common
for current customers to test new
features upgrade plans or offer comments
it could be more profitable for a
corporation to concentrate on keeping
them the retention rate is equal to
customers at the end of a period minus
new customers divided by customers at
the beginning of the period times 100
moving on the next product management
kpi is the net promoter score the number
of current customers who are likely to
recommend your product to a friend or
colleague is measured by a kpi called
net promoter score it keeps track of the
number of consumers that aren't
interested in your goods or detractors
customers who give you a rating of N9 or
10 are the ones who will remain loyal to
you they sing psalms about your brand
and are referred to be promoters or
Advocates NPS equals the ratio of
promoters to detractors the specific
definition of a good NPS score is ill
defined the ideal NPS score does not
exist depending on the industry it
varies a firm in the electronics sector
can have a higher NPS score than one in
the Telecom sector the percentage of
patrons who are inclined to suggest a
product or promoters and those who
disapprove of it or detractors is known
as the net promoter score a high NPS
promotes growth and knowing how many
customers are complaining might help a
company identify a problem with the
customer experience this measure
displays the most popular product
features and may Inspire teams to come
up with fresh concepts for brand new
features or improved ux design here's
the equation NPS is calculated as the
percentage of promoters minus the
percentage of detractors the next kpi
used in product management is average
revenue per user the average revenue per
user is the amount of money a business
May anticipate from a single client this
is an excellent technique for an saas
business to evaluate the effects of a
new strategy a new subscription plan or
a pricing change which client segments
provide the greatest value may be
determined by running the computation
for several subgroups this can provide
information to investors about

recurring Revenue divided by total
accounts the next product management kpi
is customer acquisition cost the
anticipated cost of acquiring One

customer acquisition cost understanding
the necessity of measuring CAC is
essential if you plan to operate a firm
for the long term CAC covers the money
you spend on Advertising overhead the
effort of the sales staff software used

obtaining cash from investors might also
be aided by it product managers May
learn from CLTV how much money they can
spend on acquiring and retaining
customers these expenses include those
for lead creation Market marketing and
retention tactics they want to ensure
that their expenditures are reasonable
given the return on their investment
establish the average customer lifetime
and average revenue per user for your
company to compute CLTV CLTV equals
average revenue per user times average
customer lifetime the next product
management kpi is the number of
customers acquired the number is not
reserved only for your sales and
marketing staff the quantity of
customers you have obtained is a good
sign that your product is successful if
the discrepancy between the amount you
anticipate and the actual acquisition is
significant either your skills have been
overestimated or the product hasn't yet
gained much traction you may use this to
identify areas where the product may be
improved learn more about the reasons
why your product failed and then act
right away to redesign it to get a
broader appeal the number of new users
new user percentage and percentage rise
in user base are a few of the product
management kpis to monitor that are
connect Ed to the acquisition the next
kpi used in product management is Bounce
rate the percentage of people that visit
one page on a website or app before
leaving quickly is known as the bounce
rate this measure gives essential
information about how users behave while
interacting with a company's digital
content if a business has a high bounce
rate it should look for strategies to
hold users interest for longer it is a
statistic that assesses the proportion
of people that access just one page
before leaving the website or simply
staying for a brief period the bounce
rate provides you a chance to improve
the offering so that the visitor
explores more pages and progresses
farther down the sales funnel you may
boost the average user's focus on the
website by using this statistic the
bounce rate should be decreased
according to the product manager the
next kpi for product management is churn
rate the pace at which customers depart
a business or the churn rate is the
reverse of the retention rate
particularly following a product
modification it provides information on
client satisfaction two different
turnover rates exist client churn and
churn and revenue customer churn refers
to the number of users who have ceased
using your services or canceling their
subscriptions the business's Revenue
lost as a result of client churn is
measured by Revenue churn while we would
suggest focusing more on customer
turnover than Revenue churn the latter
is still crucial because it may reveal a
lot about customer happiness customer
turn rate equals customers's loss
divided by total
customers moving on the next product
management kpi is the customer
satisfaction score the level of a
client's happiness with a product or
service feature is known as the customer
satisfaction score companies can
identify it by conducting customer
satisfaction surveys which are typically
rated on a scale of 1 to 10 this can
assist managers and staff in determining
how they might enhance their efforts to
provide a better client experience a
leader can use it to decide whether they
want to do a more in-depth qualitative
examination of client happiness CSC is a
metric that assesses consumer
satisfaction with a given commodity or
service customers are asked to rate
their satisfaction with a particular
item or service using a rating scale in
this kind of survey this metric is
calculated by adding the scores and
dividing them by the total number of
respondents CSC gauge GES how satisfied
a single feature or service is whereas
NPS gauges total satisfaction to
continually learn from the customer how
they like utilizing a certain feature
use CSC frequently make sure you address
their problems based on the feedback to
provide them with compelling reasons to
renew the product the next kpi we have
for product management is the number of
users per session a product manager May
learn which aspects of an app are most
used by monitoring the number of user
activities every session this is
dependent upon the acts that a user
repeats this is particularly beneficial
if a business is evaluating the use of a
new website or application component
they can measure client interest in the
modification to see whether it is
intriguing or practical kpis are used to
monitor if a product is still meeting
client demands this kpi monitors user
activity on your website and mobile
application any action they do and the
characteristics they employ fall under
this category this is a potent kpi that
may direct your approach to feature
uptake the next kpi is traffic the
volume of users who locate and assess
websites are referred to as traffic it
may be organic emerging spontaneously or
it may be paid emerging as a result of
sponsorship of content or the purchase
of advertising space by a business
people that are in traffic are typically
curious about a company and may
eventually make a
purchase this is a useful indicator for
assessing the success of your internet
marketing additionally it may be eye
openening to know where your traffic
comes from you will be able to identify
the most effective channels for you when
you measure sponsored traffic you will
be able to identify which platforms
perform best and which don't if you have
a variety of channels where you post
content to generate organic traffic
analyzing this measure will be fun for
your marketing team you should ask the
user why there isn't more active
participation if you see that the
engagement rate is low send your clients
questionnaires to learn where you are
falling short and how you can enhance
their experience to encourage them to
utilize more of your product moving
ahead the next kpi used for product
management is session duration the
amount of time a person spends
interacting with a website during a
session strategies to monitor the use of
digital products include this kind of
measure although revenue is not measured
customer involvement is and this has a
big influence on sales the more a
customer engages with a business's
website and digital content the more
probable it is that they will purchase
anything from that business online
resources may offer Vital Information to
prospective customers about the goods
goals and values of a business longer
session times demonstrate user interest
in a website which is beneficial the
success of a marketing campaign may be
measured by user interactions which can
also Foster brand loyalty these kinds of
measures that are centered on the
customer are great strategies to
increase financial performance the
number is crucial because it lets you
know how valuable the information in
your offering is in the end it will have
an impact on client loyalty and
retention rate adding new videos and
links and enhancing your website's
General design are the only ways to
improve it session duration equals the
total time users spend on your product
divided by the number of
users the other kpi is daily and monthly
active users how many active daily and
monthly users you have is an important
product consumption measure it
demonstrates whether your product is
compelling enough you must select a time
frame and kind of interaction when
defining active users users are active
if they complete the interaction within
the specified time frame you can think
of them as inactive users if they don't
the number of unique users that visit
your digital product on a daily or
monthly basis is tracked by the daily
active user and monthly active user
counts daily active users are the daily
total of active users users who are
active each month are counted as monthly
active users to get a clear picture of
how engaging your product is compare
your active users daily and monthly to
your entire user base the last kpi used
for product management is rating on the
App Store users may give your app a St
rating on a scale of 1 to five the
summary rating of your app which appears
on your product page and in search
results is based on user ratings when
you publish a new version of your app
you have the option to reset the summary
rating which is unique to each region on
the App Store however we advise being
cautious when using this function having
few ratings May deter potential users
from installing your app even if
refreshing the summary rating might
guarantee that it matches the most
recent version of your program which can
be advantageous if an update answers
customers prior issues now let's move
ahead in our session and know the
Frameworks used for product management
so in this video we will be discussing
the two most important Frameworks of
product management that is heart
framework and R framework so let's first
understand the heart framework an
approach to enhance software user
experience is called the heart framework
according to five indicators focused on
the user the frame frork AIDS businesses
in assessing any part of their user
experience the heart framework which was
created for user experience designers
and researchers may be a helpful
technique for product managers since it
is centered on developing a deeper
understanding of user behavior and user
preferences Google ux created the heart
framework 10 years ago as a means of
precisely defining product kpis to
enable datadriven decisionmaking it aids
in defining and delivering user centered
product metrics the heart framework may
be used by product managers to
prioritize features assess the
performance of a product and make more
datadriven product choices the user's
experience is measured by heart instead
of focusing on system or technology
metrics like failures we wish to pay
more attention to user data like usage
frequency these categories include
happiness engagement adoption retention
task success adoption the rate of users
who finish the trial or onboarding
process and switch to regular use is
known as adoption it tracks the success
of your client acquisition and
activation processes and enables you to
pinpoint the factors that encourage
repeat usage task
success to determine whether users can
successfully execute their tasks using
your solution look at task success based
on the findings of these tests you may
modify your app's functionality such as
the back end to make sure information
flows through it smoothly and delivers
the outcomes users are looking for
engagement user activity is gauged via
engagement depending on your product
this may include the number of sessions
each week the number of likes or
downloads the length of sessions the
number of transactions as well as other
metrics it is vital to Define track and
monitor suitable user behaviors in your
app the findings will provide you
invaluable insights into how people use
your app and you will be able to observe
the effects of any changes you make
retention the percentage of people that
often utilize your product is measured
by retention it's important to keep
track of who is and isn't returning to
your product and why as negative
retention also known as churn will
affect how your product performs in the
market happiness users levels of
happiness reflect their opinions of your
product it is a way to gauge how
satisfied users are and methods include
surveys inapp reviews and net promoter
score or NPS this is quite helpful when
determining how customers feel about the
most recent version of your product or
the addition of a new feature this may
then affect the features you decide to
preserve and the ones you decide to
create now coming toward the end of our
session let's learn about the r
framework one of the most often used
Frameworks for measuring growth and
success ESS in saas and startup
businesses is the r model the pirate
metrics or pirate framework are other
names for it it was first proposed by
David McClure the founder of practical
Venture Capital it divides your client
life cycle into five phases and
correlates each with relevant kpis
starting with the initial point of
contact and continuing until a potential
customer converts to a pengin this will
offer you a clear understanding of which
state stages of the client life cycle
are succeeding and where there is room
for improvement in your conversion
funnel R is a startup metric approach
created by entrepreneur and angel
investor David McClure often known as
startup metrics for pirates you may
improve the user experience for your
customers by using these metrics which
reflect all consumer activity patterns
they let you measure conversions more
accurately and concentrate on the best
channels the nicest part about R is that
it does doesn't require any
technological expertise making it simple
to comprehend for both seasoned
entrepreneurs embarking on new projects
and for newcomers with brand new
Enterprises in short it exists to assist
you in making better datadriven
decisions and achieving success by
maximizing each of the five criteria and
if you comprehend them you'll be able to
see any issues with your startup
straight away as well as what
specifically isn't working and how to
correct it by doing this you may prevent
basing choices on guesswork or on bad
information the five stages of your
client's life cycle are referred to as R
which are acquisition where the
customers come from activation the
process of converting acquired clients
into engaged ones retention how to
entice potential clients to return
referral techniques for encouraging
clients to endorse your offerings
Revenue how to convert prospective
clients into paying clients acquisition
in essence you want individuals to
register for something for instance you
could want someone to register for a
free trial keep up strong traffic
acquisition you need to make sure your
website is receiving qualified leads the
fact is if you have a good amount of
focused visits each month you don't need
a ton of leads to obtain clients save
your time establish your Target
demographic and conduct a campaign to
build anticipation for the launch when
customers are waiting for your product
to launch gaining customers will be
simpler you must provide your audience
with value if you want your advertising
to be effective for instance you provide
an automated email marketing service in
this situation a smart place to start is
an online Network for experts in email
marketing to Peak Interest and
discreetly promote your product to the
audience publish engaging pieces
regarding email marketing growth
techniques activation the value and
happiness a firm provides at this stage
Mark the beginning of a connection with
a consumer and whether or not that
relationship progresses further down the
funnel will depend on those factors the
number of people who do a certain action
such as seeking additional information
subscribing to a YouTube channel or
making a purchase may be used to assess
activation the number of customers or
users who have been activated would be
divided by the total number of people
that viewed the website or Etc to arrive
at a formula that would be helpful at
this point
retention retention is essential to
economic success for any organization
that wants to endure for a long time
this is because the most significant
measure of how much people value your
product or service is retention
depending on the pricing range of your
goods attracting firsttime buyers or
customers may not be challenging because
people make impulsive purchases every
day a subsequent purchase or engagement
however shows that the customer was
satisfied
and that the item or service match their
needs businesses use many techniques for
measuring retention however such as
annual recurring Revenue monthly
recurring Revenue customer turn repeat
purchase ratio and time between
purchases may be approaches to gauge
client-base
retention referral referrals are one of
the last components of the pirate funnel
it is crucial to remember that many
graphic representations of the funnel
include an arrow called acquisition that
Loops up from the bottom back to the top
and this is because a perfect funnel
would be a loop or a customer cycle that
keeps bringing in new clients while
maintaining existing ones successful
referrals may be especially crucial
since they are a less expensive method
of acquiring customers than traditional
marketing and because of the impact of
family and friends they are frequently
predisposed to Brand loyalty if
individuals in their Circle are already
customers there are no ideal measures
for this statistic however several
metrics such as number of active users
sharing invites can assist a firm when
they start tracking referrals many times
people fail to mention that they were
recommended or a user who receives an
invite from a friend may take months or
even years to activate nevertheless a
good referral program may be
demonstrated by reduced customer
attrition sustained growth and overall
program success Revenue although money
is transferred earlier in the customer
life cycle Revenue may be unreliable if
the proceeding phases aren't completed
and measured for this reason revenue is
frequently shown as the last step in the
pirate funnel rapid Revenue production
is less important for a company's
success than effective marketing and
initiatives to keep customers and get
them to recommend others the ability to
track income correctly is essential for
a business to succeed and while being
aware of total Revenue after cost is
crucial it only represents a small
portion of the full picture to get a
full view of a company's success and
make informed financial decisions it's
important to evaluate income across a
variety of user product and service
categories so far you've learned a lot

and then we'll understand does an
organization need both roles and stick
to the end because we will wrap up this
session by talking about the salaries of
both product managers and product owners
now let's start this session and
understand who is a product manager a
product manager is the one who defines
what success looks like for a product

rallies a team to make that Vision a
reality they do this by determining the

this expert sets a long-term product
strategy and a product road map and
decides which features to include
although it's frequently not clearly
defined the position of a product
manager or PM is crucial and critical in
many businesses all product managers
lead the development of products and are
ultimately in charge of the success of

additionally they act in the clients and
their consumers best interest the
position is derived from scrum project

client requirements it is the
responsibility and accountability of
this expert to identify and prioritize
user needs now let's understand what
both roles focus on so let's begin with
knowing what a product manager focuses
on the following categories can be used
to organize some of the product
manager's tasks number one by doing user
research and revealing key insights
learn what users need number two develop
the long-term vision and plan for the

maximization of the value of the product

efforts now let's move this session
toward the responsibilities of both
roles now let's see what are the
responsibilities of a product manager to
maintain develop and increase the sales
of current products a product manager
must communicate with several internal
and external business stakeholders they
also also must do research and come up
with ideas for new products based on
their interactions and
experiences a product manager must do
market research undertake margin
analysis and evaluate performance to
analyze product demand positioning and
profitability as well as forecast future
Trends product managers also make
pricing branding and other decisions the
very first responsibility of a product
manager is monitoring competitors
finding and analyzing your competitor's
products prices and sales and marketing
strategies is known as competitive
monitoring sometimes known as
competitive analysis the next
responsibility of the product manager is
understanding the user's needs it is
your duty as a product manager to
determine the target market and to
understand the people who use your
service or your users and what they want
to do to build a solution that works for
them the next responsibility is
assembling Market research and
competition
data by conducting market research you
might meet clients for your company
investigating your competitors may
enable you to set your business apart
for a Competitive Edge for your small
business figure out how to combine them
to learn more about the market product
managers speak with data
scientists the next responsibility is
monitoring internal
stakeholders monitoring stakeholders is
the process of looking closely at
stakeholder relation relationships for
products tailoring engagement tactics
for stakeholders through changes to
engagement strategies and plans and
observing and managing the team
translation transferring information
from the design team to the development
team the next responsibility of a
product manager is to achieve the
product goals and objectives product
goals translate the product Vision into
specific measurable objectives they are
quite detailed in terms of your
product's performance performance after
it is completed and how you'll measure
it the last responsibility of the
product manager is depicting the
parameters for product accomplishment by
providing the metrics and data one may
obtain a sense of how to position the
product successfully in the
market now let's move toward the
responsibilities of a product owner both
product owners and managers are involved
in the process of developing new
products but their responsibilities are
distinct in terms of how they accomplish
objectives and where they are located at
various stages of the
process the very first responsibility of
product owners is engaging
stakeholders product owners often
collaborate with internal stakeholders
inside the business they oversee
important interactions with managers
their departments and the board of
directors to develop the goods and
provide answers these experts gather
data from various parties to enhance
user stories in the backlog a product
owner may speak with end users directly
When developing a product taking into
account the viewpoints of many
professionals and customers may help
both roles perform their
responsibilities more
successfully moving on to the next
responsibility of a product owner is
taking care of
obligations product owners concentrate
more narrowly on smallscale activities
product owners are in charge of a
Project's day-to-day operations and
details while product manager focus on
the project as a whole to assure product
fulfillment these experts May for
example oversee the manufacturing team
create a backlog and work with
warehouses the next responsibility of a
product owner is analyzing
customers similar research is conducted
by product owners to understand the
needs and preferences of the target
market but they are also in charge of
teaching the whole team about these
topics product owners in scrum teams see
to it that all team members incorporate
consumer perspectives while creating or
updating these features along with the
product manager they also help the
backlog be optimized based on client
input and check to see if a product
adequately incorporates it moving
forward the next responsibility of a
product owner is directing group
efforts product owners often collaborate
with teams daily to make sure they
correctly follow a plan and meet backlog
requirements as a consequence they could
collaborate with product managers to
choose the most important features and
the most suitable
schedule additionally these experts
could let designers know what is
expected of them and assist them in
creating mockups or
prototypes the next responsibility of a
product owner is product backlog
management the product owner must
compile the backlog of items and
prioritize them following the
overarching strategy and corporate goals
the product owner will also need to map
out project dependencies to determine
the proper order of development but the
product backlog isn't just a list of
things to accomplish it's a dynamic
document that has to be updated often in
response to changing project
requirements as it develops and the last
responsibility of a product owner is
observing the stages of development the
product owner should devote a
substantial amount of time to managing
the actual creation of the product once
the vision strategy and product
priorities have been established they
play a significant role in All Phases of
the event including planning fine-tuning
reviewing and sprinting the agile
product owner collaborates with
stakeholders throughout the planning
phases to determine and arrange the
tasks necessary for the following
iteration after that they will get
together with their team to polish the
procedure pinpoint any problems and
assist with the
Sprint now let's move on to the skill of
both product managers and product owners
so let's begin with skills required by a
product manager strategic thinking
understanding your position in the
market concentrating on the goals and
seeing chances can help you plan and
build tactics leadership skills the
capacity of a person to inspire and
guide a team of others working together
to accomplish a common objective and
time management the capacity to
effectively manage time so that the
product may be delivered in the allotted
time empathy skills the capacity to
relate to and comprehend the ideas and
feelings of another person empathy
requires placing oneself in the other
person's position communication skills
how one interacts with others and the
act of imparting knowledge our ability
to communicate effectively allows us to
provide information in a way that the
audience can comprehend it presentation
skills the capacity to convey in and
engaging original and Visually appealing
manner now let's move ahead and know the
skills required by product owners design
reasoning to promote product
breakthroughs product owners must feel
at ease creating hypothesis driven
development
environments analytical skills the
management evaluation and approval of
the product backlog should be the top
priority for a product owner for this
reason they need to be Adept analysts
who can can review product problems and
upgrades critically and come up with
logical remedies rapidly cooperation
abilities product owners who act as
Liaisons between scrum teams must be at
ease with continual engagement they
should prioritize cooperation and be at
ease with delegating dispute resolution
and interacting with people of all
temperaments and emotions decisionmaking
another essential ability for product
owners is decisionmaking the product
owner a senior member of a product
development team makes several choices
every day including choosing which items
to add to the product backlog how to
rank them and how to inform the team of
these
decisions resolution of disputes the
resolution of disputes is the capacity
to resolve problems using established
techniques or developing new ones
because of the many parties engaged in
the project disputes may arise often for
you as the product owner during the
product development cycle aptitude for
learning one of the most crucial
qualities for product owners to have is
an aptitude for learning it's crucial to
be a breast of the most recent market
trends customer demands and corporate
requirements moving on with our session
let's understand the difference between
product managers and product owners
product managers have a greater
strategic role with broader corporate
objectives in mind they Define and map
out the product management process
across the product life cycle whereas
product owners take on a more proactive
role and prioritize immediate
fulfillment by creating customer Stories
the team can utilize to make more
user-led decisions for product
development they assist in maximizing
the value of the
product they concentrate on the market
corporate goals and the products Vision
whereas product owners collaborate with
cross functional agile teams to carry
out these needs by converting the
product manager strategy into concrete
activities the why who and what are the
responsibility of the product
manager their roles reach might vary
greatly or be very constrained based on
a variety of variables on the other hand
a product owner scope is often smaller
than a product manager product owners
are in charge of the
how artifacts like a product road map a
product vision card or a product
requirement document are frequently the
responsibility of product
managers product backlogs Sprint
backlogs and the definition of done are
just a few examples of the artifacts
that product owners must create and
manage product managers May oversee the
product Discovery procedure enabling
team
participation but on the other hand many
of the product ceremonies that take
place throughout the product life cycle
such as Sprint planning and backlog
grooming also include product
owners the product manager is very
knowledgeable about consumer goals and
how to ease their problems and the
development team's customer expert is
the product owner the multi-disciplinary
product team is led by the product
manager they are ultimately in charge of
achieving business and product
objectives and also report progress to
Executives whereas the implementation
activities are overseen by the product
owner on the development team
to decide which features the development
team will focus on next they collaborate
closely with the product manager and
other product team
members based on client feedback the
product manager fine-tunes and modifies
the product strategy and vision but
product owners make sure that consumers
opinions are considered when choices
about various products are made within
the
company long-term customer support and
continuous product capabilities are
priority for product
managers whereas product Sprints and
releases continue to get product owners
short to midterm
attention plans and important business
results are the responsibility of the
product manager delivering value to the
end users is the responsibility of the
product
owners product managers must communicate
with the product teams even if they are
customer facing they must work on
wireframes and prototypes and attend
scrum sessions
this is because it's up to PMS to
determine the overarching vision making
it crucial to collaborate closely with
the product
teams and product owners need to
comprehend and sympathize with client
needs if they don't have this every
product they develop will continue to
overlook different client pain
issues now the next phase is knowing the
switch in the roles of a product manager
and product
owner so the first question that arises
is can a product manager be a product
owner a product manager's role
encompasses endtoend product management
including feature functionality product
Road mapping and reacting to customer
input in addition to product development
and scrum a product manager can also be
a product owner because they have a
common objective while the two jobs have
the same goal of recognizing client
needs and turning those needs into
technological requirements their
respective Scopes and objectives differ
leaders must thus decide which of these
product Specialists their company
requires and in same ways the next
question is can a product owner be a
product
manager so the answer is a product
manager and owner can be the same
individual there are undoubtedly many
duties and objectives that overlap with
both jobs but because of this it makes
it logical that many businesses utilize
a single person to meet the requirements
of both positions and use the scrum
product owner as an agile product
manager as Roman piler points out but
the thing that comes next in our mind is
does an organization need both roles
instead of the titles that will be used
the true question regarding what a firm
requires must start with what the
desired product outcome is prioritizing
business value comes first followed by
evaluating the responsibilities and
procedures of the product management
team to support those objectives a
business system that lacks flexibility
frequently has structures and processes
built into it a review of current work
assignments obstacles to be overcome the
overall decision-making process and the
desired outcome are all necessary a
better understanding of the business's
operations will exist once all of these
issues have been evaluated solved and
prioritized you'll be able to identify
any issues delays or subpar product
management you could discover that there
are new ways in which you can acclimate
to the product management framework it
is possible to combine product ownership
and management with other tasks such as
product marketing now coming to the end
of our session let's discuss the salary
of product manager and product owners
the average salary of a product manager
in India is 10 locks perom and in the US
is 90,000 to
$160,000
perom the average salary of a product
owner in India is 13 locks and in the US
is approximately one lock US dollar
perom so guys let's start with the First
Fundamental question that why do
companies conduct market research so

marketing techniques that you can apply
Li for your business now let's move on
and discuss a case study of Apple where
we are going to discover how their
market research made one of the most
successful product which is known as
iPod so guys in the early 2000s Apple
revolutionized the music industry with
the introduction of iPod a portable
digital music player Apple's success
with the iPod can be attributed in part
to its meticulous market research and
understanding of consumer needs before
developing the iPod Apple conducted
extensive market research to identify
opportunities in the digital music
Market they recognized the consumers
were frustrated with the existing MP3
players which were often bulky and had
limited storage capacity and were
difficult to use also additionally Apple
identified a growing demand for digital
music downloads and recognize the
potential for a device that seamlessly
integrated Hardware software and content
Apple's market research guided the
design and development of the iPod
focusing on on the key features that
address the consumer pains points and
preferences these features include a
Sleek a portable design a userfriendly
interface with the iconic click wheel
and significant storage capacity to hold
thousands of songs additionally Apple
partnered with the record labels to
secure licensing agreements for its
iTune music store offering consumers a
convenient and a legal way to purchase

launched in October 20 01 to a
widespread aan quickly becoming a
cultural phenomenon and transforming

establishing the iPod as a market leader
in the portable music players for years
to come this case study highlights the
importance of Market Research in
understanding consumer needs identifying
Market opportunities and guiding product
development efforts by conducting Toro
Market Research companies like apple can
develop products that meet consumer
demands and Achieve commercial success
in the competitive markets picture this
there's a team working hard on a cool
new tech product they are excited but
when they launch it some off people
aren't connecting with it like they
hoped that's where user personas come in
by really understanding who the users
are the team turn things around suddenly
the product wasn't just liked it was
loved
here's the kicker studies show that
using these user personas can make
designing stuff way easier like over 30%
easier but get this most companies
aren't using them it's like having a
secret weapon and not even knowing it
our story inspired by real events shows
just how important it is to understand
the people using your Tech crafting
these user personas isn't just about
being creative it's about making sure
your product speaks directly to the
folks who will use it it's a jne that
can turn a dud into a hit so as we dive
into the world of user Persona creation
remember it's all about putting a human
touch on technology one Persona at a
time have you ever been curious about
how Tech giants like Spotify Amazon or
Netflix seem to intuitively know your
preferences offering up songs products
or TV shows that perfectly match your
taste the secret behind this almost
psychic ability isn't a result of
mystical forces
it's the Strategic use of user personas
if you want to know what user Persona is
so user Persona are semif fical
characters that businesses create based
on real data and insights from their
actual or potential customers these
personas are crafted to represent key
segments of a product's audience
including detailed profiles that
Encompass not just basic demographic
information but also behaviors goals
needs and pain points for instance
consider Fitness funer now we'll see a
persona for a health and wellness app
that is Fiona age 30 is an outdoor
activity Enthusiast who seeks motivation
and tools to track her Fitness progress
so the creation of such Persona is
driven by a desire for empathy and a
deep understanding of users needs
allowing designers to create products
services and experience that truly
resonate so you could see the example of
a Persona here and this is for the
fitness Fiona that's a quick overw will
have it
so first we have the age and occupation
so the age is 30 and the occupation is
digital marketing specialist and then we
have the lifestyle and interest so the
lifestyle is it leads or she leads an
active lifestyle with a keen interest in
outdoor activities like running and
hiking and Value Health Community and
personal growth and then the goals she
seeks to maintain a healthy balanced
lifestyle despite a busy schedule and
aims to stay fit and participate in
community Fitness events and the
challenges she was facing was struggles
to find time for regular workouts and to
stay motivated and overwhelmed by the
vast amounts of Fitness information
available and if we talk about her app
usage so she prefers using Fitness
tracking apps and engaging with health
and wellness content online looks for
apps that provide personalized workout
plans nutritional guidance and community
support and the tax heaveness that is
high integrates technology seamlessly
into her fitness journey Fiona
represents the target user for Health
and Wellness app guiding the development
towards features that addresses her
specific needs and challenges so this
was about a user Persona of a lady that
is Fitness Fiona now moving to the role
of user Persona in the company or any
role you want so user Persona play a
pivotal role in guiding the development
and marketing of products and services
their impact is far-reaching influencing
decisions across various stages of
project development and execution so
let's see the points the number one is
enhances user centered design so user
personas keep the focus on the users
need preferences and behaviors ensuring
that product design and functionality
are tailored to meet the actual
requirements of the target audience the
next is improved product development
efficiency by understanding the specific
needs and challenges of the personas
teams can prioritize features and
functionalities that offer the most
value thereby streamlining the
development processes then we have
facilitate better marketing strategies
knowing the personas help in crafting
targeted marketing campaigns that speak
directly to the interest needs and pain
points of potential users improving
engagement and conversation rates then
we have Aids in content creation and
personalization content can be designed
to resonate with the personas whether
it's blog post social media content or
email marketing ensuring higher
relevance and engagement then the point
is enhance user experience with insights
into to the persona's preferences and
behaviors ux designers can create more
intuitive interfaces and interactions
that enhance satisfaction and usability
and then the point is guide product
customization and Innovation
understanding the evolving needs of your
personas can lead to Innovations or
customizations that keep your product or
service competitive and aligned with
user expectations and then we have
supports decision making when faced with
decisions about feature inclusion design
changes or Market positioning user
personas provide a preference point that
reflects the users based Collective
needs and desires so these are the role
of user personas and the creation and
utilization of user personas are
foundational elements in crafting
products and experiences that truly meet
and exceed user expectations driving
satisfaction loyalty and ultimately
business success now we'll see the
process of creating user personas so
creating user Persona is a structured
process that combines research analysis
and creative synthesis the the goal is
to generate actionable insights that
guide product development design and
marketing strategies so we'll have an
overview of the steps involved in
creating effective user personas so the
number one step is conduct research
start by gathering data about your
potential or existing users this can
include qualitative methods like
interviews focus groups and anthr
graphic observation as well as
quantitative methods such as surveys and
Analysis of user Behavior data from
analytics platforms so let's understand
this with an example example so let's
consider a scenario the development team
for the ecostay app starts by collecting
data they conduct online surveys
targeting Travelers interested in
sustainable living they also analyze
Forum discussion on ecotourism websites
and interview frequent travelers to
understand their references and concerns
so the next step or the process would be
analyze the data look for patterns and
commonalities in the data collected this
might involve segmenting users based on
demographics behaviors preferences or
goals the aim is to identify meaningful
groups of users who share specific
characteristics or needs and the
findings we have from here is from the
research the team notices like we are
again back to the example so from the
research that was done that was the
conducting the research so the team
notices patterns many respondents
priortize sustainability but also
Express concerns about cost and the
authenticity of eco-friendly claims they
identif three main segments budget EC
Travelers luxury ecotourist and E
conscious families so these were the
findings analyzing the data and then we
have create draft personas The Next Step
So based on your analysis start drafting
your personas each Persona should
represent a significant segment of your
audience include demographic details
behaviors needs goals challenges and any
other relevant information that defines
the Persona so you would start drafting
the Persona that could be for the budget
eot traveler and any name B then you can
have her age occupation goals what
challenges she is facing and then the
next step that would be refine and
validate personas refine your personas
by getting feedback from stakeholders
and comparing the personas against
actual user data when available so this
step may involve revisiting your
research to fill in gaps or clarify
aspects of the personas and for example
the team that was the app team that
shares bets Persona with ecotourism
experts and real Travelers fitting bets
profile for feedback adjustments are
made based on suggestions such as
emphasizing the importance of community
reviews in BET's decision making process
so this was about the refine and
validate personas now moving to the next
step that is develop scenarios and goals
for each Persona outline key scenario or
task they need to accomplish with your
product or service this helps in
understanding the context in which your
personas will inter with your offerings
so let's consider scenario with an
example only so Beth for which the
Persona was created so Beth is planning
a two week backpacking trip across Costa
Rica so she uses ecostate that app
person was making so she uses ecostate
to find budget friendly verified ecodes
and hosts so key features she looks for
include sustainability certifications
user reviews and easy booking options so
this was about her so so now moving to
the next step that is apply personas so
use the Persona to guide decision making
in product development design and
content strategy and marketing personas
should inform features user interface
design and the overall user experience
as well as targeting and messaging and
marketing campaign and we talk about the
example so the ecostay app so that
development focuses on features like a
verification batch for accommodations
with authentic Eco certifications a
budget filter with a sustainability
rating and a community review section so
this was about apply personas now moving
to the next one or the marketing
campaign highlight stories from budget
Travelers like be showcasing the apps
ability to combine affordability with
sustainability now moving to the next
that is review and iterate so user
Persona should not be static as your
product evolves and you gather more data
about your user revisit and update your
persona to ensure they remain accurate
and relevant and about the iteration so
after the apps launch user feedback and
usage data are analyzed the team finds
that Eco conscious families are also
using features designed for Budget
Travelers so the personas are updated to
reflect their crossover leading to the
development of familyfriendly features
and content so throughout this process
it's a crucial to remember that personas
are tools for empathy and understanding
designed to keep the user at the heart
of product development decisions while
the exact details and depth of each
person can vary depending on people's
scope and the available data the
fundamental goal Remains the Same to
create a product that resonates with and
meets the needs of your target users so
now moving to the next topic that is
applying Persona to product development
and marketing certainly applying user
personas effectively streamline both
product development and marketing
ensuring efforts are closely aligned
with user needs so now we'll see a
condensed overview so starting with the
product development number one point
would be feature Focus use personas to
pinpoint essential features that truly
matter to your target users enhancing
the products value and then design
decision tailor Design Elements to match
the preferences and Tech proficiency of
a Persona improving usability and user
satisfaction and then we have
personalized experience leverage
insights from personas to customize user
experience meeting diverse needs within
your user base now coming to the
marketing team so the points are
tailored messaging craft messages that
resonate deeply with each Persona
addressing this specific interest and
paino for more effective communication
and then we have content strategy
developed content that speaks directly
to the concerns and goals of your
personas ensuring greater engagement
then we have channel selection choose
marketing channels based on your
persona's preferences optimizing reach
and impact so let's see a simplified
application example for a fitness app
aimed at users like Fitness Fiona the
development team might focus on
personalized workout plan plans and
social sharing features while marketing
efforts would highlight success stories
and tips for busy Lifestyles directly
catering to F owner's interest and needs
so by focusing on these streamline
points both product development and
marketing can more effectively align
with user expectations driving
engagement and satisfaction so this was
about the process of creating user
personas and now mve to the real world
success stories so real world success
stories serve as powerful illustrations
of the tangible impact user personas can
have on product development and
marketing strategies so we'll see two
examples showcasing how companies have
leveraged personas to achieving
significant results so the number one
example would be spotify's personalized
recommendation so the challenge Spotify
faced was Spotify sought to enhance user
engagement by delivering personalized
music recommendations tailored to
individual taste and preferences and the
solution they got was by analyzing user
data and behavior patterns Spotify
created user personas representing
different music preferences listening
habits and Discovery preferences these
personas inform the development of
algorithms that power personalized
playlist such as discover weekly and
daily mix providing users with a
customized Music Experience and the
outcome it generated was spotify's use
of personas and personalized
recommendations led to a significant
increase in user engagement and
satisfaction discover weekly aone
Restore for 40 million users within its
first year driving longer listening
sessions and boosting user retention
rates now moving to the next example
that is airbnb's host and guest personas
so the challenge was Airbnb aimed to
enhance the experience for both host and
guest by understanding their distinct
needs and pain points and the solution
they like output or the outcome was
detailed personas for both host and
guest encompassing demographic
information motivations and behaviors so
these persona guided product development
decisions informing the design of
features such as host profiles guest
reviews and search filters tailored to
specific preferences and the outcome
that go was by aligning product features
with the needs of their user Persona
Airbnb achieved significant growth and
improved user satisfaction host felt
more empowered to Showcase their
properties effectively while guest
enjoyed a more personalized and seamless
booking experience resulting in
increased bookings and positive reviews
so these real world sucess stories
highlight the transformative impact that
user personas can have on product
development and marketing strategies so
by understanding their users on a deeper
level and tailoring their offerings
accordingly companies can drive
engagement retention and ultimately
business success now talking about the
common pitfalls and tips so navigating
the creation and application of user
Persona comes with its share of
challenges so here we will see some
common pitfalls to avoid and tips to
ensure effective use of persona so the
common PFS are
overgeneralization creating personas
that are too broad or stereotypical that
can lead to inaccurate representations
of your user base resulting in
ineffective strategies and then comes
the point lack of data validation
relying solely on assumptions or
anecdotal evidence without validating
personas with real user data can lead to
misleading insights and misguided
decisions and then comes the static
personas treating personas as static
representations of users can result in
outdated or irrelevant profiles user
needs and behaviors evolve over time
personas should be regularly reviewed
and updated ignoring negative personas
focusing only on positive personas can
lead to neglecting important segments of
your user base with different needs or
pain points so these were the common
pitfalls now the tips for Success so the
number one is conduct thorough research
invest time and resources into
collecting both qualitative and
quantitative data to ensure your
personas are based on accurate and
comprehensive insights then comes the
point validate Persona with real users
use surveys interviews and user testing
to validate personas and ensure that
accurately represent your target
audience then comes the iterate and
update regularly continuously revisit
and refine your personas based on new
data and insights to keep them relevant
and align with evolving user needs then
comes the point focus on key personas
prioriti personas that represent the
most significant segments of your user
base focusing your efforts on addressing
ing their needs and preferences and then
comes involve gross functional teams
collaborate with stakeholders from
different departments including
marketing design and product management
to ensure alignment and buying for
Persona driven strategies and then comes
user personas as decision making tools
integrate personas into your decision-
making processes for product development
marketing and content strategy to ensure
user Centric outcomes so by avoiding
common pitfalls and following these tips
you can harness the power of user person
us to drive inform decision making
improve user experiences and ultimately
achieve greater success with your
products and services and in summary
user personas are invaluable tool for
understanding and empathizing with your
target audience by creating detailed
profiles based on real data you can
inform product development design and
marketing strategies effectively avoid C
pitfalls like or generalization and
static personas by continuously
validating and updating them with user
personas you can prioritize features
make informed decisions and tailor
experiences that resonate with users
ultimately driving engagement and
business success hey there fellow
entrepreneurs so picture this you have
got the killer product idea right and
naturally you want it to be like totally
Flawless before you launch it out into
the world but here's the thing no matter
how much you sweat over it there's
always going to be some hiccup or snag
along the way it's just the way the
cookie crumbles you know but fear not my
friend because there is a game changer
known as MVP but what exactly is MVP and
why does it matter well let's start with
numbers did you know that 42% of
startups fail because there's no Market
need for their product shocking right
that's where MVP soups in as a game
changer by focusing on the core features
and functionalities MVP allows companies
to bring a product to the market quickly
and test its viability with real users
and get this companies that prioritize
MVP development are three times more
likely to experience success with their
product launches in fact 78% of
businesses say that mvp helped them
learn what customer really wanted
leading to more successful iterations
down the road so whether you're
brainstorming your next big idea or fine
tuning an existing project stick around
as we unravel the mysteries of MVP also

endless opportunities in the dynamic
world of product management so without
further Ado let's start so what is MVP a
minimal viable product or MVP is a
strategy used in product development
where a new product is launched with
basic features enough to attract
consumer attention it's the simplest
version of the product a company aims to
bring to the market whether it's a car
website TV or laptop by offering the
basic version companies can gather
feedback from the potential user to
improve the final product before its
full release an MVP typically includes
three key elements firstly it offers
enough features for consumers to
consider purchasing it making it easier
for the company to Market secondly it
includes a feedback mechanism allowing
users to provide input on the product
lastly it provides future benefits to
early adopters encouraging them to try
out the product ahead of others some of
the fine examples of MVP is Amazon
Believe It or Not Amazon began by
selling used college textbooks their
first version of the product was basic
website for delivering books to students
As Time passed they grew their business
to become the huge online store we see
today similarly another fine example is
arbnb arbnb Journey began with a bold
idea renting out air mattresses Yes you
heard it right they kicked off with a
simple website connecting Travelers with
host offering makeshift accommodations
this quirky start was their MVP that is
minimal viable product slowly but surely
they listen to user feedback fine-tuned
their problem and expanded their
Horizons it's a tale of humble
beginnings turned into a global
phenomena who knew an air mattress could
spark a revolution in travel and there
are many more examples like that but
implementing the minimal viable product
approach requires more than just having
an idea doing the basics and launching
it it involves strategic planning to
ensure its Effectiveness and value now
let's understand the benefits that
companies get from MVPs creating a
minimal viable product can assist you in
avoiding many potential mistakes that
you might Overlook when deeply
passionate about your product understand
the preferences of your target audience
when a company builds a minimal viable
product they make a basic version of
their product to see what people like by
doing this they can learn what features
or things their consumers prefer it's
like trying out different flavors of ice
cream to see which one people like the
most helps create a better product yes
making an MVP lets companies test their
ideas quickly and see what works and
what does not this helps them make
improvements and build a better final
product it's similar to making a rough
sketch of a drawing before making the
final detailed version next is it helps
to analyze the demand with an MVP
companies can see how many people are
interested in their product if lots of
people like it they know there's a big
demand if not many people are interested
they might need to change their plans
it's a bit like testing the waters to
see if people want what you're offering
next is ensures quick release instead of
spending a long time making a perfect
product an MVP lets companies release
something quickly this means they can
start getting feedback and making
Improvement sooner it's like serving a
simple version of a at a restaurant
first and then making it fancier based
on the customer s so this was about the
benefits now let's talk about how to
develop a minimal viable product so
first is understand your goals before
starting to develop your minimal viable
product it's important to know what you
want to achieve think about what problem
your product will solve or what benefit
it will provide to the people
understanding your goals helps you stay
focused and build a product that meets
your objectives the next is study your
Market take some time to reach and
understand the market where your product
will compete look at similar products
already available and see what makes
them successful or what could be
improved by studying the market you can
identify opportunities and challenges
helping you tailor your MVP to better
meet the needs of your target audience
next is consider the product features
think about essential features your
product needs to have in order to
address the problem or provide the
benefit you identifi keep the features
simple focused on solving the core
problem or delivering the main benefit
avoid adding too many features at this
stage as the goal of an MVP is to create
something basic that you can test and
iterate upon based on the user feedback
the next is gather feedback early and
often once you have developed your MVP
don't wait too long before sharing it
with the potential customers gather
feedback as early as possible by letting
people try out your product and asking
for their thoughts this feedback will
help you understand the aspects of your
MVP and of working well what areas need
Improvement allowing you to make
adjustments and iterate quickly the next
is iterate based on feedback use the
feedback you receive to make
improvements to your MVP this might
involve adding new features refining
existing ones or even pivoting in a
different direction based on what you
learn from the users the key is to be
flexible and open to making changes
based on the feedback you receive as
this will help you create a better final
product that meets the needs of your
target audience by following these steps
you can develop a minimal viable product
that efficiently addresses a specif
problem or need in the market while also
allowing you to gather valuable feedback
and iterate towards a more refined and
more successful product over time today
we will talk about something super
important for any team which is
prioritization techniques have you ever
felt overwhelmed jumping between task
without knowing which ones really matter
we've all been there but don't worry
there are ways to get organized and
focused for product managers
prioritization is one of the most
crucial skills it's the key part for any
product management interview process as
a product manager you must prioritize
features requirements and task
effectively to ensure your team delivers
maximum value to
customers let me tell you a story about
Samantha Who was the part of an agile
software team the projects were all over
the place they would work on one thing
than another with no clear plan missing
deadlines and frustrating clients that's
when and Samantha's boss stepped in and
taught them about prioritization
deciding which tasks to do first and how
important they are he showed them
techniques like mosco for categorizing
task as must do should do could do Etc
and rice for scoring task based on
things like impact and effort using
these methods it was a total game
changer with mosco they identifi the
critical task and rice helped them to
prioritize the high impact work
efficiently
suddenly projects were organized work
was delivered on time and clients were
happy as success spread other teams
started prioritizing it too it boosted
productivity across the whole company
Samantha felt proud to be the part of
making the work better from then on
prioritization became the core part of
how they operated for clarity and focus
on what mattered the most in this video
we will be covering what is prizing
ation technique importance of
prioritization seven most popular
prioritization techniques like mosco
method Cano model weighted shortest JW
First Rise scoring model value versus
complexity effort Matrix eisenhard
Matrix walking skeleton method Etc also
choosing the right prioritization
technique well prioritization technique
is a method used to determine the order
of importance of task activities or
elements within a project or process
it helps to identify what needs to be
done first what can wait and what may
not need to be done at all this
technique involves assessing the
relative significance urgency or impact
of different items and arranging them in
logical sequence or order of importance
by prioritizing effectively you can
allocate resources time and effort more
efficiently ensuring that you address
the most crucial aspects first to
achieve your goals
effectively but why is prioritizing so
important let's discuss the importance
of
prioritization granitization is crucial
for several reasons at first we have
limited resources every team has limited
resources whether time budget or
Manpower granitization helps you make
most of these Resources by focusing on
the most important features first then
we have customer satisfaction by
delivering the most valuable features
first you can keep your customers happy
and engaged with your product moving on
to competitive advantage in today's
fast-paced market prioritization can
give you a Competitive Edge by allowing
you to quickly adapt to changing
customer needs and market trends now
that we have understood the importance
of prioritization let's dive into some
of the most popular prioritization
techniques the seven most popular
prioritization techniques we will
discuss today are as for follows at
first we have mosco method moving on to
Cano model rice scoring model Eisenhower
Matrix value versus complexity Matrix
weighted short as job first and then at
last we have the walking skeleton method
let us start with the first method which
is the mosco method mosco is a simple
way to prioritize task and features when
working on a project it stands for must
should could and w't let me break it
down for you must these are the
essential features that absolutely have
to be included if you do not have these
the project will fail then should these
are the important features that you
should try to include but they are not
critical they would be great to have if
possible that's it then we have good
These are nice to have smaller
improvements or additions and leaving
them out one really impact the project
want these are the lowest rity items
that don't match the current needs of
goals you can safely leave these out for
now by separating everything into these
four buckets you can get super clear as
a team on the true priorities and make
sure you're laser focused on checking
those must have boxes first so what are
the pros and cons of this method well
first off it's dead simple no complex
calculation or scoring systems are
needed you can prioritize a massive
backlog just by rapidly categorizing
each them it's also flexible since there
are no strict rules or timelines within
each bucket if a sh item needs to be
deprioritized no problem just move it to
the cloud or want as needed and finally
the clear separation into these
Universal terms helps get everyone
developers designers product managers
and stakeholders on the same page
instantly when it comes to understanding
priorities of course there are some
downsides too while it's easy to
categorize mosco doesn't give you
specific implementation plan or sequence
to follow you have to figure that part
out separately you can also lack some
bigger pictures perspective by just
focusing on individual feature
priorities you might miss out the
Strategic product goals or overarching
business objectives and sometimes those
category lines can get you a little
blurry in a certain feature a must have
or a should reasonable people may
disagree but in all mosco is a simple
yet powerful prioritization technique
especially for smaller projects or titos
Scopes where you need priorities locked
in quickly for bigger more complex
undertakings it can't be your only
prioritization method you likely want to
pair it up with something more robust
let me give you an example of a product
for example a mobile app for buying
crypto the must would include the
ability to buy and sell coins maintain a
portfolio View and set up payment
methods those are the essential
no-brainer priorities shs could be
things like Advanced chart analysis
alerts price tracking and maybe even
integrated social trading features they
are really valuable but not required for
an MVP good might include custom
valuable additions might include
captivating video intros or integrated
video calling features unnecessary
additions could be custom M themes
features user might dislike include
intrusive ads or sneaky premium upsells
by prioritizing based on this model you
can perfect the essential experience
before focusing on extra features themes
or watch list but doesn't break the core
experience and Wars for our initial
launch could be things like Advanced Tax
tools purchase of other asset classes or
automating trades with Bots just not
crucial priorities for the first version
by categorizing your backlog into mosco
you can clearly see that you need to
prioritize those three must have items
above everything to have a chance at a
successful initial launch the rest can
be prioritized separately within their
respective buckets so that's mosco a
nutshell a simple flexible way to
rapidly categorize your priorities at a
very first step next we have the Cano
model this one is all about making sure
that we are delivering what our users
want and care about it splits features
into a few buckets must have
onedimensional attractive total time
wasters and stuff that's all
it splits features into few buckets must
have onedimensional attractive total
time wasters and stuff to use it we
survey our potential users and get them
to categorize each feature based on how
it impacts their satisfaction the must
have our things that absolutely need for
the product to work at all
one-dimensional features are nice to
have that will please them if you get
them but disappoint if you don't
attractive features are awesome bonus
points that Delight users but it's no no
big deal if they're missing indifferent
stuff doesn't really matter either way
and reverse features are things users
actively hate having the pros are that
it really highlights what matters most
to customers and ranks features by their
priorities the downsides is that it
ignores how difficult these features are
to get built it's also timec consuming
to get that user feedback in the first
place this is all for the pros and cons
but when does it make sense to use sco
well it's great for Branding new
products to get an initial reality check
before you start designing offer
validating prototypes and making sure
you're on the right track let me now
give you an example say like you're
building a dating app the must have
might be the ability to create profile
browse potential matches and message
people onedimensional could be stuff
like Advanced filtering super likes Etc
valuable additions might include
captivating video intros or integrated
video calling features unnecessary
additions could be custom M themes
features user might dislike include
intrusive ads or premium upsells by
prioritizing based on this model you can
ensure you perfect the essential
experience before focusing on extra
features next we got the rice model
which is little more number driven it
scores each feature by looking at four
factors the reach or number of users who
use it the impact it have your
confidence in its success and man power
effort required to build it you create
each factor like impact which could be
massive high medium low or minimal then
you plug those ratings into a formula to
get a rise score higher scores means
higher priorities it scores each feature
by looking at four factors the reach or
number of users who use it the impact it
will have your confidence in its success
and the Manpower effort required to
build it you grade each factor like
impact which could be massive High
medium low or minimal then you plug
those ratings into a formula to get a
rise score higher scores means higher
priorities the pros of rice are that
it's comprehensive accounting for user
value technical cost risk and all that
good stuff and it uses real metrics
instead of just gut feelings the cons
are that it can be calculation heavy for
every single feature and you might be
missing some of the data points for
brand new products now why does it make
sense to use rice it's awesome for
established products with good product
metrics and usage data to draw them
probably not the best approach for
totally fresh projects without any of
those numbers yet let's look at an
example of a yoga studio app for a new
class booking feature reach could be
around 25,000 monthly active users
impact could be massive like uh three on
the scale confidence in its success is
medium to high so maybe considering it
to
80% and the engineering effort is
estimated around 3 person months
plugging into that formula the rise
scores come outs to be 25,000 into 3
multiplying by 0.8 which is around
20,000 you can then compare that against
the scores for other potential features
and prioritize accordingly moving on to
the next model which is the iar Matrix
we don't have any complicated formulas
here just simply divide your task into
four buckets based on whether they are
Urgent important both or neither the
Urgent and important stuff goes into the
top prity bucket to be tackled
immediately important not urgent task go
in the schedu it bucket for later urgent
but unimportant fire drills get isolated
in their quadrant so you can properly
manage those and then at the last area
is for the total time wasters neither
urgent nor important the pros of this
method are it's very simple to use and
that it keeps you focused on the truly
important task that drive business value
the downside is that it's quite
subjective and qualitative no hard
numbers or scoring system is involved
you might be wondering why should we use
the eisenhard Matrix well it works great
as a personal time management framework
or as a first pass for broadly
prioritizing a bunch of task but most
likely we want to complement it with
some other techniques for a more
rigorous product paradig Iz ation let's
look at an example of a brand new
e-commerce business the Urgent and
important stuff is setting up the
payments and shipping Integrations would
be a top priority important but not
urgently needed task are implementing
product filters or recommendations would
go in the schedu it section redesigning
the logo just cause would be urgent but
unimportant busy work adding multil
language support way down the line would
be the lowest prity section since it's
neither urgent nor crucial for the
launch next we've got the value versus
complexity Matrix this one is similar to
the Asen har Matrix as it works with the
quadrants and dimensions but instead of
urgent and important it access value and
complexity with this one we map out each
feature based on its expected user or
business value on one axis and the
implementation complexity or engineering
effort level on the other we can use
whatever scoring or definitions make
sense but but the goal is to prioritize
these high value low complexity items
first since they're easy wins really
valuable but High complex stuff comes
next after that is the low value low
complexity stuff we have the pros are
that it balances business user demands
with what's feasible to build looking at
the value and effort and then we can
tweak the scoring criteria according to
our needs the coins are that it can
still be pretty subjective and may not
be ideal for massive Cod bases and fraud
s but when does value versus complexity
work well it's perfect for smaller teams
and products early in the life cycle
when you need to rud Lesly prioritize
not the greatest for large complex
established products with crazy
requirements let me give you an example
of a productivity app a high value low
complexity features might be the core
ability to create an assigned task super
useful and not too hard to build a high
value High complexity one could be
integrated with all other major
productivity tools low value High
complexity might be some insane
reporting dashboard with a zillion
visualizations and the low value low
complexity stuff could be like smaller
tweaks custom emoji support Etc by
mapping those out you can prioritize the
top left quadrant of a major value ads
with minimal effort first all right we
are getting into some of the heavy
weights weight is shortest job first or
wsjf it uses some heavy duty
calculations s but for a good reason for
each feature you estimate the cost delay
and how much you're losing by not having
that feature then you look at the job
durations or how long it will take to
implement you score the cost of delay
based on factors like user business
value how time sensitive it is whether
it reduces risk and so on higher scores
means higher cost of delays then you
divide the cost of delay by the job
duration to get wsjf score for each
feature
the pros of wsjf are that it's detailed
consistent calculation approach and it
optimizes for faster Roi with limited
resources the cons are that it gets
calculation heavy quickly and may
unintentionally deprioritize bigger
long-term projects use wsjf when you
need to double down on those minimum
marketable features and quick high
impact wins don't rely on it too much
for full-blown product road maps though
let me show you an example
adding an offline mode to the notes app
take a look at the cost of delay factors
the user business value is High may be
four out of five since it's frequently
requested feature the time criticality
is also High 5 by5 since it's the pain
point for the users and it reduces the
risk of potential data loss so say 4x5
for risk reduction adding those up the
total cost of delay is 30 if we
calculate the job duration to be around
2 months then the wsgf score comes out
to be 13 divided by 2 which is 6.5 you
would calculate scores that way out for
potential features to then prioritize
the ones with the highest scores like
offline mode first last but not the
least we've got the walking skeleton
method this one is all about identifying
and prioritizing only the bare minimum
core features needed to ship an initial
MVP which means minimum viable product
that basic walking version of your
product the idea is to map out the
skeletal requirements that are critical
for the product to function and show its
core value proposition to users the pros
are that it enables fast prioritization
and MVP delivery we can get the market
quickly test our scores idea user
feedback and iterate rapidly from there
instead of over engineering and
overstuff version the conss are that it
will be shipping a pretty basic product
initially by cutting out tons of extra
features and and there's a risk of
taking it too far and crippling the
product if you're not careful use the
walking skeleton method when we are
focused on delivering an MVP as soon as
humanly possible to validate your idea
and get moving don't use it as your sole
prioritization technique for full
product road maps though let me give you
an example of a brand new video
streaming service using the walking
skeleton approach the top priorities
would be ability to browse a video
catalog playing those videos back
smoothly user login and subscription
functionality does the core skeleton
everything else like recommendation
watch list parental controls would all
be delayed for future iterations after
getting the MVP out by hyper focusing
only on these critical first few steps
we can take an entirely new product from
concept to Market fast while still
shipping a functional experience to
start generating feedback and data let
us now discuss how to choose the right
prioritization technique when
considering the prioritization Method
Keep in mind the following criteria
Simplicity the simpler the method the
faster you can prioritize datadriven
prioritization some methods rely more on
assumptions While others are based on
proven data balance between technology
constraints and business value some
methods focus more on customer value
While others consider technical
complexity best use case prioritizing
for an MVP might require different
techniques than prioritizing for a
mature product remember these methods
are not mutually exclusive and you can
combine them at different stages of your
product development life cycle so there
you have it a full breakdown of
different prioritization techniques from
the statistical model to the dead simple
matrices each one has its own pros and
cons and certain methods will make it
more sense than others depending on your
project stage complexity and data
availability so guys let us discuss our
agenda for today's session so in the
starting of the session we are going to
start start with an introduction to
scrum moving ahead we are going to
discuss about scrum roles then we will
Deep dive into scrum artifacts moving
ahead we are going to discuss about
scrum process flow then we will have a
thorough discussion on benefits of scrum
moving ahead we will also Deep dive into
common challenges and solution using
scrum methodology and finally we are
going to conclude our session with a
discussion on tools and softwares used
in scrum so let us start with an
introduction to scrum so guys what is
basically in scrum scrum is an agile
framework that has revolutionized the
way complex projects are managed and
completed its adaptability focus on
collaboration and iterative approach
makes it an ideal methodology for
dynamic and fast-paced environments
while scrum is most commonly associated
with software development its principles
and practices can be applied to various
Industries to enhance efficiency and
product quality this comprehensive
tutorial aims to provide you with a
deeper understanding of scrum covering
its roles artifacts even processes
benefits and practical implementation by
the end of this tutorial you will have a
solid graphs of scrum and how to
leverage its potential for your projects
now let us move on to the second part
with a thorough discussion on what is
Scrum roles the product owner plays a
very crucial role in scrum acting as a
voice of the customer so this is a first
scrum role that we see in scrum
methodology that is a product owner this
individual is basically responsible for
defining and prioritizing the product
backlog ensuring that the team focuses
on the most valuable tasks the product
owner Works closely with stakeholders to
GA requirements set clear goals and make
informed decisions about the product
Direction the key responsibilities of
the product owner includes defining the
product vision and road map creating and
managing the product backlog
prioritizing backlog items based on
value risk and urgency ensuring that a
team understands the backlog items and
their importance and also accepting or
rejecting completed work based on
predefined criteria next role we have is
Scrum Master the scrum Master is a
facilitator and Coach who ensures that
scrum framework is followed effectively
this role involves removing obstacles
that hinder the team's progress
promoting a culture of continuous
Improvement and fostering collaboration
the scrum master act as a servant leader
supporting a team in achieving their
goals without dictating how they should
work the key responsibilities of the
scrum Master includes facilitating scrum
events like Sprint planning daily scrum
Sprint review and Sprint
retrospective then comes removing
impediments that block the team's
progress moving ahead we have also
coaching the team on scrum practices and
principle then we we have a thorough
discussion on protecting the team from
external distractions and interruptions
and finally promoting a healthy team
Dynamic and addressing conflicts next
one we have is the development team so
guys the development team consists of
professionals who work collaborated to
deliver a product increment this
self-organizing team is cross functional
meaning it possesses all the skills
necessary to complete the work without
relying on external sources the
development team is accountable for
creating high quality increments that
meet the definition of done the key
responsibilities of development team
includes estimating planning work during
Sprint planning collaborating daily to
achieve the Sprint goal delivering a
potentially shippable product increment
by the end of the Sprint then
continuously improving their processes
and practices and finally maintaining
transparency through regular
Communications and updates now let us
move on and understand about scrum
artifact
the first one that we have all over here
is product backlog the product backlog
is a dynamic list of all the works
needed for the product it includes
features enhancements bug fixes and
Technical tasks the product owner is
basically responsible for maintaining
and prioritizing the backlog ensuring
that it reflects the current needs and
goals of the project the product backlog
is continuously refined with items being
added removed or reprioritized as
necessary the product backlog serves as
a single source of thru for the team
providing a clear road map of what needs
to be done it is essential that backlog
items are well defined with clear
acceptance criteria to guide the
development team and delivering the
expected value then we have the Sprint
backlog the Sprint backlog is a subset
of the product backlog containing items
selected for the current Sprint during
Sprint planning the team decides which
backlog items they can commit to
completing within the Sprint
the Sprint backlog also includes a plan
for how the team will accomplish this
work Sprint backlog provides a focused
and actionable plan for the team
outlining the tasks and goals for the
Sprint it is a living document
continuously updated as a team
progresses and learns about the work the
Sprint backlog helps the team stay
organized and aligned with the Sprint
goal then we have is increment increment
is sum of all the work at the end of the
Sprint it represents presents a
potentially shippable product that meets
the definition of done a set of criteria
ensuring that work is complete and of
high quality the increment includes not
only the new features added during the
Sprint but also any improvements or
fixes made to the existing features the
increment provides tangible evidence of
progress allowing stakeholders to
inspect and evaluate the product it
serves as the basis for feedback and
decision- making enabling the team to
adapt and refine their approach apprach
in subsequent Sprints then we have is
Sprint now let us move on and discuss
about some of the scrum events the first
one that we have all over here is Sprint
a Sprint is a time box period typically
lasting 24 weeks during which the team
Works to create a product increment the
fixed duration of the Sprint provides a
regular rhythm for the team promoting
consistent delivery and continuous
Improvement each Sprint begins with a
Sprint planning and ends with a Sprint
review and and Sprint
retrospective next one we have is Sprint
planning it is a event where the team
defines what will be accomplished in the
upcoming Sprint the product owner
presents the high priority backlog items
and the team collaborates to select
those they can complete within the
Sprint together they set a clear Sprint
goal and create a plan for achieving it
during Sprint planning the team breaks
down the selected backlog items into
smaller tasks and estimates the effort
required this retail planning ensures
that everyone understands the work and
how it contributes to the Sprint goal a
Sprint planning sets the stage for a
focus and productive Sprint next one we
have is the daily scrum daily scrum is a
short time box meeting usually lasting
for 15 minutes held every day during the
Sprint the purpose of the daily scrum is
to synchronize the team activities
discuss progress and identify any
obstacles each team member shares what
they did the previous say what they plan
to do today and any issues they are
facing the daily scrum promotes
transparency and accountability ensuring
that everyone is aligned and aware of
the team status it also provides an
opportunity to quickly address and
resolve impediments keeping the team on
track to achieve the Sprint goal next we
have all over here is called Sprint
review so guys Sprint review is held at
the end of the Sprint to inspect the
completed work and get the feedback from
stakeholders the team demonstrates the
product increment highlighting what was
accomplished during the Sprint
stakeholders provide input and the
product owner updates the product
backlog based on the feedback the Sprint
review Fosters collaboration and
transparency allowing stakeholders to
see the product's progress and influence
its direction it also provides an
opportunity to celebrate success and
identify areas for improvement and
finally we have the Sprint retrospective
the Sprint retrospective is the final
event of the Sprint where the team
reflects on their processes and
practices the goal is to identify what
went well what could be improved and how
to enhance their performance in future
Sprints the team discusses these
insights creates action items to address
any issues the Sprint retrospectives
promotes a culture for continuous
Improvement encouraging the team to
learn from their experiences and make
incremental changes by regularly
reflecting and adapting the team can
optimize their processes and Achieve
better outcomes now let let us
understand the scrum process flow the
scrum process revolves around the Sprint
cycle beginning with the Sprint planning
and ending with the Sprint
retrospective this cycle ensures a
regular keyence of work and continuous
delivery of value if we talk about the
first one we have the Sprint planning
here here the team selects the item for
the product backlog and defines the
Sprint goal they break down the work
into smaller task and create the plan
for the Sprint now guys let us discuss
about the Scrump process flow the first
one that we have all over here that is
called as Sprint planning here the team
selects the items from the product
backlog defines the Sprint goal to break
down the work into smaller tasks and
create a plan for the Sprint next one we
have the daily scrum daily scrum here
the team meets daily to discuss progress
plans and challenges this meeting keeps
everyone aligned and allows for quick
adjustments third is Sprint review at
the end of the Sprint the team
demonstrates the completed work to the
stakeholders and gathers feedback the
product owner updates the product
backlog based on their feedback and
fourth one we have all over here is
Sprint retrospective here the team
reflects on their processes and
practices identifying areas for
improvement they create action items to
enhance their performance in future
Sprints I hope so you would have got a
brief idea regarding scrum process flow
now let us move on to understanding the
benefits of scrum so guys scrum offers
several significant benefits that can
transform how teams work and deliver
value here are some of the key
advantages the first one that we have
all over here is increased transparency
scrum promotes transparency through its
regular events and clear artifacts a
daily scrum Sprint review Sprint
retrospective ensures that everyone is
aware of the team's progress challenges
and successes this transparency helps
build trust among the team member and
stakeholders fostering a collaborative
and open working environment next one we
have all over here is improved team
collaboration the collaborative nature
of the scrum encourages team members to
work closely together leveraging their
diverse skills and expertise the scrum
Master facilitates this collaboration
helping the team communicate effectively
and resolve
conflicts this teamw work leads to
better problem solving Innovation and
overall
productivity next one we have enhanced
ability to adapt to changes scrums
iterative approach allows teams to
quickly adapt to changes in requirements
market conditions or customer feedback
by delivering small functional
increments regularly the team can get
the feedback and make necessary
adjustments this flexibility ensures
that product remains aligned with the
stakeholders needs and
expectations and finally it provides
faster delivery of valuable products
increments scrums time box Sprints Drive
the regular delivery of product
increments enabling faster time to
Market this rapid delivery cycle allows
stakeholders to see tangible progress
and realize value sooner it also reduces
the risk of project delays and enhances
the team ability to meet deadlines now
let us discuss some of the common
challenges of following scrum
methodology we all know that scrum
offers many benefits but it also comes
on with its own set of challenges here
are some of the common issues teams May
face the first one that we have all over
here
is resistance to change introducing
scrum can be met with resistance
especially in organization accustom to
traditional project management methods
to overcome this resistance it's
important to provide Education and
Training on scrum principles and
practices involving team members and
stakeholders in transition progress and
highlighting the benefits of the scrum
can also help build support next we have
handling distributed teams distributed
teams can face Comm ation and
collaboration challenges to address
these issues it's crucial to leverage
technology tools such as video
conferencing instant messaging and
collaborative software establishing
clear communication protocols and
regular virtual meetings can also help
maintain alignment and cohesion among
team members then we have managing large
projects with scrum a scaling scrum for
large projects can be complex one
approach is to adopt Frameworks like
scrums of scrums Nexus or safe which is
is scaled agile framework it provides
guidelines for coordinating multiple
scrum teams ensuring that teams are
cross functional and self-organizing
with clear communication channels which
are very very essential for managing
large projects
effectively now let us dive into most
interesting part that is what are the
tools and softwares which are used for
scrub so guys several tools and
softwares can support scrum practices
enhancing productivity and collaboration
here there are some of the most popular
options the first one I would recommend
is jira jira is a widely used project
management tool that offers robust
support for scrum it provides features
for creating and managing product
backlogs Sprint backlogs and tracking
progress through Visual boards J's
customizable workflows and Reporting
capabilities make it a powerful tool for
scrum team next one we have all over
here is Trello Trello is a flexible
userfriendly tool that uses boards lists
and cards to organize tasks it's well
suited for scrum teams allowing them to
create and manage backlogs plan Sprints
and track progress Trello Simplicity and
visual nature make it easy to use
especially for smaller teams or project
and finally we have Azure devops Azure
devops is a comprehensive suit of
development tools that supports scrum
and other agile methodologies it
includes features or backlock management
Sprint planning continuous integration
and deployment aure devops integrates
seamlessly with other Microsoft tools
making it a good choice for teams using
Microsoft ecosystem so guys in this
tutorial we have covered the fundamental
aspects of scrum including its roles
artifacts events and processes do you
remember when the first iPhone came out
in 2007 it was a game changer but if you
try to use the same iPhone today you
might feel outdated that's because
technology moves fast and customer
demands keep evolving so Tech giants
like apple must keep innovating and
investing heavily in research and
development to stay ahead keeping track
of the entire process from ideon to
product launch is a massive task
especially for companies dealing with
complex manufacturing and global
distribution this is where the product
life cycle management PLM comes in
before product life cycle management
companies had a really tough time
different teams didn't always talk to
each other and and it was hard to keep
track of all the information about a
product causing problems like delays and
products that didn't quite hit the mark
Apple saw this and knew they needed a
better way to manage their products from
start to finish so they came up with PLM
strategies that is product life cycle
management strategies and special
computer programs to help everyone work
together better with product life cycle
management everyone involved in making
and selling the product could share
information and work together very
smoothly so this was how Apple keeps
launching new Innovative products like
the latest iPhone or the Apple watch
while phasing out the older models so if
you have ever wondered how companies
like apple keeps delivering such Cutting
Edge Products it's all about managing
the entire life cycle effectively in
this video we will explore what PLM is
that is product life cycle management
the various phases and steps involved
it's benefit through a simple example
let us now understand what is product
life cycle management product life cycle
management is like the blueprint that
guides companies through the entire
journey of a product from its birth to
its retirement take for instance the
evolution of smartphones in the
development stage companies like Apple
or Samsung spends month designing and
perfecting the new phones deciding on
features like camera quality battery
life and screen size once the design is
locked in they move on to the
introduction stage where the new phone
is launched with much fanfare and
marketing Buzz as people start buying
the new phone it enters into the growth
stage sales Skyrocket and the company
may even release updated versions with a
better features like enhanced cameras or
faster processors to keep up with the
demand and stay ahead of the competition
but eventually every phone reaches to
the maturity stage competitors catch up
and sales STS to level off that's when
companies might offer discounts or
bundle deals to keep custom customers
interested but inevitably sales begin to
decline as newer models hit the mark and
that's where the PLM shines throughout
the entire process it helps companies to
make critical decisions like when to
release updates how much inventory to
keep and when to discontinue the product
all together by effectively managing the
product life cycle companies can stay
agile maximize profit and always offer
the customers the best products now that
we have discussed what product life
cycle management is we will now
understand the different phases of
product development when it comes to
products we go through a journey from
just being an idea to becoming real
tangible thing that customers can buy
and use this journey is what we call the
product life cycle and it has several
phases let's use the example of a new
smartphone to illustrate these phases it
all starts with the concept and design
phase this is where the magic happens
the initial ideon research on what
customers want studying competitive
products and defining the smartphone's
core features requirements once the
concept is locked in we move on to the
development phase here the detailed
designs and prototypes are created
tested and refined based on the real
world feedback imagine Engineers
tinkering with different models running
all sorts of validation tests and making
sure the smartphone is ready for the
prime time with all that hard work done
it's time for the production and the
launch phase this is where the final
Market ready version of the smartphone
is produced and rolled out to the stores
and online outlets for customers to get
their hands on it but the journey
doesn't end here after launch comes in
the service and support phase where the
company provides assistance updates and
resources to help customers get the most
out of their new smartphone purchases
eventually even the best product reach
out to the end of their Road that's when
the retirement phase where the company
figures out the best way to phase out an
aging product maybe offer incentives for
upgrades and potentially recycle or
repurpose components for future
Innovations
so there you have it the five key phases
that product typically go through in the
product life cycle management let me
walk you through the stages of product
life cycle management every product goes
through different stages during the
lifetime known as the product life cycle
this cycle starts when the product hits
the mark after development and ends when
it's taken off the shelves or
discontinued learning the product life
cycle management can help improve your
chances of success in product management
while it's just a model and not perfect
it provides a useful approximation to
understand the stages what a product
goes through the four main stages are
introduction growth maturity decline we
will now learn about the different
stages in detail so let's talk about the
stage one which is Introduction in this
stage a new product is launched into the
market after development companies
typically spend a lot on promotional
efforts like advertising and getting the
product onto shelves and in front of the
customers example when Apple launches a
a new iPhone model they heavily market
and advertise it across the channel they
also work to get it stocked at mobile
carriers and retail stores worldwide for
the release date this is usually little
to no profit made at the stage as the
cost of the launch are so high the first
buyers tend to be innovators and the
early adopters excited to try the new
offering despite potential issues let us
now talk about the stage two which is
the growth stage in this stage the
product moves to the growth stage where
the consumer demands accelerates the
primary objectives are to rapidly gain
as much as market share as possible and
bring aboard new customer segments your
focus shifts to aggressive marketing
promotions and added product features
and models to appeal to different
customer groups for example Apple
markets the new iPhone to different
audiences like professionals Gamers
photographers Etc they add new color
options and storage capacities to give
buyers more choices retail channels and
online ordering systems have to handle
the huge surge in demand it's critical
to capture as much as market share as
possible in this phase while optimizing
pricing for both growth and
profitability before too many
competitors emerge let us now move on to
stage number three which is the maturity
stage after an initial growth spur the
product life cycle reaches to its
maturity stage where the market becomes
saturated and sales growth starts
flattening the main goals transition to
maximizing profitability defending
market share and differentiating the
product from increasing competition
companies May introduce product
variations and new models while
leveraging lower prices promotions and
revamped marketing we can say for
example Apple continues releasing
updated iPhone models like 11 12 13 Etc
every year with adding new designs
features like better camera and prices
spanning different segments older models
get discounted marketing emphasize what
differentiates them from the latest
Android Rivals as a product manager your
focus is on continuously improving
production and operational efficiency to
cut cost and maximize profit during this
extended maturity stage of the product
line we will not talk about the stage
four which is the decline eventually
even the more successful products enter
an inevitable decline stage as the
market becomes saturated and Innovations
start making the product obsolete or you
can say unappealing companies may try to
Res segment the market with new model
or versions promote different usage
occasions cut prices dramatically to
flush out remaining inventory or
ultimately discontinue the product for
example Apple could release an ultra
affordable iPhone for emerging markets
or focus on just score basic functions
or they could use transition customers
to a new generation of foldable AR
enable devices once smartphone sales
bottoms out as a product manager Your
Role is to determine if anything can be
done to breathe out new life into to the
product line or just oversee the cost
effective wind down and transition
customers to replacement offerings for
product managers understanding and
planning for each product life cycle
stage is very important to make the
product a big success we have now
discuss all the details let us now delve
into how this tracking is achieved by
measuring product life cycles companies
must make more than just the same
products forever they must continually
innovate and launch new offerings but
how do they know when it's time to move
on to something new the answer lies in
carefully measuring and tracking key
performance indicators which is kpis
across the product life cycle here are
some of the crucial metrics companies
use in the development stage the main
work is on prioritizing user problems
and building viable Solutions key
metrics here are ontime delivery and
team velocity during the launch phase
your goal is to achieve product Market
fit user engagement conversion rates
feature adoption net promoter score NPS
and customer satisfaction score we can
say csat are crucial metrics to measure
product Market fit you can also use
methods like the scen ls survey cohort
retention rate NPS over 30 or the 30%
referral method now in the growth phase
your focus is on gaining market share
through the product differentiation and
growth experiments track user engagement
NPS referral rates customer acquisition
rates market share and even churn rate
in the maturity phase aim to retain
customers by creating product
distinctions and reducing cost monitor
arpu retention rates new feature
development and adoption rates of new
features finally in the decline phase
you can either pivot to find new areas
for growth or gracefully Sunset the
product track burn rates monthly
recurring revenue and annual recurring
Revenue remember qualitative data is
also important throughout these phases
to understand use experiences and
sentiments so that was all for measuring
product life cycle let us not talk about
the future of the product life cycle
management product life cycle management
isn't just a passing Trend it's the
future of how companies will manage
their products with rapid advancements
in technology and shifting consumer
preferences PLM is poised to undergo
significant change with new technologies
like AI better teamwork tools companies
can crunch data and collaborate better
making products faster and smarter than
ever before plus there's the big focus
on being eco-friendly product life cycle
manager is the key to making sure
everything from design to disposal is
green as possible furthermore AS Global
connectivity increases PLM system will
also become more interconnected allowing
for seamless collaboration between teams
regardless of the location realtime data
sharing and Analysis will enable agile
decision making ensuring companies stay
ahead of the curve in today's fastpaced
market let me ask have you ever been in
an interview where they threw a tough
question at you like how would you solve
this product problem it can feel pretty
overwhelming well don't worry today I'm
going to help you out to figure how to
answer these product management case
study questions easily these are the
kinds of question where you have to
solve real business problems like
deciding what features an app should
have or how to launch a new product
let's say you asked to improve the
onboarding process of a food delivery
app sounds tricky not if you want to
know how to break it down in this video
I'm going to show you how to hand handle
these kinds of questionss Step by Step
first I'll explain you how to listen
carefully and ask the right questions
like what's the biggest issue users are
facing or what's the main goal here
understanding the problem is the first
step next I'll show you how to organize
your answer you'll break the problem
into small parts think about the
solution and explain why it's a good
idea for example if you asked to improve
a grocery delivery app you would think
about making it easy easy to use keeping
customers happy and standing out from
the competition finally I'll teach you
how to explain your thinking process the
interviewer wants to see how you can
think and make decisions not just the
final answer so by the end of this video
you'll know how to confidently solve
these case study questions and show the
interviewer that you're ready for the
job so let's get started so the first
thing you want to do is to listen
carefully and take notes when you're
given a case study question it often
includes a lot of information
information sometimes too much your goal
here is to understand the key details
whether the case is about prioritizing
features for a new app or creating a
goto Market strategy it's crucial to
capture the most important points let's
say the interviewer ask how would you
prioritize features for a new music
streaming app right away you want to
note down things like the target
audience who will be using this app is
it designed for a casual listeners or
music professionals then we have
business goal is the company looking to
grow its user base or increase
engagement or something else you'll also
look into the challenges what are the
key problems what they are facing maybe
users are dropping off after the first
month or aren't spending much time in
the app so writing these points will
help you break down the problem and make
sure you don't miss anything when you're
ready to give your answer remember case
studies can have multiple layers of
information so taking good notes help
you organize your thoughts and approach
the question logically the second step
is to ask clarifying questions don't
hesitate to ask clarifying questions
interviewers want to see how well you
dig into the problem if something is
unclear ask it shows how you're thinking
critically and want to fully understand
the challenge before you jump into
solving it for example let's say you are
asked to improve a product features for
a food delivery app you could ask
questions like what are the main points
for users during the delivery process is
it related to the speed user interface
or something else what's the company
goal with this this feature Improvement
are we focusing on reducing order time
increasing customer satisfaction or
something else asking questions like
these will not only help you gather more
details but also demonstrate the
interviewer that you have a thoughtful
and precise in your approach it's not
just about solving the problem it's
about solving the right problem the next
step is to pause and think now take a
moment to pause and think don't rush
your answer it's tempting to jump right
in but giving yourself time to process
everything will help you approach the
case study with a clear mind reflect on
the problem and consider how it ties
into the broader goals of the company
for example if you're task with
designing a feature for a food delivery
app think beyond the feature itself
consider the user experience Market
positioning and the longterm impact on
the business let's say you asked to
improve the signup process for a food
delivery app you don't want to just
think about making the process shorter
you also want to consider how the signup
flows into the overall experience is it
simple intuitive for the users does it
create a seamless transition into the
rest of the app or not also encouraging
users to place an order right away
taking a moment to pause allows you to
think through different aspects of the
case and gives you a chance to identify
any connections that might not be
immediately obvious the next step is to
structure your answer now that you have
gathered your information and ask
clarifying questions it's time to
structure your answer a clear and well
organized response will show the
interviewer that you can handle complex
problems in a logical way here's a
framework that works well the problem
start by clearly relating the business
challenges or opportunity for example
the food delivery app is facing high
card abundent rates during checkout
which is impacting conversation your
approach will should be explaining how
you would approach the problem this
might involve analyzing user Behavior
conducting market research or
benchmarking against competitors for
instance you could say I would start
analyzing data or user Behavior to
identify the exact point where customers
are dropping off during checkout I would
also look at competitors's app to see
how they streamline their checkout
process then propose a solution for
example to solve the card issue I would
simplify the checkout process by
introducing oneclick checkout option for
returning users and offering payment
options that are most popular in the
Target region finally mention the key
metrics you would track to measure
success for example you would track the
card completion rate and the average
time spent in the checkout flow as key
indicators of success Additionally you
would monitor customer satisfaction
rates post purchase this structured
approach helps you provide a
comprehensive answer without missing any
important details let's say the case
study ask you how you would enter new
market for a right share app you could
structure your answer like this problem
entering a new city and competing with
established players your approach should
be studying the city's public transport
support habits and competitors offerings
identifying what users in the city value
most the price speed or convenience Your
solution should be like launching a
pilot program with right incentives for
early adopters and offering personalized
right suggestions based on the previous
stps for metrics you should know how to
track customer acquisition ride
frequency and average ride distance to
measure success the next step is
explaining your thought process as you
explain your answer don't just jump into
the final solution walk the interviewer
through your thoughts step by step this
help the interviewer understand how you
would arrive at your solution and what
factors you consider along the way for
example if you're designing a feature
for an e-commerce platform you might say
I start by analyzing the customer
journey and finding out that many users
abandoned their cards during the payment
stage based on user feedback you would
learn the customers want more payment
option so you decide to implement PayPal
or oneclick checkout feature for logged
in users so this approach not only shows
that you're thinking critically but also
demonstrates that your solution is
grounded in user needs and business
goals remember interviewers want to see
how you think so explaining your process
step by step gives them insight into
your problem solving abilities now the
next step is to Pivot and check in with
the interviewer here's an important step
pivot and check in with the interviewer
after you have explained your approach
it's a good idea to pause and ask does
this align with with what the company is
aiming for or would you like me to dive
deeper into any of the specific area
this shows that you're open to feedback
and willing to adjust your approach
based on the input which is crucial
skill for any product manager
flexibility is the key in this role and
checking in with the interviewer
demonstrates that you can adapt your
strategy as needed let's say you're
discussing a product launch strategy
after explaining your approach you could
ask do you think this timeline works for
your team or should we consider a launch
or test the market first this kind of
back and forth creates more interactive
discussion allowing the interviewer to
give you feedback and potentially guide
you toward the direction they are
looking for the next step is to
summarize your answer before wrapping up
it's important to summarize your answer
quickly restate the problem your
approach the solution and the success
metrics for example to summarize my
solution for improving down on booting
process involves simplifying the sign of
Flow by offering social media login
options and displaying a progress bar to
give user a sense of completion success
would be measured by tracking the number
of completed signup and the time uses
spend during the process this final
recap reinforces the key points you have
made and leaves a strong impression on
the interviewer it also shows you that
you can clearly concisely communicate
complex ideas so what are the type of
question asked in the product management
interview product management interview
typically covers a range of questions
designed to test your problem solving
strategy and communication skills here
are the five types of questions you
might encounter first you have product
design questions these questions ask for
example how would you design an app for
grocery delivery that provides a better
user experience the goal is to access
your ability to think from the users
perspective and create intuitive
solution the second question is the goto
Market strategy questions these
questions focus on how you would launch
a product into the market for instance
how would you create a go-to market
strategy for new streaming service they
access your understanding of market
analysis competitive benchmarking and
customer needs feature prioritize
questions these are the questions about
how would you decide the features to
build first for example if you're
managing a project management tool how
would you prioritize adding new features
like task scheduling integration with
email or reporting tools then we have
metrics and data analysis questions
these questions ask you to Define which
metrics matters the most and how would
you use user data to guide your
decisions for example what metrics would
you track to measure the success of a
new product launch then we have
behaviorial questions these access you
how to handle certain situations just
conflict resolution or leadership for
instance tell me about a time when you
disagreed with a team member about a
product decision how did you resolve it
so understanding these type of questions
help you to prepare for a variety of
challenges in product management
interview and shows the interviewer that
you're equipped to tackle the diverse
responsibilities of the rule there's no
right answer what matters is showing
your thought process and decision making
skills so guys let's start with the
first question that is how do you
determine which features to incorporate
into a product so guys this is a very
amazing question and think about it
before answering so guys you would
answer something like this in
determining which features to
incorporate into a product say that you
prioritize aligning with user needs and
business objectives you gather an
extensive user feedback through surveys
interviews to understand what features
are most desired market research also
helps to identify Trends and benchmarks
against competitors to prioritize
effectively say I use Moscow method
categorizing features into must have
should have could have and won't have
this structured approach ensures that we
focus on delivering features that
provide maximum value to our users and
support our business goals strategically
so by maintaining a Clear Vision of
what's essential we enhance our products
relevance and competitiveness in the
market so guys this forms the answer of
this question so you can answer
something like this now let us move on
to our next question that is how do you
strike a balance between qualitative and
quantitative metrics so guys the
solution is say like striking a balance
between qualitative ative and
quantitative metrics is a crucial for
comprehensive understanding of the
products impact qualitative data
gathered through user interviews and
feedback sessions offers insights into
user experiences and satisfaction level
quantitative data collected via
analytical tools provides hard numbers
on the usage patterns engagement rates
and conversion metrics say that you
employ AB testing to compare different
user experiences quantitatively while
also incorporate in qualitative insights
to understand why certain features
perform better this dual approach also
ensures that your decisions are not only
data driven but also deeply informed by
actual user sentiments leading to more
user Centric product developments so
guys this is the answer of this question
now let us move to our third question
the third question is can you explain
your process of leading a product
development team from initial concept to
the launch so guys this is the
experience based question so you can
answer something like this say that
leading a product development team from
concept to launch involves several
structured phases initially say that you
start with a concept validation phase
where you brainstorm ideas conduct
market research and GA initial feedback
then you move into the design and
prototyping phase where you develop
mockups and prototypes that are tested
both internally and with a selected
group of users development follows with
an agile methodology allowing for
iterative testing and refinement based
on ongoing feedback say that before
launch the product underg goes rigorous
QA testing to ensure functionality and
reliability and post launch you monitor
use of feedback and performance metrics
closely to prepare for the next
iteration throughout this process
regular communication stakeholder
updates and adaptive planning are key to
navigating challenges and ensuring
alignment with the project goals now let
us move on to our next question that is
how do you balance user feedback with
business objectives during product
development so you can answer something
like this that balancing user feedback
with business objective involves a
careful assessment of how features align
with our strategic goals while
fulfilling user needs during development
process say that you conduct a frequent
user testing sessions to GA actionable
insights this feedback is analyzed in
the context of our business objectives
to determine feature prioritization then
regular alignment meetings with
stakeholders also ensures that there is
a clear understanding and agreement on
the direction you are taking say that
this process help you to create a
product that not only Delights the users
but also drives the business forward
ensuring sustainability and growth so
guys this is the answer for this
question I hope so you would have got a
brief idea regarding this now let us
move on to our fifth question question
so guys our fifth question is
interviewer can ask you about their
product something like this that what
knowledge do you have about our products
and how can you summarize the current
state of our market so say that based on
my research your product stands out due
to their Innovative approach in the
specific industry like healthcare
Finance XY Z you can add it then you can
say about the current market that is
experiencing describe its Trends with
significant shift that are driven by you
can mention any relevant technology or
any consumer Behavior changes talk about
competitor analysis say about competitor
a and competitor B like how they are
adapting and which keeps the market
Dynamic tell also that your products
unique features like mention unique
features providing a Competitive Edge so
guys understanding these Dynamics would
make a perfect answer of this question
now let us move on to our next question
that is a beh behavioral question and it
is something like this so if your
interviewer asks it that have you ever
encountered difficulties in securing
buyin from a stakeholder so guys this is
also a scenario based question you can
answer something like this say yes
securing stakeholder in buyin can be
pretty challenging especially when
proposals involve significant investment
or change so say one particular instance
involved in persuading a stakeholder to
approve a costly feature integration say
that you address their concerns by
representing a detailed ROI analysis
projecting long-term benefits against
the initial cost so by aligning the
feature benefits with the Strategic
business goals and demonstrating the
potential Market expansion say that you
are able to secure their approval so
guys in this way you can answer this
question now let us move on to our
seventh question that is what strategies
and tools do you use to prioritize
features during product development and
how do you handle technical depth so
guys you can answer this question
something like this say that
prioritizing features during product
development is crucial for meeting
delivery timelines and maximizing the
product impact say that you employ the
Moscow method to prioritize
feature-based in their necessary and
impact tools like you use jira that
helps to manage priorities effectively
ensuring transparency across the team
and in the technical depth say that it
is managed by dedicating a portion of
each development Sprint to refactoring
and addressing the Legacy issues so this
proactive approach prevents the
accumulation of technical depth and in
this way you can answer this question
now let us move on to our next question
that is how do you manage a conflicting
technical requirement or priorities from
different stakeholders say that managing
conflicting technical requirement
involves a balanced approach where
communication and prioritization are the
key say that in the stakeholder meeting
meetings you encourage open discussions
to understand each perspective fully
talk about use a weighted scoring model
to assess the impact and necessity of
each requirement say that it helps in
making informed decisions that align
with the projects strategic goals while
accommodating stakeholders concerns as
much as possible talk about that regular
updates and clear communication ensures
stakeholders remain informed about the
reason behind certain decision and also
fostering trust and collaboration so
this makes a perfect answer for this
question now let us move on to our ninth
question so guys our ninth question is
like can you provide an example of a
product that didn't meet initial
performance expectations and how you
optimized this so guys this is also a
scenario based question if you have
encountered anything like this so you
can talk about your experience so here's
a model answer for this question talk
about that once you launch a product
that didn't meet the expected
performance metrics initial user
feedback indicated issues with the user
interface and overall responsiveness say
that you quickly gathered a task force
team to address these issues using
performance profiling tools to identify
and resolve bottl legs say that you also
reevaluated the user interface based on
specific feedback making it more
intuitive so after optimizations you
conducted a relaunch campaign with
significantly improved user engagement
and satisfaction so guys this experience
basically highlighted the importance of
agility and responsiveness in product
management and it makes a perfect answer
to this question now let us move on to
our next question that is how do you
ensure that your product development
team remains Innovative while adhering
to Agile methodologies and meeting
deadlines so guys answer to this
question is that fostering Innovation
within agile framework involves
encouraging creative thinking and
providing opportunities for
experimentation
say that you organize regular hackathons
and dedicate Sprints for exploring new
ideas so in this way it motivates the
team but also leads to Innovative
solution so guys this marks the perfect
answer to this question now let us move
on to our next question that is what
specific tools or Frameworks do you find
most effective for tracking and managing
product development progress such as
jira or Trello so guys the answer to
this question is you can say that for
managing product development you prefer
using jira due to its comprehensive suit
of agile project management tools then
you can talk about its Effectiveness for
tracking Sprint progress managing
backlogs and distributing task across
teams for Less complex project when
working say that you use Trello which
provides a visually intuitive platform
that simplifies task management so guys
in this way it marks the perfect answer
to this question now let us move on to
our next question
that is can you discuss a time when you
had to Pivot a product strategy based on
technical limitations or Market feedback
so guys you can talk about something
like this that during one project you
initially plan to integrate an advanced
AI feature however technical assessments
and early user feedback highlighted
performance issues and steep learning
curve for our target audience realizing
these challenges said that you decided
to Pivot the strategy instead of complex
AI solution you implemented a more
userfriendly rule-based automation
feature that achieved similar result but
with greater acceptance and less
technical risk so this strategic pivot
not only addressed the technical
limitation but also aligned better with
the market needs that ultimately enhance
the product success and user
satisfaction so you can tell your answer
something like this now let us move on
to our 13th question so guys our 13th
question is what method methods do you
use to validate product idea from
technical perspective before the
development begins like such as
prototyping or user testing so guys you
can answer this question something like
this that validating a product idea
technically starts with prototyping
which allows us to visualize and test
functionality of the core features say
that you often employ tools like sketch
or figma for uiux prototypes and then
use platforms like Invision for
interactive simulation following ing
prototyping you conduct feasibility
studies and proof of concept test to
ensure the technical viability of the
proposed solution then you do user
testing utilize both focus groups and AB
testing setups which provides feedback
on the user experience and interface it
is also very crucial for making
iterative improvements before full scale
development begins so guys you can
answer this question something like this
now let us move on to our 14th question
that is how do you maintain effective
communication and collaboration with
cross functional teams including
developers and designers during product
development so guys this is also
experience-based question so if you have
worked in an industry where you have
came across these scenarios so guys you
can answer this question something like
this say that effective communication
and collaborations are maintained by
establishing clear communication
channels and regular interaction
routines say that you use agile
methodologies which facilitate in Daily
standups Sprint planning reviews and
retrospectives that ensures continuous
dialogue and timely updates across all
teams say that you also use jira and
Confluence for tracking task and sharing
documentation also you say that you use
joint design and development Sprints to
encourage a collaborative environment
where developers and designers can align
their work closely which also Fosters a
holistic approach to product development
now now let us move to our final
question that is what is your approach
for managing technical risk and ensure
code quality in product development it
is also very very important question so
guys you can pause this video and think
about it you can answer this question
something like this say that managing
technical risks start with a proactive
approach to identifying potential issues
in the early development process say
that you implement robust testing
strategies including unit test integr
test and end to end test which
facilitates automated testing Frameworks
like selenium and just then say that you
do regular code reviews and pair
programming sessions which you can say
that are part to your routine to
maintain High code standards and Foster
knowledge sharing within the team to
ensure that ongoing code quality you use
continuous integration and continuous
deployment pipelines which automates the
testing and deployment processes it also
allows you to detect and resolve issues
swiftly say that you do regular Audits
and adopt the latest security practices
that are kind of integral to your
product strategy you also ensure the
product is not only functional but is
also secure and reliable so guys that
