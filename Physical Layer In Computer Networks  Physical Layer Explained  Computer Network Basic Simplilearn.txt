hey everyone welcome to Simply learn
today we will explore the physical layer
in the computer network let's understand
this with the help of an example imagine
you sending a message to a friend across
the globe you type it out hit send and
within seconds your friend receives it
have you ever wondered how this magic
happens this seamless communication is
all thanks to the physical layer in the
computer networks according to Cisco
global internet traffic reached an
astounding 79 zabt that's 79 trillion
gabyt of data flying around the world
facilitated by the intricate workings of
the physical layer the physical layer is
the Bedrock of any computer network
responsible for converting Digital Data
into signals that can travel through
various media like copper wires fiber
optics or radio waves think of it as the
road system for your data ensuring that
your message navigates the was digital
landscape efficiently
and arrives at its destination intact so
in this video we'll uncover the
fascinating details of the physical
layer exploring how it makes mod

have an introduction to computer
networks so computer network is a
collection of interconnected devices
that can share data and resources and
these networks enable communication
between devices allowing users to send
emails browse the web and share files
think of a computer network as a city's
transportation system just like roads
allow cars buses and bikes to travel
from one place to another a network
allows computers to send information
back and forth these could be emails web
pages video calls just about any data
you can think of networks can be small
like a network in your home connecting
your family's devices or incredibly vast
like the internet which connects
millions of computers worldwide so this
was about the computer networks now
we'll have an overview of the OSI model
so the OSI model that is open system
interconnection model is a conceptual
framework used to understand Network
interaction in seven layers so each
layer has a specific role like a team in
a company where every department handles
a different aspect of the business
number one is physical layer this is
like the ground or roads in your city
analogy it deals with the literal
physical components of the network like
cables radio signals and ethernet it's
concerned with transmitting row bits or
a physical data link connecting network
noes then comes data link C imagine this
as traffic Management systems that
organize data flow so that bits can find
the way without crashing into each other
it provides Note toote data transfer a
link between two directly connected
nodes it also handles error correction
from the physical layer then comes the
network layer that is layer three this
is like the navigation system that finds
the best path for data to travel across
networks it determines the physical path
the data should take BAS Bas on network
conditions priy of service and other
factors then comes transport layer that
is layer four consider this as the
delivery service that ensures that the
entire message arrives intact and in
order making sure the data is error free
and complete it's essential for managing
and maintaining data flows between host
then comes the session layer that is
layer five this layer sets up manages
and ends connections between application
it's like a conductor who starts and
stops the Orest performance at the right
time then comes the presentation layer
layer six think of this as the
translator that converts the data from a
format the network understands to a
format the application can use it's like
someone translating a foreign movie into
your language and then comes the
application layer that is layer seven
this is the top layer for application
access network services this layer
represents the data and services that
most users interact with like emails
browsers and other applications so this
was all about the OSI model so let's see
an example imagine allies there's a
person allies who sends a letter to Bob
and allies writes her letter that is
application layer puts it in an envelope
that is presentation layer and goes to a
post office to mail it that is session
layer and the post office decides which
truck route will be the fastest for the
letter to reach Bob city that is
transport level and once on the road the
letter is sorted with others headed in
the same direction that is Network L
then physically moved across the country
in trucks and planes that is data link
lay finally the letter is delivered to
Bob's male B that is physical l so this
journey from Alice to Bob illustrates
how data travels through the layers in
the OSI model so this was about the OSI
model now moving to the physical layer
and we'll see the importance of physical
layer so the physical layer is the first
first and the lowest layer in the OSI
model of computer networking it is
fundamentally responsible for the road
transmission and deception of
unstructured data streams or a physical
medium it connects the hardware devices
like computers routers switches to the
transmission media such as cables or air
in the case of Wireless this layer is
crucial because it serves as the Gateway
between the data that networks work with
and the physical means by which the data
travels so let's understand this with
the help of an example imagine you are
sending a text message to a friend when
you hit send your phone converts the
message into electrical signals so this
is the example here so when you hit the
send your phone converts the message
into electrical signals that travel
through cables satellites and wireless
networks to reach your friend's phone
where it is converted back into Rea data
this seamless process is thanks to the
physical lb now that we have understood
or introduced the physical l and its
role in The OSI model let's dive deeper
into the specific functions it performs
so understanding these functions will
help you grasp how the physical layer
ensures smooth and reliable data
transmission across networks so let's
start with the functions of the physical
layer number one is data encoding and
Signal transmission so the physical
layer converts data into signals that
can transmit over physical media like
cables or Airwaves this process is
called encoding the signals can can be
electrical Optical or radio waves
depending on the transmission medium
example think of encoding as translating
a message into more code the message
that is data is encoded into dots and
dashes that is signals that travel
through a telegraph wire that is
transmission medium so this was the
example now mov to the next function
that is bit synchronization and rate
control so bit synchronization ensures
that the sender and receiver are aligned
in time so the data bits are correctly
interpreted rate control manages the
speed at which data is sent to prevent
congestion and ensure efficient
transmission for example imagine two
people talking over a bokit toi they
need to speak at the same Pace that is
rate control and wait for the over
signal before responding that is
synchronization so this is the example
for this function now move to the next
example that is physical topology
management so the physical layer
determines the layout of devices and
Connections in a network known as
topology common topologies include bus
star ring and mesh so let's understand
this with an example so think of network
topology like a city map the layout of
roads and intersections that is Network
typology determines how vehicles that is
data travel between locations that is
devices so now coming to the fourth
function that is interface with
transmission media so the physical layer
interfaces with the actual transmission
media example cables fiber optics
Wireless to send and receive signals it
ensures the proper connection and
interaction between devices and media
for example consider plugging a USB
drive into computer the USB port that is
physical layer enables the driver to
communicate with the computer by
providing the physical connection so
this was about the functions of physical
L now that we have understand the
functions of the physical layer let's
explore the types of transmission media
it uses to send and receive data so
transmission media can broadly
categorized into wired and wireless
media so let's start with wir media so
number one in wi media is twisted pair
cables so these are pairs of insulated
copper wires Twisted together to reduce
interference example they are used in
telephone lines and ethernet cables then
comes qual cables so these consist of a
central conductor insulating layer
metallic shield and outer cover they are
less suspectible to interference for
example they're commonly used in cable
television networks and then comes fire
Optics so these are light signals to
transmit data through strands of glass
or plastic offering high speed and low
signal lows example they're used in
highspeed internet connections and
longdistance communication then comes
wireless media and in wireless media
number one is radio waves so these use
electromagnetic waves for data
transmission or long distances without
physical connectors for example they're
used in Wi-Fi am or FM radio and mobile
Communications then comes microwaves so
these are highly frequency radio waves
that provide high-speed communication or
long distances for example they are used
in Satellite Communications and pointto
point links and then comes infrared so
these are infrared light for short range
communication typically within a line of
sight for example used in remote
controls and short distance data links
so these transmission media are the
physical paths that connect devices in a
network enabling the flow of data across
the globe so after learning about the
types of transmission media it's
essential to understand how data is
transmitted or these media so we'll have
a look at the signal Transmissions so
number one signal transmission is analog
signals so analog signals are continuous
waves that vary in amplitude and
frequency for example think of a
traditional am or FM radio where the
sound is carried by wearing wave
patterns then comes digital signals so
digital signals are discrete with two
states high that is one and low that is
zero for example imagine how a computer
processes information using binary code
that is ones and zeros then comes
modulation methods and in that we have
amplitude modulation so that varies the
amplitude of the carrier wave to encode
data for example used in AM radio
broadcasting and then comes the FM that
is frequency modulation that VAR is the
frequency of the carrier wave to encode
data the example is that is common in FM
radio broadcasting and then comes phase
modulation so that varies the phase of
the carrier wave to encode data and the
example is it is used in digital data
transmission and some radio
communication systems and then comes the
number third that is baseband and
Broadband
transmission so baseband transmission is
that transmits data or a single Channel
using the entire band width of the
medium for example ethernet networks use
baseband transmission and when we come
to broadband transmission that transmits
data or multiple channels dividing the
bandwidth into separate frequencies
example is cable TV and internet
services they use Bron band transmission
now that we have covered signal
transmission techniques now we know
about the physical layer and with that
