hey everyone welcome to this video on
population and sample by simply learn in
this video we will introduce you to the
concept of population and sample along
with some real world examples of where
they should be used so let's get started
so what can you expect from this video
what's in it for you
first we will answer the question what
is population
then we will explain the meaning of
samples to you
we will look at some differences between
population and samples by looking at
some common examples
followed by
looking at how we can collect data from
a population
and from a sample
so what is the population
in statistics population is the entire
set of items from which data is drawn
for a statistical study it can be a
group of individuals a set of items etc
it constitutes the data pool for a study
in general a population is the entire
group that you want to draw conclusions
about
usually when we talk about population
you think about the people living in an
area at a time but in research a
population doesn't always refer to
people it can mean a group containing
elements of anything you want to study
such as objects events organizations
countries species organisms etc
for example all undergraduate students
in the netherlands or say you would like
to know whether there is an association
between job performance and the amount
of home working hours per week in the
specific case of belgian data scientists
in this case the population may be
belgian data scientists however if the
scope of the study is more narrow then
the population will be more specific and
include only workers who meet that
certain criteria
the point is that the population should
only include people to whom the results
will apply
since in this case and many others it is
impossible to observe the entire
statistical population due time
constraints constraints on geographical
accessibility and constraints on the
researchers
a researcher would instead absorb the
statistical sample from the population
in order to attempt to learn something
about the population as a whole
this brings us to the topic what is a
sample
a sample represents the group of
interest from the population which we
will use to represent our data the
sample is an unbiased set of the
population which best represents the
whole data
a sample consists of some observations
drawn from the population
so a part or a subset of the population
the sample is the group of elements who
actually participated in the study
the size of the sample is always less
than the total size of the population
typically the population is very large
making a census or a complete
enumeration of all values in the
population impractical or impossible
the sample represents a subset of
manageable size samples are collected
and statistics are calculated from the
sample so that one can make
interferences or extrapolations from the
sample to the population this process of
collecting information from a sample is
referred to as sampling
say you are testing the effects of a new
fertilizer on crop yield all the crop
fields represent your population whereas
the 10 crop fields you tested correspond
to your sample
now let's look at the differences
between population and samples with the
help of some examples
the first example would be that all
students in a class would constitute the
population of that class
a sample would be only the top 10
students within the same class
the sample is a small subset of the
population in this case
advertisements for it jobs in india
would mean the complete search results
that pops up when you search it jobs in
india
a sample of that would be the top 50
advertisements for the same jobs
another example is all countries of the
world
this represents a population of all the
countries
a sample would be countries with
published data on birth rates and gdp
since 2000s
next let's look at how to collect data
from a population
data from a population is collected when
your research question needs a large
amount of data or information about
every member of the population is
available
populations are used when your research
question requires or when you have
access to data from every member of the
population usually it's only
straightforward to collect data from a
whole population when it is small
accessible and cooperative
population data is used when the data
pool is small and cooperative to giving
all of the required data for larger
populations we can use sampling to
represent part of the population it is
hard to collect data from
for example a high school administrator
wants to analyze the final exam scores
of all graduating seniors to see if
there is a trend
since there are only interested in
applying the findings to the graduating
seniors in this high school they can use
the whole population data set
for larger and more dispersed
populations it is often difficult or
impossible to collect data from every
individual for example every 10 years
the federal u.s government aims to count
every person living in the country using
the u.s census this data is used to
distribute funding across the nation
however historically marginalized and
low-income groups have been difficult to
contact locate and encourage
participation from
because of non-responses the population
count is incomplete and biased towards
some groups which results in
disproportionate fundings across the
country
in cases like this sampling can be used
to make more precise interferences about
the population
and for that we can collect data from a
sample
how do we go about collecting data from
a sample
samples are used when the population is
large in size scattered or it's
generally hard to collect data on
individual instances within it we can
use a small sample of the population to
make overall hypotheses
when your population is too large in
size geographically dispersed or
difficult to contact it is necessary to
use a sample with statistical analysis
you can use sample data to make
estimates or test hypotheses about
population data
for example you want to study political
attitudes in young people your
population is the 3000 undergrads in the
netherlands because this is not
practical to collect data from all of
them you use the sample of 300
undergraduate volunteers from three
dutch universities this is the group who
will complete your online study
ideally a sample should be randomly
selected and representative of the
population
using probability sampling methods such
as simple random sampling or stratified
sampling reduces the risk of sampling
bias and enhances both internal and
external validity
and with that we come to the end of a
