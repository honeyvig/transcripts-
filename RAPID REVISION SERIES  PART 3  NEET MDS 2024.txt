very very good evening okay the first
important concept you can see my screen
right my screen is clear right for
you clear
visible yes okay okay the first
important concept is about the negative
space okay so negative space is seen
basically in the Buckle Corridor okay so
normally uh whenever the patient smile
okay there are two different types of
smile a norm smile and exaggerated smile
so whenever the patient is going for an
exaggerated smile also uh there are more
than
25% there are more than 25 percentage of
the
patients where the
ging 1/3 okay the ging 1/3 is not
visible when the patient is going for
exaggerated smile also okay Ginger 1/3
is not visible why this Ginger one third
is not visible because of different
things like the activity of the lip or
the length of the lip or uh uh the
amount of uh your alular bone okay so
there are many factors which are going
to control the visibility okay
particularly it is about the lip
thickness of the lip or the length of
the lip is going to control that okay so
what is this uh what is this negative
smile is basically whenever the patient
Smiles okay the patient Smiles there
will be a slight Gap that is present
between the maxillary and mandibular
teeth that slight Gap is is the negative
space or you see that slight Gap where
you have the dark color the dark color
space is called as negative
space the dark color space is negative
space and apart from this the negative
space can be seen Whenever there is a
missing teeth Whenever there is a
missing
teeth okay one or whenever there is a
diastema or whenever there is a
fractured
teeth or uh whenever a poorly restored
teeth is
there so in all these conditions you see
this negative space this is basically
the dark space okay for example in this
particular diagram you can see this dark
space you can see the dark space in this
Buckle Corridor
area right can you see this this is a
dark
space that is seen in the Buckle
Corridor area Okay so the points to be
noted is negative space is basically
seen in the which area it is seen in the
Buckle Corridor area it is basically the
gap between the maxill and mandibular
teeth when the patient is smiling it can
also be seen in the case of mixed teeth
missing teeth diasta factur teeth and
poorly restored teeth
clear clear about the negative
space okay the next one is negtive uh
the next important concept that I want
you guys to make a notice there is
something called as Dead Space so
whenever you're going for a post and
core there is one concept called as Dead
Space dead space
in post and core
okay so what is this dead space in post
and core can you tell me what are the
different types of post you have seen in
your departments in your Coles or if
you're working in a clinic or if you
have your own Clinic can you tell me
what are the different types of posts
you have seen yes one is fiber
post yes most of us has seen fiber post
right fiber posts right fiber posts are
regularly white in color the second one
what we see is metal post hope you have
have seen metal Post in the department
have you seen metal posts sometimes the
metal post will be golden color gold
coating will be there have you seen
metal posts yes right so uh the concept
is basically related to these two posts
okay so which posts are nowadays very
frequently used it is metal posts are
frequently used or Fiber post are
frequently
used yes perfectly right the posts which
are very frequently used nowadays are
fiber post Can it can anyone tell me the
reason why fiber post are most preferred
when compared to metal post
po ah okay Aesthetics okay Aesthetics
that is not the main reason but
Aesthetics okay AR is telling Aesthetics
yes it is white in color so
Aesthetics okay the main reason why you
use Fiber post over metal postes fiber
posts are going to have all the
properties similar to that of the
surrounding Dent because this is if you
consider this as a post okay this is a
post right this is a post and
surrounding the post which is present
the surrounding the post you have Dentin
that is
present so what is going to happen is
fiber post apart from their Aesthetics
Aesthetics how they help the main
important property of a fiber post is
fiber post is going to have all the
properties particularly the coefficient
of thermal expansion or when you're
talking about the modulus of elasticity
so modulus of elasticity cient of
thermal expansion and all the properties
of fiber post are similar to that of the
Dentin so whenever
there is a change in temperature in the
oral cavity how the Dentin is reacting
fiber post also react in the same way
how the Dentin is expanding fiber post
also react in the same way for example
there is a stress how the Dentin is
Distributing the stress fiber post
reacts in the same way transferring the
stress to that of the den you got it
right you got the reason why fiber Bast
are more preferred when compared to that
of
the metal post right clear yeah so that
is the reason why we always prefer to
have a fiber post okay so what is the
problem with the metal post you see here
in this diagram you have a metal post
okay so what is the problem is metal
post metal is going to have most more
coefficient of thermal expansion than
the
Dentin so what is going to happen metal
is going to expand more when there is a
change in temperature when compared with
the Dentin and it is going to cause more
stress on the surrounding Dentin that
may lead to the fracture do you accept
this metal is having more coefficient of
thermal expansion so whenever you heat
it metal expands more and Dentin expands
less and this is going to create stress
and this stress may lead to the facture
in the future okay so that is the reason
why whenever you're looting whenever
you're looting metal posts metal post
looting okay whenever you're looting the
metal post you have to leave some
space allowing leave some space because
this space is going to compensate the
expansion of the metal so you have to
allow some space okay so that the metal
can expand in the space that space is
called as Dead
Space so that space is called as Dead
Space what is dead space in the post and
core to you are going to allow some
space for the metal to expand in the
post and core system that space that
extra space whatever you're leaving is
called as dead space clear right clear
guys okay now tell me okay now tell me
okay the concept of dead space in post
and core is for option a metal post op
option b fiber post option C both what
is your
answer okay right so right right correct
so dead space concept is only for the
metal post you're not going to leave any
sort of Dead Space whenever you're going
for the fiber post clear and what is the
advantage of fiber post over the metal
post is fiber post is going to have all
the properties like for example a
coefficient of thermal expansion or
you're talking about the modulus of
elocity all the properties are similar
to that of the surrounding Dentin so how
a fiber post is going to expand is
almost same as the surrounding Dentin
okay clear
done okay done so then there is one more
concept that most of us are familiar
that is called as dead space in
respiratory system physiology what is
dead space in respirator
system what is dead space in respirator
system so dead space in your respirator
system is a place where gases exchange
does not takes place okay where gases
Exchange
does not takes place that space is
called as dead space no gas
exchange the space is called as Dead
Space so dead space in your respiratory
system is basically of two types what is
that anatomical dead
space and physiological Dead Space okay
anatomical Dead Space is related to the
anatomy whereas physiological Dead Space
is anatomical Dead
Space plus area
where area where gases exchange takes
place previously but now there is no gas
exchange that can be due to a or that
can be due to uses of some some products
or something previously it is an area
where gas exchange takes place but now
it is not gas ex does not takes
place
clear so anatomical Dead Space is
anatomy related physiological Dead Space
is anatomical Dead Space plus areas
where gases exchange does not takes
place clear done okay
now yeah so areas anatomical de space is
basically the upper volume of the the
the inner volume the inner volume of the
upper air waste that is basically the
nose fings trachea and broni and these
are the areas where gas excess does not
takes place so there are those areas are
called as anatomical Dead Space whereas
physiological Dead Space is anatomical
Dead Space plus areas which are
previously gases exchanged but now they
are not able to exchange the gases so
that is called as physiological Dead
Space can you tell me what is the normal
Dead Space value in respiratory
system
normal dead
space in respiratory system yes the
normal uh dead space in the respiratory
system is going to
be 150
ml is going to be 150 ml very good it's
150
ml okay so now you have a case in front
of you so can you tell me what is the
Elise classification of this particular
case
uh you can see a discolored teeth what I
can see is you can see a crack I can see
a
crack one is I can see a crack and I can
see a
discoloration so discoloration is going
to give me a hint that the the theology
can be uh the
necrotic the necrotic pulp so whenever
you have Elise classification leading to
the
uh leading to the necrotic pulp okay uh
nonvital teeth the answer is
Ellis class four right so tell me what
is the treatment plan for
this interns post interns clinicians
what do you what do you do what do you
do if such case is came to your clinic
yes first of all we are going to do
because it's a necrotic teeth okay we
are going to do a normal root canal
therapy normal RC we are going to
do is followed by by why you go why you
go why you want to go for a post and
core Crown is where nice Crown is there
no need of post and
core okay so followed by you are going
to do non
vital bleaching for this case Okay so
once you're done with RC so what you're
going to do is you're going to remove
the gabacha 2 MIM below the ging Regis
or below the marginal Ginga okay then
you are going to keep uh a
barrier so regularly what barriers are
used you're going to keep a barrier so
that the bleaching agent will not go to
the root canal system so what barrier
regularly we are going to use in the
nonvital
bleaching so what barrier we regularly
use in the nonvital bleaching is GIC GIC
or modified
GIC and what is the material of choice
for non vital
bleaching nonvital bleaching is
basically done
by yes nonvital bleaching is basically
done by a combination
of sodium perborate plus hydrogen
peroxide as an
activator okay sodi sodium perorate plus
hydrogen peroxide is basically
used for nonvital
baching Clear guys done can I move I
hope you're clear with this diagnosis of
this case is you can see a crack and a
discoloration that is basically due to
the necrotic pulp and the class and and
the diagnosis is going to be at least
class 4 or if they're asking uh your
like American Association of Endodontics
classification this is going to be an
ecrotic pulp basing upon the
radiographic features or clinical
features you have to diagnose the
periapical area for example if the
patient is having tendron vertical
percussion for this case so the
diagnosis is going to be necrotic teeth
with symptomatic epical
peridontitis radiographically epical
changes are there but symptomatically
the patient is not having any sort of
symptoms then it is going to be necrotic
teeth with asymptomatic epical
parodontitis okay so now what is the
treatment is you do an RC keep a barrier
that is a GIC or resin modified GS
you're going to keep it as a barrier so
once you're done with that you're going
to do nonvital bleaching with sodium
perborate and hydrogen peroxide in
combination okay right clear so next is
uh we we'll have some important
points so this is basically uh metal
ceramic okay so you see metal ceramic uh
crowns okay now tell me what is the
finish line of choice in metal ceramic
Crown metal ceramic Crown Finish Line of
choice
yes metal ceramic Crown has two Finish
Lines one on the labal or facial side
second on the lingual
side the better option for the labial
side is going to be shoulder with
bevel shoulder with bevel is the best
option if you don't have that you can go
with shoulder as an answer and on the
lingual side the answer should be shamer
clear right clear so it has two parts of
Finish Lines laally it is going to be
shoulder with bevel and lingually it is
going to be
shamer next we'll try to understand few
other important points uh that you have
to make a note okay right so one of the
major reason for acceptance of porcelain
fuse to metal is basically because of
its greater strength and resistance to
facture the combination the the
combination of porcelain to that of the
metal fused together is stronger than
the porcelain alone because porcelain is
weak here it is stronger and whenever
there is a failure that is being
happening okay the bond between the
porcelain and metal is so strong so the
failure mostly occur in porcelin only
rather than the porcelin metal interface
okay so those are the important points
next one when you're talking about this
porcelain Fus to metal the metal
substrate substructure should be 05
means the thickness of the metal should
at least 0.5 very frequently Asked
question the minimum thickness of the
porcelin should range from 1 to 1.5
mm so what is going to happen the total
reduction is metal plus porcelin that is
0.5 .5 plus 1 to 1.5 which is total is
equal to
1.5 to 2 mm
which is ideally 1.5 mm thickness is
required the most frequent cause of
paracity in the porcelain is basically
due to inadequate condensation of the
porcelain and that is basically due to
the shape and size of the particles that
are used all these are mcqs okay all
these are
mcqs right here I want you to make one
more important point when you're talking
about the coefficient of thermal
expansion values that is Alpha values of
metal and Porcelain metal should
slightly have more value when compared
to that of the
porcelain and as you know porcelain is
much stronger under compressive forces
when compared to the T Cell forces so
porcelains in all ceramic registration
should be avoided by keeping okay by
keeping the preparations
rounded by keeping the preparations
rounded first important is metal ceramic
Crown labial side shoulder with bevel
lingual side
shamer factures can most commonly occur
in porcelain rather than porcelain metal
interface thicknesses of metal is going
to be 0.5 porcelain thickness is going
to be 1 to 1.5 total thickness is going
to be 1.5 to 2
mm compressive strengths are more when
compared to tensil strengths in the
porcelin so in order to prevent facture
in the case of all ceramic registrations
it is better you round off all the
angles the alpha value of metal is
slightly more than the
porcelain clear
done I'm going to the next concept so
next concept slightly concepts related
to smile designing okay so can can I
know what is the percentage value that
you have to make a note when I'm talking
about Golden
proportion so what is the value of of
golden proportion exact value of golden
proportion yes the exact value of golden
proportion is
61.8% is
61.8%
is so please do make a make a note about
the scientist name
also so golden proportion is basically
telling you that comparison of miso
distal dimension of lateral to Central
or Central to lateral or lateral to
Canine or canine to
lateral that is visual that is that you
view from the frontal area so this is
basically the apparent miso distal
Dimension not the exact Dimension right
you got it right this is not true
Dimension it is apparent Dimension what
is visible from the facial
surface so what is this telling what is
the 61.8 when you compare the Miso
distal dimension
of central incisor
to the Miso distal dimension of
the of the lateral
incisor okay means for example your
central is 100 percentage your lateral
will be 61.8 perent if your lateral is
100% your canine is
61.8% I'm repeating again this is not
the exact misal Dimension this is an
apparent Dimension what you see from the
frontal area so so what is visible
because Canon is slightly curved so
entire Canon will not be seen so
whatever you see that will be 68
percentage of the dimension of the
lateral what you see lateral that is
61.8% of the central incor got it right
you got it
right if they're asking in the ratios
your answer should be
0.618
0.618 or
61.8% okay so I'm done with the golden
proportion the main disadvantage of a
golden proportion is golden proportion
is talking about the apparent Dimension
not the original Dimension that is the
biggest uh that's the biggest
disadvantage of the golden proportion
now you have one more proportion what is
that red proportion red proportion is
nothing but recurring Aesthetic Dental
proportion which is given by
what so what is this basically okay so
lateral
by lateral by
Central is equal
to Canine by
lateral canine by lateral got it right
so 2 by 1 is constant value that is
equal to 3x2 is a constant value so that
is called
as
red proportion there's something called
as M proportion which is very very
frequently given in these examinations M
proportion is telling the width by
length the width by length ratio of a
particular teeth should be 4X
5 they're asking in percentages you need
to go for an answer around like 75 to 80
percentage done if you're done please do
respond
me
