python has surpassed french in primary
schools
this one certainly seems strange
unbelievably python overtook french in
2015 as the most widely used elementary
school language
according to stats sixty percent of
parents would rather want their kids to
learn python than french
this shows that a large number of people
understood the value of python
programming
the same stats show that 75 percent of
elementary school students would choose
to learn how to operate a robot over
fringe are you guys ready to learn the
basics of python
hello everyone and welcome to simply
learn's youtube channel i hope you guys
are doing well
today we'll be taking you through the
python basics full course
this python full course will cover all
the basic level topics of python
in this video you will see how and why
python is used today
by the end of this tutorial you guys
will be able to understand and deploy
basic python projects
but before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have regular updates on multiple

let's go through the agenda for this
full course tutorial
we'll start this video with an
introduction to python followed by
installing python and anaconda in
windows 10.
we'll move on and create our first hello
world program using python
following that we'll cover basic python
topics like
variables and expressions data types in
python and list and tuples in python
then we'll move on and cover conditional
statements and loops in python
we'll go through the syntax and usage of
all the topics we'll cover in this video
we'll end this video by going through a
mini project in python wherein we'll
create certain python projects with all
that we have learned
i hope you guys are ready to learn
something new now we'll start with the
first topic
over to our training expert hello
everyone and welcome to our course on
python programming my name is anish
karan and i will help you learn the
fundamentals of python programming and
what programming in python really means
and what it is all about
i am sure there are plenty of you over
here that are watching this video that
have their own reasons and multiple
reasons to start learning programming
and programming in python in particular
our goal over the duration of this
course is to ensure that you are able to
learn python and learn python
programming to a level in which you can
tackle whatever problems you have and
whatever projects you set out to do in
the future now i'm sure you must have
heard that the some of the most upcoming
fields and some of the high prospect
domains in in the market right now such
as data science ai machine learning
require python programming and our goal
in this course is to get it to a level
where you can start tackling and
creating solutions to whatever problems
you may occur whether it be in your job
or in your studies or anywhere else or
any personal projects that you may
take up in the future now before we
actually get started on the actual
concepts and the fundamentals of python
i want to show you over the next two or
three videos exactly what how python
came to be what was the philosophy
behind creating this language and
basically a brief introduction behind
python and python programming so python
programming was developed first by a
person a dutch programmer by the name of
guido van rossum and python was first
released by him in the year 1991 now the
design philosophy behind python was to
create a language which was much easier
to read and much easier to actually code
in compared to the
or in contrast to the languages that
were prevalent back in those days such
as the language c
now formally python is an interpreted
high level general purpose programming
and what this means is that
python is a it's a language that can be
used for a wide variety of applications
as we will see later
the high level
part of this definition basically tells
us that python is written in a language
that is very abstract at a much higher
abstract level compared to the
instructions that a computer can
actually read so in layman's term you
can say that python is very close to the
actual
language that we humans use and that's
the way python has been designed and the
difference between a high-level
programming language and the low-level
programming language is that low-level
languages are essentially machine
language instructions that are the
actual instructions that a computer can
actually understand a high level
language like python is something that
we humans understand better and we can
write in it better now the term
interpreted over here
essentially means that we don't need to
compile our instructions that we give in
python now as i mentioned earlier that
the computers or any system that
involves computing needs low level
language to be fed to it so that the
computer can actually understand because
computers cannot understand the way we
write our code and this process of
converting from high level to lower
level called compilation and in most
languages such as c there's a special
process involved called compilation
which we do after we create our blocks
of code or scripts or whatever now when
we say python is an interpreted language
what this means is that we can actually
work on python and see the results right
at the get go we can skip this step of
compilation
because our system that runs python
actually does all of that conversion
from high level to a low level
language as we type our code and
this actually speeds up the process very
well for us and makes programming in
python
and other interpreted languages as well
much much easier for us python is of
course an open source language it's uh
the most bare implementation of python
known as c python is actually
even currently being maintained by a
foundation known as the software python
software foundation so essentially
python is being maintained developed by
a group of very talented developers and
it's it's open to pretty much anyone to
work with and to create libraries for
this allows python to be an amazing
language in the in the modern world
because in the modern world we have uh
different issues and different problems
in different spheres and domains that we
we would need
to update our libraries or update our
packages that we use in our programming
language on a very regular basis and so
python being an open source language
allows us to keep updating and keep up
with the times essentially when it comes
to solving problems now let's go over
some of the features of python and these
features are actually
why it's considered
that using python is advantageous over
using other languages so let's start
with some of these points now as we
mentioned python is very it's a very
readable program code readability is
very important it's one of the design
philosophies behind this when it was
being developed it's very easy to learn
which is why python is an entry point
for many people that are just beginning
to learn programming and as i mentioned
earlier it's a high level language in
python we since python is open source as
as i already mentioned so it gets it
benefits from all the the benefits you
get from any open source technology now
it's also portable so what this means is
that if we create a code in python and
we create in a particular system say on
windows
we don't need to make any changes if we
wanted to use the same script or that
same piece of code on some other system
say on a linux system or
a mac system python itself comes with a
very large standard library this this
facilitates us
a lot because we don't need to
create our own libraries or modules or
have to download very specific libraries
most of the problems that we do
encounter
uh quite commonly can already be solved
by the standard libraries that have
already been provided by the developers
of python write right from the beginning
now later later on during the course we
will encounter what is the meaning of a
data structure a data structure is
essentially a manipulation of a if of an
object of an object of data and
as as you will see later
python has one of the most user-friendly
data structures
that can be found in any language
especially compared to some of its
contemporaries now python is a
dynamically programmed language and this
is very important and what this means is
that in most compiler based languages we
there are certain processes that can
only happen during the compilation stage
so
what a dynamic programming language does
is it takes all those
compilation specific
tasks and processes and
it it does it for us as we actually type
the code so we don't need to waste time
or spend extra time to do something that
would otherwise be needed to be only
done in compilation we would have to set
out specific uh runtimes just for that
so this allows us to create our programs
and solutions much faster and allows us
to debug much easier and
yeah so it's a it's it's a very
important feature about python now
quickly i will just go over some of the
areas of python where
like
areas of uh or
different domains where python is very
heavily implemented and the first one
the first few ones that come to mind are
like web development and
ai and machine learning so you have
technologies like django and flash that
are
built on top of python that
are used extensively for web development
when it comes to something like
artificial intelligence or machine
learning you have
distributions such as anaconda you have
pandas and many other libraries like
scipy and numpy that are used
extensively to so tackle problems in
this domain and similarly python finds
use in most of the scientific work that
goes on nowadays uh because of
again some of the libraries that i have
already mentioned such as scipy
interestingly if you are into game
development or gaming in general you
would see that python actually has
certain libraries and certain
technologies that facilitate game
development very very well one very
popular game in fifth in case you are
into gaming is a world of tanks that is
built on python some of the other
applications are of course desktop uh be
creating desktop gui's image processing
graphic design applications and uh
something that is very relevant to me
and of course you as well is uh creation
of education programs and training
courses there are many technologies in
the environment of python that
were almost designed for the specific
purpose of
being able to present certain concepts
or to be able to
teach certain classes and
i can't think of too many programs or
too many environments outside of python
that are better to solve these education
and training course related
problems and situations all right so now
that we have um i have covered some of
the brief brief introductory topics
around python let's talk about what
we're going to see in the next video
we're going to actually i'm going to
show you how you can install some of
these implementations and distributions
i'm going to speak about them i'm going
to speak out of certain libraries and
modules that they come with to install
python on your windows computer it's as
simple as going to the website
python.org and selecting the downloads
section when you do click on downloads
you get redirected to this website that
this webpage that i'm on
out here it by default it will ask you
if you want to download python 3.9 which
is the latest version but of course if
you for whatever reason if you needed a
particular version of python you can
download that as well
by just scrolling down and choosing the
option that you want now it's important
to note that whatever option you choose
of course i would recommend the latest
one but no matter what option you choose
i would recommend you choose a version
of python three point something because
uh previous versions of python namely
python 2.7 and uh and basically every
version of python two point something as
it will not receive any more maintenance
and updates uh because uh the developers
have decided that python will they are
trying to shift towards uh maintaining
and updating python three point whatever
completely right now so yeah
let's not delay this uh any further and
just download python 3.9 so once you
select the option out here uh you'll be
you'll get an installer all you have to
do is click on that and it'll give you
two options to customize installation or
install now i would of course recommend
just to install now since you're a
beginner do not worry about what a
custom installation is if you have
multiple drives in your system by
default the python will be downloaded
into uh the drive where your windows is
actually installed your uh your main
drive so as you can see now that once my
setup is done it should give me a pop-up
soon so my setup is done for python and
this is essentially how you would um
download python on your windows system
uh but what if you had mac os or if you
were using linux well for mac it's uh
it's actually almost as simple you just
go
if you see out here below this download
button python option you get the website
asking you are you looking for python on
a different os and it gives you the
options of linux mac and even other oss
but for mac
if you wanted you would just open this
tab and just like the windows option you
would so choose a version and you would
choose an installer for that version so
if i wanted say python the latest one i
would just download this installer and i
would install my mac system now when it
comes to linux i cannot show you exactly
how you would install it there are
certain commands that you have to
execute but essentially again if you
would just choose the linux option out
here it would take you to a page with
different installers and
essentially packages for linux systems
in specific what i would recommend to
you if you are a linux user and you need
python is to go over to the real
python.com website and
they have a very good uh essentially
instructions on how to install python
and since i don't have a linux system i
cannot directly show you how to install
python on linux so yeah if you do have
linux please head over to this website
and this should be of a lot of help to
you now
as i had mentioned you can actually
install python on your mobile devices as
well so if you were say an ios user you
would go to the ios app store and
download an app called the python is the
app for ios it essentially is like a
full-fledged python environment where
you can develop in python on your iphone
or even ipad
and if you were an android user you
could you would go and download an app
called the pydroid3
there's a free version and a paid
version for this app and of course the
difference between the free and paid is
that the paid supports uh code analysis
and code prediction these are certain
details you don't have to worry about
right now and uh honestly if i wouldn't
worry too much about installing python
on your mobile devices currently since
uh i am assuming most people would be
learning programming and programming in
python on their pcs or laptops it's as
simple it was it's actually as simple as
downloading just this thing so if i did
a quick quick google of anaconda
so the website that i'm looking for is
anaconda.com and i'm looking at products
and i'm looking at individual edition
there are other editions as well like
commercial team edition these are for
companies usually or
for more professional sort of projects
so of course we are looking at the
individual edition and if you selected
this page you would be taken to
this particular webpage where it will
ask you if you want to download and
again there are options depending on
which machine you're using after you're
using a linux you would choose one of
these two if you are using mac os you
would use one of these two and since i
am a windows user and i have a 64-bit
system this is the option i would use so
again it will it will first download and
install it for you and as you can see my
installer has been uh downloaded so
now upon opening it it will open up this
installation thing
you can just click next on most of these
again if you want to specify your
destination folder you can change it
here mine will be with a default folder
in the c drive and you can leave this
unticked you can you can change these
options much later so
this is how you install anaconda on
windows and it's pretty much the same on
other systems as well now once it's done
i will show you what exactly what are
some of the things that anaconda
contains that are not there if you
uh installed python like the way i had
shown you earlier just the bare bones
python implementation so as you can see
here my installation is actually
complete
and
now i will open anaconda and i'll show
you what how you can actually use this
anaconda so if i search for anaconda in
my system i would look for something
called anaconda navigator to actually
get started with this and when i open
that it should open something like this
so this is what opens when you click on
the anaconda navigator and as you can
see
there are a bunch of applications you
don't need to worry about what these
mean
right now
uh just understand that this this is
essentially a bundle of
different applications and technologies
that come along with just the normal
installation of python that you get when
you install anaconda navigator now now
that we have actually tackled
where we've seen how to install and i'm
hoping and i would recommend definitely
that everyone is watching this video
installs anaconda not just the uh normal
python uh installation or implementation
statement saying hello world so in
python this is how you would go about or
this is the syntax you would use to
create the statement
all right
now where it is very important when you
are saving your python program that you
use the dot py prefix so if i were to
save this i can choose whatever folder i
am going to choose yeah this folder
seems fine so now i give the file name
over here as say i want to keep it as
test i need to prefix this with dot py
and this uh tells
any uh sort of interpreter or anytime we
need to read the script to know that
it's a python script we need to add a
dot py otherwise it will not be treated
as a python script will be treated as
some normal document sort of a thing so
now that i have stored it as dot py uh i
have created my first python script now
obviously the next question is i need to
see
what happens when i execute this line
when i run this script essentially so
to see that um there are multiple ways
the first way that i will show you is a
command line method which is obviously
again before we get into it it's not
something that i will be using to teach
you it's not something i would recommend
you just immediately start using um but
for the sake of uh showing i will show
you how to execute a script in command
line well to do this you go since i have
installed anaconda in my system and i
will be using anaconda to work in python
what i will look for is something called
the anaconda prompt as you can see this
is the option that i get anaconda prompt
this will essentially open you a command
line
under the environment of anaconda or
python so in this now i am already in
the folder i believe that had my script
so
how do i call this script or how do i
run the script well the command is
python space the name of my file which
was test of course the prefix is very
important so i enter test.py if you if
this was in a different folder you would
have to change your folders in command
line which is again something that i
might show you later but since my file
is already in the folder that i am in in
my command line i would just have to
enter this command right now so if i
execute this as you can see it's given
me an output of hello world which is
which is what i wanted i wanted it to
print this
these two words and of course the
command line is now waiting for the next
command for me so this is uh one of the
most simple ways of or the most
rudimentary ways of executing a python
script now another question would be
well
this isn't the most visually appealing
or
not the easy to read or easy to use way
of
executing scripts and i would agree and
that's why i'm going to introduce a
another technology or a software called
the ide so the ide in python or in any
programming language stands for
integrated development environment it's
essentially a software that not only
allows us to run scripts but it allows
us to create the scripts it allows us to
debug it allows us to see outputs it
allows us to see intermediary outputs
it allows us to do a wide variety of
tools and tasks and it comes with a
bunch of robust features to enhance our
python programming experience so let's
let's see so i will show you a an ide
called spider which comes bundled along
with the anaconda distribution that i
had mentioned earlier so if i open the
anaconda navigator
as you can see the anaconda navigator
shows me a bunch of technologies and
options and i'm looking for something
called the spider ide which is over here
as you can see here it's a scientific
python development environment
this is exactly what i'm looking for so
i am looking to launch this so now that
i've launched it you can see out here
this is what an ide looks like now this
looks very sophisticated and it's it's a
one and any almost any ide is a
wonderful
software that where you can create your
code you can debug your code you can
check the results you can make
adjustments changes and you can do a
wide variety of tasks and functions with
relation to your programming so this is
the spider id in particular and this is
how it looks don't worry about the exact
details just know that on this left-hand
pane is our current script that is open
out here and out here we will get the
results in this this is what we call a
console console essentially
so now that we have already created our
script in notepad plus plus and i want
to open that script and i want to see uh
how an i how it would the result of that
script would look in an ide so let's
just open it so we can browse for our
file and as i had named it test this is
the file over here i open this and as
you can see out here in the left hand
pane
my script has opened and the command
that had given or had written is out
over here now if i want to run this
application i press this green button
and as you can see the result of my my
execution essentially is over here it's
in slightly small font but as you can
see over here uh it says hello world and
it's very and the next line is
essentially it's it's waiting for me to
do another execution of the script and
then it will give me new results so
let's actually give the system new
results so now that i have printed
something called hello world let's let's
change what's written over here let's
say i will perform
basic maths all right and let's actually
perform the basic maths again don't
worry about the details the syntax what
i'm exactly doing these are things that
we will actually cover in the
in upcoming videos and modules so
let's create a variable called a
let's store a a number three let's
create a variable b story number five
all right let's get another variable c
uh which will store the result of what's
in a and b in the addition of a and b
all right and let's print the result or
print what's in uh this variable c or
what's the result of a plus b i will
print a statement saying the result of
the addition
of three and five is
all right and i will put my result over
here
as you can see i should get the result
in this pane so let's execute this and
you can see
my first line is executed saying i will
perform basic maths and the next line
says the result of the addition of three
and five is eight so
this in this script what i've done is
i've performed two print statements and
i've performed a basic expression some
variable assignments all of these things
we will be doing later this is what i'm
what i'm essentially trying to show you
is that ides are a very convenient way
of not only creating the scripts but
actually seeing the results and then
making adjustments as well we can com we
can create a completely new script we
don't need to create a script from some
special file or text editor i can just
create a new file here and this is my
new script essentially so i can start
working on with this new script right
over here from the get go so ides are
very powerful spider ide comes bundled
with anaconda there are other ideas such
as the i idle ide stands for
indicated development and learning
environment so the ideal
ide comes
as part of the
basic python implementation that i had
shown you in the previous video where
you if you just installed a basic
python
implementation it would come along with
a basic ide known as idle or integrated
development and learning environment
but of course since we are using python
and that's what i would recommend
it comes with a more robust ide called
spider
which is actually very very helpful for
scientific
and numeric applications
and was designed specifically with that
in mind
now
this is not the only way we can actually
work with python there's another very
interesting and uh a very educative
method of creating python let's say
python programs and it's something that
i will be using extensively throughout
this course to explain different
concepts so this technology is called or
the software is called uh notebooks
now
before i get into the details i will
state i will just open node a basic
notebook so the notebook that comes as
part of anaconda is called the jupiter
notebook and when i open or when i
launch the jupyter notebook this is what
i get now
a very important
feature or a
feature of notebooks is that notebooks a
web browser or a web-based application
so you it's not something that you can
use if you are offline or disconnected
basically if you're disconnected from
the internet it is something where which
for which you would need an active
internet connection however it is way
more robust and it has very very good uh
properties that allow it to be used in
education or for presentations and such
so as you can see this is my jupiter
notebook these are a bunch of folders
don't need to worry about what these are
right now i will show you how to create
a fresh notebook so if you go here now
you go to new and you select under
notebook the python 3 option it will
open you your first notebook as you can
see
this line is essentially waiting for me
to enter some sort of a command or a
statement that i would give in a normal
python thing now if you would have
noticed that
in
uh until now everything that we were
doing involved us uh creating a script
which was the whole series of commands
and functions so if i go back to my
spider ide as you can see like this is a
whole script and this script contains
multiple different
tasks and functions that are
individually
being performed so this is a separate
print function this is a separate
edition another separated print function
and for longer
programs or larger programs you like you
have multiple different tasks being done
and if you were using a script you can
only see the result of something like
this by executing the whole thing at
once you cannot see exactly like what is
the result of just this print statement
or just this uh it's not typically
what an ide is used for and this is
where notebooks come in super handy
if i had to break down my previous
script essentially
where i first did a print statement
where i said some random thing say hello
yeah so if i execute this particular
line you can see it gives me the result
now i want to do what is five plus three
it should give me the result over here
eight now in the next
another part of your program might be
storing five and three into variables so
i can do this and i can do this so now
this line will store the variables now i
want to do the addition of what is 5
plus 3 but i want to use the variables
and i want to see what's the result as
you can see a plus b means 5 plus 3
which is 8 and i've essentially broken
down various different parts of my
previous script into
into its individual tasks and i'm able
to see what each part of that script
does and this is very good when it comes
to making presentations or
trying to teach a class so i will
personally be using notebooks a lot to
explain different different concepts of
different concepts when it comes to
python and i would recommend that you
get used to
notebooks in general because
it's an amazing way to learn python
programming or programming in general in
fact and again as i had mentioned
earlier notebooks are something that
it's an online
application it's a web-based application
so i will have to need a active internet
connection to be able to work on a
notebook which could be a disadvantage
if you do not have a consistent internet
connection and in that case you would
probably use your ides or text editor
which you can be used offline as well
well an expression in python is anything
that results in a value its difference
although the difference between an
expression and a standard statement in
python is that a statement in python is
something that results in an action or
an execution of a command there is no
calculation per se or any sort of
manipulation or as i said earlier
calculation resulting in between two
different same numbers or other objects
that results in a value and this happens
in the case of an expression so for
example if i were to add two numbers say
five plus ten this is an expression
which should where two objects five and
ten are being added and a result has
been given to me which is 15. now let's
see an example of a statement well a
statement could be something like a
print statement so when i ask python to
print something for me
it's not calculating anything it's not
evaluating anything it's simply
performing an action that i have or a
command that i have given the system
which is to print whatever i have
entered over here as you can see so this
is a statement similarly there are
another type of statement known as
assignment statements which we will
learn actually right in the next section
well let's move on to variables right
now now earlier you might have learned
about objects in python so
objects are essentially data
that
we can work with or manipulate in python
now variables are a place to store these
different objects
usually
it's much easier to
store objects in python instead of using
the objects explicitly themselves
because objects may be very completely
complicated whereas variables are very
simple to use and very simply
very are named in a very simple manner
so that we can use them quite often in
our programs now it's important to note
that in python we do not have to
explicitly declare or define a variable
to create them in fact variables are
created in the same statement where we
assign some object to that variable in
python the assignment of variables
happens using the assignment operator
which is the equals to sign so if i were
to if i wanted to assign a number say
100 to a variable say b well it would be
as simple as doing this now anytime i
want to know what is stored in b i just
have to enter b and i will get the value
that is stored in it and we can store
different types of objects inside a any
variable let's say i store i want to
store this particular word in the form
of a string now this is stored in x and
if i want to know what is an x i can
just see what is here and it's a string
hello which i had stored earlier now
it's very important that we follow
certain naming rules when it comes to
naming our variables in python or else
we may be thrown errors or we might get
some problems in our program so the
first rule is that you cannot start your
variable name with a number so if i were
to give a variable name like four num
is equal to something say
the same string hello this would be an
illegal variable name and i will get an
error when i try this so if i were to
choose a num for
is equal to hello this would be
perfectly fine i won't get an error the
second rule is we are not allowed to use
any
non-alphanumeric characters except the
underscore character while naming our
variable so for example if i were to
name my variable num underscore 4 and i
say i said random some random string
this is perfectly fine however if i
change num underscore 4 to num hyphen 4
this will throw me an error as you can
see over here next the third rule is
that variable names are case sensitive
so if
i have a variable called num
or say num if this was one of my
variables and i stored say the value of
50. this is not the same as me writing
num all in capitals and say storing some
other value 60 these are two different
variables so it's very important that
when you name your variables you are
aware of what case you are writing them
in because python variables are case
sensitive now the final and probably one
of the most important rules in python is
that you are not allowed to use what we
call reserve words in python now python
has a bunch of reserved words these
words essentially are performed or they
are used to perform certain special
functions and are used as identifiers
for certain special functions in python
that we that have a special purpose like
that particular word has a special
purpose within the python programming
language and we cannot use them to name
our variables so a list of them either
you can see over here some of them are
like false def if
uh del reyes and there are like there
are around 33 of them and sometimes some
of these words are taken out sometimes
there are more words added as python
gets updated now let's
let's move on to a concept uh
where we try to really understand
what do we mean by storing data inside a
variable now when i say that we are
storing something inside a variable you
get an image or you get an idea in your
head that this variable is like a
container where we store or we put a
particular object inside it so does this
mean that variables have a place in the
memory are they also an object that is
placed in the memory where we can put
other objects inside of well i'll show
you an example where this idea is kind
of disproven or where i'll show you that
the idea of variable is kind of
different than what we understand by
storing something inside a variable now
let's say i'm storing the same object i
will take this object as some random
number let's say 100 and i'm going to
store it into two different variables so
i take x is equal to 100 over here
and in the next line i will store 100 in
y as well now if objects were i mean if
variables were objects that we placed in
our system then x and y should have two
different ids but let's see what happens
when i check the id of x and the id of y
they should be different in case
variables were their own objects however
as you can see the id of x and the id of
y are exactly the same so well obviously
we know that two different objects in
python cannot have the same id so
does this so what does this mean when it
comes to the nature of a variable well
the the fact is that variables are not
actually objects in python in fact
variables are more like pointers or
references to the actual object so when
i said x is equal to 100 and y is equal
to 100 what i'm actually telling the
system is that there is this variable
name called x that i want to refer or
point towards the actual object that is
in my memory called 100 and i do the
same thing with another variable y so i
am not exactly creating a different
space in my system for these variables
these variables are more like
placeholders or references that point to
a particular place in the memory where
this object is located and that is what
happens when i do id of x and id of y
it's not giving me the idea of something
called x or the id of something called y
it's giving me the id of 100 each time
because 100 is stored in x and y so as
you can see this is something like a
visual representation of what i'm trying
to say and similarly if if i were to so
in this example on the left as you can
see i've used the
value of 50 to explain my point so as
you can see initially x and y are
pointing towards this value 50 because i
have stored 50 and 50 in both x and y
now what if i changed the object that is
stored in x well that means x is now
pointing towards
this new object and i have stored this
new object called hello this string
called hello as you can see here so now
x is pointing to a new object in the
system and it's called hello and
i haven't changed anything with respect
to y so y will point towards the same
thing and i can also make the pointer of
y different or what i'm trying to say is
i can store something else in y see i
stored this list in y 50 60 and 100.
when i do that now y is pointing towards
a different object in python and x is
also pointing towards something else so
what happens to this object 50 well now
that there's no variable referring to
this object 50 it becomes what we call
an orphaned object and we can actually
see that when we do the id of x now
let's go back to my example on the right
where i stored x is equal to 100 so as
you can see it gives me some id
represented by this number now let's say
i stored x i stored something different
index say 200 now if i do the id of x it
should give me a different id because as
you can see the values are different and
this is because this object 200 is what
is stored in x and when i do the id of x
i'm actually getting the id of this new
object now 200. so as you can see point
as you can see variables are
they should be and they are traded more
like references or pointers uh instead
of containers for a particular object so
i hope in this video
you got a brief introduction into the
concepts of variables and expressions
now what are objects in python well all
the data that we manipulate or use in
our operations in our code are
represented as objects or relations
between objects so if you want an
example two numbers that you add in your
code well both of them are objects and
the usually numeric type objects
similarly if you want to store someone's
name or an address of your hometown in
your code you usually store it in a form
of text and that text is also an object
usually a string similarly you might
want to create a container of different
smaller objects inside them and that big
container is also a type of an object
and one of those containers are called
lists and similarly we have many
different types of objects which we will
be covering during the duration of this
course
the following pictorial representation
gives us a broad classification of
different python data types and objects
as we can see there are five broad
classifications numeric which contains
integers complex numbers and floats we
have the dictionary data type we have
the boolean which essentially consists
of objects that have only two valid
values true or false then we have sets
and we have sequence data types such as
strings lists and tuples every object in
python has three important properties
that kind of define that particular
object they are its identity its type
and its value the identity of an object
is it can be considered as a place in
the memory or its address in the memory
where an object is stored an object's
identity does not change once once it
has been created so for example if i
took an example of say a string called
hello i can use the id function which is
this is how you use the id function to
find out the id of this object and it
should be
the answer should be in the form of a
particular long integer so as you can
see the id of hello is this integer two
three two six four seven six six two
three zero two four similarly all
objects in python have an identity we
have another operation with uh regarding
the identity of an object is the is
operator and the is operator compares
the identity of two objects so if two
objects have the same identity it should
give the answer true otherwise false now
the next property of objects is the type
type of an object is essentially
what defines what kind of values and
operations
that that object can have so for example
a numeric dr type in python such as an
integer would allow us to do arithmetic
operations and similarly string object
type in python will allow us to do
concatenation operations much like its
identity the type of an object cannot be
changed as well now let's see what's the
type of that particular object that i
had shown you above as you can see it
should be string str stands for string
similarly if i did a type for a number
say 50 it should give me int
as you can see now the third property of
an object in python is its value now the
value is the actual data that is
contained in the object it's the thing
that we use that we display that we can
manipulate and that we can perform
operations on so for example if i were
to talk about this string the string is
hello so the value of the string is the
word or the sequence of letters that
spell out hello and similarly this
particular object is a numeric object
with the value of 50. let's see in this
in this pictorial representation i have
shown you that you can assume this dash
blue area as the memory of the system
now within this memory we have objects
created called 50 and hello and this
list containing smaller objects called
cat pen and 40. now what i'm trying to
show you here is each of these objects
have a type an id and a value and let's
see what they are if i wanted to see as
we had already seen the type of 50 now
let's find the id of 50. as you can see
we get this unique id for the object 50
which is obviously not the same as the
id of the object hello above and the
value of this object is the value of 50
itself so that was a brief introduction
into objects in python numeric object
types in python are a broad
classification of objects plenty of
common real-life applications that we
associate with numerals such as
arithmetic operations and calculus are
done in python using numeric object data
types there are three main types of
numerals or numeric data types in python
they are integers float and complex
integers as the name suggests represent
all integer values in python these can
be such as 100 minus 3 to 305 and so on
floats are used to represent numerals
that contain decimal points such as
100.3 3.9 4.8 minus 6.8 and so on then
there is the complex object type which
is used to represent complex numbers in
python and this is an example of a
complex number 3 plus 7j
this is a complex number 3 plus 7j where
the real component is 3 and the
imaginary component is 7. all complex
numbers have a real and imaginary
component and this is how we denote them
now it's important to note that this j
is a very common symbol in maths and
engineering used to denote the imaginary
portion of a complex number and it's the
same in python as well so moving on
let's talk about type conversion in
python type conversion refers to the
conversion of an object from one data
type to another for example from string
to an integer and there are different
types of conversions and let's go
through some of them first of all let's
consider the conversion of something to
an integer and more specifically let's
consider the example where we convert a
string to an integer so let's consider
my example string to be
some something called one four five and
i'm sewing this within a string for a
reason because i want to convert a
string to an integer so as you can see i
have stored this 145 within my within a
variable x and if i were to confirm that
is actually an integer i can use the
type function and see that it is
actually an integer str now let's
convert this into an integer using the
int function
so how would we use it is
simply passing the end
sim by passing the variable that we want
to convert into the in function and as
you can see this is what i've done over
here but before this i will also store
it into another variable alright now
let's see what's in y well y gives us
145 but are we sure that is an int we
can just check it by using the type
function and as you can see the type
gives us uh the answer end that means
that we've converted the string to an
end interestingly
we can convert something
and
also specify what base we have to treat
the number as by default when we pass
something in the in function the program
or python will treat whatever we have
passed
within the string as
something in base of decimal but what if
we were to pass something that is well
not in a decimal well we could do it
like this now let's store y
and ny let's store
let's do this and i will show you what
this means x
and i will give a comma and eight what
this does python is well i want to
convert the string in x
into an integer but i want to treat
whatever is an x as a number of base 8.
so
145 is actually 145
in the base 8. now when we
see what's in y
we get 101 which is different to 145
because well 1 0 1 is actually the
decimal equivalent of 145 in the base 8.
similarly if we were to give it in the
base 2 we would just replace 8 with 2
over here now next let's talk about
converting something to a float now as
we know float is just simply something
that has a decimal point so let's
convert an integer into a float how
would we do that simply by using the
float function so if i give 120 and i
pass this integer through the float
function i should get 120.0
these two are not the same though they
may mean the same things to us but in
for python 120 is an integer and one
120.0 is a different object which is a
float and this is how we convert
something to a float now what if we
wanted to convert an integer to a string
well we can use the str function
we can also use the hex and the oct
function if we want to convert a
particular number to a hexadecimal or an
octal string respectively let's look at
all three examples say i have a number
688 and i want to convert this into a
string i just use the str function
around this so as we know just to
confirm let's see what the type of 688
is this is
this should be an end as we can see but
when we pass when we let's say we
convert it into a string 688 and let's
store it into some variable let's call
it a all right now let's see what's in a
it gives a 688 in the form of a string
but we can confirm
by checking the type of a it is an str
so it is a string similarly we can use
hex
if we wanted to convert an integer into
its hexadecimal equivalent in the in in
in as an output of a string as you can
see this comp this
sort of complicated thing is actually
telling us that we have converted 688 in
terms of hexadecimals now how do we read
this output this zero
should not be treated as anything it's
more like a an identifier which says
that the letter
after this first 0 is the base of this
whole number so it's saying that x x
stands for hexadecimal so it's saying
that 2 b 0 is to be treated as a
hexadecimal number and if you did basic
maths
you would find that the decimal
equivalent of 2b0 is 688. similarly if i
did oct if i use the oct function for
688 it will give me the result something
like this so again how to read this the
first zero is to be treated as an
identifier and not part of the number
what it's saying is the letter after the
first or after this zero is the base of
the number following these two uh
following these two characters so as you
can see
as you can see what's this saying is
that this whole number is an oct
represented by this letter o
and the number itself that we are
dealing with is one two six zero and one
two six zero in octal system is the
equivalent of six eight eight in the
decimal system so this is how we've
converted a an integer in uh an integer
into a hexadecimal or a an octal string
now what if we wanted to convert two
uh numeric objects into a complex data
object well for that we can use the
complex function as you can see here
if i passed complex
5 and say
say something like 3.1
let's see what this gives us as you can
see it gives us an
a complex object where
our real part is 5 and our imaginary
part is 3.1 so what this does is
essentially
you pass two numbers the first one is
the real component and the second is the
imaginary component it combines to give
you a complex number as you can see here
now let's look at some other type
conversions the next type we will be
talking about is converting something to
a tuple or a set or a list so what if i
wanted to convert a string into a tuple
i will use the tuple function and as you
can see over here so let's say i have a
string called
random let's call it random all right
now if i want to convert this to a tuple
i will use the tuple function as you can
see over here the output will give me
tuples where each individual component
of this tuple are the individual
components or the individual characters
of my string random similarly if i
wanted to convert the string to a list i
would use the
list function and this will give me a
list of the individual characters
of the word or the the string random and
i could do the same thing with the set
function to create
a set
of
individual characters of the string
random as you can see here
so yeah these were some of the basic
python
type conversions that i have shown you
as we learn about more complex data
types and different object types in
python we will learn different
type conversions and functions
associated with them strings are an
object type in python used to store
textual data this textual data could be
something like for example someone's
name it could be an address of a place
or it could be something like a word or
a sentence
now strings in python are an object type
that is actually a subtype of a broader
classification of objects called
sequences sequences are objects in
python which contain components placed
one after the other where each component
is given what we call an index a numeric
index
this numeric index identifies the
component in the sequence and
disposition within the sequence now
since python is a zero index based
language the first object of any
sequence is always index zero the second
is index one the third is index two and
so on now let's move on to defining
strings how do we define them well
strings are defined using what we call
delimiters and delimiters occur in pairs
an opening and a closing delimiter in
python these delimiters are pairs of
single or double quotes so for example
if i were to use single quotes to define
a string i could i would do it like this
this is a string
as you can see this is a string is
printed over here this is delimited
using single quotes similarly if i were
to define a string using double quotes
it's as simple as doing this this is
also a
as you can see now a valid question
arises what if i wanted to include a
single quote within my string well
if i try to let's see what happens if i
try to print a statement with a single
quote naturally inside it so say i'm
saying it's
my
birthday
all right let's see what happens if i
try to print the statement it says
invalid syntax and this is because as i
had mentioned in python single quotes in
double quotes are delimiters so they
have a special function in python and we
cannot simply just use them within a
string because python will treat them
specially for a special purpose so what
python will do is it will pair this and
this delimiter so single quotes and say
okay this looks like a string to me and
it's not going to understand the rest of
this and then it will find a random
single quote and it won't find its pair
and it will basically throw us an error
because of this so one way or one
workaround to introduce single quotes
into a string is simply to delimit our
string itself using the other type of
delimiter or double quotes so if i want
to include a single quote i will close
my string using double quotes so if i
did this instead of what i had done
earlier
this is a perfectly valid and legal way
of defining my string and i could i
would do the opposite if i had to
introduce a double quotes within my
string i would use single quotes to
close it so if i were to write a speech
statement she said
i am
hungry all right i have i want these two
double quotes to essentially show that
this is a speech and i'm going to close
the string using single quotes and this
is a valid way of doing it as you can
see my string has these two double
quotes now i had mentioned that strings
are sequences well let's describe how
are they sequences so first of all all
sequences in python are a um it's a
essentially a sequence of smaller
objects that form the sequence right so
let's try to understand like how do how
are strings to be treated as sequences
some sequences that we will learn later
are like lists
or tuples and in all sequences
we can retrieve any particular object or
component in that sequence using its
index and how do we use indexes in
python well we enclose a numeric index
within square brackets now let's see
what i'm trying to talk about by this
example now say i'm storing a particular
string called say random within now my
variable name here is test and i'm
storing the string random within it all
right and this is a way of retrieving a
particular uh index from test i write
the variable name and then next to it i
put the square brackets now i'm supposed
to put um a numeral within these square
brackets to
tell python like what a particular index
i'm looking for so let's try zero now as
i said python is zero index based
language so
the zero index essentially means the
first part of for the first component of
a sequence so let's see what happens
when i ask python to retrieve the first
part of
what is stored in test it gives me the
string r in fact it's just one character
r and it's a string so as you can see it
has given me the first character of the
string random which is r so what this
shows is that this string random is
essentially a collection or a sequence
of one character strings so this is so
random is essentially a collection of
the string r the string a the string n
and so on together combined to form the
whole string that we call random
similarly if i wanted the character at
the third position of this thing i would
use well since the third position and
since we're working in python i would
use the index two and it should give me
the letter n as you can see it's given
me the letter n so this is how we can
show that
strings are also sequences in python
well now let's move on to
certain string operations and functions
that we can perform well as you have
seen already that we can retrieve any
particular character within a
within a string using numeric indexes
well what if we want to know what index
is a particular character at and we can
do it like this we use the index
function so let's say my test and i want
to know where or what position the
character d is in my string random so
this is how i would use the index
function index and within the index say
i'm looking for the character d and now
i it should give me the answer 0 1 2. it
should give me the answer 3. so if i
execute this it gives me the index 3. so
this is
the index function that we can use for
our strings now what if we want to
say slice a string into a into its uh
into a smaller part we want to slice it
and we want to retrieve only that
particular size well here is an example
say i'm gonna i'm gonna use the same
string called random and stored in test
right so let's
so one way of so the way of doing this
is like this
now let's see what this let's just see
what this does first as you can see it's
given me a and d and if i went to my
string random a and d is this particular
slice now let's try to understand what i
have done by entering one colon for well
what this has done is it's retrieved a
slice
from the first position
the first index which is the character a
up until the fourth position which is
the character o but it has not included
o so it's very important when i index
like this every every time i put
something to the right of this colon i
am not including this itself all right
so it's essentially one when i say
one colon four what i'm telling python
is give me the first the second and the
third character but not the fourth one
so it's given me a n and d and it's
that's this is how we do a slicing
operation in python similarly if i were
to say slice
from the first if i wanted only the
first and the second character i would
do this is what i would do
if i wanted the first and the second
character i would do one two three so
this way it tells python that i want the
first i want the second but not the
third off so as you can see i get a and
n now so this is a basic slicing what if
i wanted the portion of a string from a
particular point all the way to the
right or all the way to the left well
let's consider the example of where i
want the portion of the string random
from the say fourth character until the
left well the way i would do this is
test now since i want it all the way to
the left i don't enter any index to the
left of my colon sign and since i want
everything to the left of the fourth
character i enter four here so as you
can see it gives me a r a and d which is
everything from the fourth character of
my string random to the left similarly
if i wanted something to the right of it
i would just do it like this i would
enter some index here and i would leave
the portion to the right of the colon
blank so this will give me everything
including the third character since this
is how we treat the
indexing in python everything including
the third character all the way to the
right so this is dom as you can see now
another perfectly valid um
slicing is say i want to slice
or take out
different characters from the string but
i want to skip certain characters like i
want this one then i want to skip one
and i want to take the next one and then
i want to skip one well in that case we
have to introduce a step
so one way of doing this is now how do
we read this so as you can see i have
written 0 colon 6 colon 2. so what this
is telling python is i want every
character from my string test
starting from the zeroth character up
until the sixth but not including the
sixth after skipping or taking two at a
time taken toward a time can also be
assumed as
skipping one at each step or skipping
one character at each step so what this
will do is it will go to random it will
take the zeroth one it will take r and
then it will skip the next one so it
will not consider a and then it will
pick n and then it will not consider d
and then it will consider o up until the
sixth character whichever that may
whichever that may be and if you see the
output it gives us rno which is exactly
what we wanted we wanted r we wanted n
we wanted o where we skipped uh a and d
or we skipped the every second character
essentially so this is a way of um
slicing strings while also skipping
certain characters or skipping
characters and steps now python is also
an uh there's another interesting
technique that we can use in python to
where we can start retrieving characters
from the rightmost side of
a sequence or a string we can use
negative indexes so if i were to for
example show you let's see what this
what this gives me test what what is a
minus one index it gives me the
character m now remember our string is
random so minus one gave us the last
character of the string random which was
m so this is a way of using negative
indexes and similarly if i used test
minus 2 it would give me the second last
character which should be the character
o as you can see here now there are some
other important functions that you may
use in python so for that let's create
another let's get another string let's
call it upper
lower all right i'm sorrying it again in
the same variable test let's see what
happens when i use the upper function
and what happens when i use the lower
function
now i'm going to use the lower function
for this
these two functions will respectively
give out or give us the result or give
us our string in uppercase and lowercase
respectively so as you can see the upper
function created the first string in
full upper case and the second one
created this string in full lower case
now another important and probably one
of the most important methods that we
use for strings especially when it comes
to data science is the split function so
let's see what i mean by split function
let me create another string let's call
it hello world
all right i'm going to use a split
function and i'm going to see what
happens when i
use this function essentially so what
i'm doing in these in this these three
lines is i'm creating the string hello
world i am storing it in test and then i
am using the split function on the test
and whatever result i get i'm storing
another variable called sliced and then
i'm just going to show you what is in
sliced as you can see what's happened to
the string hello world is that i have
broken it into its components or its
component words if that makes any sense
into hello and world and i've stored
both of these into what we call a list
now you might ask well how does python
know that it has to separate at a blank
space well the split function by default
will
break up a string at its blank spaces
but if we wanted we could break it up
using or add every comma so for example
if i wrote hello world using comma and
if i put a comma inside over here and
now if i try to execute this
like for example i am going to find i'm
going to look for commas in the string
and then i'm going to try to split it as
you can see there's no splitting
happening i have one list with my
original string itself because it's not
found a comma what if i introduced a
comma over here now let's see what
happens
as you can see the splitting has
happened it's found this comma and it's
caused a split between hello and world
similarly if i in my string if i put
this comma again and i put something
else it should give me the split over
there again so we can define our split
using some whatever we put in between
these circle brackets after the split
function it's just important to note
that by default if in case we do not
enter anything over here it will use
blank spaces to do the splitting
another very important operation and
very common operation in strings is what
we call concatenation so if i have two
strings first and say another string
second
and i want to join these together well
the operator i would use to do this is
called the plus symbol this is the
concatenating operator when it comes to
strings so what is the result of this
let's see let's print this out let's
print this whole thing let's see what is
the result as you can see what this has
done is it has combined the first string
first and the string second into one
string called first second so this is
the concatenated concatenation operator
now finally uh the last topic in this
lesson is the topic of escape sequences
now escape sequences are special
commands that tell python to either
suppress special meaning of some
character or symbol in a string or give
or give the special or give some special
meaning to an otherwise ordinary
character um in a string so let's look
at the first example now remember my in
my for earlier in this video where i was
i was telling you like
what what is the way of writing or how
do we introduce single quotes or double
quotes into a string and i had told you
the trick if i want to use a single
quote in my string
i just close it using double quotes or
if i want to use a double quote i close
it using single
well another way of doing this is using
what we call an escape sequence and an
escape sequence in python is the
backslash character all right so let's
see what happens when i use the
backslash character where i want to
introduce my single quote so if i use my
previous example where i wanted to
introduce a single quote and say
i am going to close it using single
quotes
as well so i'm going to go back to my
error example so as to speak now this
would throw me an error right as you can
see it has thrown me an error so what if
i used the escape sequence that i
mentioned the escape sequence is just
backslash character now this is the
point of the string where i want my my
single quote so i introduce the
backslash now i have my single quote and
i continue writing the rest of my
statement let's close the string now
will this work as you can see this has
worked so what this has done is this
backslash character has told python um
to not read this
special character or the single quote do
not treat it specially and let it be as
a part of the string so as you can see
that's what's happened here now the next
case or the other uh use case of escape
sequences is when we want to
give a particular character that is
otherwise just ordinary some special
meaning so
let's take the example of the character
t and the character n we use the
character t to introduce tab space
and we use a character n to introduce
what we call line brick well let's see
by an example so normally the character
t has no special function so the
character t within a string will just
be outputted as the characterity itself
however as you can see here i'm going to
introduce a backslash before this
character t
let's see what it does
it introduces this thing that we called
a tab space which is the larger than
normal space similarly if i were to use
the
backslash n combination this would
introduce what we call
a line break
and if you were to see the output of
this you can see at the point of the
string where i have this combination of
backslash n a line break has occurred so
uh there are plenty of other
escape sequences that you may choose to
learn and
these are just two of the probably the
most common ones that are used so yeah
this was an introduction into strings in
python starting off with lists lists are
a collection of ordered orbit arbitrary
objects that are similar to what we call
an array in other programming languages
but lists are way more flexible when it
comes to python python lists are a type
of sequence and we might have you might
have seen what a sequence is when we
were learning about strings and much
like in sequences or any other sequence
list objects are assigned a numerical
index and whenever you want to uh
manipulate an object in a list we use
its respective index how do we define
lists
lists are defined using square brackets
so this is a simple way
or a simple list that i have just
created and assigned to a variable a
let's talk about some of the features of
python lists python lists are ordered
and what this means is that even if two
lists contain the exact same elements if
they if the elements are placed in a
different order the two lists are
actually unique and different and i can
check that over here i have created a
list one two and three and see if i
create another list two
and one and three the same elements were
in different order i will use the is
function to check whether these two
lists are the same and if they are the
same when i use is function it should
give me the value or the answer true and
if they are not the same it should give
me the value false and as you can see i
get the value false because even though
i have two lists with the same elements
they are in different orders and so they
are different and that's what we mean by
lists are ordered the next property for
lists are that they can be manipulated
using their indexes or the elements and
the objects inside a list can be
manipulated using the indexes and we
will see that in the section where i
show you list operations the next
property is lists are mutable what this
means is that once we create a list
object we can actually make changes and
modify them without having to create a
new list object the next property is
that lists are dynamic and what this
means is that as we are making or as we
are programming we can actually make
changes to an already created list as we
are
programming without having to go through
a compilation stage so if we had to say
increase the or we had to add certain
elements to an already created list that
original list grows in size to
accommodate for these new elements the
next property is that lists can
contain any arbitrary objects so if i
created a list right now where
say if i want to store some numbers
say some floating point numbers now
and i can put strings
as well into my list all of these are
valid
when it comes to objects that can be put
inside a list we have no such
restrictions so we can put any arbitrary
objects inside our list the final
property that i want to talk about is
that lists are
they can be nested to any arbitrary
depth what this means is that i can put
a list within a list and i can keep
nesting it essentially by putting
as many lists i want within my list and
i'm only essentially restricted by my
system's memory so if i created a list
like this
within this say i put another list and
within this list i put another list i
can keep going on to by keep going on
doing this and i'm only restricted by
the memory of my system that i'm using
so moving on let's move on and talk
about some important list operations
that we will be doing when it comes to
lists so let's create a basic list
called a where i'm storing six numbers
so
now say if i wanted to retrieve a
particular element say if i wanted to
find out what's on the index three this
is how i would do it if i wanted a slice
of my original list and much like
strings i do it the same way so what
this does is it tells python that i want
all the elements of list a from index 1
to index 4 but not including index 4. so
it will give me 1 2 and 3 index
objects so it should give me two three
and four in this case as you can see
here two three and four i can do the
same thing by considering elements
say two at a time if i wanted to
consider elements or consider every
second element what i would do is this
syntax i would use this syntax and when
i give this command to python what it
tells what it understands is i want
every element from a
from index 1 2 and x4 but not including
index 4 but i am going to consider two
every second uh uh element essentially
so what it will do is it will go here
and then it will skip one and then go
here and then skip one and that's
essentially what we uh what it's
essentially what we call start
slicing by using strides so i'm taking
strides i'm not considering elements
consecutively but i'm skipping certain
elements in between if i wanted to
consider every third element i would
change this to three and fourth element
i would change this to four all right so
let's see what happens when i take every
second element it should it should give
me uh it will consider say from one to
index three right so it should consider
essentially
this section but since it's going to
skip one it's going to consider this
skip this and then consider this it
should give me 2 and 4 as you can see it
has given me 2 and 4. and like in other
sequences we can use negative indexes as
well negative indexing essentially
starts
looking from the right hand side of the
list so when i say a minus one it's
essentially looking at the last element
of the list so it gives me the sixth or
the last element which is the which is
object six if i did a minus two it gives
me the second last element similarly
another neat trick that we can use for
sequences is the following syntax double
colon and we give a minus one what this
tells the
what this tells the system is i want the
list a but with all the elements
reversed so as you can see i get my
element uh my list a but the elements
have been reversed right now let's move
on to
concatenation and replication well
concatenation much like in strings is
done by using the plus sign so as we
know on either side of the plus sign
should be two similar objects so if i'm
doing a plus something a being a list on
the other side it should be a list as
well so let's add a list like this
now let's see what's in a
as you can see my original list has a
789 added to it and i can also add
things to the beginning of a list
similarly so if i wanted to add say
zero
you know at the beginning of a list i
just do it like this
and i get the element zero added to it
it's very important to note that i
i i actually added zero within a list
because if i did 0 like this
it would throw me an error because like
this 0 is just an int object and it's
not a list but when i put the square
brackets i make it a list and then this
concatenation becomes valid because a is
also a list similarly if i did a star 2
this is essentially replication or a
replication function where i'm repeating
the values in a twice if i did a star 3
it's the same function
but now i'll have the elements repeated
thrice as you can see here let's move on
to modifying list values
this also shows the mutable property of
lists that i had mentioned earlier so
let's consider this example so i created
a list with elements where there's three
strings eggs apples and carrots and i
have
five int objects one two three four and
five
now if i wanted to change say the first
element all i have to do is take the
zero width index
and say if i want to replace eggs with
say mango this is how i would do it
now i've replaced eggs with mango if i
check what's in b
you can see the eggs have been replaced
with the element mango similarly i can
use the slice syntax to replace
a particular slice from my list with a
slice essentially so
let's look at this
i'm replacing i want to replace the
first three elements i want to replace
mango i want to replace apple and carrot
so what i will do is i will consider
this since this carrot is the second
index so i will consider 0 to 3 because
the third is not counted now i'm going
to replace this with three different um
let's see tv
and say sponge now let's check what's in
b you can see my three elements have
been replaced in fact i don't have to
replace like for like if i want to
replace say three elements with only one
or two elements that is also possible so
now if i want to replace the first three
elements kiwi orange and sponge
with
um just one element this is how i'll do
it let's say
wine
now let's check what's here as you can
see three elements have been replaced
with one mine i can do it vice versa as
well i can replace smaller number of
elements with a larger number of
elements but here there is a slight
caveat that i want to show you so an
obvious way of doing this would be say
if i wanted to replace the first element
wind with three different elements an
obvious way would be just consider that
elements index
and then put whatever objects you want
say i want to add instead of wine i want
to add beer i want to add
ball
and
say
club yeah well let's see what happens
now if i say b
check what's inside my now you can see
my elements have been added but they
seem to have been added as is you know
i had entered a list over here and that
whole list has been replaced uh or this
vine has been replaced by this whole
list in the first position but that's
not exactly what i wanted i wanted the
elements within this list to be
individually placed into my list and the
way to do that is not this syntax but
actually what i'm going to show you now
if i want to replace one if i want to
replace the index of the object at index
0 i would give this statement a slice
statement where i will give 0 colon 1 so
when i do this and if i um so let's
create my old scenario again where i had
wine
and i had one two three four and five
now if i do this b
zero but i give a slice then this slice
is essentially a single object slice
it's essentially the zeroth index again
but because of this uh formatting or
this this type of syntax that i'm using
what python will do is now when i say
peer
and
ball
and club now what python will do is it
will not consider this whole list and
add it to in place of
wine or whatever i want to replace it
will actually consider the elements
inside of this individually and then
replace so if you see here
now if you see my list i actually have
the
i've removed wine and in place of it i
put beer ball in club but these three
are actually individual objects within
my list and not objects within a list
that is then placed within my original
list so this is an important caveat that
you should take note of so moving on
let's talk about certain methods
associated to lists let's take a simple
list now one two and three the first
operation that i want to show you or the
first method is the append method so
when i do a append and say if i want to
append the list by one object called
four
i just do it like this now let's see
what's in a i put so as you can see the
append has put the object 4 into my
original list now say if i wanted to
append
three different objects i want to append
5 6 and 7 now let's see what append
function does
oh no as you can see it's done a similar
operation to what we have seen earlier
when we gave a single index or the
single element replacement
that we saw earlier it essentially put
this whole list into this particular
spot into the list and this is not what
i wanted i wanted 5 6 and 7 to be
individually placed and we do have a way
of doing that and the way to do that is
the extend function that is what i'll
show you next now if i want to extend
say the original list by three different
elements eight nine ten when i use the
extend function it will not put this
whole thing it will consider each object
inside this thing individually and then
add it to a so if you see my result this
is exactly what i wanted now the next
method that i want to discuss is the
remove method
so the remove method is what you how you
use it is within the parenthesis you put
the
object that is present in the list that
you want removed so you don't give an
index over here you give the object
itself so if i want the object 8 all
right
this number if i want 8 itself removed
what i will do is put the value 8 here
and it will remove it from my list so if
i check my list a as you can see the
value 8 has
it's gone a next another similar
function to remove is the pop function
now the pop function by default will
remove the right most value from the
list but unlike remove the pop function
actually outputs a value
and that value is what we have popped
out of the list so by default it will
pop out the right route right most value
of a list or rightmost element of a list
and in this case that element is 10 so
it should give me 10. but of course if
we want to pop out any particular object
in this case we do not give that
particular object we give its index so
now say if i want to remove this uh this
list object from my bigger list
as i can see it's in index 0 1 2 3 4
it's the fourth index so if i want to
remove the list which is at the fourth
index i give the index value inside the
parenthesis and it pops that out for me
as you can see over here so this was it
for lists let's move on to tuples next
so tuples are another ordered collection
of objects much like lists but they
differ from lists in two key properties
first of all the tuples are defined
using parenthesis instead of square
brackets so this is how i would define a
tuple with elements one two and three
and the next very important property
that is different or that differentiates
tuples from lists is that tuples are
immutable and what this means is that
once we create an object of type tuple
we cannot make any modifications to it
we would have to only create a new
object if we wanted something different
and this is obviously a key difference
between a tuple and a list but apart
from this
every operation that we have done on
lists are actually
possible to do in the case of tuples as
well so any operation that we did to
lists that did not modify the list or
that does not do any modification we can
actually apply to tuples as well so if i
wanted the first element of this duple
all i have to do is call it by the index
0 it should give me the value 1 as you
can see if i wanted a slice
i can do that as well it should give me
2 and 3. and if i wanted to reverse my
tuple well i can use my same neat
technique that i've used for lists and
that i can use for the sequence i mean
strings as well so it gives me my old
tuple but with the elements reversed so
now the natural question is why do we
use tuples over list well one important
difference is that when we con when we
make a program execution where or where
we are manipulating a tuple if we do the
same thing for the exact same objects in
uh that if it were present in a list it
would be much faster than a tuple
essentially program execution is just
faster on tuples when compared to an
identical list so you use tuples over
lists when we want to be efficient while
we are creating an ordered list of
objects so whenever we create an ordered
list of objects that we don't need to or
we don't want to make any further
modifications to we don't need to create
a list we can create a tuple and another
very important area where we use tuples
over list or why we need a tuple instead
of a list is
when we are using dictionaries
dictionaries as we will see later is a
data type in python that needs an
immutable component
while we are creating the dictionary so
if we
want to use
something that is like a list but since
lists are mutable we can use a tuple
instead and use that when we are
creating our dictionary and we will see
like what uh what i mean by
the immutable component for a dictionary
when we actually uh learn about
dictionaries but yeah these are some of
the places where we would use a tuple
over a list uh a brief section on tuple
unpacking and packing is what i would be
doing right now and what that means is
that when i create when i give this sort
of a statement
you can assume this to be
me packing this tuple into a object or a
variable t now what's very interesting
is and this is something that's very key
to tuples is that i can unpack a tuple
onto another tuple so let me show you
what i mean by that so now that i have
packed one two three and four tuple into
t let's unpack it into another tuple
let's call this let's
put these elements into this tuple and i
put this into t all right now let's see
what i mean by unpacking something onto
something let's see what's uh what what
what happens when i put a if i just want
to see what's in a it actually gives me
the value 1 if i see what's in b it
gives me the value 2. if i see what's in
3 giving value 3 and d gives me value 4.
so essentially if you think of it what i
have done is i have matched this tuple
then put it into t and then put that
tuple t into this tuple a b and c d so
what it's what what has happened
essentially is the element a has been
or a better way to say this would be the
element 1 has been packed onto or
unpacked onto a 2 has been unpacked onto
b 3 has been unpacked onto c 4 has been
unpacked onto d to show you what i have
done in a single line is essentially
this
this is essentially what i've done
i have assigned 1 to a 2 to b
3 to c 4 to d i have matched these two
tuples together like this and this is a
very neat feature of tuples the only
only important thing that you have to
keep in mind is the elements of this
tuple and the elements on this tuple uh
should be equal so if there are four
elements here there should be four
elements here all right i
in fact another very important thing
about or a neat feature is that we don't
really need to mention the parenthesis
when we're doing this
unpacking or packing so if i did x
comma y comma z if i did it like this if
i put say 5 and 6 and seven this is also
a valid way of packing and unpacking so
now if i see what's the value in x it is
actually five if i see what's the value
in y it is six if i see what is the
value of x and z it should give me a
tuple containing five and seven as you
can see over here so this is a neat
feature of tuples called packing and
unpacking so yeah
this is it for lists and tuples and i
hope you understood some of the concepts
around english and tuples dictionaries
are another type of composite data type
in python there are also a collection of
objects much like tuples and lists and
like lists they are also mutable dynamic
and can be nested however a key
difference and property of dictionaries
is that they are unordered items in
dictionaries are paired using keys
unlike in lists and tuples where the
objects are assigned numerical indexes
to define a dictionary we use curly
braces each key value pair in this
dictionary in a dictionary is separated
using commas and the key and values
themselves in a pair are separated using
a colon let's look at an example this is
a dictionary where i have three key
value pairs as you can see they have
been separated by colons and each of the
pair themselves are separated by commas
and these are enclosed in curly braces
to define the whole dictionary in this
example
these are the keys banana apple and
grape and their respective values are
yellow red and green so this is very
important that in this particular data
type we have what we call a key and that
key is assigned a value and we can have
multiple such pairings and we have three
such pairs in this particular example
another example or the or another type
of way to define a dictionary is using
the dict function this is how we use it
as you can see i have inputted two value
or two object tuples this is a tuple
this is a tuple and this is a tuple and
when i use it in a dig function
when i place it within a list what
python will do is it will consider the
first element of each tuple as a key
and the second element of each tuple as
its respective value
now if i check what's in d as you can
see the key banana has a value yellow
the key apple has a value red the key
grape has a value green this is another
way of defining dictionaries an
important
note over here is that the
the objects that we use for keys have to
be of an immutable data type so we
cannot use for example lists uh as an
example of keys but we can use say
integers or strings for our dictionary
keys also keys have to be unique when it
comes to a dictionary you cannot have
two different keys with uh
or should i say the same key having two
different values you can have only one
key and that one key will have a unique
value assigned to it duplicate keys are
not allowed however when we speak about
values we have no such restrictions you
can have a mutable or an immutable data
type as a value in a dictionary and you
can have duplicates as well so if i
created a dictionary with a key say
banana
and if i gave if i associated with it
a value green i cannot create
another key banana and associate
a value yellow let's see what happens
when i actually do this if you actually
see
what has happened here is
python has considered the second case so
it's it first looks at the first pair it
goes okay so my dictionary has a key
banana with a value green but right
after it sees another key banana with
the value yellow so it overwrites my
first key banana with the second key and
it overwrites the first value green with
the second value and we essentially get
one key banana with the second value
yellow so obviously this is a python
does this to avoid duplicates however if
i
created a dictionary with a key banana
again if i created i gave it a value
yellow or say green
if i created another
key and if i gave this also a value
green this is perfectly fine and this
will not
nothing special will happen in this case
because values do not have to follow
such rules let's speak or let's see
certain dictionary operation operations
and functions now so let's uh bring back
our original dictionary which we had
created earlier with the three pairs all
right so what if i wanted to
we can use keys to
essentially do these operations and
functions let's see what happens when we
so much like how we use sequence how we
use indexes in example of sequences we
use keys when it comes to dictionary so
let's see what happens when we use a key
over here
so we as we know banana is a key in this
dictionary let's see what happens when
we do where we give this command it
actually gives the value associated with
that key which is yellow what if we
wanted to change a particular value
associated to a particular key i would
give i would do this i would give the
key and assign it
the value that i want to change it with
all right now if i check my dictionary
you can see the key banana no more has
yellow value but the value gold what if
i wanted to add a new pair you know a
new key with a new value completely i
would do it pretty much the same same
way as i did in the previous step i
would
essentially write my new key whatever i
wanted say if i wanted a new key called
watermelon i would assign it a value
red
and now if i check my dictionary at the
end of the dictionary you will see that
my
new key pair key value pair has been
added watermelon red as you can see over
here now what if i wanted to remove if i
wanted to remove a key value pair from
my dictionary i can use the delete
function which is
called by using this the del function
now how do i do it say if i want to
remove the key value apple in red so all
i have to do is do d e l
d and within square brackets i have to
only mention the key i don't even need
to mention the value just the key so
you can probably draw parallels in how
we use indexes when it comes to lists
and tuples and even strings and how we
use keys when it comes to dictionaries
they are quite similar so if i did this
and if i um oops i think red is actually
not a key as you can see red is a value
my
key is apple actually it's not red it's
apple as you can see now if i see my
dictionary the key apple and its value
red has been removed so these are some
of the operations that we can do
for dictionaries using keys what if we
wanted to use certain inbuilt functions
that are associated with dictionaries
well some of the examples are as follows
there is a get function when we use the
get function all we have to do is
enter a key inside the parenthesis and
it will get the value associated with
that key so
if i gave the key great let's see what
value is associated with it as you can
see it's green
there is also a function called items
that returns the key and value pairs in
our dictionary as a list of two object
tuples where the first object is
the
key and the second object is a tuple so
let's see what it does as you can see it
gave me a
list and in this list the
objects inside the list are two object
tuples where the first object is always
the key and the second is the value and
it's the same for each of the tuples so
this is what items function does let's
see what uh the next so the next
function is keys let's see what the keys
function does as you can see it returns
a list of all the unique keys within our
list i mean within our dictionary
similarly we can there is a function for
values as well and as you can see it
returns all of the different values that
are present in our dictionary in the
form of a list also it's important to
note that if we have a particular value
that has occurred multiple times in a
dictionary it will appear as many times
it has occurred in the dictionary or
appeared in the dictionary in our list
over here when we use the value function
so if say
a particular value say i had another key
where its value was green again so i
would have the value green appear in
this list once more essentially our next
function is pop item what this does is
much like the
pop function in list
it gives us the last entered
key value pair that is present in our
dictionary so the last centered pair was
watermelon
key watermelon with the value red and
that's what has popped out when we give
this function another important function
associated with dictionaries is the
update function and the update function
is a very neat function that is used to
merge two dictionaries together so say
if i had a dictionary let's say i'm
creating a dictionary using the dict
function where
i have say
some key called key v so as i had
mentioned i will use two object tuples
in this case
and
let's say i give this also a value green
all right and another
pair would be
say mango and
let's give it a value yellow
all right so this is another dictionary
that we have created as you can see over
here we have created a dictionary with
the key called kiwi with value green and
another key mango with the value yellow
and i already have a dictionary d with
these values all right
now if i want to merge these two
dictionaries i can use the update
function what i do is say if i want to
merge d with x or x with d
only the ordering will change and that
doesn't really matter when it comes to
dictionaries so if i want to merge d
with x i use d update and then inside it
i put my target dictionary now when i
check what's in d i have
the
the the dictionary x and its key value
pairs
merged inside my original dictionary d
as you can see i have my original ones
here and i have the merged ones over
here so this was the update function so
yeah this was it for dictionaries i hope
you learned some of the important
concepts surrounding dictionaries so the
first type is the nun type
it's accessed through the built-in name
none its truth value is false it's
essentially used to denote
functions or it's you it's returned as
the value for functions that don't
really return anything so if you have an
expression or a function that returns no
particular value you actually get a data
type called none that is how python
interprets it
then there is the ellipsis ellipsis is
something that you might encounter later
it is accessed through the built-in name
ellipsis um it is used to indicate the
presence of this particular
syntax this particular symbol or
expression
or syntax in a slice its truth value is
true again don't worry too much about
ellipses right now next is numbers and
numbers is something that we are very
familiar with we have seen we work with
numbers a lot they are an immutable type
they are created through numeric
literals and they are the outputs of
arithmetic expressions and built-in
arithmetic functions its subtypes are
integers floating point numbers and
complex numbers
within integers you have plane integers
that represent numbers in the range uh
this number and this number so these
this number is basically the largest
positive value that you can represent
using 32 bit notation in two's
complement and this is the equivalent
for the the negative the negative side
long integers on the other hand are used
to represent numbers in an unlimited
range that is only subject to the
available memory of your system so these
are two types of integers and as we know
floating point numbers represent machine
level double precision floating point
numbers or numbers with a decimal point
and a component after that complex
numbers are numbers that contain a
floating point number that represents a
real part and a floating point number
that represents a an imaginary part so
these are the types of numbers then we
have sequences sequences are finite
ordered sets indexed
by natural numbers so each element in a
sequence has an index and that index is
a natural number the different types of
sequences are based on the mutability
whether the objects can be changed or
not is essentially what we mean by
mutability right once we create an
object whether we can modify it or not
and that is how we differentiate
different types of sequences so there
are
mutable and there are immutable types
now the different types of immutable
ones are strings we know what strings
are they are sequences that contain
characters unicode is the other
immutable sequence and then there are
tuples tuples are a collection of
arbitrary python objects and unicodes
are sequences that contain unicode
characters then we have mutable
sequences and
there is only one currently there is
only one built in
mutable sequence in python and that is
lists
lists are also again collection of
arbitrary python objects
finally we have well not finally but
next we have mappings and mappings are
again
sets of
objects but these objects are now
indexed using arbitrary
index sets you know the difference
between a mapping and a sequence you
could consider
sequences are ordered but mappings are
not ordered and the indexes given to the
objects and sequences are always numbers
they are natural numbers whereas in
mappings they are not natural numbers
but they are
certain arbitrary objects that we can
set for ourselves again in python there
is only one built in standard
mapping type that is the dictionary
dictionaries are
there they represent finite sets of
objects indexed by nearly arbitrary
values the only condition is that these
indexes must be of an immutable data
type so
these uh so what i have mentioned until
now are probably the most common data
types that we encounter uh or that we
have encountered now so next types are
like callable types such as user-defined
functions user-defined methods built-in
functions built-in methods classes and
class instances so again callable types
as a whole are referenced using the call
function and this is something that we
will learn when we start learning about
functions when we learn about object
oriented programming
and methods and functions and such the
other type are modules so modules are
module objects or modules essentially
are referenced or called using the
import function again modules can be
considered as these large libraries or
larger pieces of code or applications
that we
that contain various different methods
and functions and objects and classes
within them um again modules are
something that we will think about a
little later files are data types that
are called using the open function so
anytime we and as we will during the
course of this uh tutorial we
are during the course of this uh
this course essentially we will be
working with a lot of files these some
of these files are text files some of
them are comma separated files so all of
these files that we open using
the function open or some other certain
specific functions
where we create file objects out of
these files these are what we call file
data types
finally there are internal types that
are used by python interpreter again
this is something that
does not concern us right now but just
know that
the interpreter for python uses these
data types for its functioning so this
was again this was a very brief
introduction or explanation into python
type hierarchy and as you can see in
this table there are different types
such as addition subtraction
multiplication so let's go over them one
by one so a simple addition operation
would be like 5 plus 6
giving me the value 11 i can do 5 minus
3 and that's subtraction similarly i can
do a multiplication using 5 say 5 into
2. there's division where i use the
backslash so say i did division of eight
divided by two now you might encounter
another type of division which is called
the floor division where we use a double
backslash and what this does is it
returns us the largest whole number that
is lesser than the result of our
division uh so the division difference
between the float division and and the
normal floored and uh the floor division
or the single and the double backslash
is this say i did 9 divided by 2 using a
single backslash it should give me as
you can see 4.5 right so this is the
actual value now let's see what happens
when i do 9 double backslash 2. it will
give me 4 which is the largest number
lesser than or equal to 4.5 that is also
a whole number so this is what we call
flow division essentially finally we
also have
if we want to raise something to the
power of something so if i want to do 5
say 6 raised to the power 3 so i would
use double asterisks and this is how i
would do it give me 216 as you can see
if i wanted remainder between the
division between two different numbers i
will use the percentage sign so if i
wanted the remainder of the division
between 7 and 3 this is how i would do
it i get the answer one as you can see
so next category of operations are
logical operations the first one is the
logical and operation where we use the
operator end all right so let's see
what we mean by this i am creating so as
we know the and operation returns the
value true if both the operands are true
so
that's actually let's actually do this
for an example let's give this variable
the value true and this the value false
actually should be done like this
false so now uh think of it like one and
zero so one and zero is obviously 0
right so if i did a
and
b i should get the answer false or 0
because i'm doing true and false so it's
like doing 1 and 0. so if you see this i
should get the answer false if i change
this to true as well now if i do this i
will get the answer true as you can see
uh
the next logical operation is the or
operation where
well logical or is if either of the
operands are true then we should get the
answer to our order operation as true as
well so in this case obviously if i did
or over here it will naturally give us
true if i change this to false
it should again give us true and it will
only give us false if both are false as
you can see here now it's false the next
operation is the logical not uh it's
done by using the not operator so in
this case the
value that we get
is true if the operand is false so let's
take a as we know a is false over here
so if i did not a i should get the
answer true but if i change this to true
now if i do not a i should get false as
you can see so this was the
logical operations let's move on to the
next set of operations that is
comparison operations so there are a
bunch of them let's go over them one by
one if i want to check if two operands
are equal so if i did x is say equal to
2 and now y is equal to 3. if i want to
check if they are equal i will use the
double equals to sign and if um they are
equal i will get the value true if they
aren't it will get value false as you
can see since x is 2 and y is 3 as you
can see x and y are not the same so
there's false they are not equal if i
change this also to 2 now i will get the
answer too another the next comparison
is the x not equal to or where we use
the exclamation sign so over here this
is this um the result of this is true if
x and y are not actually it's the same
so i should get false over here as you
can see but if i change this to say 5
now i will get true because x is not
equal to y in this case the next one is
greater than so if i did x greater than
y as we can see 2 is not greater than 5
i will get false over here similarly
there is a lesser than if i did x lesser
than y i should get true over here as
you can see well there's also a
greater than or equal to and less than
or equal to we simply add the equal to
sign here so let's see now if i say x is
lesser than or equal to 3 i should get
true because x is 2
and if i put 2 here i should also get 2
but what if i put 1 here since x is
equal to 2 and 2 is not less than equal
to 1 this is a false statement and i can
do the same thing with like this using
the greater than equal to now it's true
because 2 is actually greater than equal
to 1 and so this was comparison
operations the next set of operations
that we can do in python are assignment
operations if you've already seen a
whole bunch we've already been assigning
values to variables we've been doing
assignments throughout already but let's
go over them and see some of the
assignment operations so as we already
know the equal to operation is assigning
everything that is on the or the value
on the right hand side of the equal to
sign to what is on the left so if i did
a is equal to 5 plus 6 it will assign
the value 5 plus 6 or 11 to a let's
check what's in a as you can see it is
11. there is a plus equal to sign and
what this does is so for example if i
did
say a now since a is 11 let's create
another variable called b and call this
five all right so now if i did a plus
equal to b what this will do is it will
add b to a and then store it in a so
let's see what this does once i do this
now let's check what's in a it should be
5 11 as you can see 16. so this a plus
this is this plus equal to sign is
essentially the same as doing a is equal
to a plus b it's essentially the same
thing they're both the same uh there's a
similar thing for this the negative
symbol or subtraction as well minus
equal to so now that a is 16 and b is
still 5 of course if i did minus equal
to b now i'm subtracting the value of 5
from 16 so i should get a is equal to 11
again as you can see here and this is
the equivalent of doing a minus b a is
equal to a minus b i mean as you can see
so
uh the next similar like assignment
operation let's create a is equal to say
6 in this case and say b is equal to i
will say 2 all right now if i do a star
star equal to b what this does is it
multiplies b to a and then assigns it
back to a so if i see what's in a now it
should be 12 as you can see here
similarly there is similar thing for
subtraction as well so if i did a is
equal to 6 and b is equal to 2 and if i
did a sorry for division so if i did a
division symbol and
equal to sign and then if i give b what
it will do is it will divide a by b or 6
by 2 and it will assign that back to a
so my value on a should be 3 as you can
see here 3.0 obviously this is a single
single backslash so this is a float
division the resultant of a single
backslash is always a float i can do the
same thing with a double backslash so
let's see if i did a is equal to seven
now and then b is equal to three now if
i did a double backslash equal to b now
it will do the same division but uh it
will do a floor function so it should
give me 2 in this case if i did the same
thing
with a single backslash just to show you
the difference between single backslash
and double backslash division in this
case it will give me
the value around 2.3 or something a
float basically 2.33 as you can see here
then there is the modulus you can use
the modulus sign as well with this
assignment um say a is equal to say 5
now b is equal to 2 now if i do a
percentage symbol equal to 2 i mean b it
should give me it will assign the uh it
will take the modulus in both sides and
then assign it to the left and operand
now let's see what's in a as you can see
it it did a divided by two the modulus
symbol is basically the remainder of the
division between two objects so in this
case it will divide a by b and then give
me the remainder and then put that
remainder back in a and as you can see
the remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1 and
we get that over here similarly we can
also do exponential so if i have a is
equal to say
5 b is equal to 2 and i want to raise a
by if i wanted to raise the value of a
by the value of b and then store that
back in a this is how i would do it so
it should be 5 to the power 2 which is
25 as you can see here so this is
assignment operations so finally we move
on to
uh two special sets of operators one is
the identity set identity operators and
the other is the membership operators
let's look at the identity operators so
when we talk about identity operators
what we when what we mean is the is and
the is not operator so what the is
operator does is it checks whether two
operands uh have the same location in
the memory essentially this does not
mean that it does not check for whether
two objects have the same value and this
is very important so let's look at this
if a is equal to 1001
and b is equal to 1000 plus one all
right if i did a is equal to this is an
equality check are they the same values
true now if i say a is b let's see what
happens as you can see it's false this
is because this object and this object
are not the same and this is what the is
operation does we can confirm this by
checking the id of a the id of a gives
us some value like this and the id of b
gives us as you can see a different
value so the two objects are not located
in the same place in the memory as we
have seen using the id function and that
is what we check uh through the is
operator and the is not is essentially
just the opposite of that so
so that is the identity operator
now the membership operator is used for
checking whether something is present in
a sequence or not so let's create a
sequence i will create a list to show in
this example my list is one two and
three basically simple list with three
integer objects one two and three i will
check whether now say 2 in a so is 2 in
a if it is it will give me true as you
can see is 5 in a it should give me
false because 5 is not an a and the a
not in operator is just the opposite of
that it checks the other condition
essentially so this is the membership
operators in python so this was it for
operations in python so of course
there's confusion when we don't know
which operator has presidents over the
other and in python there is a strict
precedence that is followed in such
scenarios so this table gives us the
precedence so as we can see the
the operators at the top are at the
lowest precedence and as we go down we
get operators with higher precedence
over the ones above them so the low of
the operators that we have seen the or
operator the and and the not have the
lowest precedence so or and not and then
we have comparisons and identity
operators such as the equal to equal to
sign the the exclamation equal to sign
so these operators come at the next
level then you have addition and
subtraction followed by multiplication
division modulus and flow division and
finally the highest precedence of all
the operators that we have seen till now
is the exponentiation or the double
asterisks so let's see a couple of
examples
that explain this point a little more so
as we can see in this line we have 20
plus then there's a 5 an asterisk 3
minus 25 and we want to know like okay
what is the precedence in this case so
as we know we have the plus sign we have
a minus sign and we have the asterisk
sign so we have addition subtraction and
multiplication so which one will take
precedence over the other well let's
refer to this table as you can see the
addition and subtraction have lesser
precedence over multiplication so this
multiplication will happen first so we
actually do 5 into 3 first we get 15.
after that we do plus and minus so we
get 5 into 3 15 then we add it or we can
subtract over 25 that does not matter so
we do 5 into 3 15 and then we do 20 plus
15 which is 35 minus 25 so
we should get an answer 10 as you can
see we do get the answer 10. another
example would be
where we have this plus symbol we have a
double asterisk talking which shows
exponentiation and a subtraction and a
division so again as we know
exponentiation has the highest
precedence so in this whole operation or
this whole expression we first do uh the
operation associated with the
exponential so we do 5 to the power 2 or
5 exponent did exponentiated by the
power 2. so we have 5 to the power 2
which is 25 now we look at okay once we
have that we still have a addition and
we still have a subtraction and we still
have a division symbol and as we know
division takes precedence over addition
and subtraction over here so once we do
this we finally move on to this step
where we do the division of 6 divided by
2 where we get 3 so we have 25 from this
5 to the power 2 which is 25 and we have
3 over here so now we do 20 plus 25
which is 45 minus 3 which is 42 and as
you can see that is the answer over here
let's look at
the precedences when it comes to certain
of the certain
comparisons or
the logical operations or the comparison
operations so as to speak so i've
created a variable called season with
the string summer i have created the
variable age with the value uh with the
string 10 so you don't need to put it in
the string so i have the into object 10.
and i have the color uh a variable
called color with the string pink now
i'm going to see in this line
i'm going to do an if and else statement
so if you don't know what an fns
statement is just follow along with me
so what this does is if this condition
is met i will print this statement
otherwise else i will print this
statement now what is this first
condition it is saying
season equal to equal to summer whether
this variable is equal to the string
value or as we know about the or
operation age is equal to this and color
is equal to equal to pink so as we can
see in our
comparisons
and our logical operations the
precedence for or and and not is or is
the lowest precedence uh and is above
that and then not is above that in this
we have the or and we have the and so of
course the first check is the and
function so it's going to check whether
this whole condition and this condition
are it's going to come it's going to do
that operation so it's going to do this
and this
so is color pink color is indeed pink
okay so this this part is true now let's
see if this part is true as well now
once we're going to check whether this
is true or not what we need to see is
this condition itself has an or
statement so the first part of it is
saying is season summer season is indeed
summer as you can see here next part is
saying is age greater than 0 but this
does not matter since the or function
just needs one of the operands to be
true and in this case this is true in
this case it is also true so this is
this whole statement is true as well so
once we have this statement as true and
then this statement is true
we can we finally move on to we come
back to this and statement and we say
since both the operations all both the
operands i mean are true the resultant
of this and should also be true and
since this is true this whole condition
we actually move into this section of
our ins if else condition where we say
okay we can uh do this statement this
print statement and we do not have to
print this particular thing so
our answer should be our result should
be the
printing of the string this string okay
and as you can see the ok string is
actually what is printed over here so
this is
an example on operator precedence of
course it's it always helps to
you know try to fiddle around on your
own uh
create random expressions out of like
out of the top of your head and see how
exactly python is evaluating that and
try to understand break it break it down
on your own and this is probably the
best practice you can do to understand
operator precedence so starting off what
is this math module well the python map
module is an important library or a
feature that is uh designed to deal with
mathematical operations this math module
is part of the
basic python installation so you don't
have to install this separately
to use this math module all you have to
do is import this module and this is how
you would do it you just do import
math and this will import your math
module for you to use in your
programming and in this in the course of
this video i will be showing you certain
concepts surrounding the math module
such as what are the constants that come
with the mass module some of the
arithmetic functions the logarithmic
functions um power functions and even
trigonometric functions that we can do
using this math module and the function
inside the math module so starting off
let's look at some of the constants that
are part of this so as you can see
the standard constants are available uh
in this module are pi there is tau there
is euler's number nan which is a special
it's a it's a programming specific
concept and infinity uh so let's look at
this one by one so starting off uh our
first constant is pi um
pi is as you know in maths it's the
ratio of the of a circles circumference
to its diameter and
pi is an irrational number you know the
value of pi is 3.14 something since it's
an irrational number it does not we
cannot
define it in terms of a specific
fraction but it can be approximated to
the fraction 22 by 7. so how do we
access this
pi
constant is as simple as this once you
have imported maths uh the maths module
all you have to do is do match.pi and it
will give you the value as you can see
so as you can see the value returned to
us is a float this is important to note
and
the number of
number of decimal digits
the number of digits after the decimal
point that we can see here are 15 and
this is like a by default uh thing for
python that if you call the pi constant
it will give you the value of pi correct
up to 15 decimal points so an example of
where we can use this thing is say we
have the radius of a circle 3 it can be
in any units 3 meters or whatever you
want and you want to find out its
say circumference so as we know the
circumference of a circle is 2 pi r so
if i had to find the
circumference of a circle in my say my
code for some application with the
radius 3 or all i would have to do is
use the formula 2 pi r and to call the
value 2 pi r instead of specifically
writing 3.14 or something i can just use
this function math
dot pi over here and then i can enter
the r as you can see it will return me
the radius as you can see so moving on
uh the next constant that we will talk
about is tau tau is similar to pi
in fact tau is the ratio of a
circle circumference to its radius pi is
the ratio of a circle's circumference to
its diameter and tau is the ratio for
circles circumference to its radius so
important to note this difference so
because of this definition tau is always
2 times the value of pi this is by
definition and
much like pi if you call the tau
constant in
you from the math module it will also
return you a float number and
to find that this is the function that
we use or this is the syntax so as you
can see this is this is actually 2 times
the value of pi 6.283 and even this is
returned correct up to 15
places to the right of the decimal point
and this is by default uh next constant
is the user's number
the euler's number is a it's one of the
most widespread constants used in the
world of sci uh in the scientific
community in the mathematical community
um you will be using the uh euler's
number probably a lot as a if if you
move into data science or ai or
something like that so what is the
euler's number it is uh it is the
base of the natural logarithm if you
know what the natural algorithm is it is
used to calculate rates of growth or
rates of decay and as with numbers or
constants like pi and tau even the
euler's number is an irrational number
with infinite decimal places uh the
value of
the euler's number uh in short it's
denoted by the small letter e so this
value of e is
usually approximated around 2.718 so how
do we call this
constant is simply as math dot e this is
how we do it so you get this value again
this is also a float and it's correct up
to 15 decimal places so the next concept
that we will be talking about is
infinity now infinity is a it's more of
a mathematical concept and this is very
important to note because infinity
doesn't is not really a number there is
no number called infinity it is it is
used to define something that is
infinitely large or infinitely small so
positive infinity something that
is higher than any known number to us
and negative infinity is lower than any
known number to us
so this is the concept of infinity and
how do we call this
function well so let's see what happens
when we call the math function math
constant infinity so this is how we do
it and as you can see it will return us
this
it might look like a string to you but
this is actually a special type in
python um which is not a string this is
also a float it's a type of a float in
fact this uh infinity value it's it's a
it's like a special data type it's a
special data type that you can
you can consider as an equivalent to a
float but
it's not it's not a typical float that
we know like you know 3.14 or 2.71 the
value of mathematics will give us
inf and this is this inf is actually not
a
string so we can we can confirm that
over here as you can see when i do a
type when i check the type you see it's
actually a float in fact this was
recently added in python 3.5
a special type known as math dot inf
it returns this inf data type um which
is the equivalent wave float
so this is this is how we use infinity
if you wanted to get the
value of say minus infinity all you
would have to do is math dot inf with a
minus sign preceding this constant and
you will get minus inf now let's check
if uh the concepts or the properties of
infinity are uh maintained you know like
every a positive infinity is greater
than any number that we know and
negative infinity is greater than any
number that we know so let's just
confirm this um so i will take math
throat in and i will do a check
is this greater than say some really
large number something that comes off
the top of my head immediately okay so
let's see if it's if this is true then
this is conceptually correct and as you
can see it is true in fact i can change
this number to anything as large as i
want this will be true because infinity
is true is larger than any number that
we know
and similarly if i did minus math dot in
inf uh and i checked some very small
number you know a very very small
negative number so just consider some
minus uh 10 to the power something right
this should also be true uh sorry it
should be a smaller sign symbol this
should also be true because i'm checking
minus infinity smaller than any node
number to us and it is true as you can
see so uh it's very uh also if you did
uh if you did something like so let's
say if we do uh let's add something to
this you know it's a number so we should
be able to do arithmetic on this let's
actually see what happens when i add say
10 to positive infinity it actually
gives us the same value back infinity
because uh intuitively we know that
infinity plus anything is still going to
be infinity right and this is exactly
what python does for us even if we add a
number to this the math dot inf or the
infinity constant in python it will
still give us
the same value the same data type of inf
or infinity similarly if we subtracted
something from the negative of math dot
inf you know um say minus say again
let's say minus 100 so if you subtract
something from minus infinity we're
technically still minus infinity itself
so this will again give us minus and
minus inf as you can see and this is
absolutely what we need and this is a
very very interesting feature in python
uh finally the last
constant that we will discuss is the n a
n or the not a number constant so this
is not really a mathematical constant uh
there is no constant in maths called not
a number this is a computer science
related concept that
it's used to
is used to
denote invalid inputs or in it's used to
indicate
a certain places where say a variable
that should have a
number um it's been corrupted for
whatever reason and it it now has a text
or a symbol and our code throws an error
then in these in these cases where
python expects a number from us or from
your code and it does not get it it will
throw you a n a n value and this is
usually used in cases where you have
errors in your code so
again just to check like what this this
constant like how to call it this is how
you actually do it math.nan and it will
give you a data type called nan also
much like the infinity constant let's
see what's the type of this um this
constant again might look like a string
to you but of course this is not a
string this is a a numerical concept and
as you can see it's still a float so
this is like um it's another special uh
data type that was created for
specifically this case where uh it's
some it's the equivalent of a float but
um it's not really the typical float
that we are that we associate with so
this is a constants in the math module
so our next topic will be arithmetic
functions that we can do in the
using the math module so some of the
common arithmetic functions that are
available to us are factorials the
ceiling operation floor operation
there's permutations there's
combinations you can find the greatest
common divisor or the gcd and the lcm or
the least common multiple and you can
truncate numbers so let's look at them
one by one so starting off with the
factorial operation the factor of
operation is done using the factorial
function as you can see here actually
defined like this math dot factorial all
right so now what we pass in between the
parenthesis will be what we calculate
the factorial for as you know factorial
is so factorial is always for a positive
integer and the factorial for say a
number 10 would mean 10 times 9 times 8
times 7 so on until the number one
obviously factor is only defined for
positive integers uh it is not defined
for uh negative values or it's uh and
it's also not defined for decimal values
so uh let's see let's look at an example
so as we know um so let's say we pass
maths dot factorial for six and let's
see what's the value so
this is exactly what we expect so we
expect the value of six times five times
four times three times 2
that is actually 720. let's see what
happens when we pass 0
this should give us 1 since we know 0
factorial is 1. now let's see an error
case where we pass say minus 5. as you
can see this will throw us an error
because factors are not defined for
negative numbers now moving on let's uh
so the next function that we'll talk
about is the ceiling function so the
ceiling function is defined using math
dot see
seal as you see here so again we pass
the number that we want the ceiling for
in between the parenthesis so what is
the serine function it gives you the
largest uh sorry excuse me it gives you
the smallest number that is uh greater
than or equal to what we pass over here
so for an example if i gave you 6.6 and
i asked you okay what is the ceiling
function for 6.6 it should give you 7
because 7 is the largest integer in
integral value that is greater than 6.6
or equal to it obviously if you give the
ceiling function for an integer it will
give you the integer itself so let's
look at an example 7.8 so this should
give me the value 8 as you can see here
let's look at another negative number so
minus 12.3
an integer that is greater than minus
12.3
is -12 the smallest integer that is
greater than minus 12.3 and this should
give you 12 as you can minus 12 as you
can see here
a similar function is the floor function
which is defined like this
again the floor function what it does it
gives you the greatest number that is
smaller than
whatever value we pass between the
parenthesis so if i gave it 2.3 it
should give me the value 2. um again if
we pass integers
it will
just give us the integer itself again
just to reiterate this ceiling and floor
functions
they give you integ
integer values so the floor function
will give you the largest integer that
is smaller than what we pass over here
so let's look at 6.7 so the largest
integer that is smaller than 6.7 is 6
and as you can see this is our answer
over here uh the next function that we
will look at is the truncate function
the truncate function is defined using
this truncate is very similar to what we
have seen this is how we define the
truncate function uh it is very similar
to the ceiling and floor uh in the
truncate function what we do is
we pass a decimal value a float number
to the bet in between the parenthesis
and what we get back is the number
without the decimal component so only
the integral component so if i gave it
7.8 for example it will give me only the
seven part it will return me only the
seventh part and it will chop away the
point eight part um if i give it minus
twelve point three uh it will chop away
the point three part and give me only
minus twelve back so let's look at an
example 8.9 it should give me only eight
as you can see here see i did minus
eight
or minus six point nine this will give
me minus six so you can think of
truncate function as
it does the floor function for positive
values and it does the ceiling function
for negative values because it rounds
down and rounds up respectively for
positive and negative values so now
let's look at the next set of arithmetic
functions
let's move on to permutations
permutations are defined using this as
you know so in between the parenthesis i
have to pass two values n and k so i
have to pass n n and a k
the k has to be less than or equal to n
because the permutation as you know is
uh the number of ways in which we can
permute
from n objects k tie uh k different
objects uh so what this mathematically
what this is is
permutation of n and k is n factorial
divided by n minus k factorial so if i
pass say 10 and 6 it will give me the
permutation of 10 and 6. so let's look
at what's the value as you can see it's
a very large value
15 150 1200 similarly is a combination
function and this is a combination the
permutations are used a lot in
probability so if you're going to move
into that sphere which you will
encounter a lot in
machine learning ai you will be using
these functions quite a bit um so the
combination function again you pass an n
and a k again the n should be greater
than or equal to this k what this
evaluates is n factorial divided by n
minus k factorial times k factorial so
again this is a mathematical concept so
let's look at the permutation sorry the
combination of 10 and 6. so as you can
see it gives me 210 which is the
combination of 10 seconds in the
arithmetic function section um our gcd
and lcm as we know gcd is the greatest
common divisor lcm is least common
multiple so as of the newest version of
python in three point python 3.9 the
math module gets these two new functions
that were very lately added actually um
since i i cannot show you that because i
don't have the absolute latest version
of python on my system but using the
math dot gcd function this is the
function and in between this we would
what we would do if we had the latest
version is we would pass two numbers or
as many numbers in fact and what this
function would do is find the common
divisor amongst them so if i gave these
say for example if i gave these numbers
it would give me the value 10. similarly
the lcm function again added in the
python 3.9 finds the common multiple
amongst
whatever we pass over here so if i
passed say 20 and 30 this will give me
uh the value of 60 which is the lcm of
20 and 30. so again these are uh it's uh
something neat that if you say you have
python 3.9 or
if you have python 3.9 or after that
you will have access to these functions
as well if you when you import the math
module so that was for the arithmetic
functions let's move on to the next
section which are power and logarithmic
logarithmic functions so let's start off
with the power function
there are two there are uh multiple ways
you can actually do a power functional
math in python so you can do something
like this which is the equivalent of 2
to the power 3 or you can use the
inbuilt
module math and you can use the
pow or the power function which is this
is how you do it and if i had to do same
2 to the power 3 i would just pass 2 and
3 as arguments like this and it should
give me the value as you can see 8 over
here what if so there's actually one
more function which is simply the pow
function and this is uh not part of the
math module it's a function not part of
the math module but it's still part of
the
base python you use this as well and you
can do the same thing pow 2 and 3 it
should give you the value 8 again the
you know you might ask what's the
difference between these two functions
well it's not much for at least in a
beginner's standpoint it's not that much
uh just note that the math dot
power function is slightly
computationally faster than the simple
power function so yeah moving on the
next topic would be the next function
that we'll discuss is the exponential
function which is defined like this
again exponential function is again e to
the power something so if i did
exponential of 3
this would give me e to the power 3 as
you can see oh of course i did not
define the module beforehand so math.exp
now when i do this it should it will
give me some value which is basically
euler's number or e to the power 3. so
this was the exponential function and
let's look at uh an example so we will
look at the example of rate of dk and we
will use the uh this function in that
example so the exponential rate of decay
um
for
is used to calculate the amount of
radioactive elements that is present in
a substance after a certain amount of
time so the the
the the the expression is uh something
like the initial amount of radioactive
elements that were present
right at the beginning times the
exponent of minus 693 times t
t for time divided by the time period
the half lifetime uh so let's just write
it down to make it simple so again as
you can see the uh so this will give me
the remaining amount of radioactive
elements right so let's uh let's write
down the remaining let's assign this to
a variable remaining so the initial
again um initial is the initial amount
of radioactive elements so let's give it
some value say 100 um
the time let's assume it's 10 years
and let's say the half-life
half-life
is
around i don't know let's give some
value say three or something again this
is uh the details are not important so
this will uh i'm using the
math.exponential function over here as
you can see and for these values uh now
when i check what's the value of
remaining after i calculated it it's
something so this is it's basically what
this tells me is that i started off with
100 units of some radioactive element um
and in 10 years
this is what is left so yeah so this is
how we would use say the exponential
functions in a particular example of
ours so next the next type of again
functions are logarithmic functions so
let's look at some of the logarithmic
functions that are part of the math
module so basic log function would be
written like this math.log in between
this i would pass the number that i want
the log for by default if i just pass
one number it will it will calculate the
log of 8 to the base of e as we know e
is the euler's number so let's see what
it does in this case it gives me some
value what if i wanted to specify a
particular base well i would pass a
second argument in this case i want to
find the log of a to the base two this
should be the value three as you can see
over here
there are two specific functions that
are also provided in this math module
that is log 2.
what this will do is again it will again
i have to just pass one argument and
this will automatically find the value
of the log of 8 to the base 2 as you can
see here
similarly there is a math dot log 10
function if i give if i did this i will
find the value of
something here to the base 10 as you can
see so this was a logarithmic functions
then you have the finally you have the
square root function so how would we use
the math uh the square root function is
math dot sqrt
again we pass the what we want over here
if we want the square root of say 49
this should give me the value seven as
you can see finally maybe move on to the
final set of functions that we can do
using this math module uh they are
trigonometric functions and they are
hyperbolic functions so let's start off
with some of the trigonometric functions
as we know um we can do sine we can do
cosine and tan
some of the basic functions
the way we would do it is math dot sign
in between this what we this is to
calculate the sign of a particular
angle and this angle must be passed in
radians and this is very important to
note we do not pass it in degrees but in
radians so if i say past
sine of
3.14 as we know 3.14 is an approximation
of the value pi
uh my sine pi is uh supposed to be uh in
fact it's supposed to be zero so let's
see uh we get something close to zero
again since this is an approximation it
won't give us the exact value
similarly we can use math dot cos to
find the value of a particular angle
if you want to find
if you want to find the value of the
sorry the cost of a particular angle we
can use the tan function in case
we wanted to find the tan similarly uh
we have the next set for arc sine and
the arc cosines of
certain of angles so to use to find the
arc sine for example we would use a dot
sine i mean sorry a sine
for our cosine we would use this and for
r10 we would use this the next set would
be hyperbolic functions again hyperbolic
functions are
basically the sine and the cosine and
the time calculated not circles but on
hyperbolas uh again the details don't
have to be you don't have to know the
details you just should you should know
that if you wanted to say for example
find out the
hyperbolic sign of an a of an angle we
would use math dot
sine h
and we would pass what we wanted between
this similarly if we wanted to find the
cosine it would be cos edge
tan it would be tan h and if we wanted
to find the inverse
of
the hyperbolic inverse what we would do
is what we would do is use a so we would
use a tan h if we wanted to find the
hyperbolic inverse
of sine we would use a sine h and
similarly for cos it would be cos
a cos h so this concludes our video on
the math module in python and some of
the math functions surrounding this so
the basic uh
syntax if you will for a if statement in
python consists of the keyword if
followed by an expression as you can see
from this uh pictorial uh if if there's
an if statement there is a expression uh
there is this block of code which if you
can actually see is slightly indented to
the rest of the code uh and then we have
the rest of the rest of our code after
that so what we're looking at is this so
this is our if statement block um now
let's let's break this down so what is
this expression that we're speaking of
uh an expression in this context is a
boolean expression which evaluates to a
true or false statement so when we are
speaking about the if statement we have
an expression and if this expression
evaluates to true then we execute
everything below the if statement
otherwise we skip that portion as you
can see if the statement is true we
execute this statement or these
statement blocks otherwise if it's false
we move on to the next the next
statement block or the beginning of a
new statement so let's look at an
example to further understand this let's
take this if statement over here as you
can see in this if statement i have this
expression 50 greater than 30 so what
python is going to do now is it's going
to check whether 50 is greater than 30
and it's going to check in a boolean
context if this is true then we can move
on to the next portion which is this but
if it is false then we will skip this so
let's see what this what happens over
here so since we know that 50 is indeed
greater than 30 this is a true
expression we move on to this block of
code which is saying that print 50 is
indeed a larger number than 30. so let's
see if this actually gets printed so as
you can see we get this uh the result
which is this is a true statement and we
get our print statement getting executed
what if we give a false expression over
here so let's look at uh what happens if
i give a false expression now i'm
checking if 50 is lesser than 30 which
is a false statement so if it's a false
statement we do not move on to this
portion of our if statement block and we
we directly in fact we directly skip so
if i have to execute this you will see
nothing gets executed in fact my print
statement is just not executed because
we never entered this because our
expression over here was indeed false so
yeah this is how a basic if statement
block looks like in python and this is
how the uh how we move on to
how we check for the true the truth
truthfulness or the falseness of a
particular expression in the if
statement so moving on um let's move on
to the topic of indentation in um in
python so as you can see
this uh this if statement is an example
of a control structure so without moving
without defining what a construal
control structure is
in detail control structures consist of
these conditionals or loops or
iterations if you will
so all of these control structures
involve heavy indentation so what does
an indentation mean well what if i gave
you an example say i gave you some
variable called h and i wrote 20 over
here now if i give you an if statement
saying if age is greater than 10 now uh
it's very important to note that when
i'm defining an if statement i need this
colon otherwise this if statement is not
defined so this colon is important uh
anyways so now i'm checking this
expression if age is greater than 10.
now what is this what happens if h is
greater than 10 now what if i want
python to do something only if age is
greater than 10. well how do i tell
python that there is a piece of code
or a section of code that i want
executed only if this condition is met
well this is where indentation comes
into play so if i want say if i want
this line
this person is an adult again this is
some random line where i'm assuming ages
pertaining to this adult all right or
this person
so
if i have uh this variable age where i
write this number 20 which denotes the
age of some person and i'm doing a check
if age is greater than 10. actually
let's be specific here well the adult
age for most people is 18 in most
countries so let's see if age is greater
than 18. now if i'm doing this check
i want to print this statement only if
this person is a person's age is above
20 above 18. so
how do i tell python that i only want
this statement to be
executed only during this if this
condition is met well this is where
indentation comes into play as you can
see exactly as you can see uh this part
this portion of the code is slightly
indented compared to the if statement so
when this condition is met then only do
we move on to this if this condition is
not met we move on to whatever the next
section of code will be like whatever
whatever
code that we have after this if
statement so let's see so this since
this condition is actually met as you
can see this print statement is actually
executed so this is the importance of
indentation now we will see uh in as we
move as we learn more about if
statements and else statements and lf
statements how indentation plays a key
role in defining what we want as an
output when a certain condition is met
all right so for now it's very important
to understand that uh this is how
indentation is used in python in other
languages we might use uh we probably
don't use indentation in fact popular
language the c language uh does not use
indentation at all but some languages
and python and probably the trademark
language for indentation and programming
so you might say that
so different people have different
opinions on indentation the general
consensus is that indentation helps make
the code look very presentable and very
readable and this actually is one of the
facets of python programming is the
indentation and the easy readability of
it anyways moving on so what if we have
um multiple conditions in our code or if
in our if statement block that we want
to see so let's create this um list or
let's actually just copy this example
that i have written over here as you can
see what i am doing in this piece of
code is i have a list x where i have
this integer 50 i have two strings cat
and apple now i want to check a bunch of
things so i want to check if 60 is an x
and i also want to check if the string
cat is an x
and i want a final sort of like if none
of these conditions are met i want
something to happen so how do we do that
well we start off our state our if
statement block with the standard if
keyword all right now if we have
one more condition that we want met then
we can use the l if which
is kind of a short form for else if
so we use the l if keyword so it so what
this python
what python reads is it checks this
condition then it will check this
condition and then finally we have this
else keyword and else is the keyword
used in our block to tell python that if
none of our earlier expressions have
been true then do uh what is in the uh
that is within the else
keyword that is indented within the else
keyword so
again we don't pass an expression for
else because else is uh only we only
reach this l as statement in case all of
the other earlier conditions have not
been met or have uh come to be false and
not true so let's look at uh this
particular example so we have a list of
50 cat and apple and i'm my first
expression that i'm checking is
is 60 in x so this is how we check
actually so if 60 and x should be read
as is 60 in the list x so is this 16
elix list x well actually no we don't
have the object 60 so this part is not
executed we move on to the next
condition is the string cat in x well
actually it is
the string cat is indeed in x so we move
on to this statement block which is
within the condition that is met which
is print cat is in list x and you will
see that none of the other statement
blocks will be executed because we have
met our condition over here so if i
execute this as you can see that the
print statement cat is in list x is what
is actually executed and we do not
execute this obviously because it is
false and we do not even check or we do
not even move on to the statement
because well we have a condition met
over here so it's a one thing that is
important to note is that we can use as
many elif statements to check for as
many conditions that we we want to check
for
but it's very important that we only use
and if we are using that we only use one
else statement and only at the end of
our block okay so moving on now i'm
going to show you a very neat example
about how python actually does its uh
these these condition checkings so it's
very important to note that once a
condition is met none of the other
conditions are even checked for so
we do not even consider the next
statements and we directly leave this
if statement block so let's look at this
example over here now in this example
that i have over here is where i've
stored the string cat in x now i have
three
i have three conditions that i'm
checking i'm checking is 50 greater than
60 i am checking if the value of x is
indeed cat and i'm checking i'm some
random expression 1 divided by zero this
is not even a check this is literally
just checking if one divided by zero is
true or false and as we know we cannot
divide anything by zero so
let's see what happens when i execute
this statement now typically if i wrote
one divided by zero python will throw me
an error because 1 cannot be divided by
0 that is an error error in a statement
so let's see what happens when i do this
actually as you can see i have a
statement being printed but i have no
error even though i gave a wrong i gave
an error statement in 1 divided by 0
well now you might ask why is that so
well it's simply because i have actually
never reached this condition i have not
even
python is not bothered looking at this
because if you actually see there is a
condition previous to this over here
which is met and which is true so we
move on to this block we execute this
block and we forget about the rest of
the code so we don't actually get to
this erroneous statement which is an
interesting thing and which is an
example that i have shown
to show you that once a condition is met
in an if statement block we do not look
at any of the further conditions that
are being checked okay so finally um i
have one
one small topic that i would like to
share with you is the conditional
expressions or the python's ternary
operator now this is slightly different
to the if statement that we have talked
about up until now
in the sense that it is not a control
structure so what this actually is is
more of an operator that defines some
expression so let's see what i am trying
to say over here so as you can see over
here highlighted is the
syntax for what i'm trying to talk about
this ternary operator so let's look at
this example and let's see what i'm
trying to do over here so i have this
variable age all right and this age is
26 now x now just just read this
statement x is equal to adult if age is
greater than 18 else child now i could
have done an elaborate control structure
with an if statement then an indentation
within that if statement and then
i could have written else and then
another indentation and i would have
written another statement over there but
instead of that i have used this
operator to assign a particular value to
the variable x and this uh what value
i'm assigning to x depends on if this
condition is true or false so
as you can see the condition says is age
18
greater than 18. so if this is true then
i assign this particular string if it is
false then i go to the else statement
and i assign this so since age 26 is
greater than 18 i should assign the
string adult to x and as you can see if
i execute this and check what is in x
you can see adult is indeed an x so this
is a very neat a very needable readable
and a very um
it it's a it's probably a more it's a
better looking way
to perform simple else uh some simple if
and else statements where you don't want
to create a whole um if stay if if else
statement control structure block so
yeah this was the ternary operator
finally we let's uh we make a short note
on the path statement uh in python so
the pass statement or the pass keyword
is a
a place where it is a placeholder of
sorts so what if i had an if statement
and i'm writing a piece of code but i
don't know what to do with this if
statement so if if a statement is
correct if a statement is true
but i don't know what to do if this
statement was true
how do i tell python well let's just
keep it a hold for now and i might
put something into this block later in
the future well i would use the pass
statement so if i had this say the sum
condition again so i'm checking age is
greater than 18 but i don't know what to
do with this i would just simply use
this pass statement and
this basically does nothing uh it it's a
way to it's it's like a way to create a
placeholder where maybe in the future i
might have i might write some sort of a
say a print statement or some sort of a
different function or something else
within this indentation so but in the
meantime like currently i don't have
anything to place over here so i just
leave it with a path statement so this
is
a way where you can use a pass statement
in um if an else statement or infinite
control structures so yeah this was a
basic or the an introduction into
conditional statements and
the control structure
of if and l statements in python and
iteration is uh
executing the same block of code over
and over potentially many times a
programming structure that implements an
iteration is called a loop now in
programming we have two types of
iterations definite and indefinite
iterations and in this example we will
be speaking about indefinite iterations
indefinite iterations in python is the
while loop where we use the while
keyword to define an indefinite
iteration so let's look at the basic
syntax as you can see this is the basic
syntax where we have the while keyword
followed by an expression and again the
colon and below that is something
indented again we are encountering
indentations just like in fl statements
uh a set of statements where um what
happens here is following the while
keyword we have this expression where
this expression is evaluated in a
boolean context again we check if this
expression evaluates true or false and
if it is true we
execute all the statements or the
statement block that is indented below
this file statement now this is another
example of control structure much like
uh if any statement blocks where we use
a lot of indentation so let's look at a
basic example now of while loop so let's
copy this example and let's see what
this does so i have a variable n where i
am assigning it a value 0. this is
called an initializing process and it's
very important to note that most while
loops consist of an expression which
contains a variable a control variable
which
is usually initialized prior to starting
the loop and then this control variable
is
typically very modified somewhere within
the
main loop body so in this case my
control variable is n and i am
initializing it by assigning it the
value 0 so let's uh move into the loop
now so the loop has this wire keyword as
you can see followed by a
an expression n lesser than or equal to
five now what this is is an expression
which is going to check if it's true or
false is n lesser than or equal to five
and as long as this expression is true
we will continue doing whatever is
indented below this y statement and what
is below this while statement is a print
statement first of all which says value
of n is and it basically prints the
value of n in that particular iteration
and as you can see at this uh compound
assignment where we add the value of n
uh by 1 and we assign it back to n so
what this is let's see what this does
actually let's execute this and see what
this does uh important to note the value
of n again is initialized at zero so
this while loop will keep going on until
the value of n remains lesser than or
equal to five so as you can see i have
the execution of this
particular block of code or this while
loop where i get the
multiple different iterations of this
print statement that you can see here
the first iteration it says value of n
is zero then it's the value of n is one
what i'm doing is i am writing i am
assign i'm writing uh the value of n
multiple times
and each time the value of n is written
over here based on what iteration it is
so what is happening actually is
that initially the value of n is 0 and i
print this statement value of n is 0.
now i add
the value of what is in n by 1. so now
what is the value of n so again we do
this check so after this first iteration
we
come back like once this whole
co block of code is executed we again
come back to this expression and we
again check if this statement is true so
now that the value of n is actually 1 if
this
statement is still true so again we
execute this and that you can see over
here value of n is one now again we add
the value of n by one and again we go
back here once this uh this block is
executed and we check if this statement
is true again and as you can see the
value of n when it's two is still
making sure that this expression is true
and this keeps happening until the value
of n is greater than 5. so once the
value of n becomes 6 this condition is
no longer met and finally we do not
execute the statement because this
expression evaluates to false and we do
not do this anymore and we finally leave
our while loop so let's check what the
value of n is just to confirm this as
you can see the value of n is indeed 6
and that is why we have left this while
loop over here so this is an example of
a basic while loop where we check for
this uh an expression if it evaluates to
true we evaluate everything within it
once this is done we go back and we
evaluate this expression again if it is
again true we again go back into
whatever is indented within it and we
keep doing this until the expression
gives us false and interestingly we
don't uh we don't necessarily have to
define these control variables always we
can actually use uh iterables and we
will learn about iterables actually in a
future video but we can use iterables
and an example of an iterable is
the list so let's look at this list and
let's look at this whole block all right
so i created this list a which contains
five objects one two three four and five
all integer objects and i have another
variable x where i store the integer one
now i'm this while statement now it
might look confusing now it says it says
while a now what is a well a is not uh
your typical expression where you're
making sure if some condition is being
met or not but this the way you read
this is while a exists so in the context
of a list as long as a which is a list
contains objects within it a is true if
it does not have any objects within it a
is false so while a basically what it
means is while a has objects within it
and if it does have objects within it or
as long as it does we continue executing
whatever is indented within this while
statement and this y statement is a
print statement again we
do like we we have this value x where we
um we're doing this this we're printing
this is iteration number and
we pass x so the first iteration
obviously pass x is equal to one and
then we add x by one and then the second
iteration should pass this iteration
number two and then so on and finally we
have another statement within this block
called the a called the pop statement
where we're popping the elements of a
now as if you would have seen the list
the video and list the pop statement
removes the right most value
from a list so if i do a dot pop
initially it will remove five from this
list and i will have the rest of them
again if i do pop it will remove four
from this list and then you will have
the rest of these so let's actually see
we'll actually check what's left in this
list each time we do this pop statement
so that i'll also print the list
a each uh during each iteration and
let's see what happens over here as you
can see what is happening out here is
while a or while a has elements we are
going to continue doing this while
statement whatever is within it so in
the first iteration obviously we have
all of it uh and it is iteration number
one and as you can see the list contains
everything then i pop it then iteration
number two it again has elements but it
has lost its most rightmost element and
this keeps on happening until the list
finally has no elements left and once
element or events the list has no
elements left we this expression while a
evaluates to false and we do not execute
this anymore and we leave the while loop
and again let's check what is in a a
should have no elements as you can see
it's an empty list when i check what's
in a it's an empty list and that is why
while a returned me a false and we did
not print any further so this is an
example of using a while statement using
lists
and of course
the next topic would be discussing
nested while loops and
this is a broad topic what i mean by
this is that when when i'm saying nested
while loops i'm actually talking about
nested control structures so we can have
while loops within while loops not only
that we can have if an else statements
within while loops we can have while
loops within if and else statements and
we can have if and else statements
within if and l statements so if you
think of all of these loops uh and we
will even speak about for loops in the
in the in in another video for loops
again are a type of control structure so
all of these are control structures
while loops are control structures for
loops are control structures if and l
statements or control structures all of
these are control structures and nesting
can happen within them and it does not
matter uh which is the like the parent
of the nest and then the child or the
nest if you can have a while loop within
an if and a statement you can have for
loops within a while loop all of this is
valid in python and uh it's one of the
one of the great features of python that
is very flexible in this way so let's
look at an example where i have a while
loop within another while loop so i'm
copying this piece of code where i have
this list one two three four five and
another list first and second now my
first while loop i print i print what is
popped from a so i take a then i pop the
zeroth index so basically from the left
hand side and i print what is that all
right and then i have another while loop
where i have this list b and i'm doing
the same thing but this while loop is
within the first while loop and let's
see what happens out here so as you can
see my first uh my first iteration of
this parent while loop causes me to pop
what is the first element which is one
then i do these while loops and this is
completely executed and only then do i
go back to this first one and then i
come back and do all of this again then
i go back to this one and then i come
back and do all of this again and that's
why you can see this repetition so i
have this first iteration and then i do
uh the second while loop then i have the
second iteration and then i do the
second while loop and i keep doing this
and this is an example of a nested while
loop okay so our next topic in this
section this video would be break and
continue statements now break in
continue statements are ways to abruptly
end iterations uh in in a particular
loop you can use break in continuous
statements not only in while loop but
you can use it in also in for loops so
let's look at how we use it in while
loops and let's look at what we mean by
breaking continuous statements first of
all well the break statement terminates
the loop entirely so once the break
statement is found
the the complete while loop that we are
using is completely terminated and the
continuous statement on the other hand
terminates only the current loop
iteration and it goes back to the
beginning or the expression and it
checks whether uh the expression or the
the controlling expression is again
reevaluated and it is checked whether
the loop will execute again or terminate
this pictorial that you can see here
actually emphasizes or it shows the
difference between break and continue so
i have this while loop and i have an
expression all right i have a bunch of
statements and i have a break command
over here and i have a continue command
over here so if i encounter the break
command it will not execute any of this
in fact it will not execute this via
statement at all and it will move on to
the next piece of code that we have but
a continuous statement if a continuous
statement is encountered in while loop
will not completely break away but it
will not uh it will not execute the the
rest of the statements in that iteration
only these two but it will go back here
it will check this expression again and
again we will do this all over again so
this is this small uh difference between
the break and continue statements but
both are used to abruptly end an
iteration in a loop so let's look at an
example of how we use the break
statement so i will use this example
where i have again i have initialized
some controlling variable n to 0
my first loop will check whether n is
less than equal to 5. if this is true
then i will print this statement then i
will what i'm doing over here is i am
incrementing it by one now in my
previous my earlier example using a
similar uh using the similar example uh
i had no like this this part was not
there so what you got was i was printing
the value of n so it was printing as
like value of n is one i mean zero and
then one and then two and then three
four and five but over here i've
included a small i've nested an if
statement and within that i put a break
statement and this if statement is
checking if if n is equal to equal to
two so once n is 2 i move on to this and
i do the break statement so let's see
what happens now as you can see once
so when i have executed this i don't get
the whole value of n is 0 and then 1 and
then 2 3 4 5 i o i stop at one and that
is because once n is equal to two i
actually do not execute this uh while
loop again i do not go back and uh
execute print value of n is two now in
fact i break from this whole while loop
and uh my while loop terminates right
then and there and that's why you only
get these two iterations value of n is
zero and then value of n is one okay so
now i'm going to show you a neat example
of what happens or what is the
difference between a break and a
continuous statement okay so let's uh go
back to our initial example where we're
printing this value of n is 0 1 2 3 4
and so on but i've added one more
statement where i print hello at each
iteration so let's see what happens when
i do this as you can see it will print
hello after each of whatever i was doing
already now let's introduce our break
statement first of all so when i do
break well let's
go back to this if statement if
if we check this condition then we break
let's see what happens now as you can
see something interesting has happened
where we have this first iteration
completely being executed but the second
iteration kind of stops where there's no
hello and that is because we have broken
from this while loop before the second
iterations hello was printed let's see
the difference between a break and
continue now so now i have this continue
statement instead of a break let's see
what happens here as you can see it
seems familiar to our first example
where we did not have any break or
continue but there is a small difference
that i want you to catch and that is
very important about this continue
statement so as you can see the first
iteration has value of n is 0 and then
hello and value of n is 1 but there is
no hello and this is because and this is
because once this condition is actually
met we do not move on to this statement
but we go back to this expression and we
will evaluate this expression and then
once we evaluate this expression again
and it's found to be correct we do
everything the same again where we print
hello but except for that one step where
this if statement was met and we did
continue and this following statement
was not executed and that happens only
for one iteration and that is when n is
equal to equal to two and as you can see
that is what happens over here in one of
the iterations we may say hello and that
is the difference of the continue
statement between uh there is a
difference of the continue statement
with the break statement so this
concludes it for our video on indefinite
iterations i hope you learned about
while loops and in definite iterations
so starting off we know that there are
two types of iterations in programming
uh definitely an indefinite we have
already covered indefinite iterations in
the form of while loops
definite iterations on the other hand
are done using the keyword for
and the basic syntax or the standard
syntax for a basic for loop in python is
as you can see over here we have this
four keyword we have some variable we
have the in keyword and we have this
iterable and
we of course define this control
structure with the colon and then
indented we have this statement block so
once this for loop has started we
execute all of these uh statements
within the statement block as part of
the follow-up iteration so yeah let's uh
now let's to understand like how for
loops work
exactly let's
look at the concept or meaning behind
what we call iterables and iterators so
so think of it in a stepwise manner all
right so we in python we have different
objects that can be used as iterables
and an iterable is basically some object
that
it's a collection of other objects so
you know think of your lists uh think of
dictionaries and sets so all of these
are essentially collections of objects
so once we have these collection of
objects
we can create an iterator out of it
how do we do that is we use the iter
function so for example if i passed this
list a if i pass this list a through the
iter function and i store it in some
variable iter underscore a
and i see what is iter underscore a it
is actually a list iterator at some
random memory location which we don't
really care about similarly if i gave a
tuple and i did the same thing i will
create a tuple iterator and in the left
if you can see over here i've done the
exact same uh functions with sets and
dictionaries as well so i'm creating
iterators out of these uh iterables so
as to speak now what is an iterator well
an iterator is an object that yields
values successively so
if my list contained five values or five
objects an iterator of this list will
yield these values uh one after the
other and that is kind of how or that is
the basis for which we do
we create loops let's see what we
exactly mean using this uh
using another function that we call the
next function so the next function keeps
moving from object to object within an
iterator so since i've created this list
iterator let's just do it once again so
as you can see i've created this listed
iterator iter underscore a now with this
item underscore a what i'm going to do
is i'm going to use this next function
what next function does is starting from
the leftmost object within this iterator
i will keep yielding or keep producing
the values so let's let's just see what
happens when i do next either when i do
next for this particular variable it
gives me this object first now let's see
what happens when i do it again
now it gives me the object second what
if i did it again it gives me third now
if i kept doing this it will keep giving
me the different objects that were
initially stored in a that is first and
then second third fourth and fifth one
after the other so let's actually
perform that now i get fourth now i get
fifth now a natural question is now that
i've exhausted all of these values what
will happen if i perform the next
function again well let's see what
happens i get a
an error or and this error is the stop
iteration function error which basically
is telling me
look you have
exhausted all of the objects that were
initially present in this list a and you
cannot you cannot keep doing the next in
the next function anymore you cannot go
you keep going further so yeah so this
is uh what the next function does when
it comes to the concept of iterators all
right so now we've learned two things
what is an iterator and what is the how
do we create an iterator out of
different collections of objects like a
list or a tuple and we've also learned
how to use the next function now let's
move or let's come back to our for loop
that we
started off this video with so our for
loop again let's consider our for loop
over here
as you can see some for loop with the
objects again one two three four and
five all right this is a list now i'm
going to do for x in a print x and let's
try to see what happens when we do this
okay as you can see when i have executed
this it gives me one two three four and
five so i have first of all let's look
at this for loop i in this for loop i
define a new variable x and then i say
for x in a print x and what's happening
well in each iteration i am printing
whatever the value of x is at present so
in the first iteration it is the first
object one in the second iteration it is
the second object two then three four
five and then finally uh on its own like
uh this for loop knows that okay now
once i have exhausted all of the objects
within my iterator i can stop doing this
for loop and i can move on with the rest
of the code all right so think of it
like a three step process uh a for loop
in python the first step is it calls an
iter function to obtain an iterator for
whatever we pass over here this iterable
second step it calls the next function
repeatedly in each iteration all right
to keep getting the next item from the
iterator so it gets one then it calls
next then it gets two then it calls next
and it gets three and then four and then
five and so on and then finally the
third step is the termination step is
when after we do the final next where we
get this
error as you can see the stock iteration
error or exception finally this tells
the for loop function or the for loop
that um okay we have reached the end of
our definite iteration or the end of our
definite for loop and this is where we
must terminate our loop and then
continue with the rest of the code all
right so this is how a for loop works in
python now it's very important to note
that whatever we have discussed when it
came to while loops such as nesting of
while loops and nesting of other control
structures is also applicable in the
case of for loops so if i had a for loop
within another for loop that is
perfectly fine if i had a vial within a
for loop that is perfectly fine so all
of these are valid statement blocks that
we can do
and again for loop is another control
structure and so we must follow the
concept of
indentation when it comes to writing our
statement blocks within a for loop okay
so now i'm going to speak about in
specific i'm going to speak about the
this uh something called the range
function that is uh quite
you could say it's used definitely it's
used in other areas of programming but
it's widely used in python uh i mean uh
i mean the for loop in python now what i
mean by this is that um
range this range function is very
important for the for loop and we will
see why okay so let's look at um one of
the examples of using the range function
so what does a range function do is if i
give range 5 let's see what it does it
gives me range 0 to 5. what this
basically tells me is that this will
create an iterator that contains
integers from zero to five so it will
contain the object zero one two three
four and five and we can use this as an
iterator so let's let's look at this uh
i have range five uh let's store this in
x okay now let's do a type just to see
what happens when we do type x it should
give me the type of range as you can see
and this is the type of an iterator in
python now let's see what happens when i
do 4 i in x
print i okay let's see what happens as
you can see it prints the number 0 1 2 3
4. an important caveat when it comes to
the range function is when we say range
5 it creates an iterator from 0 to 5 but
it contains the objects 0 1 2 3 and 4
only it does not contain the object five
itself okay this is something that is
very important too so uh once again i
created uh i use this range function to
create an iterator from
iterator of five objects from zero to 4
0 1 2 3 and 4.
i use that in my for loop and that's
what that is what you are seeing here
now let's use this range function in the
context of something else for example
let's see so i had my earlier list a
right look at my list a here
so you can see list a contains these one
two three four five five objects okay
let's see what length of a is length of
a is five okay uh let's use the range
function on top of the length of this
list a and this is
like i can't show you an example right
now without any context but this uh this
form of using a for loop is used is
widely used in
python programming you will use it so
much in data science you will use so
much in machine learning and ai i cannot
tell you uh this is so this is a very
important like sort of uh for loop
expression so you have four
let's say i
in
range
len
a let's see what's going on here first i
create uh first i do length of a that
gives me five then i do range of five
that creates an iterator between uh zero
and four right when you do range five it
gives you an iterator of 0 1 2 3 and 4
as we saw earlier and this is what we're
doing over here we have created an
iterator out of the length of a list
now when i do print i it should give me
again 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 of course so as
you can see here it will give me 0 1 2 3
4. and this is a very neat way of using
the range function on top of the length
of a particular collection of objects in
this case we're using the list a this is
something that you will use a lot so i i
would recommend that you get used to
this form of creating a for loop as well
using the range function also of course
um there are
the you can use break and continue
statements as you have in the case of
while loops uh exactly this it works
exactly the same in the case of for
loops wherein the break statement will
abruptly stop the for loop completely
and we will move on to the next piece of
code whereas the continue statement will
break that particular iteration and then
we will resume with the next iteration
so yeah that was breaking continue
statements and for loops finally i would
like to show you something about uh how
to use dictionaries as an iterator or as
an iterable when it comes to for loops
so let's create our dictionary let's go
we have a dictionary already here in
fact create this dictionary again we'll
store it in a okay so i created this
dictionary a all right so i have
dictionary a uh what i'm going to do is
i'm going to pass it through the
iterator function as you can see and now
i'm going to just for the sake of
showing you it will show i'll show you
that it is actually an iterator of type
of a specific dict key iterator type all
right so
now let's uh let's do something on this
so as you can see in the dictionary i
have the key first that has the value
one i have the key second that has the
value two i have the key third that has
a value three and then fourth for four
fifth for five now
a good question would be when i do
iteration or when i do a for loop on top
of this a well what is it going to pick
up is it going to pick up first uh is it
going to pick up the keys like these or
is it going to pick up the values or is
it going to go one by one key and then
value and then key in the subsequent
value uh let's see what actually happens
let's do four i in
uh iter underscore a print hi let's see
what what is the iterations happening
upon using this so as you can see we're
using the keys
so by default when we do this when we
perform when we create an iterator out
of a dictionary we use only the keys as
our uh
iterator elements or at iterator values
but of course like if you wanted to use
values all you would have to do is pass
a dot values over here and if you
remember from a dictionary video this uh
a dot values gives us a list of
or it by it gives us the essentially a
list of
the values in our dictionary so when we
pass this to the iterator uh iter
function and we create an iterator out
of it let's see what happens over here
now let's see what is it underscore a
you can actually see it's now the dict
value iterator at a particular memory
location so it's not the dict key as we
saw earlier it's a dict value iterator
so now that we have this dict by
dictionary value iterator now let's
print what are our iterator elements and
as you can see now we are printing
values and not um the keys so this is
how to these this is basically two
different ways of iterating through a
dictionary one through keys and one
through values so this concludes it for
our video on definite iterations in
python i hope in this video you
understood and you learned about the
concept of iterables and iterators and
the different functions associated with
it and how exactly the for loop function
works uh in python so let's first revise
some of the concepts of an if statement
so basic if statement can be something
like this we have a small condition
where we're checking if a variable x is
greater than 5 or not and if it is
greater than x we print a statement over
here so if this condition is met we
print this statement else we move to the
statement block now our variable x has
the value 5. now since x is not greater
than 5 what this will do is it will
check the statement and since this will
be false we skip the statement block and
move on to this statement so as you can
see here similarly we can do something
where we are checking multiple
statements we use the l if statement in
such a case so
now in this block we are checking in one
of the one of the conditions we're
checking is if x is equal to 5 or if x
is greater than 5 and then finally if
both of these conditions are not met we
say else and we print whatever or we do
whatever is in this particular statement
block which is a simple print statement
so as you can see x is indeed good is
equal to five so this is the block that
will get executed as you can see here
now another example are nested if
statements so nested if else statements
are if statements within if else
statements so let's look at an example
as you can see here we have a string
stored in a variable called orange
quality and the string is fresh now we
have an integer or a float in this case
4.0 stored in orange price now our first
statement is checking whether orange
quality the variable orange quality is
it equal to the string fresh and within
that if the statement or if this
condition is met we do another check
where we're checking what is the price
is it lesser than 5 if it is we do this
block else we execute this block finally
if our initial
statement our initial condition is not
met we move on to this else block now
when i execute this what should happen
is i will enter this block because this
is true and finally i will enter this
block because this condition is also
true so i should have this printed i
will buy five dozens as you can see here
now let's move on to our main exercise
for this video so this was all just a
revision now we're gonna use some or all
of these concepts in a sample project or
a sample exercise
to for your further practice
so in this exercise what we're going to
do is we're going to request the user to
enter a number between 1 and 20 and our
our code is going to check whether this
number entered is an even number or an
odd number so as you can see there are
two sets of checks that we're going to
do in this code the first check is going
to be whether the number that is entered
is between 1 and 20 or not and if it is
not we have to say it's an invalid
number but if it is entered between 1
and 20 we have to move on to the further
checks which is whether it is an even or
an odd number so let's see how we do
that so in this piece of code what we
start with is a print statement saying
please enter a number between 1 and 20
and then we add an input command this
input command will open a box where we
can enter whatever number that we want
to enter
now we use this in keyword to make sure
that whatever we have entered into the
input box is stored as a int data type
in the enter num variable
once we do that our first if statement
is going to check whether the entered
number is greater than or equal to 1 or
less than equal to 20. sorry and less
than equal to 20. so both of these
conditions have to be met if this
condition is true then we have a valid
input and this statement is printed that
we have entered a valid number and then
we move on to the rest of the statement
block within this if statement which is
another set of if and else if statements
if our number is not between 120 we move
to this block and this block prints that
we have entered an invalid number now
once we have
say entered a valid number we move on to
this block this is in
if else
if elif statement block now what this
block is checking is whether the entered
number is an even number or not now as
we know an even number is divisible by 2
and leaves the remainder 0 when divided
by 2. so this is what this check is
doing if this check is true that means
our number is even and we get printed
that our number is even the other other
check or the other uh if statement is
checking whether it's an odd number and
that means when we divide by two we
should get the remainder one as you can
see here and we get printed your number
is odd so let's execute this and see
what happens when we enter a number now
it's asking me to enter a number let's
say i enter 17.
now that i've entered 17 as you can see
it's a valid number that i've entered
and the code is telling me that my
number is indeed odd let's look at some
other what if i entered something else
here let's say if i enter 16 now since
it's an even number as you can see 16 is
also a valid number as it's between 1
and 20 and my number is even and the
code checks for that let's see if i what
happens when i enter an invalid number
let's say 25 now will i enter 25 as you
can see it says i have entered an
invalid number and in this case what has
happened is this condition itself is not
met and i have moved on to the statement
block so to give you a breakdown as to
how our code has executed this let me
show you an example for the number say
nine when i enter nine the first check
that happens of course is this check
whether it's a valid number or not and
since it is between 1 and 20 we move on
to this block and in this block is
checking whether our number is divisible
by 2 or not and since it is not it will
remain it will leave a remainder 1 and
we execute this block it says our print
our number is odd as you can see here so
this was a brief recap into the if
statement and if else statements
necessary file statements we also saw an
exercise where we used nested if else
statements so our first example will be
where we calculate the factorial of a
number in this example as you can see
here we are first going to ask the user
to enter a particular number for us now
this number is supposed to be an integer
once we have this integer we store it to
a variable called number now we have
this you can say this
variable called fac which stores one and
you we will see how we are using it
later now we know that the factorial of
0 is 1 that's how it's just defined so
we have an if statement checking whether
our entered number is 0 and if it is 0
we
say that the result is 1 or the
factorial is 1. however
if we enter a number that is greater
than 0 we must calculate the factorial
for this number and that is what we are
going to do in this else statement block
over here now in this else statement
block we have a while loop in this while
loop the condition is checking while
number is greater than or equal to one
so as long as this condition is true
everything within that while loop will
be executed so as long as number is
greater than equal to 1 we are going to
execute these two lines now what do
these two lines do let us see so the
first line takes the variable fac where
we had the number one stored and we are
going to store fac times number into it
number being the number that we have
inputted so in case for example we we
entered 8 then what this will do this
line will do is 1 into 8 and it will
store that back into fac now once that
is done we move on to the next line
where we are decrementing the number
variable by one so if we have stored
eight or we have entered eight into our
input it will become seven now as we
know seven is still greater than or
equal to one so this condition is still
being met and then we do this process
again where we are going to multiply fac
this time f ac stores the value 8 and we
multiply times the new number which is 7
now so we do 8 into 7 and then again we
decrement this
also once we do 8 into 7 we store it
back into fac and we keep doing this
where we keep multiplying 8 times 7 and
then we decrement the number variable
by 1 and then we check this condition
again so what ends up happening is we
are going to keep doing 8 into 7 into 6
into 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 and
once we are at 1 again when we do this
decrement operation the number variable
was stored the value 0 and then this
condition will no longer be met so
number will be 0 and this condition will
be false and we can move out of this
while loop then finally we store the
result into a variable called result
which stores the result of 8 into 7 into
6 into 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1
this is of course if we did enter 8 when
we were asked to give an input so let's
see this um in real time once we execute
this so i'm executing this the first
thing it asks me is to enter a number so
let's say i enter my number eight as i
was speaking about eight all right now
that i've entered eight as you can see
the result that it gives me is factorial
of eight is four zero three two zero
which is correct and you can check this
for yourself where it will show you um
eight times seven or eight factorial is
basically this this number okay so now
in our next example we will be looking
at how we can generate fibonacci numbers
for this example we will be using bunch
of if and else if statements along with
a while loop so let's look at this piece
of code where we are actually doing this
so as you can see the first part of the
code is basically an input statement
asking us how many fibonacci numbers we
would like to generate and then the user
would be asked to give an input which is
stored as an end into a variable count
now in this
fl statement the first
if statement checks whether what we have
entered is 0 in which case we just store
an empty array in the variable called
fib next if our
entered integer is 1 we just store the
value 1 in this array called fib if our
entered number is 2 we store 1 and 1 in
the array fib all of these are different
sets of fibonacci sequences this
obviously an empty
an empty array shows that well there is
no numbers to be generated in this
sequence if we have one we just print
the first number of the fibonacci
sequence which is one itself if it is
two we print the first two numbers which
is one and one now
the actual calculations happen when we
say we want a fibonacci sequence for
more than two numbers now in that case
we move on to this block in this
statement block we initialize the fib
variable with the first two fibonacci
numbers one and one and we store in this
very in this array now we are going to
do a while loop within this and in this
while loop we are going to keep
executing the statement block as long as
this condition is met or this condition
is true and what this condition is is
it's checking this variable i which we
have initialized as 1 over here and
we're going to check whether that is
lesser than count minus 1 count being
the number that we have been asked to
input if the statement is true and as
long as the statement is true we will be
executing the statement block which is
basically us appending this expression
into the array fib now what this
expression is is basically it's going to
keep adding uh each subsequent numbers
and we're going to store each subsequent
numbers back into the
array fib so in this case if you see the
what the first step will do is it will
take the value at the first position of
the array fill and it will add it to the
value at the zeroth position of the
array fib and both of these values since
they are one and one when we add them we
get two and we append that to fib so now
our fib will look like one comma one
comma two then we increment this by one
and what we do is we
do the same process again so in the next
step what would be what we would do is
we would do two plus one so we would get
three now this would keep going on until
this condition is met or basically until
uh the numbers that we actually want to
generate in our sequence so let's like
let's let's uh execute this and let's
see an example of what happens so it
asks me how many fibonacci numbers i
would like to generate and i will say i
want the first let's say six fibonacci
numbers so i execute this as you can see
this gives me the first six numbers in
the sequence which is one and one and
then two which is basically one plus one
and then three which is one plus two and
then five which is two plus three eight
which is three plus five so if we wanted
more numbers we would just enter over
here like say if we wanted the first 10
numbers it would give us
the first 10 numbers in the sequence as
you can see here now in our next example
what we are going to do is we are going
to write a program which takes two
digits that represent the dimensions of
an array so for example if we want a
three by three array we will enter three
comma three and we are going to generate
a two dimensional array in which each of
the elements of the array are basically
the row times the column position of
that particular element and what i mean
by this is say we have a position i
comma j on the array the value of the
element at that position would be i
times j so for example if i'm looking at
something at the third row and the fifth
column or say the third row and the
third column for example the value of
the element would be three times three
and if i'm looking at something at the
second row and the fourth column i am
going to do two times four so let's uh
let's see how we can do this using code
so if you look to the right over here i
have a piece of code where i'm going to
uh in where it asks me to input two
numbers two integers to represent the
dimensions of my uh example uh my sample
array now once we have done this we are
going to store
these
these
dimensions in the
inputs in in a variable called input
string so obviously when we enter say
five comma five that will be stored as
an in in this particular string or this
variable what we want is we want
five say we entered five comma five we
want five as a separate integer and the
other five as another separate integer
and that is what we do in this
particular statement where we're going
to split up our input string based on
the comma separator and we're going to
store the first part of that string into
the zeroth position of dimensions which
is an array and the next dimension in
the first position in this particular
array now
we're going to store the number of rows
as row number and that is the zeroth
position of this array and we're going
to store the number of columns as the
first position of dimensions or whatever
we've mentioned in the input so now we
we have this um our results array called
multilist which is basically what what
our final array is going to look like
and we're going to store into multi-list
and
in this example we will be using for
loops to
do this or to create this particular
array so as you can see here our first
uh we have initialized our multi-list
saying that um we're going to have only
zeros in our sample array so initially
once we have initialized this array all
multi-list will contain is a say for
example we have inputted a five by five
array it will have basically a five by
five array with all elements as zero and
that's what this line does once we have
done this we are going to move on to the
for loop portion where we are actually
going to create our array that we want
so as you can see we are our first for
loop is going to say for row in range
row number so obviously uh range will
generate a
an iterator which can be iterated over
um and since it says range row number
and say our the number of rows that we
entered were five what it's going to do
is it's going to create an iterator
containing the value 0 1 2 3 and 4. so
for row and range it will basically
basically row will take the value 0 1 2
3 and 4. and a similar thing is going to
happen in this nested for loop which is
within this where we're going to again
uh create a an iterator using this range
function and for the column number once
we have this we're going to do the
simple process of
multiplying the uh the value of the
element based on its position so if it's
at the position 3 comma 4 we're going to
store the value 3 times 4 into that
particular position of the array and
we're going to do this for every
position which is what happens in these
two for loops we're going to first go by
each row and then within that we're
going to check each column and we're
going to cover perform these
calculations and finally we print our
result so let's look at an example now
i'm going to say i want a 3 by let's say
a 2 by 4 matrix so let's see what the
results will be when i give this as uh
so what i'm saying is i want two rows
and four columns now as you can see here
it might not be very clear to you right
now but what you can see here is this is
the first row and this is the second row
and each row contains four columns so
these are the is this is the my final
array that i get so what you can see
here is this is the zeroth position and
the uh or you can say this is the first
row first column first row second column
and since python is zero based so this
is actually the zeroth row and this is
the first row so as you can see uh this
this value basically is zero times one
this value is zero times two zero times
three zero times four and over here it
is one times 0 1 times 1 1 times 2 1
times 3 so similarly if i did for
example a 5 by 5 matrix what you will
get is 5 rows now 5 rows and 5 columns
and for example like this particular
value is uh 1 2 3 or 0 1 2 3. so 0 1 2 3
and the first column so this is 3 times
1
um if i took this value this is like the
fourth row for example fourth row times
the um zero one two three third column
so this would be four times three which
is twelve so and uh each value of this
has been generated in the similar
process so this is an example of how we
can use for loops um for a particular
exercise that i have shown you right now
so this was it for uh these particular
examples into violent for loops uh i
hope you found the two examples on while
loop in this one example on for loops uh
helpful to you and um i hope it gave you
further insight into how we can use
these types of loops in
different projects
hello everyone and welcome to another
video on python programming in this
video we will be covering a sort of a
project side type of scenario which is
basically going to be a problem case for
you and uh
it's going to be slightly slightly
difficult slightly tricky um
but what we're going to do is we're
going to tackle a particular problem and
we're going to uh what i'm going to do
is also
show you a solution to that problem
so let's start with this so this
question that we have is um we have this
program
that we have to write where we compute
the frequency of words that exist in
some input okay
the program should output after sorting
the key alpha numerically
now
this input can be any it's basically a
block of text right so in our example we
have um for example if this was our
input right uh what we want to see is
um
an output which is basically saying that
uh the word python has appeared say well
in this example it's appeared five times
and then the word read has appeared one
time and so on and so forth like for
each of these words we want to see um
how many times have they appeared in
this particular block of text so
let's look at a particular example now
where we have done this so let's um
let's see here
so first of all i'm going to create a
dictionary so why am i creating a
dictionary is because i'm going to use
each unique word as a key and the number
of times they have appeared in a block
of text as the value to that key so
i'm going to use a sample
string which is basically this long
string that you can see here which is
stored in line so this large chunk of
text is what we're going to be analyzing
um
so how are we going to do this it's
pretty simple so
we have this now what we want to do is
um when we find what we one way of
tackling this problem that we're going
to do here is we want to
um check word by word um first of all we
want to see if it's a unique word and if
this word is
um we encountered it for the first time
then we need to store a new key in our
dictionary called frequent table or
frequency table
um and if it has already if there is a
key already with that
particular name then we just want to
increment the count or the value by one
so let's see how we do this over here
so if you can see in my this the
solution is as simple as this but if you
see what's happening it's basically what
uh what it's doing is we're splitting up
this string
using the split function what this will
do is it will split up the string at
every white space so it will take this
as one part and take this part as
another part it will create an iterable
with each word as the um each iterable
object in that
container
so
it's going to be a list of words like
python is one so on and so forth and
we're going to go one by one so we're
going to say forward in line dot split
now if this word
is if it exists in frequency table as a
key
then
what we're going to do is we're just
going to increase the count of
the value of that key by one but if it
does not exist then we're going to
actually create
a key
with the word as that unique word and
we're going to create its value um
initialize its value to one
so when we execute this
now
if we
want to once you've done this we can
sort it by the count of the words so
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a another tuple called sorted
tuples where we're going to use the
lambda function out here
to sort the
um
the dictionary
in terms of its values so what we're
going to do is we're going to take the
key
uh the key being the lambda item item
with index one index one is basically
the value um so a particular
key has a value so the word python
appears so many times the per the word
say scientist appears so many times so
we're going to check which words have
the highest number of
occurrences and we're going to sort it
in a descending order so that that is
basically what the reverse is equal to
true does so when we're going to sort
this when we're going to use a sorted
function when we say reverse true
it tells the sorting function to sort
this dictionary um this dictionary
frequency table
in terms of value
by the the descending order so whichever
word appears highest that would be the
first word in our
sorted tuple so that's what we do in
this line and once we execute this we're
also going to print so if you see the
result
of this
activity that we've done you can see
that the word machine
um
appears six times learning appears six
times then python appears 10 and so on
and so forth so we've created a sorted
tuple where the first object of the
tuple
we've created a list of sorted tuples
where the first object of the tu each
tuple is the unique word and then the
second one is the number of times it has
appeared in this um particular example
or this particular string
so yeah this was uh what the first basic
project that we have tackled if getting
your learning started is half the battle
what if you could do that for free
visit skill up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
hello everyone and welcome to another
video on python programming in this
video we will continue with what we
started in terms of our
project number one what we're going to
do is um we're going to tackle another
slightly complicated a question or a
situation um we're going to try to
arrive at a solution so in this what we
have is some sort of a robot a moving
robot which moves on a cartesian plane a
two coordinate plane
um is going to move uh in terms of up
down left and right okay and each each
time it moves up or down or left or
right it takes a certain number of steps
in that direction
integral steps of course so what we need
to do is from a starting position
whatever its starting position is which
we are going to take as 0 comma 0 in
this example
we are going to make it move to a
particular location with the commands up
down left and right followed by certain
steps
um and we're going to
ask what we're going to do is we're
going to calculate the distance between
these two points
and we're going to calculate different
types of distances so you might be
introduced to new concepts um your
distance concepts in this video as well
so
what we're going to be using for
distance calculation is the minkowski
distance and that is um we're going to
take
so the minkowski distance between two
variables is basically the absolute
difference between these two uh
variables of these two points
um
and
we take it to the power of something so
if we want to say uh calculate the
minkowski distance with um
in terms of the quadratic men cause the
distance with basically p2 so we are
going to do x i minus y i absolute
difference to the power 2 and then we're
going to take the second root of it
after summing each and every point um
so when we take p is equal to two we we
say the minkowski distance behaves like
the euclidean distance and this is
probably one of the most common
distances uh in case you've done
basic
cartesian geometry when you are asked to
find the distance between two points on
a plane um we can also take the absolute
distance where we take p is equal to one
so in this case we're just basically
summing the
absolute distances between each point um
no roots no powers nothing basically p
is equal to one and we call that the
manhattan distance so we're going to
take p is equal to one two and three in
each case and we're going to find the
distance between two points uh based on
these
measures
so
this is just a visual representation
this is basically the euclidean the
distance basically the
estimate of the value between these two
points if um
since this is a two coordinate system
whereas the manhattan distance would be
the absolute distance in terms of
if we go up and then we go right between
these two like save this first and this
was another point
um so yeah
let's uh move on to the problem
so what we're in this in this particular
example we're going to start from the
starting position 0 and 0 on a on a
graph and we are going to give the
commands of up 5 down 3 left 3 and right
2. so first of all what we want to do is
um we initialize the starting position
as zero and zero and we also just for
the sake of this example we um
initialize the end position as zero and
zero
so what we're going to do first of all
is
um let's execute this much now we have
this list list of tuples
it's we're going to call this actions
and this is the actions that we're
performing so the the each tuple
contains an action and the number of
steps in that direction so it contains
four actions up by five steps down by
three steps left by three steps right by
two steps so now we're going to iterate
over this each tuple and we're going to
get the direction first of all in this
line
for each step
uh and we're going to calculate the
number of steps it takes so for each
action it's going to first tell um it's
going to check what is the direction
which is done by this line and we're
going to find out the number of steps in
that direction which is
stored in this line
so once you've gotten this for each
action we have to uh update the end
position right
so
what happens is if you go up
by a particular direction so you are
basically changing the y y axis right
the uh the y axis so we're going to
change end position and the first index
which is basically this part of the
end position
coordinate point so we're going to say
if it's moving by up then we're going to
update
by adding uh
the y axis by the number of steps so
um and and if the direction was down
we're going to do the same thing for the
y axis but we're going to decrement it
similarly if we move left or right we're
moving the x-axis right so we take end
position in the first index so we take
the x-axis and if you're moving left
it's a negative uh it's a decrement and
if you're moving right it's an increment
so
if there's any other like action like
any other action for example that was
given here we say pass so basically the
only valid
actions that we can pass is um up down
left and right otherwise we we
just skipped that particular action so
this is what the this particular loop
will do it will update our final
position
so once we've done this
if we if i execute this
what will get stored in the end position
is basically my end position so
now that i have my starting position and
my end position um just to show you what
the end position will look like right
now
let's
just do this so if you see here after
i've moved up by five steps down by
three steps left by three steps and then
right by two steps my final end position
is minus one and two um my start
position on the other hand
was
as you remember it should be zero and
zero
it is zero and zero so now we're going
to find the distance between zero and
zero and minus one and two so we're
going to first of all create a function
called minkowski distance which which
does a basic function of just calculate
the uh
the difference between the
what do you say
the end position x coordinate and the
end position y coordinate times uh or to
the power of a root and we're basically
going to do this operation that you saw
here we're going to do this
and um
we're going to uh
we're going to
use this root variable to
specify to like p is equal to 1 2 or 3
like what p value we want to take for
this minkowski distance so once we've
done this what this function will do is
basically store
uh this much and it will wait for us to
uh it will basically wait for us to give
us a root so when we give root one it
will create these it will check the
distance between the end and starting
points um with the p value of one if we
give it two it will calculate euclidean
distance with p value two similarly for
three and we can calculate for any roots
so we're going to calculate for one two
and three roots
and we're going to see what values we
get in each case
so when root is equal to 1 i print a
statement saying minkowski distance with
root 1 is something and then root 2 is
something root 3 something let's see
what results we get
so if you see here the minkowski
distance with root 1 is actually 1.0 but
the euclidean distance between these two
points is 2.23 whereas the um
the cubic minkowski distance with
basically the with root 3 is 1.91 so you
see these three different uh distance
measures for the same distance between
two points so in this video you
basically so in this basically by doing
this activity you might must have you
will learn how to um
basically how to iterate through loops
and perform these uh distance
calculations which you'll find pretty
handy in
many activities related to data science
and machine learning
so yeah this was on the project too
hello everyone and welcome to another
video on python programming in this
video we will be continuing tackling
different
problems and problem cases in terms of a
project called project 3 where we're
going to be using regular expressions to
validate whether
certain passwords that have been entered
or do they match certain criterias or
not
so let's look into
our particular question
we have a website that requires users to
input username and password to register
now we have to write a program to check
the validity of passwords input by the
users now the criterias that the
passwords have to follow are that
there's at least one number between a
and z um and this is at least one number
between is at least one letter between a
and z and one number between zero and
nine uh the third criteria is that uh
there's at least one letter between
capital a and capital z so this first
and third point basically is saying that
there should be one lowercase letter and
there should be one uppercase letter um
now there should be at least one
character from dollar sign hash or the
at simple um it should have a minimum
length of 6 and the maximum length of
12.
so when we whatever passwords that we
enter into our um example they must be
comma separated so if we're going to
have an input uh they're going to ask us
for an input where we're going to have
to input the different passwords in a
comma separated way so let's look let's
look at um how do we tackle this so for
my example i'm going to use these
uh examples in terms of these are my
password examples if you're going to
check if these are valid passwords or
not so let's copy this first of all
and now let's import the re this import
re is basically the regular expression
module
now in this step is going to ask us to
input the passwords as you can see here
so i will just control v so since this
is comma separated what it will do is it
will split up each of these
by the comma and it will store them in a
list so it will take this as one
password this has another password this
has another password and this has
another password once i press enter
now if i want to check what's in list i
mean what's in items
what i can do is
just check over here what's in items
it's a list of whatever passwords i had
entered uh each object is separately
treated now in this list
now i'm going to create a an empty list
called value for store once i've done
that i'm going to move on to the next
step
so once i've created my list called
value what i'm going to do is now i'm
going to search and i'm going to check
for each condition using regular
expressions for whatever criteria that
we have
initially
so
if you see here what i'm going to do is
first iterate by each item in this to
check for each password now my first
check will be a basic check
for the length of the password if it's
lesser than 6 or greater than 12 then
our
our basically our password is illegal so
we can't be using this and we will just
continue and we won't check for anything
else but if it is within 6 and 12 the
length
6 and 12 then we can
continue with our check so we can do
we'll do an statement for pass which
basically moves on to this
next block
now once we've done this
what we will do is
this this first statement what this is
going to do is it's going to do an re
dot search and re dot search as you know
is going to look for at least one
instance of um
a letter occurring between
a and z so this ire.search
followed by this now this is the regular
expression that we have passed and what
this does this is basically the square
in the square brackets we're looking for
anything between
a and z in terms of small letters so if
um this is if this condition is not met
then again we continue and we leave this
uh particular search because one of our
criterias is not met
all right but if it is met then this if
not statement will not uh like we won't
enter this block and we can move on to
the next check
so
now now we move to l if not now again
we're using if not statement so this is
basically checking for uh a negative
case so any time one of these cases have
been met it basically means that our
password has been invalid because these
conditions are not being met so we're
trying to eliminate all uh
conditions all of these conditions so
that we get a valid password so again we
move on to the next statement which is
basically going to do the search for
numbers once again if we find a case
a password without any numbers we
continue and we don't
um
check this password no more because we
already know it's a
an illegal password now next check will
be for capital letters a to z
and the next check again will be for
these particular symbols the dollar the
hash and the at one of these three
symbols
finally we have a a search for
uh we're gonna search for a white space
character so if we actually do find a
white space character in our password um
that's an illegal password and we're not
going to continue checking for those
cases
so
um so this is basically all our cases uh
lowercase letters
numbers capital letters these one of
these three symbols and the existence of
a white space so once we've done all
these checks
if if none of these have been passed we
move on to this else statement where we
just pass and uh what we can do is we
append the value
we append the value to uh we we append p
to the uh
the i the list called value
so basically what happens is um just to
go through it again
if this condition is not met
and this condition is not met this is
not met this is not meant this is not
met and if this is
also not met
then we're fine so basically as long as
we have small letters as long as we have
a number as long as we have a capital
letter as long as we have one of these
three symbols and as long as we don't
have
any uh white space characters we can
append e to this otherwise it will
continue and it will break out of this
for loop completely that's what the
continued thing the continue statement
at the end of each of these blocks
checks um anytime this condition is met
this if not condition is met then we
break through we break through this
whole for loop and we don't append p to
the value but uh if we actually get to
this stage then what we can do is simply
append
p to value
now finally what we are going to do is
we are going to print out all the valid
um all the valid passwords so just by a
quick look you can see here
um
this is a valid password right so let's
execute this and let's see uh
what we get if you see here we only get
one valid password and let's look at why
um some of these did not turn out to be
valid so if you look here all of the
conditions are met it has a capital
letter it has a small letter it has at
least one number and it has one of the
symbols either dollar sign or the hash
sign or the add sign
in this case we have two white spaces
one over here and one over here so this
is an illegal password similarly in this
case also we have an illegal password
because it begins with a space
in this case it's the same thing we
begin with the space and also it does
not have any of those uh symbols that we
were looking for the dollar or the hash
or the ad so again so these three are
illegal passwords and they do not get
appended to value however this does get
appended to value and that's why we get
the result for only one password which
is the only legal password and with that
we come to the end of this full course
