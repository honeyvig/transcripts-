hey everyone welcome back to another
episode of zen in the art of cooking my
name is matt and today we're going to be
cooking the most delicious butter
chicken you've ever had in your life
let's get started first of all start
with a coffee out of your zen in the art
of trading mug
all right for this we're going to need
500 grams of tomato
small onion a carrot
and a couple of garlic cloves we're also
going to need three tablespoons of sugar
1 tablespoon
of chili powder preferably kashmiri
chili powder one teaspoon of kasuri
methi also known as fenugreek powder and
also about one heaped teaspoon of garam
masala and then finally we're also going
to need about 60 grams
of cashew nuts or about one handful all
right so before we begin cutting up the
veggies i like to start with the chicken
because we're going to marinate it in
some garlic ginger and chili powder now
we want to cut this chicken up into
bite-sized pieces so a couple of square
inches each but before we do that we
need to appease the cat gods by giving
them chicken sacrifice so i cut off a
little bit here cut that in half
and then
come on
i give some
to hunter first
and then a little bit fairer
now we can safely proceed with cutting
the chicken now i'm using chicken
breasts here but you could use chicken
thigh if you prefer and if you're a
vegetarian then just throw in your
favorite veggies at the very end there
we go now we just want to dump all of
this chicken
into a big bowl now i'm using two
chicken breasts or about 500 grams of
chicken all right now we want to season
the chicken with about one teaspoon of
salt about a tablespoon of chili powder
a tablespoon of ginger paste
and a tablespoon of garlic paste
and then give that a good mix
all right now throw that in the fridge
while we sort out our vegetables
now we're going to blend all of our
vegetables once they're done cooking
into a sauce so we're fine to roughly
chop these
all right so now we want to start
cooking our vegetables throw the heat on
high put in about a tablespoon of ghee
all right now we want to throw in our
onion garlic and carrot
and just cook this down for about two or
three minutes until the onion starts to
soften and then since this is butter
chicken we're going to throw in about 50
60 grams of butter
now we're not trying to brown this onion
and garlic we're just trying to soften
it it shouldn't take long all right once
the butter has melted in goes our tomato
and then we also throw in
our cashew nuts
once that's mixed in you want to throw
in about a cup of chicken stock
or just a cup of water if you're a
vegetarian now we also want to throw in
a tablespoon of garlic paste
then we want to put in our jesus bird
relax then we want to put in
our sugar
our chili powder
the garam masala
and the fenugreek powder
and a couple of pinches of salt
and then just mix that through
smells bloody delicious
now we just want to let this simmer for
about 15-20 minutes until everything's
soft because then we're going to blend
it
all right that looks about ready to me
i'm going to turn the heat off and then
we are going to blend this all right
once that cools down it's time to blend
it now you can use a hand blender
if you want to but in my experience it
makes the mother of all messes so
i'm going to use
a normal blender so now
you want to carefully
pour this into your blender
there we go
hardly any mess
now don't wash this yet
because
we are still using it
and now we want to blend this into a
fine paste or sauce
perfect all right now we want to heat up
our pot again so
turn on the
correct
gas
and if your gas clicker stops working
just use a lighter
but be very careful don't explode your
house so now we are going to cook our
chicken so let the chicken sit out of
the fridge for a couple minutes while
this heats up and throw in about
two teaspoons of ghee or butter and a
little drizzle of olive oil
or any other oil all right once your oil
is nice and hot you want to carefully
dump in your chicken
and we just want to
brown this a little bit
be careful not to burn the seasoning
damn that smells good
now if you're vegetarian just skip this
step and throw in your veggies at the
very end and if you're vegan probably
you shouldn't be eating butter chicken
anyway the clue is in the name now the
sauce is already cooked so once the
chicken's done we're finished so if you
have a thermometer you can give it a
stab check if it's close to 75 degrees
celsius or whatever that is in american
temperatures and this is nowhere close
so it needs another few minutes
otherwise just leave it in for 20
minutes or so you can always pour your
sauce in and simmer it at the end as
well now don't stir this too often but
make sure it's not burning
all right that's close enough we can now
put our sauce in
i like to strain the sauce to get all of
the skin of the tomatoes and the carrot
and all of that out of the butter
chicken but that's completely optional
however if you want your butter chicken
to be silky smooth then this is the way
to go sometimes there'll be some caught
in the blender i like to put a little
bit of water in there to get that out
this will take a little while to strain
but it's well worth it so be patient you
might need to help it along with a
wooden stick or a metal instrument all
right that'll do all this left in there
is mostly skin and seeds from the
tomatoes but don't forget to scrape the
bottom off of your strainer because
there's some perfectly good sauce there
as well all right now just give that a
mix
and let it simmer for a little while
probably another five ten minutes
on low
damn i don't have any cooking cream i'm
gonna have to go to shops then you need
to quickly run down to the shops because
you forgot to buy some cooking cream
and take a moment to marvel at all the
toilet paper
and then preemptively grab a bag just in
case there's another lockdown soon all
right now we're pretty much done the
last thing i like to do is crack in just
a little bit of pepper
and about one tablespoon of cooking
cream and then just stir that in and if
you're wondering yes i did get some
strange looks walking out of the shops
with nothing but a bottle of cooking
cream and a massive bag of toilet paper
and we're done all that's left to do is
make some rice and serve it up although
maybe taste a little bit first make sure
it doesn't need any more salt or
seasoning according to your tastes now
for the rice i'm going to use my crock
pot slow pressure cooker thing but if
you don't have one of those just do it
however you would normally do rice and
just follow along with the ingredients i
put in there so i'm going to start with
about one cup of long grain basmati rice
but you can really use any rice you like
and then about one cup of chicken stock
and then about half a cup of water so
one and a half cups of liquid to your
one cup of rice again if you're a
vegetarian i don't know why you're still
watching this video but just use one and
a half cups of water next up we want a
little bit of salt
not too much just a pinch and then a
pinch of
turmeric it's a little bit more than a
pinch but that's because i slipped and
then if you have it a nice big pinch of
one of the most expensive herbs in the
world saffron but if you don't have
saffron just use a little bit extra
turmeric and then
put your rice on for however long your
rice takes to cook you can find the
right button
there we go all right our rice should be
done
perfect all right all that's left to do
is plate it up
garnish it with about a teaspoon or
drizzle of cooking cream
and a sprinkle of chopped coriander
unless coriander tastes like soap to you
in which case just use parsley and
we're done
now i know this is an april fool's joke
but this is some of the best butter
chicken i've ever had give it a try if
you don't like it you can have your
money back
