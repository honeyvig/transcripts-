hi everyone this is dr saiti team mds
conquer
so right now we are going to have a
quick revision
of your histology specimens from your
oral pathology
okay so all the important diseases and
the respective histological features i
am going to discuss now
and these astrology pictures are
directly taken from your schaefer text
book of oral pathology
so what i want to suggest is give a good
glance to the pictures that have posted
and also
read out the description that is given
below okay so
as the from oral pathology the histology
aspect is quite important so i have
discussed almost all the important
diseases
from your oral pathology and their
unique
histological presentation okay so let's
start with the first one so if you see
this is a potentially malignant disease
wherein the advanced stage has shown
fibrosis of the lamina proper as well as
a submucosa so where do we see this
fibrosis
in a potentially malignant disease so
it's quite obvious it as a oral
submucosal fibrosis okay so there's a
fibrosis of the lamina propane submucosa
so that is oral submucosal fibrosis and
now here you can see many
malignant melanocytes that is invading
the underlying connective tissue
so this is nothing but a vertical growth
phase which is characterized by the
malignant melanocytes
invading the underlying connective
tissue seen with the malignant
melanoma okay so this is seen with
malignant
melanoma okay next
here if you see this dilated thin walled
vessels
okay so that is stimulating a stag horn
and that is seen associated with
hemangio pericytoma
so wherever you see this unique names
that is being given for a
particular feature either it could be
clinical or a
histological or radiographical so or a
radiographical
presentation just grab them out ok so
here if you see there is a staghorn
appearance
so that is because of dilated thin
walled vessels which is seen with
hemangio pericytoma
next having sarcomas so here you can see
small round blue cell tumors his
logically
and also you can see multiple mitotic
figures in the field
okay small small round blue cells you
can see right so that is
seen with ebbing sarcoma histologically
so do note this as well
next here there is a neoplastic spindle
cells of osteosarcoma that is being
embedded in the matrix
of osteoid that is tumor which is being
produced by these cells so this is
osteoid cells whereas
you can see numerous neoplastic spindle
cells which is embedded in the matrix of
osteoid
and next again a unique feature starry
sky appearance seen with
buckets lymphoma so here you can see
it's a starry sky
appearance okay so that is a unique
feature of the
burkitt's lymphoma next
read steinberg cell again a unique
feature of the hodgkin's disease
so wherein you can see cells with large
pale nuclei containing purple nucleoli
okay so purple nucleoli will be there
and this is again an indicative of
hodgkin's
disease next multiple myeloma so here if
you see
in the lower lower low power mode
there's abnormal plasma cells and in the
medium power mode
these plasma cells a little similar to
that of the normal plasma cells but
they're poorly differentiated
and you can see the benz zone proteins
the light chains in the urine as well so
this point is given here
okay and there is a
in the in the third picture if you see
this is the smear of
a bone marrow aspirate wherein you can
see numerous plasma cells with eccentric
nuclei and perinuclear halo of clear
cytoplasm so you can see
eccentric nuclei with a perinuclea halo
of clearer cytoplasm so all these are
the pictures related to the multiple
myeloma and obviously the last picture
being the punched out lesions in the
skull
so this is a clear cut picture of
multiple myeloma
okay so the plasma cells right so it is
a disorder related to the plasma cell so
you can see the abnormal plasma cells
and that is clearly appreciated his
logically so this description which is
given here
do read it out next
pleomorphic adenomas so there will be
cells
neoplastic cells which are arranged in
ducts which are arranged in sheets which
are arranged in islands so there will be
mixed appearance
okay so and also fuel cells have
vacuolar
degeneration and are chondroitin
appearance so this picture
is related to the pleomorphic adenoma so
being the most common
benign tumor of the salivary glands so
therein this will be arranged in ductile
sheets as well as island so you can see
this picture
you like many appearances of the cells
are there the neoplastic cells how they
are arranged so that is related to
cleomorphic aroma so this mixed
appearance so it's related to
pleomorphic
adenoma what instrument very very
important again so it is an exclusively
occurs in the
parotid gland being the benign tumor
occurring in the parotid land
and here there will be cystic spaces
which are filled with homogeneous fluid
and it is circumscribed by double rows
of oncocites
having a stroma which is infiltrated by
the lymphoid tissue
so infiltration with a lymphoid tissue
in a benign
tumor of the parotid gland then you have
to go for
what in stoma okay so there's double row
of oncocites
having a stroma infiltrated with a
lymphoid tissue
underline and note it out and this is a
his logical picture related to what in
stoma
next the party wall appearance seen with
the canalicular adenoma wherein the
tumors
cells are the tumor shows the rows of
cells which are arranged parallelly
okay and they form long lumina having a
canalicular appearance so this is
regarding the
canalicular adenoma giving this party
wall
appearance okay next
is a muco epidermoid carcinoma so this
line
if you see there are large pale mucous
secreting cells that typically surround
large or small cystic spaces and sheets
of
epidermoid cells so they are large pale
mucus secreting cells
with typically surround small cystic
spaces and sheets of epidermis
so they are mucous cells and epidermid
cells so it is muco epidermoid
okay so it is a classic picture of the
mucopidamoid carcinoma
next again coming to the cysts so if you
see the tomstone appearance or the
picket phenoms appearance and there is
about
eight to ten layers thick
lining of the epithelium and it is
palisaded
pattern okay so this is again with the
okc
right so it is seen with okc so very
important
his logical pitch of okc just grab it
out
next again very very important which i
feel
which you must have missed out is the
his logical picture of the radicular or
the periapical cyst
okay here if you see the cyst is filled
with an isophilic coagulant containing a
slit like spaces which contain the
cholesterol
okay so the slit like spaces as you can
see that contains the cholesterol
and b if you see there are peculiar
shaped structures which are is no
phyllite and they
are described as lady hair pin shaped
okay so the ladies hair pin shaped which
you can see here
so that is again with radicular cyst
so this is a very unique feature related
to the radical assist
so do note it out and
next is amyloblastoma so the various
types of amyloblastoma being the
follicular plexi form
and the c so the d one is a basal cell
and the e is acanthomates and f
is granular actually it is quite
difficult
at this stage to identify the subtypes
of amyloblastoma but just
have a look of this and if you are aware
of these logical features
then you can answer but these are the
subtypes so just give a glance to it
okay
next uh apple red birefrigence which is
seen in the congo red stain and that is
seen with ceot
or the pinball tumor so apple red
birefrigence you can see in the
description
and also the picture clearly shows it so
under eye under a polarized microscope
or a light source you can see this apple
red
color by refrigerants of the amyloid so
there is amyloid which gives this apple
green color by refrigerants okay so
which is seen with the
co2 or the pinball tumor next the coc
wherein you can see sheets of gauched
cells okay so you can see the ceased
of ghost cells as that is shown in the
picture so the sheets of ghost cells and
also
the lining epithelium is palisaded
hyperchromatic columnar nuclei
and uh stilate reticulum like area and
the sheets of go cells are there with
the
coc and dentygonic go cell tumors you
can see there is aggregates of ghost
cells
in association with the organogenic
epithelium so as you can see here there
are many
aggregates of the go cells that are seen
with the
genic ghost cell tumor so just give a
glance to this
and now the aolai appearance which is
seen with the cytomegalo
virus so the arrow points show typical
inclusion body and aolai appearance
which is seen with the
cytomegalo virus and this is related to
osteogenesis imperfecta
what i want to suggest is just read out
the description that is given below
okay so here the bony cortex is thin and
porous
and there is a trabecular which is thin
delicate and widely separated and many
osteoblasts and osteocytes are present
but the formation and organization of
the osteoarthritis obviously it is not
that easy to note all these features in
a histology slide
but the description if it is given like
this then you can go for osteogenesis
imperfecta okay so there is less bone
matrix
which is less than normal but most of it
again is oven and non
lamellar bone with collagen fibers of
small size and random distribution
okay so this is regarding osteogenesis
imperfecta so do read
out the description that is given below
okay
next the chinese letter pattern so where
you can you can see with the fibrous
dysplasia so that is pretty clear the
chinese letter pattern seen with fibrous
dysplasia
and next cherubism wherein you can see
multinucleated jain cells cherubism
being a
multinucleated lesion it's a jain cell
lesion so there will be muddling
nucleated chain cells so here
in the description you can see the last
description
which reveals a cellular fibrous mass
with interspersed
multinucleated jain cells so that is
regarding cherubism so if they give
a clinical picture of a child having a
little bilateral presentation of the
expansion of the jaws okay and they give
a radiographic presentation like this
and if histology
says that there is multinucleated gene
cells which are interspersed
within the cellular fibrous mass then
you have to go for
cherobisin okay and next here it is
of pernicious anemia wherein you can see
macrocytosis and
polykilocytosis okay so this is
regarding the
pernicious anemia so the variation in
size of erythrocytes is quite obvious so
the size of erythrocytes is variation is
there
so that is regarding the pernicious
anemia and
the characteristic peer-shaped or
tear-shaped erythrocytes are present so
in addition
so this is a bit underline to be
underlined point
so these are the diagram based questions
so at times
the examiners want to pill out the
lines which are given below the diagram
from your textbooks
okay so those are the areas which we
usually means
we will not give that good uh like i
mean we will not have that good idea
right
so it will just turn over the pages and
we will not look at the
description that is given below the
diagrams but there are features or
characteristic features which are given
below the diagram so for example here
you can see the peer shape or ta shaped
erythrocytes
so that is seen with this picture of a
pernicious anemia okay so you even
those areas are quite important so
that's regarding this
and now if you see these are sickle
shaped erythrocytes so
quite obvious sickle cell anemia so
sickle shaped erythrocytes you can see
okay so that is with sickle cell anemia
okay
next infectious mononucleosis so you can
see
a peripheral smear that exhibits
atypical lymphocytes
with indented nuclei okay so that is
illustrated here so there is
numerous atypical living foresights that
is seen so it is seen with infectious
mononucleosis and in a if you see the
picture of a person
uh which where there is severe cervical
lymphadenopathy
right so there is severe cervical
infernopathy as you can see
and the histology shows atypical
lymphocytes
so that goes in favor of infectious
mononucleosis
next oral icon plan is so here there is
a basilar degeneration that you can
see in picture a okay and these are the
various other histological pictures so
do
read out the description given below and
one of the classics logical feature we
know it is saw tooth ready pegs again
that is seen with the
plan is next test tube like ready pegs
if you see that
is seen with psoriasis okay so here also
you can see test tube like gratipex
so that is seen with psoriasis
okay next this is again with the
pemphigus so wherein you can see
suprablacila cleavage
okay suprablacella cleavage you can see
and there are numerous giant cells so
giant cells not only with pemphigus
vulgaris seen with herpless simplex and
herpes joster
as well okay so their giant cells but
here in pemphigus vulgaris you can see
the supra basilar
cleavage okay so supra basilar cleavage
with
giant cells okay so this is regarding
the pemphigus vulgaris
and immunofluorescence gives a fishnet
appearance
okay so very important to do read out
the the things that is given here so
this is being the early stage
wherein supra basically split will be
there with numerous jain cells okay
and in bullet stage there will be
acantholysis
with occasional leukocytes in the
bullets fluid okay so the b denotes the
bullets phase and this is a
early stage of vesiculation with supra
basilar cleavage or suple blissela split
with acantholysis and
numerous giant cells so this is
regarding pemphigus vulgaris
now circuit racial pemphigoid here there
is sub-epidermal in pemphigus while
there is supra
whereas in pemphigoid especially in the
sacrificial as given here it is
sub-epidermal okay so that is regarding
the circuitry shell pemphigoid
okay so these are the few his logical
features a few important diseases which
i have covered so give a good glance to
all the pictures that have posted
and do read out the description given
below each and every picture and
wherever you find a unique feature
or a unique name in respect to that
particular picture again note it out
okay
so all the best for your exam so this
quick revision i feel it
could be important for you so don't miss
any of it okay
thank you
