that's a basic introduction of mine okay
so
so first of all
big congratulations to each and every
one of you for the people who are done
with the final year exams and for the
people whose results are out and they
have started the internship this is the
greatest achievement
as of now this is going to be the
greatest achievement and I'm very very
happy for your extraordinary performance
at a BDS level and you are intense now
you have a doctor tag in front of you
but you need to enter into the society
with lots of confidence and everything
that you will learn through this process
till this date as a final year the game
plan is totally different okay so what
is The Game Plan
because I want you to answer this this
is an interactive session so what is
real success and what is real
achievement in a final year for a
finally a student what is the real
success and what is what is the real
achievement
pradeep is telling to pass to pass the
final year
come on I want your answers because I
want
you to know what is the reality actually
to clear the final year
is a success to clear the final year is
a achievement or to get a first class 65
percent as ever
or to to crack a distinction or to be a
college topper or a university topper
okay so this is what the basic uh
thing that most of us are targetful okay
right
so okay we are done with internship so
now what is the real success and what is
the real achievement in an internship
what is a real internship what you want
to achieve internship what is basically
success in an internship called us
foreign
doing more more patients getting
exposure to more patients
handling the cases
handling the cases exposure to more
patients any any other any other uh
gain confidence to handle the patients
yes of course right navya
yes any any other thing you have in your
mind because the thought process is
going to vary from Individual to
individual
you you're thinking may be different my
thinking may be different so it varies
from college to college it varies from
state to state it varies from People to
People okay right so I agree so
internship is a phase where uh you need
to learn how to handle the patient
without any help basically till finally
here you have your uh like Co aspirants
helping you co pgs in the department
helps your staff in the department helps
you so different people are going to
help you out but in internship you're
going to come out after internship so
you need to handle the situation by your
own and more clinical exposure or if
you're reading for entrance uh keep a
good Target
yes this is this is a wonderful Sharma
you are absolutely right you should know
in internship you should know which
department or which subject you really
love so that you can choose the
particular subject in the PG
having a Passion or liking towards a
particular subject is different because
if you can ask me in 2012 2013 so I'm
going to tell what is your favorite
subject what is your favorite Department
I load for oral pathology but that's not
a clinical department so I cannot tell
that because why am why I have that
fantasy towards oral path on our oral
medicine two departments is I allow the
department staff who over there so that
is a reason why I have that fantasy
towards the department but if you come
into the reality so you cannot do uh or
I mean like they're they're not clinical
subjects basically right so
so the ideology what I have developed I
have my passion develops to a particular
department or an internship is more
because of the exposure or because I'm
knowing the things even if you start
preparing for entrance examinations or
for any sort of examinations as you go
depth oriented reading then you will get
to know what fantasy or what uh
like uh I mean like what what do you
really love what you are really good at
because what you really good at what you
have fantasy so that's going to make you
and you you're going to have passion
towards particular things right so right
absolutely right wonderful your answers
thought process is extraordinary
so what is the real success and what is
a real achievement in PG
you have joined PG prepared well got a
good rank selected your best department
and what is going to be success in your
PG life
so PG lives again we have a different
goals okay most of you are not pgs
so PG life we have a different set of
goals where we have to achieve right you
will have definitely you'll have some
Goods followed by post PG you may open a
clinic or you may work as a as a
lecturer or a reader or something like
in a college or you are going to work
under someone you are going to work
under some corporate company dental
dental offices you have many other
things and you have a particular role
over there and you have some goals over
there in the life so my prospective is
okay so what is success what is a real
achievement
is always you need to get upgraded you
need to get upgraded from one level to
other level I hope you remember 11th and
12th standard when once you're preparing
for the entrance examination to enter
into this mbbs or BDS or something so
you are writing the same exam after
which you are writing BDS first year
after which you are writing BDS second
year third year fourth year now jumped
into
an internship program where you are
going to prepare for an entrance or
prepare for your goals followed by every
level of life
requires an upgrading so success is
something which is not static it is
always Dynamic okay today my my Target
today my target or my success is to
motivate you
okay yesterday when I was taking a class
for your seniors okay my target is to
make them ready for the exam day before
yesterday I was having an interaction
with your super seniors for their
counseling I was talking to them so my
target yesterday was different what is
my target they have to get allocated
with the good seats so in three or four
days or three or four weeks I have a
different thought process of success so
Success is Not static it's going to vary
it's going to be dynamic so Dentistry
requires a dynamic success success at
different levels success in different
areas success in different directions
and do you accept this or not
do they accept this Success is Not
static it varies from Individual to
individual it varies from time to time
it varies from place to place it varies
everywhere right so do you agree right
yes absolutely true the best example I
can give you is what is the best mobile
as of now available in the entire world
what is the best mobile
as of now available in the entire world
best mobile
or else you can you can give attack best
mobile company
what is the best best mobile company yes
absolutely right
absolutely right everyone
sakshi right you're right
and this is what the example is iPhone
every year they are going to launch a
new series why they want to launch a new
series because they want to get upgraded
this is the best mobile as of now
available in the market best mobile
company with crores cross of Revenue
generation but every year they come out
with a new thing they launch a new thing
they upgrade themselves so life requires
upgrading Dentistry requires upgrading
everything requires upgrading whether
you're a dentist or whether you want to
go out of the field it's okay but you
require upgrading a simple exam I can
tell you okay so probably in 2012 2013
when I was an intern or when I was a
finally a student so the most common
registrator material that we do in our
department is what can you guess what is
the most common registration that we do
in the Departments
2012 10 years back most common
registration
yes absolutely right amalgam foreign
that is being done
now what your what is the most common
registration that they are doing now we
are selling composite
pradeep is telling composite
Lakshmi is telling composite
right now now every one of us are doing
composite okay maybe right so maybe
probably 10 years from now
2013-33 okay 2013 to 33 maybe you will
be at a different level in dentistry
composite may get replaced by some
extraordinary material to there are
chances there are chances okay it can be
replaced by an extraordinary material so
what is happening here we are upgrading
we are upgrading the dental knowledge we
are upgrading the dental practice we are
upgrading everything right so life
always requires upgrading so my question
for you interns the upcoming dentists
the upcoming future of the Dentistry
probably as told you right so 10 years
from now
2032 to 2033 10 years from now you're an
intern now after 10 years as an intern
so you are going to be the future you
are going to be the star you are going
to be the staff you are going to open
clinics you're going to work clinics
you're going to operate the patients and
most of the Dentistry will be run by you
probably within the next five to ten
years
so the future of Dentistry so I'm asking
how you are planning to upgrade yourself
how you are planning to upgrade
yourselves how you are planning to
motivate yourself
okay so this session is mainly on that
upgrading what to be done to upgrade
yourself what is going around you what
is going to be your future so this is
what I'm going to talk about
are you riding I want you to back to
okay 17 now it is 72 or 75 plus okay
right a decent figure to my expectations
right cello we'll start
so most of the like most of the Indian
dentists what I see like probably this
is the Ninth Batch of MDS conquer and I
have trained around like uh 12 000 to 13
000 12 000 to 13 000 uh dentists
particularly and these twelve thousand
to thirty thousand more than sixty to
seventy percent is our interns okay so I
know the mindset of intents because I
interact talk with interns every day I
interact with interns every day I talk
with the interns online offline
everywhere I move I I came to Bhopal uh
I came to many other places now I'm
planning to come visit nashik okay
because I need to meet your seniors
probably once uh like probably in
November I'm planning to come to nashik
and many other places in Maharashtra
also because I love to interact I I
should I should know what is happening
with you then only I can find a solution
to help you out okay so the problem here
with most of us are so whenever you see
yes I'm upgrading but it never goes
filled never goes 100 percentage it is
always upgrading okay so there will be
always breaks some struggles and
everything happens so I'm going to tell
you what are the mistakes that an intent
should not do to be successful everyone
you can open uh YouTube and you can see
so many so many videos Everyone are
uploading videos that's a different
story so everyone will tell you how to
be successful but I'm going to tell what
things you should not do so that you can
be successful there are few things that
you should never do okay you should
never do in your entire life of
Dentistry or in your entire life as a
professional with a professional attack
you should never do such things I'm
going to tell you
so my first question for all of you
how are you feeling about Dentistry now
as an intern how are you feeling about
Dentistry I have given different types
of Smileys okay okay so what do you feel
about Dentistry as of now
okay what you are feeling about
Dentistry before the session okay yes
very nice excited excited and proud yes
extraordinary these are the
extraordinary things I'm able to see for
the first time excited
yes of course you should be confused
you should be confused okay you should
be confused is something very common
okay right so Dentistry is something
like which is very very vast okay so
first of all you should know what you
are good at you should know what you
want to do you should know what is what
is going to make you happy okay so
before that my kind suggestion for all
of you okay so whatever you are okay
wherever you are whatever profession you
are going to do so don't insult your
profession
because your respects belongs to your
profession what you are is your respect
if you give respect to your profession
then people will automatically respect
you but if you insult your profession in
front of others then don't expect
respect in response so this is what I
want to start with I have been seeing so
many so many of my friends so many of my
students so many of my juniors okay so
first of all I don't know why they
insert our profession I don't want
anyone to insult our profession okay so
your now you are a dentist
now you are a dentist you may die as a
dentist so Dentistry is the greatest
Divine thing for you do you accept this
or not you have to feel proud that you
are a dentist
because it's our profession I'm not
comparing with any other profession
why the best example I was traveling
long back like two years or three years
back in an auto
and Ottawa a lot of Allah is very proud
about his profession okay in the auto
he has kept some beautiful lights he has
kept some beautiful songs he has kept
some beautiful flowers okay and he is
making or he's taking he's taking care
of his otter Auto in any very most and a
decent heiseness hygienic way when an
auto Allah is taking his Auto in such a
care and how you have to take care of
your profession
called as Dentistry
am I audible right guys
I'm audible to you
yes right so first of all I want every
one of you
stay strong give respect to the
provision so once you start respecting
your profession automatically it
reciprocates well
what is Dentistry now in India is what
the dentists have done
I'm not going to talk whether it is a
good or bad
what how the Dentistry is there in India
is what we have done
how it how a profession is there is what
they have done okay so the this is
better that is bad this is good and
everything is just a comparison so I'm
not here to compare because if I start
comparing so there's no point okay your
life is very unique you are very unique
as an individual no one can copy paste
you no one can resemble you so there's
no point okay Virat Kohli and I born in
the same week in the same year in the
same month okay there's no point of
comparing me with Virat Kohli because I
am unique to myself and I love myself
more so I don't want to compare with any
other individual
comparison is nonsense okay but
giving respect to what you are doing is
the most important thing that any
individual can do and this I have seen
in ottawala that I have seen in
rickshawal I have seen in someone who is
selling who is a who is a vegetable
vendor they're very respectful there to
their professions for what they are
doing for their family or for themselves
why can't a dentist
so the First Quality that an intern has
to develop is you have to feel proud of
your provision you have to respect your
profession and you have to find the best
way to sort out something better in your
profession so that once you're doing
better in dentistry you grow and
Dentistry will grow if for example like
uh this year some 2000 uh you have you
have a bulk of dentists who are coming
out into the market okay some 50 000
dentists are coming into the market if
all 50 000 dentists are doing
extraordinary Dentistry how the
Dentistry will be in the next five years
so Dentistry will get upgraded so
Dentistry is far better in many many
other developed countries you take USA
the industry is utmost respectable
proficient you take UK Dentistry so
respectable proficient you take
Australia you take New Zealand you take
many many many other countries where
Dentistry is really doing extraordinary
why the dentists are doing extraordinary
the dentists are doing extraordinary so
it become an extraordinary industry but
if you talk about India only 10 to 15
percentage of dentists are doing
extraordinary I'm not blaming the entire
Dentistry I am monitoring the Dentistry
I'm talking with the dentist I'm I'm
interacting with the dentist so I can
see 10 to 15 percentage of dentists not
all the dentists 10 to 15 percentage of
dentists are doing really extraordinary
industry similar to other developed
countries so what I can tell you is
Dentistry is not developed in India no
that's a wrong statement dentist is
developed in India but it is developed
to a certain extent only to a certain
places only to a certain clinics only to
a certain dentist
I hope my my my wordings and my talk is
very very clear right so I hope you got
what I mean
so I have been interacting with so many
big big people they simply said
Dentistry is not developed in India it's
developed in U.S no it is developed but
it is limited to your particular places
it is limited to your particular people
it's limited to your particular Zone
that's what I mean okay so you need to
find out you need to find out how to
make it move to the next level how a
dentist Dentistry can move to the next
level is the dentist they have to do
something only when dentists started
doing something Dentistry will do next
level right so do you agree for this
statement or not intense you are going
to be the next five years you will
finish your pgs you're going to come
into the market and you are going to be
the future so that is the reason why so
you need to push yourself from the day
one so that you can reach these big big
goals in the future
if you're clear with what I have
discussed till the point I'll be moving
to the next very very utmost important
topic of Twitter
okay hello so what are the biggest thing
uh what I have learned is I have learned
from my mistakes okay so I'll be ready
to hear my uh story story as an intern
how my internship has started because I
have learned so many things okay because
I have wasted ways basically I have
wasted so many so much of my time two
three years I have wasted so I have
learned so many things so I'm going to
share my story so it's going to be a bit
funny okay so please do enjoy my story
okay it has so many twists like your
baahubali part one and part I hope you
have seen bahubali right so you have
seen baahubali you have seen kgf okay I
have seen many many movies with lots of
twists so my story is filled with lots
of twists so first of all my story is a
very very cool story I'm a good student
at a ug level so BDS level I'm an
extraordinary student among my batch so
I read get good scores
I got a distinction in the final year
too
so the results were out so the finally
result similarly uh the final result was
out I got a distinction okay so then
what I have done my goals are very very
simple I have started my PG preparation
so I have started my PG preparation I
was taught
I started my PG prep so I I was
interacted with my seniors and my super
seniors who got good ranks who settled
well so I started my PC preparation like
similarly most of you have already
joined and started the proceedings so so
I have started my PC preparation so once
you are preparing in the college
probably in the library probably in the
department what is going to happen so in
the next few days one month or two
months so this is going to happen for
you okay so everyone keep their eye on
you
everyone is going to see you once once
someone is doing good they'll keep an
eye on you okay so your junior senior
species teachers keep an eye on you so
monitoring will be more so everyone are
going to monitor you so many eyes on you
so people once they have ice what they
do they give suggestions
so I got so many so many suggestions now
basically I have started with a plan a
that is my PC preparation
okay but as many people are seeing that
I'm reading I'm working hard I'm sitting
dedicatedly so what I have got my plan B
I have got my plan see
I got so many plans okay so I was
confused okay I was confused okay so one
of my senior told
okay uh why can't you join a clinic
why can't you join a clinic so then I
got a call letter from my one of the
clinic I went for there I went for an
interview so I got selected in an
interview so then I quitted my
preparation
quitted my prep and I have started the
clinical work I have worked on nothing
so why I have quitted my preparation I
don't have answer till my senior told I
quitted why I have started my
preparation my senior told I have
started why I have joined a clinic my
senior told I have joined do I agree for
this this is what happened with me
so as I am going Clinic okay so it's
almost like two to three months done
two to three months or over so then I
got I got I met so many staff over there
who who settled at a very high level
so then one of my staff told srikant guy
dude you are extraordinary you're
extraordinary your knowledge is
extraordinary you're hard working you're
smart Okay so such candidate has to move
to USA not in India
so he has motivated one teacher of mine
who is to work in the cleaning has
motivated me to go to usca to go to USA
so now my plans again has changed
confusion plan a plan B plan C
so finally I opened the Google
and I was searching about Dentistry so I
got so many beautiful photographs
related to the USA so I thought of going
for USC
so first I started preparation
for neat then I pushed myself to a
clinic where I have worked for six to
six to eight months then I got motivated
for the plan of USA so I have cleared uh
GRE I have cleared TOEFL I got an
admission Okay so so what happened after
three months I got a Clarity before like
probably within three months I'm flying
off I got a Clarity that okay my
financial situations were not clear
not clear not great to support the U.S
demands okay because I have never done a
groundwork by myself I was just
following my senior first of all I
followed my senior my senior told to
prepare for PG then there is one more
senior came into the ground he told me
to join a clinic then a clinician who is
a teacher of mine has suggested me to go
to USA I have never done a groundwork
so now
all these are gone USA and everything so
finally I was sitting with my teacher
and I was started asking so he asked me
how many clinics are there in your
hometown
ask me a simple question how many
clinics are there in your hometown I
said only one Clinic sir
then he told me to open a clinic in my
hometown your clinical work is reasoned
enough you can open a clinic in your
hometown
so then again my plans has changed
confusion confusion so Mona most of us
have started the session like how we are
feeling about Dentistry yes most of you
have answered confusion so I am in a
state of confusion so again my plan a
plan B plan C has changed so finally I
went to the home
I was sitting with my father I was
talking with my father I told my father
I need some two to three lakhs so I can
open a clinic because we have a good
good uh good commercial space in our
hometown okay so I can open a clinic in
my commercial space itself so this is
all the positive things what I have
discussed with my teacher and I have
implemented in the home so after a few
days my father has called me up and told
me srikant I cannot adjust two to three
lakhs as of now
my father said no I can't
if you want you can take the commercial
space but two to three lakhs for a small
single chair Clinic is not going to be
possible my son I'm sorry for that so
this was after two to three months of
discussion with my father so now again
my plans has changed
KBC
right so I was so depressed so
disappointed where I have started my
preparation then I joined a clinic then
I thought of going for U.S and wasted
six months then I came back to the home
and wasted for two to three months to
open a clinic finding the places finding
the things and everything
can you guess what happened next
baahubali
why kattappa has killed
bahubali
any guesses what has happened next
pradeep
guessing a routine story
anyone anyone guys
so what happened is
this happened
what is this
what is this
no no it's not my marriage not my
marriage pradeep my girlfriend got
married
okay so my girlfriend got married
so of course once your girlfriend is got
married so what is going to happen you
will go to utmost depression
you will lose everything in the life
yeah
so again plans has changed a b c d
everything so what I have done
I took a break for six months I rebooted
myself and I have restarted the
preparation again
so my story is very simple
my story is very very simple I started
my preparation
with the suggestions I have created the
preparation and joined the clinic with
the suggestions I have planned to go for
USA with the suggestions I have planned
to go and open a clinic then things were
completely out of my hand so I have
restarted the preparation
so what preparation has given me
so this is what basically I have planned
I have planned a single chair clinic in
my hometown but the twists in my life
okay the confusions in my life the
learning process in my life the struggle
in my life after six years of hard work
God planned something big for me
I opened centers
trained students with my experience and
skills and I have opened a clinic I
thought of opening a clinic in my
hometown which is probably a single
chair Clinic
okay but luckily
now I have opened the largest
microscopic clinic in the country we
have five microscopes with six shades
which is the largest microscopic clinic
in the entire country okay
so I mean we have an academy okay we
have an academy microscopic Academy in
the city of Hyderabad okay and we are
doing very very good so it's just it's
just a matter of six years six years
it's just a matter of six years
Everything Has Changed I thought of
opening a clinic in my hometown now I
have opened a biggest clinic in
Hyderabad so it's just a process of
updating your surface that's a process
of learning from your odds learning from
your difficulties okay planning
interacting with the people
understanding what is happening in the
society and reacting according to the
requirement of the society so there's no
point like if you are if you're selling
something Woolen clothes in in in a
summer season doesn't make any sense
okay so everything requirement has a
particular face a particular time what
the society requires what really the
Dentistry requires so if your thought
process is going in such a way for
example what the crowd requires okay so
you need to go and answer or you need to
go and address such things so that you
can grow high in your profession
that can be like for example you are
from operator dentist in indoor everyone
are doing root canal therapy what you
can do special in this
can you handle the curved canals can you
retrieve the files
are you best at reroute Canal are you
best at periodical surgeries are you
good at smile designing are good in
handling the patient or a good in
converting the patient or good in
talking with the patient so these are
things which are done by very few
dentists okay so what I feel strongly is
find your strong point work on it
enhance yourself polish yourself learn
Dentistry is not a day or it's not an
year it's a process
it's a process like what I am as an
intern in 2012 2013 and what I am now in
2020 to 2023 is totally different I have
learned so many things because I am
interacting with the people around me
okay finally welcome to MDS conquer okay
so MDS conquer Academy MDS conquer
hospitals and MBS conquer training
center for your need inict inbad and
everything okay so so most of you are in
a confusion what after BDS how many how
many of you are in this state of
confusion what to be done or you have
already decided whether you want to
start the prep or you want to do MDS
there are few people who have already
decided that you want to start your trip
but how many of you are still in the
state of confusion I want your response
on the chat box
anyone still in the state of confusion
okay so this is this is this is the
perfect answer for you first of all I
want every one of you to prepare the
goal
what you want to be what you want to be
what you want to be in the Dentistry you
have you should have an answer I I'm not
uh I'm not forcing you to decide your
department now I'm not forcing you to
decide your plan now but I want you to
decide what you want to be
what you want to be
and after deciding what you want to be
in the Dentistry what you want to be in
the next five years decide a proper plan
prepare a plan for that
sit talk with the people who are good at
this
who are good at this having good
knowledge about this who talk positive
about Dentistry don't sit and talk with
someone who has vast knowledge about
Dentistry but not positive because you
require a positive vibes at this
particular phase you require Positive
Vibes you require a strong positive app
so people who are positive towards the
Dentistry people who has good knowledge
over the Dentistry people who has good
knowledge in counseling you sit with
them prepare a proper goal prepare a
proper plan this is the most important
thing that you have to be you have to do
if you want to be successful because
that is the biggest mistake I have done
so that I have wasted two to three years
of my valuable time
because I I take suggestions random
suggestions for everyone and I keep on
moving in my life this is what the
biggest mistake I have done so I don't
want any one of you to do the same
mistake if you require we are open to
help you out we are open to counsel you
we are going to check your financial
levels we are going to check your
mindset we are going to help you out and
we are going to tell you what suits best
for you by telling positives and
negatives of each and every step and so
that accordingly you can plan your goal
and goal with a proper plan and with a
proper Mentor is must
so my goal for all of you is have you
seen this good doctor the good doctor
web web series available on Netflix in
different
have you seen this at least one episode
have you heard this at least right okay
so I want I want every one of you to
become a good dentist dentist everyone
can become a dentist all hundred of your
batchmates one or other day are going to
become a dentist so every one of us are
dentists okay but I want a good dentist
in fact I want a great dentist I want a
great dentist
so keep your target to become a good or
a great dentist I don't want everyone at
dentist right so I want a good dentist
or a grand dentist Market requires good
and great dentists Dentistry require
good and great dentists if you want to
develop Dentistry
to the to the to the level of us yet to
the level of UK to the level of other
countries we require good dentists we
don't require dentists dentists are so
many
the Dentistry is saturated
Dentistry saturated agree good Dentistry
good Dentistry is not saturated they
agree for this or not
good Dentistry is not saturated I have
many of my friends who has a bad dental
experience till the date means we don't
have good dentists that's what they're
telling the industry is not good because
I have a bad experience my mother has a
bad experience it's not about a pain
it's about the failure of the treatment
so we don't have good dentists here we
don't have very good dentists here okay
we don't have a great dentist here we
are having dentists so I want every one
of you to become a good dentist
your target should be a good dentist
or a great dentist not a dentist again
you're done with your final year exam
results you're a dentist now but now
a dentist has to convert into a good
followed by a dentist has to convert
into great so then you will have your
weight is in the market then you will
have your demand in the market you got
what I mean are you clear about what I'm
talking
difference between normal density
difference between a good Dentistry
difference between extraordinary and a
great Dentistry it's a plan to shift
from this level to that level that level
to that level this is how it should be
don't stuck yourself at one point taking
your family response I have seen many of
my students taking family
responsibilities not getting upgraded
they're doing whatever they want they're
doing whatever they want they're doing
whatever they know they don't upgrade
why sir I'm married I have kids I have
responsibilities I have emis I have this
I have that my father my mother health
issues and everything this is personal
whatever the terminologies which I have
used is personal and whatever I am
talking about Dentistry is professional
so don't include your personal life into
your professional life not now after
five years
now you have completely the personal
life is totally different you go out
enjoy
move out do everything whatever you want
in internship but this is not going to
happen after five years so don't mix
your professional life to personal life
whenever you mix your professional life
to personal life both struggle
clear
clear so I want some extraordinary
dentists I want some good dentists I
want some great dentist to come out in
the next few years
and I want every one of you who who are
going to hear this uh session maybe live
now or maybe streaming on the YouTube I
want kindly I want you to focus on to
become extraordinary in the Dentistry
That's My Kind kind request because
if you become extraordinary overall the
dentist is going to be extraordinary in
India I want Dentistry
to be best to get upgraded in the India
in the upcoming years maybe five or ten
years and the complete responsibility is
dependent on the dentist who are in the
market
so to do this what should I do
what should I do sir I won't become a
good dentist I want to become an
extraordinary great dentist but what
should I do sir
you have to follow these principles
okay so this is
trust principle means you should trust
first of all good dentist who is good
dentist I am good dentist
so first if you are good dentist you
have to trust that you are good dentist
I am great dentist sir so first you have
to trust it so trust depends upon few
important things one is consistency and
second one is time consistency means you
should struggle you should work every
day to become good or great and second
thing you have to do everything in as
less time as possible sir I want to
crack the entrance how many years after
10 years you want to crack
sir I want to finish the BDS how many
Five Years sir I want to finish the BDS
in five years Sir with good knowledge
and everything so whatever you do we
always talk about time do you accept it
the most important thing for us is time
how many of you agree for this how many
have you seen money haste
how many of you seen money has web
series
very very very
Trend setting web series in the case of
your covid-19
how many have you seen here
yes right
sakshi has seen
right so what is the most important
thing in money Haze web series what is
the goal what is the primary goal
of Professor in the money Heist web
series
what is the primary goal of the
professor in money haste web series
right I'll give you the options
so what is the primary what is the major
goal of money is web series option A
stealing money option b stealing time
is it stealing money or stealing time
yes money has web series run on stealing
the time
because there is no money there to steal
okay there is no money there to steal
they have to print the money
so when they have more time they can
print more money and they can steal more
money so the concept of money has to
have serious runs on stealing the time
the more the time you steal the more the
money you can print the more money you
can steal okay so life also moves on
time okay so you have to do everything
in as less time as possible
so it's inversely proportional to the
time
so if you follow this principle
throughout your life everything is going
to change around you
you know this guys occurs long back
what is this that is uh if not girls I I
want guys to answer this
what is this
so most of us will miss things by
Imagine
probably I hope like at least few of you
have missed your mbbs seat by a margin
am I right
I have missed namibia's seat by a margin
maybe margin of five marks I like I hope
most of you have missed your mbbs seat
by Imagine and you have taken videos
right so similarly what has happened in
recent World Cup is
so dhoni has missed
the World Cup this world cup semi-finals
by Martin so you can tell me sir
all these are by Luxor anything so what
happens between the England
and New Zealand in the final is England
New Zealand final was dra
Etc so whenever there is a draw what
they do they keep a super over
what happened so per hour is also drawn
and they have New Zealand has missed the
World Cup
the first World Cup for them New Zealand
has I mean recently they've got the test
World Cup but New Zealand has missed the
first World Cup by a margin after
getting into finals the final Etc after
playing the sober of after I draw the
soap opera is also a draw and they have
missed the World Cup
by this margin so in in our life most of
the things we costliest things expensive
things
life-changing things we are going to
miss by a margin
so
I don't want anyone to miss anything by
imagine so I want everyone to take calls
seriously there may be one or two
individuals I still remember there is
one of my batchmate who has missed
distinction in the final year by one
Mark very painful it is maybe now she
she may be fine now she may be fine with
that but she cried like anything she has
missed distinction just by one mark
maybe most of you have missed your first
class biomark maybe 70 days by a Mark or
distinction in a particular subject my
by a Mark if I'm not wrong right so I
want every one of you to be serious
before missing anything by a margin
so first and foremost thing that any one
of you has to decide is about my trust
principle okay trust is directly
proportional to consistency and
universally proportional to time and
followed by if you want to settle as a
dentist if you open Google if you open
here and there and you see lots of
things I don't consider mph as a
Dentistry
Hospital Administration is not Dentistry
is it clear guys
there may be few of your seniors super
seniors or someone XYZ they do mph going
to USA they do mph in India they do MBA
they do something XYZ that is not
Dentistry
those are considered as options after
Dentistry
they are not only options after
Dentistry there are options after mbbs
also there are options after
biotechnology also there are options
after B techno B Pharmacy also their
options after ayurved their options
after Homeopathy is it clear
if you want to stay in dentistry where
those are different
if you do MBA Hospital Administration
you are nowhere called as dentist you
will have your dental degree but you are
not you are not you are not a dentist
anymore or if you are doing mph
Public Health you're not dentist
you have degree you know knowledge but
you are not dentists so Dentistry is
something you stay in dentist you you
behave as a dentist you treat as a
dentist okay so first of all you have to
decide whether you want to go to you
whether you want to go to abroad whether
you want to stay in India the first four
most important thing
two options you have staying as a
dentist in India are staying as a
dentist in other countries so here there
are many dentists who are taking
multiple ways mph MBA there are many
many many other things that the people
are doing where there is one of my
friend who has done fashion designing
also okay so you have many options to be
done if you are going abroad or even in
India also there are many other gateways
you can move out if you are planning to
move away from Dentistry that is also
fine but I'll be talking more about the
things which you have to do as a dentist
so International if you are going okay
what are the other ways you can be you
can practice dentistry in other
countries or you can learn something in
international and come back in India and
practice okay is it clear I want
everyone to be active from now because
this is going to be more informative
until now I tried my best to motivate
you
tried my best to guide you
to know your mistakes
and I highlighted my mistakes what I
have done during my internship and post
internship so now I want you to back to
because this is more of an orientation
related stuff
so if you are planning to go for
international
the most important thing that you have
to consider internationally are three
important things according to me
three important things has to be
considered the first and foremost
important thing is what is this
yes right time
the second most important thing that you
have to consider is money
means how much time is going to take for
you to settle down second one how much
money you are going to spend
by the time you start making money
and what is the third important thing
third Factor anyone can guess me what is
the third Factor
third important factor for your
international plan is
any guesses who is the most important
person for your international plan apart
from you
apart from you yes the third important
factor is parents why parents sir who
will provide you time
parents has to provide you time
who is going to provide you money
parents has to provide you the money
because you don't have money I don't
have money when I was an intern so
parents has to provide so these are the
three important factors which you have
to consider so if you are planning
International goals
sit with your parent
tell that okay Dad Mom I'm going to take
this much of time maybe five years from
now or in this five years I'm going to
spend this much amount of money and you
need to sponsor the money you need to
arrange the money so everything you have
to discuss with your parents
you should know first of all what are
the proceedings what is the time how
much time it's going to take what are
the exams to be cleared how much money
you need to spend and followed by you
need to discuss the same with your
parents and take the permission because
I have seen many many such conditions
where
the students were well prepared and
planned they have good plan students
have their their plan and of course
parents will also have their plans okay
student prepared well and arranged
everything finally father told I have a
different plan I'm thinking of you to
get married in the next three three
years maximum I cannot give five or six
years for you to go to USU or do
something and come back so so my
suggestion is rather than uh your plans
to be like uh your plans to be going
going in waste okay that's what happened
with me because I thought my father was
financially very very strong when I was
planning to USA because my father never
said no for how much I'm going to ask at
a huge level and logical that's that's a
miscon misconcept I have because I never
used to ask more than five thousand or
ten thousand so whenever asked five
thousand or ten thousand my father is
used to immediately deposit on my
account during my usual level but once I
asked my father 30 lakhs he said no he
he does have 30 likes I don't know I
don't know the financial situation of
the family at that time so my suggestion
for all of you when you are planning
abroad make sure you sit with a good
Mentor you discuss about the things
checklists and everything then you
discuss the same with your parents take
the permission from the parents then
start the proceedings or else you're
going to waste the time is it clear
the most important things for USA or UK
or any country abroad plans is fastest
time second is money third one is the
proper permission and
and support from your parents
you can do by your own probably without
without your support from the parents
maybe after 10 years from now after
making money for example at that
situation I was not in a position to go
to USA because of my financial
situations but now I'm financially
strong if I want I can go I don't need
to ask my parent or I don't ask anyone
because now I'm financially stable I'm
financially fine is it clear
clear time money and proper support from
the parents and of course before talking
about the time money and everything you
should have a proper Mentor you should
have a proper resource person who has
vast knowledge on these things to take a
proper call without guidance by trusting
the Google or by trusting some XYZ stuff
if you take a call you are going to
waste your time like me proper guidance
proper resource person is very very very
very important
clear can I move to the next part
so for every call what you are going to
take whether it is it is Dentistry I'm
talking about Dentistry whether it is
Dentistry or what you are going to take
the steps and everything you should be
very very clear for example you are
planning to become a dentist in USA in
the next five years
so you should know everything about in
beading and you should know everything
about
about the amount that you are going to
spend the exams that you are going to
take over there or or the steps that you
need to go through
or if you are planning to go to UK
what are the procedures worry how how it
is what is the waiting time how much
amount you need to spend
am I capable of handling this or not or
you are planning to Canada
for a license exam or you are planning
to go for any other UAE country
UA country so you should know okay long
back UA people they used to take videos
but now they are not taking BDS people
now everything moves on MDS so MDS plus
two years experience is required to go
to UA to go to any other any countries
like UA Dubai Qatar Saudi any other
countries options are very good and open
but you require two to three years
experience after MDS nowadays long back
we require a BDS with three years
experience now they have changed that
okay so now they have changed MDS with
three years experience is required for
an open job in the case of your UAE
country similarly there are many other
countries you have Australia
you have New Zealand you have many other
countries Singapore Malaysia there are
few of my friends working in Malaysia as
a dentist a few of my friends working in
Singapore the few of my friends have
settled in USA they're they're two
Juniors of mine are in UK and there are
many of my senior square and students
who are working in UAE many many other
things are happening right okay so for
any call first of all you you check out
the positive side
you check out the positive side and
similarly you try to check out the
negative side also okay any call okay
try to focus on negatives as well as
positives and consider yourself in a
situation and take a proper call that is
very important that is the reason why we
always have to sit with a proper
individual research person who has to
take the proper uh information then you
have to take a call because most of
these calls are irreversible if you take
a wrong call you have to suffer a lot so
you have to be very very careful in
taking the calls
right so finally okay so most of us
after digging out and everything so most
of us they ask this question sir is MDS
the only leftover option or the best
option among the rest
okay so what I strongly believe is yes
both can be right or I suggest like MDS
is going to be the best uh among the
rest of the options and like how many of
you traveled on a ship or On A Boat Boat
Ride or a ship ride or or an airplane
how many of you traveled on these things
chipboard boat ride at least
have you traveled
of any of this
yes so when you travel any of this what
we are going to do we are going to have
something like a live jacket okay we're
going to have life jacket okay so but
the probability of using this we never
use this okay if if we we have I mean a
number used traveled in so many flights
I've never used this okay if a situation
comes where I have to use this I may not
be there okay so MDS is something like
something like a live jacket okay which
should be there with you when it's going
to support you it's going to save your
life okay when it is sinking so MDS is
again going to give you the maturity
Dentistry requires maturity
that that simply that most of us call it
as experience
experience not in in terms of uh the es
experience in terms of the number of
cases you do number of patients you do
number of patients you interact number
of different range of cases you do and
MDS is something like a apart from
getting a degree you will get lots of
knowledge and experience and maturity
towards the Dentistry
so I'm going to ask you a simple
question a normal question for you so
what you do in Period Department ugly
level
period Department uses what they do
scaling
skill anything apart from scaling
you know we are still in hand skills
do you do a hand scaling in a clinic
you do hand scaling in a clinic
no
so what you do what you do in a clinic
is totally different okay what you what
period Pages you have seen what they're
doing in the clinics where your pages
per your pages
of course they do scaling scaling is
common right
okay the rate of flap surgeries
flaps apart from that you have seen
anything apart from flap scaling
anything perio people
okay they do implants
augmentations
okay many other things like and normally
in a metropolitan City what we do mostly
in a clinic in a period is of course
scaling everyone can do I'm not going to
talk much about scaling okay we'll be
doing lasers flaps
laser Blaze flaps okay so what my point
is what you do at a UC level in a career
department is not we practice in the
clinic
so there is so much that you have to
learn in a in a department like perio to
come out and have a bright practice
to come out and have a bright practice
right so for example I'll talk about
other departments
so what you do in oral surgery
usually level
usually level what you do in oral
surgery
extractions
okay anyone of any one of you have tried
impaction at least
extractions right okay extractions
impaction at least
suture removal
what pages will do in your college
disimpaction right
trauma cases
surgeries
orthogmatic cleft lift cleft palate so
there are many other things which we are
not learning at a UC level because
usually level surgery posting is how
many days one month one month in final
year one month in internship perio
posting one month in final year one
month in internship are you going to
learn within two months everything
are you going to learn everything every
of these in two months
not possible
this is why PG is required this is why
PG is required do you know how much a
metropolitan City
laser flap they are going to charge
just I mean how much how much scaling
you're going to charge in your college
100 rupees 50 rupees
scaling how much you charge
in the college
200.
200 I think it's a maximum 100 or 200
maximum
just imagine how much you are going to
charge a flap in a metropolitan City
like Hyderabad Mumbai Bangalore
Chennai
thirty thousand
to 50 000 they are going to charge
do you strong do you really believe that
with the uni using knowledge can you do
a flap surgery
can you do a laser-based flap
and make thirty thousand to fifty
thousand
no more but you can make it you can make
it over a period of experience if you
know the maturity I was talking about
the maturity I was talking about the
experience in the Dentistry you're going
to make it can an intern finally a
student who has posted two months in a
oral surgery Department can he do an
orthogonic surgery
can he do a cleft Loot and cleft palate
surgery
can he properly do an impaction that's
my question then can he properly do an
impaction with just two
two months experience in the department
in that two months again you will have
eight Saturdays and eight Sundays eight
Saturdays and eight Sundays will be
there
no right so that is why PG is required
that is why PG in a good college is
required that is why PG in a good
department is required that is why PG in
a college with a good op is required
do you know what is the real uh real
necessary or essential thing why you
have to do a post graduation so
Dentistry require good dentist
experience a dentist maturity dentist so
you have to do you have to gain that
maturity from a PG from a good college
with a good department and a good good
op
s good infrastructure and material
should be there right
right you got that is I don't want to
discuss much about this okay so every
Department like you Arthur what you do
level
now it's ruling
ruling part of Dentistry trending part
of Dentistry
case taking
pradeep is telling what you doing
pre-clinical work oh do you do you do
the pre-clinical work in the patient now
everyone are going for invisaligns
everyone are going for uh Elena's right
everyone are going for Elena's invisible
braces in everything
where you are going to learn at a user
level what you learn in author is
is a nonsense it's just a basement
because they cannot teach everything in
two months posting simple logic sir why
they can teach everything sir right so
they cannot teach everything in a two
months posting okay so they have the
limitations of time so within the
limitations of time you are able to
learn the basics and you are able to
come out so that is why
a PG is required from a good college or
an experience is required or maturity is
required by exposure to vast number of
patients and vast number of cases
clear clear what I mean
I hope you're clear
can I move ahead okay to the next part
so now PG okay how can we do MDS okay so
there are many ways of doing MDS so now
I'll be talking about MDS in India
so how can you do mdss for doing an MDS
in India you have two examinations
okay one is meet
it occurs once a year
one time per year
and 97 to 98 percentage of MDS seats in
the country will be filled by need
second one is inichet
it occurs two times per year
per year
and it occupies that one to two
percentage or two to three percentage of
seats
clear
so you're eligible to give need you are
eligible to give ionize it ionize it
occurs two times a year the one session
is going to be November the second
session is going to be in the May and
neat and now it is a bit Dynamic but
most probably it will be uh January
December January or February clear so
these are the two gateways two exams
even if you are financially very strong
even you can be a son of a DCI president
or you can be a son of an or a Dean or a
college College principal even then you
have to write this exam and you have to
qualify this exam without qualifying
this exam without writing this exam you
cannot buy a seat or you cannot get a
seat is it clear
I hope this should be very very clear so
neat and ionizing
so the next important thing is okay so
so the number of seats okay in India we
have around 6000 MDS seats per year
out of the 6000 MDS seats you have
somewhere around 550 to
560 GDC seats are there government
Dental College seed Circle
okay how many government Dental College
seats are there per year in India 550 to
600 seats
government dental colleges what is the
advantage of government Dental College
seats is one is more op
what is the other Advantage guys you
have more op more outpatient OPD will be
there
and these are free seats
and they'll give you a stipend
you have you have in and around like uh
eight to ten central government colleges
are there who are going to give a
stipend of more than
80 000 per month eight colleges in the
country are there central government
colleges who are going to give stipend
of more than 80 000 per month
and you have Maulana
and you have Delhi University these are
going to give a stipend of 1 lakh 16 000
per month
one lakh 16 000 is a stipend for two
colleges in the country the first field
colleges
is it clear
this is one lakh sixteen thousand
one lakh sixteen thousand per month
so just you can Calculate 1 lakh 16 into
12 12 months per year
into three years it's going to come
around 41 lakhs you will get 41 lakhs
stipend in the form of stipend in your
three years of PG
clear
OPD is good Advantage you'll have more
more op you can learn more things now
that is a free seat no need to pay
anything to the college and every month
they are going to give a stipend okay
the highest hyphen is 1 lakh 16 and
there are eight colleges with more than
60 000 stipend there are 12 colleges
with more than 65 000 per month styphen
there are many colleges with more than
50 000 per month stipend clear can I
move to the next part
I need your response in the chat box
so that I can discuss more I can make
you more comfortable I can make you more
confident and this is all information
what you have to know before you start
your proceedings before you're planning
to know about your future and Dentistry
or your future plans right
next how many GDC seats are there per
state so here I want to tell you very
important thing so there is something
called as all India 50 percent is
all India 50 is what is this for example
in a particular State okay for example
we have more Maharashtra students today
so in a particular state in Maharashtra
okay you have total number of gdc's you
have or somewhere around okay consider
I'm telling a rough figure okay for
example we will consider it as 100 100
GDC seats are there so what do you have
to do so Maharashtra government has to
split this half gdcs and they have to
give to all India means 50 GDC seats
will be filled by all India and 50 seats
will be filled by State Pool of
Maharashtra state of Maharashtra in
Maharashtra State Council
so everyone is eligible to all India so
for example this 50 is seeds even a Maha
even a major Pradesh people is student
is also eligible
the Andhra student is also eligible
Telangana student is also eligible
Karnataka student is also eligible Tamil
Nadu Kerala is also eligible
whereas the left or 50 percent is in the
state pool only Maharashtra students has
to take similarly like if you take your
Telangana Telangana you have GDC
Hyderabad
so in GDC Hyderabad if you have like
somewhere around like uh consider it as
24 seats are there so 12 will be for all
India 12 will be for stateful well
anyone can take
and this only state people can take
clear
is it clear
right
is it clear guys
all India pool how all India so every
state is going to give their 50
percentage of seats from Gemma and
Kashmir to that of the Kerala Assam
every state is going to pull and this
pool is called as all India pool
all India pool so in all India pool the
cutoff ranks will be in and around like
this for an open category student
in an or India pool the open category
student will have a cutoff at 350 to 400
all India rank
if you get 350 or 400 Below on all India
their High chances that you will you you
will get a GDC of any Department 350
range will get a non-clinical if you are
100 below you will get a good clinical
and a good college 50 Below Good
clinical and central government college
with more stipend
per month
this is how it's going to be
foreign for an OBC candidate
it will be same around range of 400 to
450. OBC or ews
OBC or ews you'll have a range of 400
and 450 you will get an all indium
whereas for an SC
for an sc student
below
so let's let's not take to let's not
consider two thousand
I want you to keep 1500 as a Target okay
so for an sc student you have to get all
India 1500 below
to get a all India government College
seat
and for an st you can keep a target of
2000 or 2500.
2000 let's make it as simply make it as
good seat
keep it as two thousand okay okay two
thousand five hundred
if your pH physically handicapped so if
they keep one or two seats for
physically handicapped and you are the
only one you will get that seat
is it clear
guys is it clear
with the cutoffs I want you to know the
cutoffs then only you can keep the goals
can only can keep the targets then only
you can work hard
followed by once you are done with all
India okay then you can apply to your
own State Maharashtra people can apply
to the Maharashtra said State Telangana
people can apply to the local Telangana
so all your colleges like I think like
most of you are from nashik and all
these Aurangabad and everything so
your college seats will be coming under
State Pool not in all India pool is it
clear
or India pool is only for government
colleges and it will be only for few
deemed colleges
if you are from Dy Patel Dy Patel will
be coming in all India pool team to
college
but for example if you are from uh nasik
sorry if you are from acpm
okay or if you are from uh people's
dental college of Bhopal
okay your college will be coming under
State Pool
is it clear you've got a Clarity right
what is State Pool what is all India
pool what seats will be coming under all
India pool how many seats will be coming
under all India pool how many seats will
be coming under state
clear right okay this knowledge is very
very important because most of the
people they assume that even after
getting thousand two thousand rank also
they assume that they are getting GDC
they'll be getting they feel that they
are going to get a government and will
call a seat
I was talking to a few of few of such
people and I was asking how who told you
so there is one YouTube video I have
seen sir even if you get 1200 1300
they're telling that you will get an
announcement no that's not the reality
so come out there come out to the
reality
come out learn the reality learn what is
happening okay once you learn what is
happening you can keep such tough goals
you can keep some tough goals and you
try to achieve them
so for MP students
the GDC that is available for use is
indoor
so indoor is going to have three seats
in ortho
so four seats in Pro store four seats in
oral surgery three in Period three in
oral medicine three pedo three oral path
three public health and three
conservative industry so here what is
going to happen however the splitting is
going to happen for example oral surgery
four seats are there so two will go for
all India and two will go for the state
pool
so you'd you take conservative way to
conservator has three seats cons has
three seats so what is going to happen
two one so one year they're going to
take two seats for all India and get
keep one seat for the state pool and the
next year they are going to keep one
state for all India and second state for
the state because three cannot be
splitted into one point five and one
point five what they do one year they
are going to give two and the next year
they're going to give one is it clear
four it is okay even number it is okay
odd number one time they are going to
give more one seat and second time
they're going to reduce one seedless
clear clear clear
so this is the only GDC that is
available in mp
so checking out next if you're talking
about Hyderabad so Telangana again you
have one GDC so you have three seats in
every department so two seats one year
to all India and one seat for all India
the next year so This Is How They are
going to give so Ural surgery three
hundred way to three pedo3 oral path
three Public Health three
so if you're if you're from Karnataka
you have again one GDC the second second
series is have started but PC is not had
started for all these udcs so there is
only one government Dental polish
Bangalore which is providing the MDS
seats so you have ortho3 surgery three
perio three medicine three Public Health
three conservative Three cross the three
oral path three and pedo3
and of course the most waiting is
Maharashtra
so what I can tell you is Maharashtra is
having the highest number of gdc's
colleges as well as GDC seats in the
entire country
so you have GDC Mumbai
you have pedophile
or a path five medicine five surgery r10
prosto is 10
conservative is five orthophile and
perio 5
followed by GDC Aurangabad
okay you have ProStar six
and rest all departments are three
and you have GDC nagpur
okay where you have your
perio 3 conservative Three Ortho 3 oral
path three oral medicine two surgery
three pedo3 and prosto 3.
and GDC Nair again Mumbai you have one
more GDC okay where you have Hull number
of seats here Prosper five oral medicine
five oral pathology sorry prostate and
oral medicine 10 oral pathology 10
conservative 10 surgery 10 pedophile
periophile and ortho3
so these are the gdcs that are available
in Maharashtra okay so Maharashtra is
having the highest number of gdc's in
the entire country and more number of
GDC seats also okay so coming to the
sequence of exams you are going to give
okay so probably uh the first exam that
most of you are eligible is going to be
November 2023 IMI CET so this is the
first exam that you are going to give so
how many days you have for this exam
guys
this is the first exam you are
officially eligible if you are preparing
seriously for MDS okay keeping MDS as a
Target the first exam you are going to
be eligible for is November 2023 ini CET
so how many days you have for this
okay so you have exactly 12 to 13 months
for this examination so I want everyone
to be serious to the preparation so keep
this exam as a Target okay so okay so
number of seats will be in and around
like 15
15 to 20 okay now recently uh aims
centers has increased so the seats they
are trying to increase so previously we
used to have very very less uh in a
single digit but now they have more to
double digit so the number of questions
will be 200. time duration is three
hours and it will be minus one third
negative for every right answer
if you are getting minor plus one mark
for every wrong answer you'll get minus
one third
and each question you have to handle in
less than 50 seconds
and you'll have diagram based questions
you will have more regular questions and
you have new pattern questions what is
new pattern questions means like I hope
you remember your user level like
assertion reason based questions arrange
the following in ascending order
descending order toward the true or
false match the following all these are
the new added questions uh in the latest
two to three years in the last two to
three years they had so most of your
questions will be moving around
clinicals and in the clinicals also
you'll have more questions on Endo ortho
conservative
oral medicine Radiology oral pathology
and general Anatomy so most of the
diagram based questions will be from the
clinicals okay so this is a rough
blueprint not exact blueprint exact
blueprint we are going to discuss as we
proceed to the classes
and next the second exam that most of
you are eligible is going to be first I
said it is November 2023.
it's a fact that you have 13 months
preparation time
so followed by the exam may be like
prediction exam may be like in January
so after finishing November so you'll
have 30 or 40 days more so maybe you'll
have 14 to 15 months preparation time
for for your January
2020 for a neat examination so this neat
examination is going to contain all
government Dental College seats all
private college seats all deemed College
seats all the seats available in every
College whatever call is wherever you're
reading from okay and this is
eligibility criteria for your Army Corps
also is there anyone
who are planning for Army Corps
Army Dental Corps or you want to know
about Army General cops
okay right so Army Dental Corps every
year they are going to have some index
of 35 to 40 35 to 40 intake will be
there for Army rental cops so you can
work as a
dental officer or a dentist in an army
army background with an army background
in the Army troops and everywhere so you
are going to get a rough stipend or
rough rough salary of 90 000 to 1 lakh
and it's going to increase basing upon
the experience and you'll have a 13
years to 14 years service over there
after which you you can come out and you
can have your own practice or something
okay but for Army Corps the first you'll
have two rounds round one and round
round one is decided basing upon the
neat rank
and round two is going to interview
okay as of now the interviews are going
for the your super seniors they are
attending the interviews so from uh the
interviews have started from October 2nd
we and they are going to close by 15th
or 16th of this month so first is you
should get a good neat rank
with which you are going to apply the
form and second they are going to call
you for an interview and a medical
examination okay right so uh I mean now
I mean long back we used to have a
different rule but now what they have
done in the last in in this in this year
is so out of this 35 intakes 35 to 40
intakes so they kept only three intakes
per woman
and more intakes for men
so
if you have interest or fantasy towards
Army and everything so the probability
of clearing the part one is going to be
easy for a male compared to female so
this bias was started this year so we
cannot do anything okay I'm sorry for
the woman okay so now they are taking
less women okay so women are just three
and cut off for the recent women was
England around like 22 all India rank so
you should get 20 222 all India rank
okay 220 to all India rank to qualify as
a woman and males have a qualifying up
to two thousand two thousand two
thousand two hundred also there are many
to many many people who has qualified
for the
round two so now they are going for the
interview and the medical examinations
followed by the final list is going to
be out so in that the top 40 people are
qualified uh to serve the country as
Army Dental Corps
clear right so the rough idea I have
given right okay so next one is uh the
subjects
the questions are going to be 240 where
your inict the questions are 200 okay
right and time duration is same in ICT
is three hours need is also three hours
and coming to the negative marking
negative marking uh here it is minus
four minus one fourth there the negative
marking is minus one third here for
every right answer you'll get plus four
marks and for every wrong answer you
will get minus one score okay so there
what is going to happen there you you
are going to get every right answer
you're going to get plus one and every
wrong answer you're going to get minus
one third
and for every question you have to solve
in 40 seconds 40 seconds uh you have to
finish every every question and diagram
based questions uh are going to be 35 to
40 plus and you will have lengthy case
based questions I'll expose you uh
to all this different range of questions
as we start the proceedings in the in
the upcoming few days
right clear right so clear with the
basic blueprint of Ames the basic
blueprint of uh the neat and everything
so once you're done with the neat again
I said like I said what what I said you
I said you you are eligible to take may
I and icet some inict will be done in
November
followed by after six months in may also
you'll have one more round of inicity so
if you are interested you can take Maya
and ICT May ICT will have uh more number
of seats okay seats will be more because
it includes PGA also apart from Ames it
includes PJ and Japan so the time
duration exam pattern everything were
same which were discussed previously so
neat they have given a blueprint and we
people have given a blueprint that every
subject is going to carry 14 marks your
Anatomy with embryology astrology is 14
physiology biochemistry 14 so physio 7
biochemistry seven dental and orbit
Dental histology seven plus seven
pathology micro seven plus seven
pharmacology 14 Dental materials 14
general medicine 14 general surgery 14
oral path 14.
oral Radiology 14 pedo preventive 14.
Ortho 14 perio 14 Rose to 14
conservative 7 in the seven max official
14 and Public Health 40. so anyway I'll
be sharing this blueprint to you just do
make a note every subject has an equal
weightage that's what I'm telling so
there may be a cases where you are going
to give more importance to few subjects
but logically your preparation should be
a balanced because every subject has a
equal weightage in your neat examination
and books to be followed if you are a
student of MDS conquer okay so I want
everyone to carry uh the pp books PP
books are hard copies of books which are
given to you
as a hard copy
okay if you're a student of MDS conquer
this will be dispatched to your post
letters these are very very unique books
which helps in quick revision which
contains lots of diagrams which concern
lots of repeats tables all the memory
based content which we have condensed to
one book that is called as power
playbooks and I want every one of you to
carry the latest edition of dental pulse
as of now uh the 15th Edition is
available in the market probably after
four or five months they may come out
with the 16th Edition but I don't want
you to wait till the date because it is
you're already running short of time
it's better you start the proceedings as
early as possible so I want you to take
the 15th Edition
and I want you to take the dentist
clinical part dentist is going to have
both clinical as well as non-clinicals
okay non-clinical so I will be telling
you what to be done and I'll be
providing you the material in a
different way okay but I want clinical
exposure should be more so I want you to
take dentist clinical part as well as
Dental pulse 15 days 15th Edition so
both of these books you have to carry PP
books I'll be sending you as a hard
copies
so all previous papers from 2017 to 2021
will be available on the website so last
year it is 2017 to 2021 but this year we
are planned and we have increased it for
your senior batch so we'll be giving you
the same access so now we have extended
from 2010 to 2021.
so you'll have more more mcqs that are
available on the website so all latest
Concepts available on the website smart
notes is available on the website last
minute stuff available on the website
mock exams available on the website so
textbook reading content videos
available on the website so everything
uh the website is the best source okay
you'll have diagram based questions case
based questions memory based questions
numerical based questions
subject specific exams will be there
okay again topic specific means every
subject is going to have 10 to 15 topics
and each topic you will have an exam so
you'll have you'll have a big question
Bank on the website okay so whenever you
start you can dig out and you can solve
apart from the hard copies what you have
related to the dental pulse and dentist
okay you'll have lots of questions on
the website available as a question Bank
as also available as a exam
okay so I want you to carry your uh well
organized a little bit of expensive uh
notices and I strongly recommend every
one of you to use classmate uh good
quality notes is because whatever notes
you are going to write so they should be
uh ease they should have that ease and
pleasantness when you're reading for
them for the last time during the last
two to three months of the phase of the
preparation so I want you to this is my
friendly suggestion for you I want you
to carry uh highlighters
pencils stickers
stick notices
Glitters whatever that that's going to
make your preparation more colorful and
make your preparation more interesting
because preparation is something like
which you should have more attachment
more involvement so you have to make it
more colorful more more Innovative more
attractive so that you you will get
addicted to the preparation so if you
are addicted to the preparation then it
is very very easy for you to handle the
stress handle the situation handle the
time and get a good rank
guys clear can I move to the next can I
move to the next part
yes yes
so what what conquer is going to do what
is unique unique thing that MDS conquer
has okay so the unique thing that MDS
conquer has is the Smart work which we
are going to add so students should have
their basic hard work and what we are
going to do we are going to add
smartness to your preparation and what
the team of MDS conqueror is doing from
past eight to nine years is okay we are
going to be in touch with the student
whenever you feel like talking with us
we are available for us we are not like
a regular online app where you just
register get get the bank get the
material you read by yourself okay or
you see a video and read by yourself so
whenever you are low whenever you have
ups and downs in the preparation because
we are humans I strongly believe we will
have lots of up and downs in the
preparation lots of upon ounce
emotionally when you're an intern okay
so what we are going to do we are going
to be in touch with you
so if you feel like talking with us we
will be available for you in maximum 24
hours or 48 hours we'll be responding
you we'll be talking with you we'll be
having an interaction with you and there
are many other cases where I traveled
long long distance and I have reached so
many places okay so I was there in
bhupal I was there in many other places
so I constantly moved from college to
college so that we can interact with
each other we can talk with each other
most of the so most of the so most of
the problems and most of the solutions
for most of the problems is by talking
so if you talk with someone who is
experienced someone who has a vast
knowledge over this some good resource
person you can come out of the problem
and that is what required the emotional
support for Preparation is very very
required and that will be provided by
the team MDS conquer apart from the
stuff what we are going to provide you
so we are going to provide you hot
copies it's not an app based preparation
I don't encourage an app-based
preparation okay it's it's a mentor
guidance based preparation that can
occur through an app or that can occur
through your website sources app and
website but the guidance will be the
individual so every morning you will get
a voice note where we are going to
interact where we are going to talk and
where we are going to tell you what to
be done for this particular day for
example it's a weekend what to be done
on a weekend weekend you do a different
job normally you do a different job
or it's going to be a festival is a
common festival for everyone so I don't
keep schedule on Diwali I don't keep
schedule on the major festivals I don't
keep schedule on customers I don't keep
schedule when we have a new year because
we enjoy we enjoy that face right so
it's like in a emotional based guidance
uh so every day uh the team is going to
help you out and whenever you want we
are going to reach you out and we are
going to interact with you
and how to start the preparation is the
biggest question that most of us have
you know rule of 21
any idea about rule of 21
yes anything requires rule of 21.
constant hard work of 21 days a first 21
days is a winning thing for your
preparation
I have seen this in more than 60
percentage of students in my 13 000 of
students whom I have trained till the
date so in the 13 000 students my
analysis were more than 60 percentage of
students they are successful by
following rule of 21 because most of the
students they quit the preparation in
the 21 days but if you cross the 21 days
with all the pain all the energy levels
building your confidence definitely out
of these people who are crossing 21 days
60 percentage they end up with some
extraordinary and great runs so it's all
about falling under rule of 21. it's
something like falling from bicycle so
on the first day every one of you
including you me everyone we are not
able to balance the situation we are not
able to balance the bicycle but on a
process we have learned it so I want
every one of you to hit that constant
practice every day you should have that
enthusiasm that okayness I have to be
serious about preparation right I'll be
focused on the preparation
you keep your goals okay don't don't
don't talk about reasons like I'm not
feeling good so I have not done it my
mother is not feeling good the op in the
college is too heavy I was posted in
conservative Department I was tied so
these reasons you should not give any
sort of these reasons for the first 21
days you organize the things I'll help
you in organizing things I'll tell you
what to be done where to be done how to
be done and how to handle it how to
easily finish it I'll be helping you out
but
time adjustment time management as an
intern is going to be a biggest
challenge that every one of us to focus
so time management how an intern has to
manage time how interns are able to get
good ranks extraordinary ranks the only
reason is they sacrifice few things
gossips talkings Department whenever we
free tomorrow we interns as an intern I
still remember my internship 10 years
back we used to gossip more on others so
stay away from Gossip stay away from
social media stay away from nonsense
stay away from unnecessary things if you
focus on you will get time
interns are not able to have time is
Just an Illusion if you are able to
remove that illusion and apply 21 rule
21 day rule things are going to be
easily possible and I'm going to help
you out don't worry I'm going to help
you out in this 21 Rule and I'm going to
keep on motivating you at different
different levels in different different
modes
which course is most effective with high
uh percentage it is more interactive
course I strongly believe prologue is
going to be more interactive because you
are going to meet Mentor every week two
times you are going to meet the mentors
okay so whenever you meet the mentor
there are high chances that you are
going to the only difference between the
pro live and a plan a is prologue is
going to have live classes
and the live classes will be evening
from six o'clock to eight o'clock
the pro live classes will be evening
from six o'clock to eight o'clock okay
even if you miss the pro live class I
strongly recommend pro-life should be
live even if you miss the live class the
recorded will be recorded version will
be available for reference for revision
and everything we are going to provide
you access to the recorded version also
so it's already discussed plan year how
many things you can access plan a
anywhere from any time throughout the
globe any times you can you can access
it the syllabus will be will be covering
the syllabus twice
okay and you'll have one-to-one analysis
after every Grand exam you'll have Smart
notes from the standard textbooks you'll
have PP books hard copies you'll have
access to more than 1500 videos you'll
have diagram based discussions on videos
case based discussions you'll have
latest question papers discussions
you'll have daily WhatsApp activity
you're going to have you'll have 500

sometimes it can be two days you'll have
doubts day whenever you want you can
post it out the mentors are going to
help you out and you'll have constant
interaction with the all India Toppers
either in the zoom or either in the live
class or either in the Instagram or
somewhere
and we are going to provide you the
proper counseling and suggestion because
nowadays most of the coaching centers
they're not providing a proper guidance
for the counseling and option filling
and everything again you have to find a
mentor again you have to pay so in this
course as of now as of now in the early
bird so we are including the counseling
suggestions and guidance also till you
enter the college still you enter the
college as an MDS and with an MDA stack
after getting a good rank the team is
going to help you out
I think offline as of now okay offline I
think it's not going to be possible for
an Intel so offline is going to you are
going to we're going to provide plan a
and apart from that all the additional
features will be there so you'll have
live classes
and syllabus will be covered twice you
have AC study room and Library access 24
into seven
and you will have you'll have Smart
notes from standard textbooks Library
access 24 into seven one to one analysis
after every exam will be there okay
you'll have more number of classes more
number of interactions motivations
personal guidance and everything in the
offline centers
so those these are the offline centers
and of course we are going to provide
you uh the coaching for inbd as already
discussed inbd is for USA examination so
we're going to provide you with the
coaching for in video also and we have
recently started the bench test 14 days
course also
okay if you have any plans of going for
USA or anything so we are open so in
India we don't have proper guidance for
the bench test but we have planned a 14
days
basic bench list program for that you
need to come to Hyderabad normal Theory
NBD Theory
you can prepare online no no need to
come to Hyderabad there's an intern you
can prepare but inbd 14 days bench test
scores you have to take off from the
college and you have to come to
Hyderabad to finish it and I strongly
recommend people who are planning to USA
okay so I want you to finish this inbd
14 days bench discourse as fast as
possible so that because as you have
more number of patients by learning the
things here like microscopes uh maybe
rotary Endo you're going to learn here
microscopes you're going to learn here
isolations you are going to learn here
you're going to learn perfect class
Tools in less unless Crown cuttings
everything what not related to inbd
you're going to learn everything so you
will have you will have a vast time
throughout your internship and your
posted in Pro store you can you can you
can plan your crown cuttings when you
are posted in indoor you can plan your
class 2 English unless you're posted in
indoor you're going to plan your
operator pedo you're going to do
something isolation you can do
everything you can practice it so that
you you'll be well versed with the
clinical skills also
so you can consider that as a clinical
clinical course also right so this is
our academy uh where you're going to
have your uh all the latest equipment
all the latest things that are going
around the globe in the Dentistry you'll
have magnification you'll have
microscopes uh you'll have all high-end
instruments you have laser-based
industry you have everything uh and you
can come and you can learn as a part of
your upgrading aspect okay so coming to
the achievements of MDS conquer MDS
conquer is standing uh uh I mean like uh
getting single digits uh from many years
and of course most of our single digits
are intense you can see last year we got
all India eighth rank she's an intern
and before that we have a student from
Assam who got single digit then we have
somya who got all India second rank then
we have bharathi who got all India third
ranks so all these are interns so we
have uh like an interns yes of course
time is not a big factor if you're
focused and if you have a proper
guidance and our students has proved it
the best so recently we have made a
Maharashtra State first
uh all India 22 and we have made Assam
State second okay and followed by of
course we are standing first in
Telangana and Andhra from past six years
okay and of course and the same Prospect
to the the reason why I'm keeping all
these achievements is uh the last year
already
and and all India 28th ranker is an
intern
is an intern
we have more because uh ours is like
more inclined to the online offline we
have students repeaters are going to
come for the offline Center but more of
an interns they pick they pick MDS
conquer and we have an extraordinary
result with an interns in the last
couple of years and of course uh
the repeaters are also do good but what
I strongly believe is whenever you have
a direct intimacy with the mentor that's
going to create more impact and most of
these students are pro-life students so
interaction with the mentor is very very
important that can occur through
pro-life or that kind of cut to offline
so it's not going to be possible for an
intern to reach an offline Center okay
until unless you stay within Hyderabad
okay of course as an intern you can come
to offline Center but most of the
interns they cannot reach the offline
Center if you stay far away so we have
students from JK so the online access is
going to be easy so basing upon your
convenience and everything you can plan
accordingly or after finishing your
internship you can come to the offline
center for the last two to three months
crash course or something
so this is my
all-time
contact number so your helpline or
Lifeline number you can call me interact
with our team talk with us and plan
accordingly and everything
okay so I'm done from I'm I'm done from
my side yeah okay so there are many
other things which I need to discuss
like non-dental options after BDS are
also there so when time permits I'll
take the class regarding that but if you
have any doubts uh you can you can you
can drop it on the chat box so that I'm
ready to help you out
if you have any doubts you're open I
mean there may be lots of confusions and
everything throughout the process of
preparation that's okay I'll be there to
help you out but as of now before you
start the proceedings you have any
doubts regarding the approach regarding
the goal regarding the plans or
regarding MDS conquer you're open to
drop on the chat box so I'm ready to
answer all those questions
I strongly recommend KN students to uh
to start the preparation as early as
possible without wasting any any any
time
because your seniors are suffering
your seniors are suffering so I don't
want you to suffer so that's what as of
now I told you right so uh
no we are not going to provide I'm not
taking admissions as of now for worry
okay because uh most of these abroad
options they have time limitation so you
should be ready and prepared to spend
more time five years
minimum five years they are going to
take they starts from three years to
five years so first of all you should be
financially strong second thing you
should be uh you should give the time
space okay when you give the time space
only the things are going to work out
yeah first of all you can start with the
dental pulse then after few days if you
want you can add dentist clinical apart
rest everything I am going to provide
you so I want you to have a good quality
of material that most of the Toppers of
all India are doing so most of the
topics of all India they do dentals and
they do dentist okay these are the two
books apart from the precise material
I'm going to provide you in a different
source so that we can take away our
preparation
no you check out the possibilities of
Oru
ore is good but you check out you check
out the possibilities uh how you can go
there how you can slot where slots are
not available now waiting period for ore
is more so you have to start working
from the day one of internship that's
what I'm telling planning is very
important you check out now as of now
there are two or three of my juniors and
batchmates who are in UK but they are
not able to get that slots slots are not
patient patient station slots are not
available so they have to wait for the
slots
how to start and everything uh we'll be
having a videos we'll be having one more
session so I'll be telling you in that
how to start and how to proceed ahead
don't worry about the preparation part
uh you can you can leave it to me you
can I I'll make sure that I'll I'll sail
you uh to the safest zone I'll give my
Hundred percentage so this is what I'm
doing from past eight to nine years
along with my team so I'll be available
for you all the time so we'll be
interacting so that's not a big deal
that's not a problem I'll help you out
don't worry
offline Center will take some time here
okay maybe probably if you are ready I
am ready to start I feel like Telangana
people are a bit lazy okay okay I need
to motivate them encourage them it's
going to take some time so if you are
ready if you guys are ready then we can
start or else we'll be starting after
finishing your final year exams
meanwhile you can start your proceedings
in online
maybe probably will take some in this
week we will keep one more session to
discuss about IMBD is it okay inbd will
take one hour time to talk about the
steps of invd or anything if you want in
specific either you have to book a slot
of mine okay or uh if if like if if 50
people or 100 people are coming then
it's okay then I'll come online and then
I'll discuss if 50 people minimum 50
people should be there for my session
I'll I'll announce I'll we can plan B
inbd will have lots of people
foreign
anything more
it definitely I mean look the more the
mode of content in offline and online
will be same navya content wise you
don't have much difference in online
offline we we teach the same content but
when you're talking to offline the
mentor will be with you the mentor will
be with you the impact will be more when
I'm talking online the impact will be
different
when I'm talking live the impact will be
different when I'm when I'm posted a
recorded video so probably I'll be
posting this as a recorded video on
YouTube
you watch a recorded video on YouTube
that's that impact is different when
you're talking live I'm talking directly
to navya now that impact is different so
prolab is different and when you're
talking live your Mentor is sitting in
front of you talking with you personally
that impact will be there when you have
chance to offline I strongly believe
repeaters has to come to offline the
impact will be more
online course is online course offline
course is offline first everyone
everything has its own impact like
that's what I'm telling comfort zone is
online break the Comforts and come out
is going to be offline so when you break
the Comforts chances of success will be
definitely more that's what I'm telling
nasik student cannot travel over every
day every week to Hyderabad to hear the
classes so nasik student has to go for
online but in the last two to three
months if they have chance they can come
to offline Central and we are here to
provide you the the backup support and
everything like we are we love to help
you and we are doing this from past
eight to nine years so that's what our
job is
