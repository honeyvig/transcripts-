I have acquired from the course in AI
for decision making from water will help
me take steps to expand my

and I have my whole startup infi before
starting my own business I gained some
experience in the management domain I
worked with leading automotive players
like Mahindra and Tata as a senior
manager after getting more than 16 years
of experience I started my own set of
businesses I already knew how to make
business decisions but I was not sure
about the benefits that AI can provide
in a business when I launched my AI
startup taking a certification course
made sense after much thought and
research I opted for the AI for decision
making withs the strategies and
applications course I definitely gain
knowledge about various AI tools and
Services I also enjoyed the course it
was an awesome experience with respect
to the content and syllabus very easy to
understand the flow from the experts the
instructions actually help you improve
your grasp on the content it stays with
you the real life examples they provide
help you understand better I learned
about Big Data machine learning and much
more at infinite AI we'll be providing
