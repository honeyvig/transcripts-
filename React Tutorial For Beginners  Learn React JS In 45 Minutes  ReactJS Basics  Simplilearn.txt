right so let's get started all right so
in this video we will learn what you
should do before learning theact then
react folder structure jsx then react
components then react props after that
we'll learn additional rendering and
then the rendering lists so without
further Ado let's get started all right
so before moving forward we need to
understand what is react so reactjs
often shortened to react is a JavaScript
library specifically designed for
building user interfaces that is uis
think of it as a collection of pre-made
building blocks that you can assemble to
create Dynamic and interactive web pages
unlike traditional web development where
you write out every detail on the page
react lets you focus on describing what
you want the UI to look like and it
handles the efficient updates behind the
scenes this makes building complex
interfaces faster and easy to maintain
all right now let's understand what you
should do before learning react so
before we start learning react it's
important to know a bit about HTML CSS
and JavaScript so basically HTML is what
we use to build the basic structure of
web pages in react you will use
something similar called jsx to create
your components so understanding HTML
will help you a lot then CSS CSS is what
makes your web pages looks nice by
adding Styles like colors fonts and
layouts knowing CSS means you can make
your react components look good too all
right now JavaScript JavaScript is a
language that makes web pages
interactive and dynamic since react is
built on JavaScript you need to
understand how to use it to handle
things like user interactions and data
changes if you have a good grasp of
these three technologies that is HTML
CSS and JavaScript you'll find it much
easier to learn and work with react but
you don't have to worry as we are
covering react from the basic so you
don't have to worry about that but a
basic understanding of these three
Technologies would help you all right
now we'll have to understand how to
start with theact that includes how to
download it and from where we'll have to
download it and so let's do that all
right so we'll go to Google and we'll go
for nodejs download you guys might be
confusing here like why we are
downloading nodejs so for that we'll
have to understand many things so we to
get started with Thea basically you need
to set up your development environment
which includes installing nodejs npm and
understanding npx so basically nodejs is
Javascript runtime that allows you to
run JavaScript on your server or a local
machine it's essential for developing
like modern application including uh
those built-in react so we'll have to
download it because we'll be using npm
and npx commands so npm is basically the
node package manager it's a tool that
comes with the nodejs it helps you
manage JavaScript packages and libraries
uh including react so basically for that
reason we'll have to download nodejs and
talking about npx that I uh Told You So
basically npx is like a tool that comes
with npm uh it started from version
5.2.0 and it allows you to run npm
packages without installing them
globally so this is useful for running
create react app without clustering your
system with unnecessary package so
basically if you npm is for managing
packages and npx is for uh like running
the packages so in short we can describe
this by this all right so we'll go to
nodejs download and you can download it
from here can find the download option
and you can easily download it I already
have it in my system so I'll not be
downloading it it's pretty simple you
have to download it and install it it's
very basic you don't have to worry about
that so once it's downloaded and
installed you can check by going to CMD
my link M
Chrome and here you can type node minus
V which will give you node version so
your version can be different from mine
depends how it is upd updated and new
versions come comes and goes so you
don't have to worry about that so mine
is V
2.6.1 you can check whether it is
installed or Not by doing this node
minus Fe if it is not installed it will
not display this all right now I hope
you have V Studio code so for any code
editor you can try but I believe Visual
Studio is much better than any other
code editor so I'll prefer that one only
so let's go to the visual studio first
so basically Al this is the interface of
Visual Studio code as we can see now if
we want to create a react app over here
as we have installed node chair so we
don't have to worry about anything else
so first of all uh you'll have to create
a folder where you'll be creating or
whatever changes you'll be doing your in
your project or something like that you
can keep it over there so first let's
create a folder we'll go to this and
here we'll go and we'll write new new
folder and we have created a folder in
the name of react cute all right all
right so basically this is our folder
react cute now we'll go to Explorer open
folder and we have selected the folder
we'll open the folder in react now what
we'll have to do is we'll basically go
to the
terminal and we'll use the commands to
create the react tab basically so we'll
have to pay attention or all right now
we'll go to the terminal and we'll write
npx create
react app then we can write the name of
the app I'm writing like my app you can
write any name as per your choice all
right now we click on enter so basically
uh my app can be replaceable with your
desired project name so yeah so
basically this command does several
things so uh basically downloads this
command basically downloads and runs the
create react app package and it will
also set up a new project with all the
necessary files and configurations so
we'll have to wait until it is done
completely so let's wait all right so
it's done so as you can see it is
written we suggest that you begin by
typing CD my app and PM start so
basically CD my app is used to navigate
to the project directory and uh then
there is npm start so we need to start
the development server so we use npm
start it will start the development
server to see your react application in
action so this command basically starts
the development server and opens your
default web browser at Local Host 3000
so you should like start with it you'll
have to type in this command CD my app
and then npm start all right so we'll
write CD my app or you just can copy
paste it from the above I'm typing all
right now we'll write n m start let's
just wait so a local host 3000 is here
and react app is started it is keep on
rendering all right so you can head back
over here all right now as you can see
inside this we have multiple things node
modules Publix SRC Etc so let's just
explore all of these things one by one
so as I told you earlier so so when
you'll create a react project you'll see
bunch of files and folders so
understanding these the structure will
help you know where to find things and
where to put your code so we'll start
with the first one this is node modules
basically so this folder contains all
the packages and libraries that your
project needs you don't need to touch
this folder it's managed automatically
by the package manager like npm or Jam
so then don't have to worry about it
then there is public folder so this
folder holds the static files of your
project it includes an index.html file
as we can see so uh this index.html file
is the entry point of your react
application any files you put here will
be like accessible directly in the
browser all right now after this there
is SRC folder we can see so this is
where you're all you'll spend most of
the time it contains the source code of
your uh react application and uh here's
like index.js is there so this is the
Javascript file where the react
application starts then app.js is there
so this is the main component app.js as
we can see so this is the main component
of your application you can think of it
as a container for all other components
and app.css this file will contain the
styles for the app component then index.
CSS this file contains the global styles
that apply to the entire application so
other files are also there you don't
have to worry about them like package.
so package.json you need to understand
so this file keeps track of your project
dependencies scripts and metadata it's
an important file because it defines the
project setup all right so this is dog
ignore uh this file tells git which uh
files and folders to ignore so they
don't get included in your version
control so yeah this is pretty much the
folder structure so now talking about
the entry point so the index. ml file
that I already discussed uh in the
public folder it is is the entry point
of your app the index.js file in the SRC
folder is where the react app is
bootstrap basically then the main
component the main component is app.js
you can say this file is the main
component of your application it can
contain other smaller components that
you can create all right then the
styling styling is app.css we can see
here it is app.css and index.css files
are used for styling your components you
can add more CSS files as needed so I
think this is pretty much what it is
about the folder structure now we'll be
proceeding with creating the react app
and understanding what are the things we
need to understand the react application
so all right now it's time we should
talk about GSX as well so GSX stands for
JavaScript XML it's a syntax extension
for JavaScript that looks similar to
HTML and is used in act to describe uh
what the UI should look like uh it lets
you uh write HTML like code within
JavaScript it makes uh it easier to
visualize the structure of the user
interface components so it basically uh
allows you to write HTML like code
directly inside your JavaScript files
for react like it makes describing what
your website should look like much
easier so let's just understand it with
the help of one example let's just
create a
file just simply have just created this
file we'll delete it later uh all right
so let me explain to you guys so here
we'll write two examples and then I'll
explain about uh jsx you can understand
it in a better way so cons let's say
element react create
element which one
hello
world all right now again const
element
right
hello world so what according to you
guys is much easier to write the first
one or the second one I believe you guys
have selected the second one right so in
both examples we are creating a an
element that displays the text hello
world as a heading H1 however uh the jsx
version is much cleaner and easier to
read because it resembles HTML so
basically this is not HTML this is jsx
as I told you that it lets you like
write like HTML like code directly
inside the JavaScript files so all
thanks to jsx we can write like this and
so let me do a bit breakdown for you so
we start an opening tag so as we can see
H1 and then we write the content we want
to display basically like we have
written hello world and we'll close the
tag simply that we do in HTML so
basically think of jsx as a special
instruction for react when you use jsx a
tool called bble often used with react
that translates it into regular
JavaScript that react understands so
this is what jsx is it looks like HTML
but it is not so yeah all right so let's
just delete it all right so now let's
understand about components so first of
all let's understand how to make one
we'll go to SRC create a new file and
let's name it gretings you can name as
per your choice jsx to create a
component we have to use jsx in the end
all right so this is the component and
this is the app.js comp app.js component
and this is G .js so uh talking about
this so a component in react are
basically the building blocks of react
app they can be functional that is the
simple function or class based that is
uh using es6 classes so we are going to
do uh with the functional component
itself so functional components return
jsx while the class components use
render method components use props to
receive data and can be composed
together to build complex user
interfaces for example that we'll going
to create one and I'll make you
understand what a component is and how
it is working it's all right so let's
get started so this is greeting. jss and
this is app. jss so basically we can
remove this one first we don't need it
right you can remove this as well all
right now greetings. jsx all right so
we'll start
import react from react after this the
name of the functional component is
greetings so function then the name of
the component greetings all right now
let's say I've written I'm going to use
a basic example first so that you guys
can understand it happy learning so this
is our function component and so now
we'll have to export it to the app.js so
we'll write
export default
greetings so we have exported this from
here and now we have to import this over
here so that we could receive it import
greetings all right now we can remove
this as
well greetings so this is how we can
write a component so the back slash is
over here and the name of the component
and inside the
tag kind of a format so as you can see
we have
included happy learning so what now will
happen is this happy learning will be
displayed over here in the app.js so
this is basically a building block so
similarly we can create many components
like gretings we can create some more
components and all we have to do is to
place over here we'll have to write the
name in the similar format so we can
include it over here and in the app
it'll display normally so so it will not
get cluttered with a lot of code we can
code I can write 100 lines of code over
here and all I have to do is just
include the name of that particular
component over here and it will
automatically displayed over here also
we have to write return statement like
this over here as well that is in the
component return now I hope it'll work
happy learning it is displaying as you
can see so this is a basic example of
what we call component now let's
understand what is props so uh react
props that is short for properties are a
way to pass data from parent component
to child component Ina they are used to
customize and configure the child
components think of it like arguments
you pass to a function so let's just uh
understand it with the help of fine
example so yeah we have to go to this
greeting function again so yeah we'll
have to change the code a bit so let's
just say we want to pass some props as I
told you it's like argument that you
pass to the functions so uh let's say I
want to pass name name is let's say
John
and just copy paste it another thing
that I want to pass is another name
three times we pass is Robert and here
Sid so I want want to pass these three
names as arguments to the greetings
function that is props so how should we
do that so we'll go to greetings and so
uh this code will not work basically so
what we'll do is greetings we'll have to
pass the props props will receive the
what we call names one by one so let's
just write like this uh hello and the
curly braces we can write the jsx props
do name and yeah now we can display the
names now let's save it and one by one
all these three names will be displayed
so here the first component the second
component third component it is the same
component but you're passing the
different names so let's see if it is
working or not so as we can see hello
John hello Robert hello Sid so these
three we have passed from here to here
props do name props do name so it is
receiving the names one by one name is
here it's like this so we are passing
from apps app.js and receiving props
over here so this is what props is
you'll be using it in a regular basis
when you're creating a react app or
making a project in react other thing is
this curly braces so uh the curly
brackets are used to embed JavaScript
expression within jsx so jsx as I told
you is a syntax extension for JavaScript
that looks similar to HTML and is used
to describe what the UI should look like
when you want to include Dynamic content
or execute JavaScript code within jsx
you need to use curly braces so keep in
mind if you're using uh HTML in
JavaScript you have to use these cly
Braes it'll it is jsx basically all
right so now let's understand about
conditional rendering so conditional
rendering in react means showing
different content or component based on
certain Condition it's like making
decisions in your codee about what to
display on the screen so if I'll put it
in simple words it's like conditional
rendering lets you control uh what shows
up on your screen imagine having a
different pre-built sections of your app
and you can choose which one to display
based on the certain conditions so uh
for that we'll have to create uh another
what we call this component so go to SRC
we'll click on SRC and then we'll open
create a new file and let's name this
file as packing list and we have named
this file as packing list so let's start
so first of all uh let me tell you you
can export in the end as well and the
starting as well I'm going to use it
over here export default function list
so yeah default spelling is not
correct all right function list not
function L it's packing list
yeah packing list but before this we'll
have to use
function all right so now the
Braes yeah so now we'll use return keep
in mind this is the syntax basically so
you'll have to keep in mind the
syntax all right now we'll use a section
tag I'll explain it to you guys why we
are using this section tag and what it
is and Yeah so basically we'll have to
do conditional rendering so we'll create
different scenarios all right
so let's say uh this is
saying
Sally rides packing
list all right so this is under
H1
and now item we are creating a component
basically inside a component so that
component would be I haven't created yet
would be
item so in item we'll write is packed if
it is
true you don't have to be worried guys
I'll explain it just be with me this is
let's say space
time or space suit okay we don't have to
use this we should use like this it's my
bad right similarly we'll have to do for
others as well just copy it paste it and
paste it so basically we'll be using uh
different scenarios so name the space
space suit over here and here we'll
write some other name let's say
helmet with a golden leaf okay now here
we'll write photo of t
all right so we'll have to enclose all
of these under a list I believe so let's
do
that an out
list so here let me explain to you guys
what we are doing so here this component
uh is defined as packing list so it
returns a section element containing the
packing list information inside the
section there's a H1 element displaying
the uh Sally's uh Ride Sally rides
packing list basically so next comes a
unordered list element that you guys
know for the items uh Inside So within
the unordered list there are three uses
of item components each use of item is
wbed in jsx as we can see uh and passes
props to configure the items display so
each of these are passing the props to
configure the items display the name
prop specifies the item name that is
example space suit and the is paged prop
as we can see is paged so is packed prop
determines if a check mark is shown true
or not that is true or false so uh as I
told you we'll be making another
component inside this component only so
uh the overall functionality would be
the packing list components create the
overall structure
and the title for the list it then
utilizes the item component three times
each time customizing it with the
specific item names and packing status
whether it is packed or not using props
the item component that we will be
creating now uh will display each item
based on the props it receives packed
items show a check mark while unpacked
items will be listed without one so
let's just create that one all right so
let let create over
here function
item inside this we'll be using the CES
name and his pack so these are the two
things that we are
passing all right now if condition is
there and inside if is bagged if is pged
is true then we should return a tick
mark basically uh all
right so I like class names so let's
name it like item only and we'll have to
use tick I don't know if we can do that
we'll write it
afterwards Li all right let's just write
take over here as of now right
so and in the else it would go like
return
last name
item here also we'll have to write the
name and along with this so that it is
shown uh the tick is shown in front of
the name that's why we are doing it all
right so it is done so the conditional
rendering thing is whichsoever name is
correct that only will be displayed as
the correct one others will not so it's
a conditional thing this is how this is
what we are doing in it so let's just
say this item one is true two is also
true three is also true let's just make
it
false so this one will not be ticked
correct correct it will not be uh
correct one these two will be the
correct one in front of this will be
displayed so we have used this if now I
repeat we have used this if so it is
conditionally rendering it all we have
to do is just to include it in
app.js so let's just do this we can
remove this one and now we can
write go packing list dot slacking list
so yeah just keep in mind that while
doing the importing thing import packing
list from do slacking list it'll go in
the files or folders wherever this file
is as we can see over here it is they
search for it and then it will include
it so the same format
packing list we have included it let's
just see as you can see Sally R packing
list space suit is done helmet with a
golden leave she hasn't packed yet photo
ifim is there so if we'll alter it let's
go over here and make it this one also
will make false and let's see if it is
depicted over here or not so as you can
see photo of team again is not correct
not she has not Tak
it with her so yeah this is what
conditional rendering is now let's
understand rendering list in react so
for that we'll be doing an example again
so we'll create a reusable component
we'll build basically we'll build a
shopping list and then we'll create a
reusable component to display a list of
items we'll use the map function to
iterate over our items and render them
as list items in a clean and efficient
way so for those people who don't know
what is map function so the map function
in react is like a conveyor belt for
your data it takes an array of items
sends them through one by one and lets
you create something new for each item
this something new is usually another
array but in react it can be jsx
elements to build Dynamic list or other
user interface structures so this is
this was about uh Maps so now let's
create another component all right so
let's go to SRC right click new file
list. jsx we are naming it list all
right so let's make a list so first of
all we'll again import react from react
all right now what we'll do is we'll
create the functional component function
list and all right
now we'll mention the
items so uh I'm going to explain to you
guys in a very basic manner because I'm
considering you guys are beginners so
I'll be using as simple example as I
could so yeah all right first let's say
apple then
avocado then
banana
grips then we can can say
ranges all right so we've used five
fruits we have mentioned a list or cons
or list of items basically you can say
the array of items as well
now we'll go on
return We Make a list unordered
list now inside this list we'll first of
all uh name it
class name all right class
name item
list all right now inside this we'll use
items do map basically because we want
to iterate over each of them so we'll
use a map function to itate over the
items that is Apple avocado banana one
by one so we'll do is
jsx so jsx we'll write
items.
map this is an arrow function I believe
you guys understand know about Arrow
functions all right
so all right this is key I'll explain it
to you guys what is key if you you guys
don't have any idea regarding it so
item class
name item and inside it we'll keep
the sorry inside the jsx we'll write
item that is basically the
array all right let's keep it short
only here also we'll keep it short item
all right
now I think uh we have we have wrote Mau
instead of map all right now what else
we'll have to do is we'll go to the
app.js basically and we'll do some
things over there so what are those
things will packing list we have wrote
we can exclude
that and go we'll write H1 don't worry
I'll explain that code to you guys you
don't have to worry about that
so first of all my shopping list now
inside this we'll write we'll basically
write the name of that component that is
list and we have to import it as well we
don't have to forget it import
list
from SL list so why it is showing me an
error because I think I have not
exported that we'll go and Export that
as
well
export
default
list as you can see there is no error
now go to app save it and let's see if
it is fine or not so as you can see my
shopping list Apple avocado bananas
grapes so this is how we can render a
list this is basically a
list basically this this is how we can
render a list in react so uh let me
explain it to you guys the list
component uh defines an array of items
containing list of items basically as we
can see so the return statement over
here uh uses GSX to create an unordered
list that is ul and we have named class
name as item list and we have do we have
done the CSS part but you don't have to
worry about that as we're focusing on
react now we use here the map function
to iterate over the items array where it
is as you can see here it is so uh in
this list we have use the map function
and inside the map function we create a
list Alli and inside the list element
for each item in the array we are using
the map function each list item has the
class name item and displays the current
items names using cly Braes so crucially
we add a key prop to each item list each
list item basically so the key prop
should be unique for each item and helps
react optimized performance when
updating the list that is why we have
used that in this case we use the item
itself as the key as you can
see so here again in app we have just
included the component name and imported
it so yeah this is how you
can render the list now let's understand
react hooks so here we'll be covering
UST state in react hooks so UST state in
react hooks is that allows you to add
state to function components it returns
a state variable and a function to
update it you initialize it with a
default value and react ensures that
state persist across rerenders so uh in
simple words like it has two parts
basically the state variable and the
state seter function you can also refer
it to as up data function so State
variable so this variable holds the
current value of the state you can use
it to read the state in your component
and the state Setter function which will
write next to it is the function that
allows you to update the state when you
call it with the new value we yet
reenders the component with the updated
state so I'll explain it to you guys
when uh we are writing it so let's start
with it all right now again let's create
another component go to SRC create a new
file. GSX all right now first let me
just explain it to you const count set
counter set count U state so when you're
using this use State uh in react you're
using the use State hook to add state to
a functional component this line creates
a state variable that is count and a
function set count this is set count to
update it initially you can set the
count to a variable by passing to used
State like whatever the value will be
here let's say zero so this zero value
will be assigned to this count it's the
initial value of this count all right
now and this is the set count function
it will update this count function so
whatsoever value uh will be passing from
this set count it will gets up reled to
this count it works like this so U
initially you can set this count using
the U State like UST State Z which sets
count to zero whenever you need to
change the value of count you call set
count with the new value this helps your
component remember values and update the
display when those values change so this
is how it works now let's write a proper
component regarding this all right
import react from react now we'll create
the
function function
counter all right return
statement so in the return statement
first of all we'll create a div and
inside that div we will be creating an
H1 tag inside that we'll be uh using the
count and after that we'll be using two
buttons that is one will increment and
the other one will be decrementing it so
basically let me tell you what we are
creating over here so here we'll build a
simple counter app we'll use a cool
react feature as we told you use state
to keep track of a number and create
buttons to increase it or decrease it
you'll see how this hook helps manage
the state within the functional
component with the help of this example
all
right Dev class
name all right let's name it counter
so in this one we'll write
H1 and we'll here this here we will
display the counter the current counter
basically so we'll write
count after this we'll make buttons
we'll create
buttons onclick so the buttons have the
on click functionality on click
this function will be called that is
handle click so we have wrote this
function inside jsx so what we are doing
is we're making it whenever we'll click
on the button that is on click C Capital
this function will be roked or called
and the definition of this function
we'll be creating after this so
similarly we'll create another function
let's just copy paste it because the
syntax is same and this time also uh
let's just write because we want one
function to increment it and another
function to decrement it so we'll write
handle
increment andle
decrement all right so we have created
two buttons now what we'll do is we go
over here and we'll create these
functions so let's let's first of all
create counter that US state basically
that we previously wrote
const
count then there is set
count U State we have initialized the
value of count with zero as we can see
and after that function we have to
create another function handle increment
so inside this function we'll write set
count count + one
so basically what this function will do
it will update the uh what we call count
state by one using the set count
function so this function handle
increment will call this and the set
count will update this count by one so
basically as I told you this set count
this one is the updator of count so when
we are clicking on handle increment
basically we are calling this function
and this function is again updating this
count so initially value was Zero then
it will become one again we'll click it
will become two again we'll click it it
will become three same goes for the
decrement so let's write the function
for decrement as well
function
handle
decrement all right so inside this again
we'll have to do the same thing set
count count minus one over here we have
to do
all right here again the update the
count state it will update the count
state by minus one using the set count
function so this is how it is working
and now let's see whether it will work
or not we'll have to uh add it in app.js
as well let's just write counter over
here
first all right now instead of list here
we'll write the name of the component
that is counter all right we'll have to
import it that is why it is showing the
error import
counter from do SL
counter all right it is showing errors
as we can see all right because we are
using UST State hook so we'll have to do
one thing more because we are using US
state
import
react US state
from
react uh another thing is this export
statements don't have to forget it keep
in mind export
default
counter all right new state is not
defined6
[Music]
27 all right so make sure to add this to
import it the hooks that is the use
state
then it will not show any error now
let's see if it will work or not all
right the buttons are very small uh okay
let's just add something in
it
and or we can also write decrement as
well all right now it is visible so on
clicking plus it is incrementing as you
can see in now let's click minus it is
decrementing as we can see it is also
going in minus wow so yeah this is the
counter that we have just created you
can also create it with the help of
react so all thanks to you state and it
is pretty easy to use it you can try
this on your own so all right that's a
great start for react with react
basically so we have covered some
fundamental concepts like compon on
hooks like UST State and many others
these are just the building blocks and
react offers vast toolbox for creating
Dynamic uis so I've also tried to make
things easier by going through some
basic example alongside you and play
around with those examples try modifying
them and see what you can build out on
your own there are tons of online
resources you can go for but make sure

I've mentioned earlier it will be a
onstop solution for all of you guys and
remember practice makes perfect and with
a little effort you will be well on the
way to mastering react all right guys
