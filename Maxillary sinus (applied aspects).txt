hi - this is a doctor Srikant from team
MDS conquer now I'm going to discuss
about the part 2 of maxillary sinus few
case based or applied best aspects of
maxillary sinus so the first important
aspect is as aise increases as ace
increases the thickness of the wall that
is present between the roots of
maxillary teeth and that of the
maxillary sinusitis decreases so when
you're talking about a case of auto and
rural communication or aura and true
fistula these cases are very very less
or very rare in the case of below 14
years okay but if you see in the adults
the bone thickness that is present
between the roots as well as the
maxillary sinus is just around one to
one point two centimeters okay
sometimes even lesser than that so
whenever you have when are your planning
to extract the maxillary teeth
particularly the the premolars as well
as the maxillary molars that is the
posterior teeth there are high chances
that you may lead to a communication
okay communication that is between the
oral cavity and to that of the sinus
which is called as or Oh Android
communication okay so that is one of the
important a plant I suspect that you
have to make a note and whenever they
are mid-facial factors we are going to
discuss about these mid-facial factors
in the next few in the next classes so
there are high chances that this wall
because this thin wall can easily right
okay so the next important aspect as I
was already discussing the thickness of
the wall of the maxillary sinusitis so
whenever there are swelling sore
whenever there are any patio pathologies
related to or adjacent to that of the
sinuses they lead to thinning of these
walls okay so whenever there is a
thinning of these walls the symptoms can
be easily exhibited on your facial
aspect that is particularly the cheek
the buccal aspect and the palatal
aspects and whenever the tumors okay
particular is already discussing about
the anatomy so then autumn a where where
you were
roof the roof of the maxillary sinus is
found by the orbital wall so whenever
there are tumors related to the
maxillary sinusitis which lead to the
expansion of this roof okay so they'll
leave they mainly to exophthalmos or
diplopia and some sort of signs and
symptoms related to the site and I and
coming to the root lens in some cases
the floor of the sinus lies between the
roots of the same tooth or the IG Center
okay so you can see that maxillary sinus
will be like this okay so that the roots
there on the radiograph the roots
assumes to be inside the floor of the
wall and most of the periodical
infections in the in the maxillary teeth
can cause or can communicate or while
extracting they're high chances that
they can lead to or internal
communication right so a few more
applied aspects if you take the line
okay the line that is drawn from the
median canthus okay the median canthus
of the eye to that of the angle of the
mandible if you draw a line to this and
if you divided it into anterior and
posterior because this particular line
or plane is basically used to help in
prognosis and the tumors that lies
anterior to this have better prognosis
when that when compared with the tumors
which lies posterior to it okay so this
is an applied aspect okay
so apart from this okay has already
discussed about this particular diagram
that the roots assumes to be inside the
wall and that is one question that is
given in 2014 or 2015 AAPC I think so
humanization of maxillary sinus and set
what is okay that is at 16 to 18 years
okay so the floor of the maxillary sinus
appears to be moving around roots and
giving that the appearance that the
roots of the maxillary teeth penetrates
into the sinus floor so apart from this
you can you can see the surface contour
of the soft
shoe structures in the maxillary sinus
by using a contrasting agent against the
air-filled spaces because air will be
marred in a different way and your fluid
and soft tissues will be marked in a
different way on the radio so this
particular effect can also be asked as a
question so these are the new terms that
you have to add to your notes right so
that's all for now we'll be coming up
with the part three
