foreign
in this tutorial we are going to cover
the exciting new features of next.js
so let's jump into it
so hello everyone welcome back to
another video by simply learn this is
anubhub and in this video we are going
to talk about next year's new features
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and
press the Bell icon so you will get all
the updates from SIM dealer so for
today's video we will obviously use
nexjs13 and with that I am going to use
Tailwind CSS
but before that if you want to become a
software developer consider the course
on full stack developer mean stack by
simply learn and master those necessary
skills
check out the link in the description
box now I'll tell you how to install the
next JS into your system
the first thing you need to download is
node.js just search node.js download and
open this page
here you will find two options
open this link
here you will find two options
recommended for most users and latest
version so we have to download the
recommended one actually no JS is
already installed in my system but I'll
show you how to install it so if you are
a Windows user Apple user or Mac User or
Linux or any other user you can
differentiate between them okay now
when you'll install this node.json to
your system to check whether it is
installed or not in your terminal you
just have to open the terminal and write
a command node hyphen V
okay let me just show you inside my
terminal
would you have to write to check just
write node
hyphen V
and this or some other version will come
on your screen and if it shows you
version then it is installed cool
now the next step is you should have a
code editor in your system like I have
Visual Studio code so where you can
write the code right
so there are so many code editors
available but my personal favorite is
Visual Studio code and I recommend this
only after downloading and installing
the vs code open the web editor and now
we are going to write a command to
install nex.js
so I'm gonna write
npx
create
next
app at latest
and then I'm going to press
enter
so it will ask me the project name so
I'm gonna write next yes
I'm going to press enter
it is telling me do I have to add
typescript in this project I am going to
say yes
now eslint I'm going to say yes yes
laboratory okay
and now
it will install all the dependencies so
let's wait couple of minutes
while they are installing
so
our next year is is install in our
system
now let's go to this folder which is
next.js
okay we can find the
position because I have put the space CD
next.js and I'm inside my folder
now I'm going to open my folder here
so my
folder is inside
this only this is
select folder
and my folder is here
now
to install Tailwind in your system we
need to add the command
let's open the terminal first you can
just press Ctrl and backed it
but it's not opening here yeah opened
okay now write a command npm add
Tailwind CSS
or css and Auto
fix
pre-fixer
let me just read this command again
Tailwind CSS
or css Auto prefix okay
let's press enter
and it will again install all the files
that we need okay
now let's configure Tailwind CSS for
that write a command
X
Tailwind
PSS
in it
t
yes
so
it is showing me the version this
is fine
now here
I have written this command again
to add the
teluguin CSS file okay
so this is in BX Tailwind now let's
open the file
Tailwind
CS config.js now in this file in this
array content I am going to write some
lines of code
just write it I'm also going to add this
file in the description box so don't
worry about the code just
see
okay
let's add Js
is obviously type in JavaScript
DX
and jsx what is jsx it is a JavaScript
in JavaScript sorry it is a JavaScript
extension
and now I am going to add
typescript hit stage
right
okay
now let's add a comma here
let's make it inside this line and this
is really good
now and I'm going to add once
another
okay
ready I am going to tell you about
everything here so just relax
this is what I'm going to tell you about
the routing and all
okay
so this is
just a minute
okay
oh yeah
yeah Dave's Creed TSX
DSX
yeah
just save this part again
now
the next step we are going to do is
after saving this file I'm going to open
my file which is
Global dot CSS okay
and on the top of this file I'm going to
add
till when
when base
art tell me
components
so I I'll first tell you guys okay
adding this in this way at the top
is for the configuring till when
okay
so we're just configuring it the
components the base and other things
utilizers after this
and you can
tell when
you know what is this
let me just show it
relativity
okay fine
it's cool
let's save this file first
so this is all you need to do
to add okay
let's open the file
okay
close this one
next config.js
and
things look great here okay
now let's again open the terminal
and now I'm going to run this
effect for that I'm going to write npm
run there press enter
and let's wait a couple of minutes
it's just making our project ready
for the running under server
foreign
let's see if it is compile it is
compiled successfully
okay
now let's
open window
yeah
this okay
let's
split the file
like this
okay
it's fine
now we're going to start doing the
routing first I am going to tell you
about the routing fundamentals
so next is introduced a new file system
based router built on top of react
server components with support for
layouts nested routing uh loading States
error handling and more
so we are going to first see
the main parts of routing okay let's
start with the static page routing okay
so first thing that we need to do is
let's create
in this arboretry
let's name it as
okay
count
and inside this account I'm going to add
one file
page Dot
TSX
okay
inside this and I'm going to write
export
the default
async
function then I'm going to write the
name of the function
which I'm going to add is
okay let me just
let's write let's see
and set this I'm going to create
return
now inside this I'm going to add one
depth
let's say write an H1 so you can see it
clearly
not sure okay let's write this one here
same design page
let's save it
okay let me just see everything is right
here yeah now let's create another
folder inside this app menu
let's create one
let's name it skill up
okay now let's first just copy this
thing inside this
scalar we need to add one file and we
will write
data TSX
okay now
okay
so this file is not created
again here it is
Dot
TS6
now I'm gonna paste that code here also
here in this name of the function I'm
going to change as
good
okay
and I'm going to prepare right
oh
pitch let's just save this file
and let's open this terminal where I'm
going to write
count
it is automatically working
right
and as you can see here it is clearly
shown best welcome to simple learn page
so this is what a static
routing looks like and I'm going to
change from accounts to Skiller
now let's see
yeah
so this is working
fine now let's create another folder
inside this
scale up folder for that new folder and
I'm gonna write this as ID
okay let's just delete this one and
and have
inside the bracket
see it's coming like that only okay
let's leave this one
and let's create another folder called
ID inside this
now let's do the dynamic routing for
that inside this app folder
will create another folder
let's name it product
okay
products
now inside this product I'm gonna add
one more folder which is
ID in the brackets
so what these brackets is doing is which
is helping us to do the dynamic routing
okay so let's create a page now we are
going to create
a file
let's name it
page
dot TSX once again
and inside this I'm going to write short
and s f c
okay it's not the right one so let's
just delete this
and right here export
and fold
async
function and let's name it
product
product page okay let's just
because we have done in every file the
name is this the product page now what
we're going to do is
we're going to add this prints and the
curly brackets so the function structure
let's just give it some space let's just
okay
fine let's create a constant of ID
and
yeah
dot ID
I'm going to show you how to do the
dynamic routing you know page
so let's flip down here
again
we're going to write div
yeah
so
okay this is not inside the curly
brackets I'm going to remove the code
they've got it from here now it's fine
yeah okay
okay I'm going to read
this
is a simply line
of course
page
and with the ID that is
required okay
now save it and
let's go to the Chrome
here and put products okay
so enter but this is the error that I'm
getting you must all will be getting
this error this is all because I haven't
this okay let's save this I think it's
working fine now
so let's just
add the number
10 so it is showing
this simple learn course page ID
which is I have written 10. so this is
simply learns course page 10 okay so
this is what a dynamic programming look
like
this is how the dynamic routing works
you can use it whether with parameter or
ID
okay or arguments you pass that in the
routes with the retrieve or the relevant
of the corresponding data
okay
in this case it was the ID
now let's move ahead
now let's see the next part which is
nested layout so
what I'm gonna show you is let's write
here
this is features
and I'm gonna open the
page and here you will just see this
line
next.js has all the tools you need to
make the web faster
okay
all right
yeah
so
the first thing is client server
rendering okay
the next one is nested routing data
fetching building optimization
typescript support API routes middleware
node.json edged runtimes CSS support
this all's Commander
next years with the help of Yap okay so
now what we are going to do is we are
going to study about the
nested layouts okay
after that we will learn about client
and server entering and then streaming
UI and suspense on This Server then
we'll study data fetching and then API
routes
okay
let's move ahead onto our code
now
for nested layout
now a react model allows us to
deconstruct a page into a series of
components like we have created here
okay
and many of these components are often
used between pages
like I have created one page here and I
have create one page this one page here
okay I have created few pages like this
okay so these are the components that
often used for the pages
like for example you might have the same
navigation bar and footer on every page
right if I'll create one web page and
there are so many other web pages inside
that like for products and for the one
that product specific product and like
that only the footer should be same in
every
page so for that we use nested layouts
so this is how next is leverage on
nested layout okay
so let's talk about the client and
server side components
this topic is the widest and the most
talk about
now let's just okay first let me give
you an example if you know react you
must have worked on the client side
projects
or client components okay we will just
let me give you an example or let's
create a folder inside this app I'm
gonna create a folder
let's name it as
it's right here
home great
and here I'm gonna write
B dot d s x
I haven't gonna write export
default
is it
function
you need this datas
and page
and inside the parameter I'm gonna cut
this because I'm not gonna
put the parameters right now
let's return
again I'm gonna add one there here
and here I'm going to write in H1 done
and this is a page
let's save it
and inside this let's
check this one
okay this is a home page right so till
now this is what we have discussed
earlier also right
now I'm gonna write the client component
inside this home file folder I'm again
gonna create another file let's name
this file as
not Pages this name it as
of course
Dot
bsx okay
now let's import
react
let's first just to create one
and export
default
let's just try the basic structure here
first
okay
okay
let's here
[Music]
yeah I'm gonna raid
put it down
okay till now I'm not doing anything new
now
here I'm gonna write
you state
we create real diamond applications like
this only
so inside this
create a constant
count
set count
okay
let's use this view state
inside this let's write numbers only
but the end should not be kept till now
let's try it right zero
okay let's save it and here inside this
there
I'm gonna create another disk
let's write this
course come
course count
okay after that here I'm gonna write
count
okay
and now
I'm gonna create
the div
for button
okay
now
I'll write here
add button I'm going to create and
inside this
so I'm gonna write on click function
which will set not Capital no
said count
okay
as
I'm gonna show you and see going the
count plus one
so I have declared one function here
what this is doing is it is counting
plus one again and again
grade and here
lead over error function
right
let's declare it
here
on the escort
yeah
it looks good
let's just cut this one here so I can
see this
now let's save this file first
and then
let's go back to this inside the home
one
I'm gonna
read here
let's let's close it
okay
and after that I'm gonna write a client
component here that we have just created
push
okay
so let's import that
only
probably let me just here what station
let's import
of course okay
let's just save it and it will
showing us an error that
we can't use the
use
state
so we are only using the
component of client here
so that's the reason we are getting the
so to remove these kind of errors
what you have to do is open your page
and here
I'm gonna declare
use
let's now save it and you can see this
working fine right
awesome
so the error that we saw earlier was
because after next year is 13 version
all the server components are run on the
app directory on our server component by
default
okay
so let's move forward
so this is how no
so let's check yeah it's working fine so
this is a client component okay
server and client component allow
developer to build applications that
span the server and client combination
the rich interactivity of client-side
apps with the improved performance of
traditional server rendering
this pH that we have just now created
has the server and client components and
how to use them in next application this
is what I have explained you okay
now let me just tell you what client
components are in the end
so client component enables you to add
client-side interactivity to your
application
in next days they have prevented on the
server and hydrate on the client
you can think of client component as how
just next 12
like you can just think of just client
components as how next js12 and previous
versions worked okay now
talk about server components server
components allow developer to build
leverage server infrastructure for
example
leverage dependencies that previously
would impact the JavaScript bundle size
on the client side
instead remain entirely on the server
leading to improved performance
when a route is loaded with next.js then
initial HTML is rendered on the server
the HTML then progressively enhance the
browser
right allowing the client to take over
the application and add interactivity by
asynchronously like we did here
okay
so by this
additional JavaScript is only added as
client-side interactivity is used in
your application through client
components
now
I'm going to tell you about why to use
server versus react component
the server components are based because
it because it fetches data and it is
better than client components because it
access backend resources and server
components are best because it keeps
information sensitive on the server like
access tokens API Keys Etc or comes
under server components but
add interactivity and event listeners
like on click on change that we have
just done here
one on click
okay
this is a client component and uh in
client component we can use browser only
apis
we can also use custom hooks that
depends on state effects or browser only
apis
we can also use react class components
right
okay let's move ahead now we'll talk
about data fetching data fetching in
next.js allows you to render your
content in different ways depending on
your application use cases
these includes pre-rendering with server
side rendering or static regen
generation and updating or creating
content at runtime with incremental
static regeneration
now we'll see
what comes into this next.js
so
if you want to use the fetch function
you can just write anywhere like
let's see
if here I'll create one okay let me just
give you an example
if I am here writing let me just find
one file
okay
so where we can add this part
okay
okay
let's add it here
Okay so
if we'll write we have to face data we
will write const
source
the weight function
in this await function we'll write Fetch
and then in the parenthesis with the
back tag I am going to give like
for example
opening simply learn
and here
just let me add one video inside link
okay let's do open this one
and let's copy the URL
and paste it
here
okay
so after pasting this one let me just
this
okay
so it's showing
to level up because we are not using any
parents uh any other functions with this
so
we'll add the parenthesis of the video
like from where to where we have I want
to fetch this one
or everything
so let me just give you the brief about
it
just a second
so let's open this one first okay
so here inside the back end I am going
to declare one key
to clear one see here with the tallest
sign
and the
in the curly brackets
I'm going to write
key
I am passing the key here
okay
after that
and right and and then I'll write
part
which I want to
snip
again dollar sign
early brackets and the part
select okay
right here
okay
and the video ID I'm gonna declare it
so again I'm gonna add the
dollar sign
and then curly bracket starts okay and
we'll let it
and
and
video
ID
put it like this start yeah
so
I will
write
video
right
now
again we'll add the comma here and we'll
declare the next yes
re-validate function
for that
that's right next
oh really curly where it starts I really
did
and then we'll add the
numbers from where to where so I have
added 30 here okay and then let's close
this
right
so this is how we add the
data fetching function
now I have to fetch this also this is
what I have declared here right I have
to fetch this also
so for that I am going to write
if
okay
so if
this resource that we have just now
declare cons
this
will is stored okay
and
throw
new
error
and we'll write the error and it should
through when it get failed so fail to
fetch data right
now
if not
it will return
resource dot text
okay
yes
so
this is the function
how we can fetch the data right
now okay let's move ahead on
data switching client server
let's now move ahead to API browse
middleware is done let's talk about
API layouts okay
okay
now
let's create another
file
okay and let's name it as
hello Dot
d s okay
no but before that I am going to tell
you what the API routes are so API
routes provides a solution to build your
API with next.js okay any file inside
the folder is mapped to API and will can
treat it as API endpoint instead of a
page
so I'm gonna show you right here how to
use that okay
so for example let's import the files
first I'm going to import
type
is one PPI next
yes this one
okay and let's just
cut it and then next is coming okay
let's cut this one
okay
I think this this because we need one
more right there which is
next
response for responsible next API
response from next years
right now
I'm gonna add here
type or the data
let's say type
data
equals to
it is
let's name it
is free
right
now we'll export the
Handler function
code
and look
okay no not the Sprint we need straight
brackets
now we'll request for
a guide request then we will write
response
and then we'll responds
next API response and then data which is
string name String okay
let's close this one
and then here
I'm gonna declare
Pawns latest
so I am going to declare
300 or 3000 anything then j7
I'm gonna write name
okay so I'm going to declare my name
here as a number
okay I'm going to come under
okay
okay
let's see what's happening here
right simply
time to check whether our API is
fetching here or not this is compiled
successfully let's save this file also
okay
let's cut it
from here
let's run this file and see
that our file is working or not okay
first we'll write API slash
hello
so let's click it and see yeah it's
fetching
name
simply
so you can write anything to fetch the
API so the request and response is
I have told you earlier also it is a com
incoming message to the server and the
request is some is plus some pre-built
middle ways and response is an instance
for Server response plus some helper
functions okay so finally I would say
next.js is great when you want a static
website with many updates so with this
