mother of a premature baby postm of
depression I have come over with the
support of my parents and my husband who
Stand By Me as a rock so that I can
cherish my dreams I upgrade myself I
took certification with simply learn and

computer application from vatna
University recently I have completed
mtech from bit Pani uh coming to my
family background I come from um jagat

my father was a reti her master and uh
my mother is a homemaker uh my uh
sibling uh I have a younger sibling then
I'm married my husband is working as it
professional and I have a six-year-old
son uh my father um with educational
background and teacher himself he is
knowing the value of education so he
instilled the educational values with in
us so that we can get the better
education me and my sister uh as I told
you I am mother of 6-year-old right he
came as a premature baby to our world so
that we are not prepared of we are
thought like we'll get a full grown baby
really we are blessed he's almighty's
Miracle but uh uh he's like uh he came
as a premature baby and entangled with O
and Sirens of U NICU so that um I
couldn't digest and I went through postm
postum
depression I have I have started crying
off out of no reason that time my
strongest pillar came as my husband my
parents and even though they are far
from me my in-laws they are supporting
me a lot if girls are surrounded with
family uh who are giving um what light
to them so they can come over it I have
joined uh um was Fargo as a senior
developer but the journey was becoming
quite monotonous uh I wanted to explore
the path fortunately Co era gave that
time to reinvent my career so that time
I thought of going to uh a process
oriented role and which is the scum
master I'm having a development
developer background I was not having
that much knowledge to go for that so I
thought of upscaling myself and
upgrading myself myself for for uh uh
scrum Master role I was searching
through the LinkedIn and uh from
LinkedIn I come to know about simply
learn and from Simply learn I went to
the website and searching for whatever
simply learn is offering the courses and
I was searching that in Midnight
actually and uh fortunately the next the
morning the first call I got from the
coordinator that okay you want it to be
certified yes uh I told yeah uh let's do
that
2022 March that uh I did the
certification for CSM and I thought of
to go one step ahead and uh then I Jed
open going for uh a PSM that is
professional scrum Master offered by
scrum.org uh and it is also having
another two uh psm2 and psm3 I'm also
aiming to do that uh this year from
access management domain to scrum domain
uh I have moved and uh this uh scrum
Master role was uh one step ahead of the
developer role which I got because of
the certification the knowledge I got
through the process being a working lady
uh actually we should have the support
system where we can explore ourselves
fortunately I am uh blessed with such
family system and my husband uh plays
the P role in that the time and whatever
the effort apart from my job is taken uh
by my six-year-old and uh I try to uh
spend as much as time possible with uh
the kid apart from that I have recently

writing first we should have the dreams
what we want to chase then only your uh
goals will be
clarified and uh dreams are the one
which will ignite the Flames uh of
