advantages of social media marketing
first off social media marketing
provides great brand awareness now with
the help of interactions with people on
social media brands are able to build up
their reputation as businesses and with
each interaction each post each share
the brand is exposed to a larger network
of potential customers who might be
interested in the products or services
offered

website marketing your products or
services on social media will also
attract customers to your website

the direct correlation social media
marketing does have a part to play and

content people will start liking and
sharing it and this will in turn bring
it to the attention of influencers

to write about your business and then
this gives you backlinks which as you
know will help you improve your search
engine rankings
next it will give you improved
conversion rates and with your brand
being much more visible and interactive
on social media every text image video
or comment could potentially Drive users
to your website
social media also humanizes your brand

interact with your brand on social media
it provides you with an opportunity to
show compassion for your customers

in a positive light and can go a long
way when it comes to humanizing your
brand
social media marketing is also cost
effective
compared to other forms of digital
marketing social media marketing offers
some of the most flexible and relatively
low-cost options available

marketing and business expenditures and

now let's go into the social media
marketing tips and tricks
number one set up your goals
now what good will your actions do if
you don't have a goal in mind the goal
of your marketing strategy may be the
driving force behind every decision that
you make and this is exactly why setting
up goals is very important moreover your
marketing efforts have to align with the
goals of the organization
here are some things that you need to
keep in mind while setting up your goals
first of all your goals need to be
quantitative for example you need to
have a thousand conversions by the end
of the quarter or 5 000 followers on
Instagram by the end of the month and so
on
number two you need to stick to a
consistent deadline this gives weight
for each of your options number three
make sure your goals are smart now smart
refers to specific measurable attainable
relevant and time-based
now let's go to number four like I
mentioned earlier your goals need to be
aligned with the marketing strategy
and alongside these goals there also
needs to be the North Star metric now
what is the North Star metric well this
represents a main goal or a fixed
reference point to ensure that your team
is on the right course this North Star
metric will also give your team Clarity
and focus
now let's have a look at some popular
North Stars there's increased engagement
greater conversion rates more leads
generated app downloads and so on
now let's go to number two understanding
your audience
social media allows you to interact
engage and build relationships with your
Audience by understanding what they need
want and desire you can deliver content
in a way that makes your product or
service the answer that they're looking
for
there are also other ways that you can
understand them better
this could be surveys to determine the
issues that bother them the age
demographics of Their audience
by conversing with them in forums
responding to their comments and blogs
and social media taking up their
feedbacks of suggestions into
consideration and acting on them and so
on
now here's an example of different
channels and the audiences that use them
now here well we've taken a personal
example here is simply learn now simply
learns audience is predominantly working
professionals and graduates
unacademy has high school graduates and
baiju app has high school students as
users
now let's go to number three determining
the right social media platform
now when performing social media
marketing choosing the right platform is
really important
When selecting them you need to ask
questions like why you're using that
particular platform who you will reach
with this platform what content could
work best on the platform and is there
any content that was unique to that
platform like for example YouTube and
then there's the video
answering these questions will help you
zero in on a platform for you
now while there are several platforms
available for you to choose from let me
tell you about some of the major ones
there's LinkedIn Facebook Instagram and
Pinterest
now let's talk about the purpose of each
of these platforms
LinkedIn is a professional Network
that's best suited for B2B audiences
for Facebook well just about everyone
has an account on it
content that is related to news or
entertainment usually finds success on
Facebook and then we have Instagram
visual content works best on Instagram
now although it works well for static
images and short form video It Doesn't
Really drive a lot of traffic to your
website
and then finally we have Pinterest
Pinterest is also limited to static
images however it's highly effective at
driving traffic to your blog
now let's go to number four setting up a
social media calendar
a social media calendar demands the
message you want to convey to your
audience it also consists of information
regarding the different kinds of content
that will go up on the social media
platform
let's have a look at some of the most
popular types of posts on social media
first off we have competitions now I'm
sure all of you have seen posts like tag
a friend who does this or comment or
like to win something and stuff like
that competitions like these provide
great opportunities for engagement with
the audience and they can be used to
increase your followers to share your
content it could also be for them to
create their own content along with the
predefined hashtag in competitions help
grow your presence on social media then
we have polls and surveys
polls can help you if you need a
collection that also encourages
followers to take action and interact
polls and surveys also provide
opportunities through which you can
learn from customers to understand what
they like about the product or service
or what they don't and to receive their
feedback and then we have videos and
live streams although we'll be covering
this in a little more detail further on
visual storytelling along with videos
and live streams goes a long way to
drive engagement among your audience
these will help get your followers
attention increase trust and credibility
and have a high response rate and has so
much more to offer live stream with its
live nature and having a human face
alongside your business humanizes your
brand and by extension helps increase
customer loyalty and trust and then
there is infographics articles and
images
so social media calendars are successful
because of their ability to increase
collaboration within the team help
understand what works and what doesn't
and in distributing resources in an
effective manner

a lot of information in the simplest of
forms visually using pictures and videos

message quickly and remember it for a
long time afterwards visual storytelling

small businesses or startups to manage a

clients business or for yourself as a
social media expert or any expert that
you um that you are positioning yourself
as so that's the introduction let's get
going into the action so let me start
with a simple question
out of these four social networking apps
which one do you think is the old one
out yeah when you look at Facebook
Instagram YouTube and WhatsApp which one
is the odd one out from a social media
networking app perspective
yep and the right answer of course is
WhatsApp because WhatsApp is a messaging
platform yeah and what is a messaging
platform do in between social media
platforms like Facebook Instagram and
YouTube well very simple the answer is
that WhatsApp and messenger Facebook
Messenger for instance nowadays are
considered social media apps as well
yeah so in WhatsApp you can communicate
and engage with your friends and with
groups you can promote your business in
there so they are fully blown social
media networks yeah just a little trivia
to get the the juices going so there we
have it so what I always do when I talk
about social media marketing yeah I've
um I'm talking about Trends from a from
a quite a generic perspective
I've been in digital marketing social
media from the very early days yeah I
was one of the first to demo the
internet when I worked in Silicon Valley
in 1995. yeah we call when the web was
launched in 1995 we talked about a
presentational web yeah you created a
website for your business to present
your business and that was what the web
was it was very much like one way you
could go on the web and you could find
any information that you like yep and
that you need it now in the early 2000s
we saw rep 2.0 emerging which is the
conversational web
it happened in the conversational web we
saw social media coming yep so it was
Facebook was Twitter there were some
um some other social media networks that
no longer exist but it was all about
getting into conversations with your
clients or with um with other people
that share similar interests so that was
the conversational web and that led to
the growth the phenomenal growth of
social media
and then nowadays today we're talking
about web 3.0
yep and web 3.0 is what we call the
virtual reality web
Facebook bets heavily on the virtual
reality web through the metaverse it's
that important for Facebook that they
even change their name as a company they
are now called meta as a company so the
meta first is Mark Zuckerberg's Vision
to actually meet people in a virtual
world and you can see each other in this
virtual world currently probably still
with virtual reality glasses or a
virtual reality headset but where will
the future go yeah so instead of typing
text or sharing photos in your news feed
you're stepping into a virtual world
where you can meet your friends anytime
anywhere
so really exciting still a long way to
go but consider that web 3.3.0
and social being interaction engagement
is a core part for that yes social media
although social media websites social
media platforms may come and go the
basic concepts of social media they are
here to stay
yeah social media has led to a
fundamental change in the Way businesses
engage with their clients yeah and how
they interact with their clients and
we'll get deeper into that when we go
into the definition of social media
marketing for now let's look at where we
are today with the social media networks
and I always use this slide for that it
is the most popular social media
networks worldwide by monthly active
users
and I want to emphasize the monthly
active users because that is what is of
Interest
I'm not interested in how many people
have subscribed to a network there may
be robots that have subscribed to it
yeah what I am interested in is that how
many people are actually using it on a
monthly basis
and you can very clearly see yeah
Facebook of course is the biggest social
media Network platform but if I look at
this slide I see three major trends
the first Trend I see is the sheer size
of Facebook
yeah because Facebook is not just number
one when it comes to social media
networks worldwide but there is also
WhatsApp on number three there is
Instagram on number four and there is
Messenger
um as well yes so you see the share size
of Facebook is enormous and they are
driving the changes in social media lens
although some of the Innovation may come
from other social media Networks
yeah the
um the big Drive is
from Facebook
the second Trend that I see here is if I
look at number two which is YouTube
yeah to me that says video is one of the
most important types of content being
used in social media these days if I
combine that with the importance that
Facebook gives to video yeah there's no
doubt that video is the preferred type
of communication on social media
networks and let's look at ourselves
yeah we prefer to watch a video then
read a lengthy article yep with about a
particular topic so if you are not on a
video in your social media marketing
strategy you're really missing out on a
tremendous opportunity
yep so that's Trend number two the
importance of video and the third Trend
I see is the importance of messaging
there you see number three is Messenger
you see number five is
um there is Facebook Messenger there's
also WeChat from China yeah so it is
very important these days to understand
that messenger is considered a key
social media platform and that
businesses use messenger in their
communication and the power of using
messaging in your marketing Outreach is
that it allows you to have one-on-one
conversations with your customers you
can reach an audience yeah you can reach
a big audience through Messenger but
once they respond you get into
personalized conversations
and that is how Facebook is seeing
messenger yeah as where in messenger you
have your one-to-one communication with
your best sort of friends where on
Facebook platform itself you more have
like Community title style conversations
okay so another few things that you see
in this slide is to be of course the
emergence of the tick tock yeah you see
the presence of
um Snapchat of Twitter of Pinterest but
the main thing that I miss here actually
is where is LinkedIn on this chart
and if I look at the original graphic of
this charge you see that LinkedIn is in
there and remember LinkedIn May probably
have more than 300 million subscribers
but not all subscribers are actively
engaging and using the platform on a
monthly basis so from a monthly active
users perspective LinkedIn does not
feature on this chart and that is one of
the biggest challenges that LinkedIn has
yeah to get people to engage with the
platform
welcome back to all these social media
networks later where I'm going to give
you a quick overview of what it what it
is and what it does
okay so let's have a look at what social
media marketing actually means what is
it yeah and we've got to put this in the
context of the definition of marketing
yeah I studied Marketing in the very
early days in the 80s and um my main
sort of Guru in marketing was Philip
kotler and over the years marketing has
sort of developed from traditional
marketing to online marketing but to
basic concept has not changed if you
look at the definition of marketing it's
the activity of creating
communicating
delivering and exchanging offerings
that have value for customers
yeah so you supply you deliver you
exchange products or services that have
a value for your customers
so two very important aspects here there
is value and there is customer and that
is what we capture in the marketing
concept you put the customer at the core
of what you do
yeah because when you do that you
automatically will look at what value
are we giving to the customer
yep so take social media marketing in
that context
then the second part of the social media
marketing
sort of term is the word social media
what is social media when I explain
social media I'm using the three C's the
three C's of social media marketing and
they are content they're community and
campaigns
content is the fuel of your social media
content is the
um the currency of social media if you
have really good content that you can
share on the internet
you're using various multiple multiple
social media channels like Facebook like
YouTube or like video or like Instagram
or blogging you name it yeah people will
engage with your content
and then when people start engaging with
your content they may come back for more
content that you supply and they will
then become part of your community so
Community is a very important aspect of
your social media definition
with really good content you can create
communities
and then you can push that process by
running campaigns
yeah and the campaign makes it relevant
for businesses
because when you run a campaign you have
a goal for your campaign you have an
objective you have a star date you have
an end date
yep and that is what social media
marketing is it's all about running
campaigns to develop your communities
with really exciting content
and then you put it into the marketing
context you do that if it's a customer
that in the core of what you do
yes so if I then take that to a
definition of social media marketing
is
very basic it says the use of social
media to develop a company's brand
increase website traffic and boost sales
that is what we call social media
marketing
yeah the most important aspect here is
that you need to have an outcome you
need to have a result which is customer
related
and that is where the sales element
comes in you do this to get the customer
to do something and in the end that is
buying your product or your service
yeah so social media marketing is not
the technical
combination of your social media
networks you had to
um to reach as many people that needs to
be a goal to it and when we talk about
marketing it comes down to selling your
product or service with a value
yeah so that HD
um kind of the call to action as it were
that comes out of your social media
marketing so keep that in mind
everything you do with your social media
marketing in the end comes down to
reaching your goals or achieving your
objectives of developing your company's
brand increasing website traffic or
growing your sales
now a big
benefits that you're getting these days
in digital marketing and social media
marketing is data
is intelligence
is knowledge
in the early days of marketing the
biggest problem has always been how to
measure the success of your marketing
campaigns if I ran adverts in a magazine
how do I measure the effectiveness if I
do a PR campaign and they write about me
in the newspaper how do I measure the
effectiveness of that how can I track
that when somebody buys a product it
actually is as a result of the pr
campaign that I ran
so in the early pre-internet days yeah
we the only way to measure
customer engagement as it were were
through Loyalty cards or credit cards
yeah it was a loyalty card you had some
basic customer data through credit cards
you could track transactions but it's
very difficult to relate it to your
marketing then the internet emerged and
all of a sudden I could track traffic to
my website
yeah I could see how many people visit
my website are these people that visit
my website for the first time are they
returning visitors what are the most
popular pages that they see how long do
they stay on my website and are they
actually buying my products
yeah so that was a major advancement of
marketing in the early 2000s and then
when social media emerged it all of a
sudden became possible to measure
engagement
how many people are having conversations
with us I could even measure sentiments
are people positive about my brand are
they negative about my Brands I could
track the effectiveness of my marketing
campaigns
I could measure the effectiveness of my
advertising campaigns that I ran online
so today's reality is that we can
measure everything
we can measure clicks we can measure
transactions we can measure engagements
we can measure return on investments
yeah and we can now even take that a
step further through artificial
intelligence that we can actually start
making predictions how people may
respond to campaigns that we're going to
be running
so it's a very important aspect of your
digital uh your social media marketing
so as I mentioned earlier social media
is a completely new way for businesses
to engage with their customers
yeah you can no longer go without it
it's a new channel to Market it is a new
channel for engagement with your
customers it is a new channel to learn
it's a new channel to listen to find out
what's happening in the market so it's
now it's it's it's there in every aspect
of your business
and not only for the marketing
department it's there for the sales
department it's there for Logistics it's
there for the customer service
department it's there for the HR
department using social media for your
recruitment is a very important element
of social media marketing
yes so keep that in mind that social
media marketing is no not a fad it is
there and it's there to stay and it
touches every aspect of your business
now to summarize this there are three
areas where social media has changed
The Way businesses operate
first of all there is the connection
social media is a new way to connect
with your stakeholders
yeah and stakeholders in this case can
be customers they can be prospects
influencers your own employees using
social media for internal
and not only on a local scale this
happens nowadays on the global scale the
internet allows you to sell locally to a
global audience if you want to yeah so
you can you can
cover the world you can Target specific
audiences wherever they are so the
connection aspect the targeting aspect
yeah the markets where you want to sell
your product is opened up through social
media and that is a big benefit for
business
the second area where social media has
changed businesses fundamentally it's in
the interaction site it's not just about
connecting with your stakeholders you
can also interact with them and they can
interact with you on their terms on
their preferred platform
and remember in social media land the
customer is in the driving seat if
you're not interacting with them on
their terms you're going to miss the
train
it's not about you don't liking Facebook
or LinkedIn
yeah as long as your customers are on
Facebook you better be on Facebook
otherwise you're going to miss the vote
yeah because if you don't interact with
them they will move on to your
competitors who are very likely engaging
with them
yep so it's the connection aspect it's
the interaction aspect and then the
third part is the customer data aspect
all of this yeah what we talked about
can be done and you can track every
aspect of your social media marketing at
a customer level
and it gives you the key performance
indicators like conversion ratios sales
ratios customer satisfaction ratios and
ultimately return on investment
and there are tools nowaday that let you
manage and track all these areas in one
conglomerated system
your HubSpot is for instance a tool that
you can use for that and they integrate
all your marketing and customer data and
campaigns in one system that you can use
for that
so now Having learned about these sort
of fundamentals of social media
marketing let's now have a look at how
do you put together your social media
marketing strategy how do you set it up
how do you develop it now with my over
40 years of experience in marketing
digital marketing and social media I
developed a simple five-step methodology
to set your business or to set up
yourself for social media and it's
called flirt
yeah and flirt is an acronym
flirt the first letter the f is for
focus
yeah and in the focus phase what you do
you look at various things the first
thing you do in developing your social
media marketing strategy is look at what
is your niche
what Market are you targeting
and the more you focus in your Market
your targeting your Niche the easier it
will be to reach them
yes so it's very important that you
focus on a very particular niche
once you've identified that Niche you
look at your positioning
why should they buy from you what is
your unique value proposition remember
the definition of marketing yeah the
value for your customer is key in this
and you put it in what we call a
positioning statement
you also look at your customers you
create customer personas
where you look at your customers and you
kind of map their interests their pain
points the typical questions that they
would ask so you get a good
understanding of your your customers
yes or you look at your Niche you look
at your positioning you look at your
focus or sorry you look at your
customers
yep and then you're going to ask
yourself why am I going to use social
media
yeah am I going to use it to build
awareness am I going to use it to drive
traffic to my website
am I going to use it to generate sales
am I going to use it to improve customer
service
am I going to use it to recruit new
staff am I going to use it to
communicate with my
um my employees
yeah so lots of reasons why you could
use social media and it's your challenge
to identify one or two objectives for
your social media
and then a very important aspect of your
social media marketing strategy even
your overall digital marketing strategy
what are the key words that you will be
focusing on
in other words what are the key words
that you want to be recognized
recognized for Google wants to know
Facebook wants to know LinkedIn wants to
know and it's all about repetition the
more often you use those keywords the
more those social media platforms and
Google will associate you with those
keywords when people search for them
they will then show you how you're up in
the search results we call this search
engine optimization or search engine
marketing
yeah so keywords is like a whole course
in itself
but it's very important part of your
social media marketing strategy in the
focus phase
so that is the F for Focus think about
your Niche your positioning who is your
customers why are you on social media
and what are your main keywords
the next is the L for listen
is so important
yeah we tend to talk too much
yeah where social media
can give you fantastic listening
opportunities
and when I say listen I mean read
articles online
listen on Facebook and on Twitter on
LinkedIn listen on Google
yeah watch videos listen to podcasts
there's dozens of ways that you can
listen online because when you listen
you learn
and when you learn you get better and
you develop
so what does that mean from you some
practical tips when it comes to
listening first you need to listen to
where your customers hang out
are your customers on Facebook are they
on Twitter are they on LinkedIn and
later in this session when we go through
the various social media platforms I'll
give you an overview of what type of
people are on the various social media
platforms
the next thing that you want to know
when you listen is who are your top 10
bloggers
or influencers in your Niche do you know
your top 10 bloggers do you know your
top Instagram influences
because you want to learn from them but
you may also want to build relation with
them
to use them in your marketing Outreach
you also want to look at the trends in
your Niche Google Trends is a really
useful tool that you can check to find
out what are the trends in your niche
and you're looking at your competitors
and your customers what are they doing
what are they talking about
yes so a very important stage and if
you're doing it properly you would
actually set up a social media listening
dashboard where you bring all your
listening channels together in one
dashboard
and then instead of having to go to all
those social media networks or websites
you let them come to you Inno reader is
a very good dashboard online dashboard a
free dashboard that you can use for this
we're then looking at the eye for
integration
yeah so you know your strategy you know
where your customers are you know which
social media Networks you're going to
focus on then you're going to integrate
them you're going to set up your social
media Networks you're going to make sure
the branding and the profiles are
consistent you're using your keywords
you're going to create your content
calendar
and you're going to set up your blog
blogging is very important in social
media marketing because it is the
easiest way to start creating content on
your website
and to start sharing that content
through your social media channels that
will then drive people back to your
website
yes so that is part of the integration
stage and then once you've got that all
set up you're then going to reach out
it's very important that you reach out
because if you're not reaching out then
people won't find you people won't see
you yeah the whole essence of social
media marketing is that you create as
many touch points as possible on the
internet for people to find you
yeah where they start engaging with your
content going back to your website want
to know more about you want to know more
about your content and you start
building a relationship that may then
turn into a sale
so reaching out you're going to start
sharing your content you're going to
repurpose your content so turn your blog
post into a video or into a carousel or
turn your video into a podcast or what
have you
yeah you're going to share other
people's content there's nothing wrong
with sharing content from other people
and you're going to run
campaigns
campaigns to push your content in the
channels
yeah and campaigns nowadays are no
longer sort of just posts on social
media it is a combination of organic
posts yeah where you just share your
posts on social media could be paid like
pay-per-click advertising or it could be
influencer marketing style
reaching out yeah so very important is
the reaching out stage and then of
course tracking is the icing on the cake
as it were when you track you measure
your online reputation you measure your
conversions you measure your social
media activity and engagement you're
meshing your Roi and you plan for your
next quarter
okay time to talk about the social media
marketing platforms let's have a look at
some of the most relevant ones out there
now but before that let's make sure that
you understand the essence of the social
media marketing platforms how do they
work very simple they all work according
the same concept what you do you create
an account on the social platform like
of Facebook for instance you fill in
your profile
on Facebook you put in a lot of data
about yourself on Twitter a little yeah
so you fill in your profile and once
your profile is ready you're going to
connect with friends or follow and be
followed
there are some platforms when you send
somebody a connection request or a
friend request request when they accept
your mutually connected like Facebook
and like LinkedIn other platforms like
Twitter and like Instagram when you
follow somebody doesn't mean that that
person follows you
yeah so we're talking about followers
and following as it were
yep and then when you've got that you're
going to start sharing updates
and you're going to check your news feed
where you will see the updates from your
friends
now as a business every platform enables
you to create a Facebook page or to
create a page
yeah and what you want to do you create
your page you put in your company
information you brand it to your company
branding guidelines and then you get
people to follow or like your Facebook
page
or your LinkedIn page yep and then you
start sharing updates and people that
liked your page they may see your
company updates in their feeds
and this is what we call organic reach
so you do a post as a business and then
the people that follow you will see your
posts on their personal news feed
now in the early days of social media
this organic reach could be 40 to 50
percent
which means that if you have ten
thousand
followers on Facebook so 10 000 people
liked your Facebook page 5 000 of those
people would see your update on their
personal news feed which is fantastic
and that was in the early days for
social media many Brands they spent lots
of marketing building huge communities
because it was a fantastic free way of
reaching out to your Market
nowadays things have changed
Facebook has been driving this yeah
Facebook wants you to advertise on
Facebook all these social media and
platforms they have to make money so
they have advertising sort of on their
platform and they want you to use
advertising so over the years Facebook
has lowered organic reach to less than
three percent
so again if you have 10 000 people that
like your Facebook page fewer than 300
people may see your updates in their
feed
and Facebook says hey that's the way it
is we offer you a fantastic marketing
environment and we need to make money as
well so hey yeah start advertise on
Facebook to reach your entire audience
and businesses Now understand that they
now know that social media is pay to
play
to reach your audience it's no longer
relying on organic reach you have to pay
to use pay-per-click advertising or PPC
but we're going to talk about that in
the next videos
all right so it's very important that
you understand this concept of how
social media marketing platforms work
so let's start with the first one the
biggest one Facebook with 1.9 billion
active users worldwide
fact is that over the years the younger
generation has left Facebook
yeah why have they left Facebook because
it's not cool anymore
yeah and their parents are on it
yeah so if you want to reach the young
teens uh late teens early twenties don't
go to Facebook you want to be on social
networks like Snapchat or Tick Tock if
that's available in your markets now
there's still markets where Facebook is
enormous
yes so they are the leading social media
Network in your Market if that is the
case then of course you have to be on
Facebook but in general we can say that
the audience for Facebook is now a
slightly older audience Generation X or
Millennials it's still a really good
Network to reach these people
particularly when you talk about
consumer type products
now what does Facebook offer you as a
business to use Facebook has the
Facebook page that you can create to
reach your audience
nowadays Facebook really would like you
to use Facebook groups
Facebook groups is a fantastic area in
Facebook where you can get really good
engagements
and I said business you can offer a
group to your customers as a VIP area or
a product knowledge area or a pre-launch
area or just for your customers yeah
lots of reasons lots of areas where you
can use a group to reach your customers
then there's Facebook Messenger of
course that you can use for your
business where you can set up Bots yeah
so you can have sort of automated
conversations with your customers on
Facebook messenger and there is Facebook
live
don't ignore Facebook live Facebook
loves you to use Facebook live
the beauty about using the Facebook live
it gives you sort of Buzz and engagement
before the event during the event and
after the event
yeah we call this tent pull marketing
you can build up excitement leading up
to the event and after the event as well
and then finally
fine is betting heavily on the metaphors
yes so it's Mark Zuckerberg's Vision
that instead of engaging with your
friends in the news feed you engage with
them in a virtual world now the verdict
is out if this is going to work but fact
is that although we've been talking
about virtual and augmented reality for
years it is here now
yeah there's more and more apps becoming
available on your mobile on your desktop
that use augmented reality
and virtual reality I can now download
Ikea place I think it's called where you
just open up the app you pick a product
from the catalog like a table and then
you can just position the table in your
living room
yeah and then you can move it change the
color of it or whatever yeah using
augmented reality through your um your
camera
okay so that is Facebook
let's look at the next one Instagram I
love Instagram yeah a lot of users from
Facebook have gone to Instagram
why because it is a visual social media
platform and it has
inherently higher engagement than
Facebook it's easier to reach the
audience not just your friends
yeah so lots of cool features in
Instagram one of the coolest features is
the Instagram stories
yep and people now spend more time on
the stories than on the the timeline
where they see the posts so Instagram
started as a photo sharing app very
simple yeah you made a photo you put a
filter on top of it which almost felt
like you're a photographer and then you
share it with hashtags and you saw
immediately the likes coming in and
people loved it for its simplicity
and now it has grown to a fully featured
social media Network that businesses can
use to make their brand come to life via
photos and Via stories
the audience is slightly younger than
the Facebook
um audience but a more and more mature
audience is coming on there as well and
it's it initially it had very much a
business to Consumer Focus but nowadays
it's not just photos that you can share
you can share visuals I can turn a blog
post into a carousel of five visuals
yep and
um in that way share really good content
so very powerful and very useful for
businesses to reach the audience that
hangs out on on Instagram
all right so that is Instagram let's
look at the next one and that is YouTube
now YouTube of course is not just for
watching video YouTube is a fantastic
social media platform to build an
audience of followers
yeah it's a great platform to monetize
your video as well by enabling
advertising to be shown before or during
your videos a lot of video creators they
do that yeah and your YouTube has a
program for that if you qualify by a
number of views that you have on your
video a number of uh and then the size
of your audience you can participate in
this program and it is a really good way
to make money on you for many content
creators now check out our earlier check
out our earlier video on how to create a
YouTube channel to find out how you can
set up a YouTube channel and how you can
use YouTube as a social media platform
YouTube is great for brand awareness and
since it's owned by Google it's also
really helpful for your search rankings
both on YouTube and on Google Google
and there's lots of different videos of
course that you can make you have videos
that do well are typical videos like
how-to videos unpacking videos Vlogs
video blogs we call them review videos
live videos lots and lots of ways to
reach the video your audience yeah on
with video on YouTube so the typical
audience that uses YouTube are basically
everybody from young to old but very
important to understand with YouTube
that people are there for a reason they
search for something they may search for
entertainment they may also search for
answers to their questions
which is different than the videos you
would have on Facebook for instance yeah
so Facebook is very good for brand
awareness where YouTube videos are very
good for
um for lead generation for instance and
for building relationship with your your
audience
good and
social media platform that emerged
around 10 years ago is Snapchat
they have around 300 plus million daily
active users
and let me tell you a bit about the
history of Snapchat Snapchat was a
response to Facebook's problems about 10
years ago in privacy
and not being cool anymore and
particularly the Privacy issue where in
those days a lot of people said who is
owning my photos on on Facebook yeah
um is it Facebook or is it myself so a
lot of people and that there's always
been a gray area
yeah combined with Facebook not being
cool anymore and you know how important
being cool is for the younger generation
yep so Theta so two guys who came up
with the idea of doing something
radically different and they came up
with a social media platform Snapchat
where posts would delete themselves
within 24 hours
they built a a user interface around
this which was fairly difficult to use
yeah but that was for a reason
gets they love to explain to each other
how it works and if it's complicated
enough then their parents won't be able
to get on it yeah so kids love that idea
it's too complicated to use for my
parents so I really have my own social
media worlds yeah in Snapchat that
nobody else has access to so
particularly the teens the generations
that was very uh keen and they were very
hot on the uh on Snapchat
so it was the new place for Facebook
users to go to and they grew ever since
steadily not huge but they are there and
they are a very powerful social network
particularly when you want to Target the
younger generation
now there are two major features that
they sort of drove into social media
lens which was the stories
and second the vertical videos
so you all know the concept of the story
itself the leads in 24 hours but it
turned
um social media instead of sort of
scrolling through your news feed you
swipe from story to story much more
visual much more fun much more engaging
yep and you would swipe those stories
vertically and that automatically led to
using vertical video
and vertical video is a major Trend in
social media content yeah which is
picked up by
um by Tech talk as the main format for
uh for videos on Tick Tock YouTube have
shorts so all social media networks they
now have stories and they have vertical
video as a key element yeah so vertical
video particularly for short 10 12
second videos which we call snackable
content is very important why would you
tilt your phone to watch a video why not
just use it vertical which is also a
quite an interesting
um sort of form factor to get a good
engagement on your videos
finally Snapchat has very Innovative
advertising features
yeah they have lenses they have stories
they have filters you can put a filter
over your face BMW had a really good
campaign to launch a new car where you
could place the car through a lens
anywhere that you liked in augmented
reality and you could actually put a
filter where you gave yourself a golden
face yeah so very powerful advertising I
think the the WhatsApp advertising
platforms is one of the best advertising
platforms out there it's also probably
one of the most expensive
advertising platforms of all social
media Networks
right so let's look at Twitter
I call Twitter SMS on steroids yeah it
was one of the first besides Facebook
one of the first social media platforms
that came out and it was a very exciting
platform when it launched
and Twitter relied heavily on celeb
celebrities using it to drive acceptance
on a global scale yep and many music
stars rock stars actors they started
using Twitter and that drove the global
adoption of the the platform now what
makes Twitter show powerful there are
three aspects on Twitter first of all
you can retweet a tweet
yeah so when you send a tweet and I
follow you I receive your Tweet if I
just click on retweet it'll go to all my
followers yeah if somebody in my
follower base retweets that tweet your
Tweet can go viral without uh in in in
minutes
yep and there's various examples of
tweets that went viral
um within minutes yeah like the um which
was it the selfie tweet during the Oscar
ceremony a few years ago
yes so it is um so the retweeting is
very powerful
it also makes it instant yeah because of
this retweeting aspect news goes on in
on Twitter instantly and it shares to a
global audience instantly so that makes
it very very
powerful for news agencies as well and
for businesses a very powerful feature
of Twitter is the Twitter search
each tweet is indexed and you can search
in all the tweets you can search for the
very first tweet that was ever sent
yeah so that makes it very powerful for
Brands to find content so Twitter is
really good for finding jobs for
instance because lots of businesses they
tweet about I'm looking for a marketing
manager or a web developer so if I
search for web developer hashtag jobs
that tweet will show up in my search
results
one problem that Twitter had is that
they did not keep up with the
developments in social media platform
functionality yeah so most celebrities
went to Instagram because Instagram was
much more visual much better place for
celebrities to engage with their their
fans so Twitter lagged behind and in the
last few years it clearly repositioned
itself
so it now is seen as a great way for
businesses to use as a communication and
service Channel with their customers and
for media companies to share the latest
news
so if you want to find out what is
happening in the world now or what
businesses are doing now or if you have
a problem with a product from a business
Twitter is the best place to be
and for you individual as I always say
you don't need to be on Twitter to tweet
but you must be on Twitter to find great
content to search
whether you want to search for jobs or
whether you're searching for
opportunities if you're a photographer
yeah and you in London for instance and
you go to Twitter and you search for
looking for wedding photographer London
you get a list of tweets of people who
are tweeting I'm looking for a wedding
photographer does anybody know anybody
yeah so extremely powerful to uh to use
for lead generation
right so what about Pinterest
Pinterest is a visual bookmarking
platform
it's very cool the concept is simple you
see a photo on the website that you like
yeah but you can then do you can pin
that photo on Pinterest in a board
yeah and you're not copying the photo
you're just copying the link in your
board so by doing that you can build
fantastic collections of visuals that
you like and want to organize
so I bought a house in Marrakech a
number of years ago in Morocco and we
needed to design the interior so we had
a board with Morocco design we had a
board with Morocco riyads we had a board
with
um a tiling and what have you and we
just build up a whole collection of
ideas that we liked and then we got the
people that helped us in making the
things that we wanted and we could just
share them the links on Pinterest of the
ideas that we had worked really well
now because you can save those Boards of
course you can then share them as well
yeah so everybody can access your boards
which means that it becomes a great tool
for getting ideas and Inspirations from
boards from other people
so if you want ideas for home design or
your wedding or fashion Pinterest is a
fantastic place to get inspiration
another major benefit for businesses is
that you can put your product catalog on
Pinterest as visuals organized in boards
yep and then when people
find those products on in on Pinterest
and they click on them it will take them
to the catalog of your website where
they can buy your product so it's a
great way to drive additional traffic to
your website if you want to see a good
example for that go to the IKEA UK
Pinterest page and look at their boards
you see boards for small living room
ideas back to school Christmas holiday
celebrations and then you get lots of
ideas with for instance for small living
rooms and then you click on some of the
products that you see and that takes you
to the
page on the Ikea catalog website where
you can buy the product
now Pinterest is very popular amongst
women amongst Millennials and it also
has very powerful advertising features
and then LinkedIn LinkedIn is serious
yeah I call LinkedIn Facebook with a tie
where Facebook is fun LinkedIn is
serious in Facebook you can get away
with a funny profile photo in LinkedIn
your photo needs to be professional
now if you go to linkedin.com forward
slash sales forward slash SSI you get
your Social selling index and that is a
score between 1 and 100 of how good you
are on LinkedIn
and you will see in the score in the
summary that our four components that
contribute to your SSI score or four
components that contribute to how well
you do on LinkedIn
so those four are your profile
yeah your activity level in connecting
with people
how much content you share and your
activity a level in building
relationships with people
yeah so the better you do in those four
areas the higher your score your profile
of course is very important make sure
that your LinkedIn profile is as
complete as possible
now linkedin's biggest challenge as I
mentioned earlier is to get people to
engage and share content
so how does LinkedIn make money very
simple there are four areas where they
make money first of all they allow
people to upgrade their LinkedIn account
to a premium account where they get more
features
there is a whole section in LinkedIn
specifically for recruiters
yes so a recruiting version of LinkedIn
there is a whole area for sales we call
this sales Navigator
yeah if you run a sales team that use
LinkedIn of course you want to keep the
customer data so you're getting a sort
of customer relationship management
system within LinkedIn when you sign up
for sales Navigator and then there is
LinkedIn advertising
LinkedIn of course is best for business
to business and it's really good for
developing your personal online profile
as long as you share content through
publishing articles and sharing uh
sharing posts
so I've been operational on LinkedIn
from the very beginning and I shared
lots and lots of content and articles on
LinkedIn and I got lots of business
coming in through Linkedin
yeah we're talking about serious amounts
of business that I did by being on
LinkedIn so you've got to be on LinkedIn
if you are in business
right now one thing that I will not talk
about here is Tick Tock yeah we haven't
got a slide for that but bear in mind
Tick Tock although it's not available in
India
um Tick Tock is a very important social
media Network these days which derives a
whole new format of uh of engaging and
communication but more about that that
later
right so let's look at the pros and cons
of social media what is good and what is
bad about it the biggest the biggest
advantage of social media marketing is
that it can lead you to new audiences
yeah wherever they are in the world
whatever type of business you are you
can reach them through organic paid or
influencer Outreach
yeah influencer Outreach has become a
very powerful element of your social
media marketing strategy it is about
collaborating with for instance
Instagram users with many followers to
Market your products or services
so that's the pros are there and they
are far better than the than the cons
but there are cons it's not all positive
you need to be aware that when you are
on social media you are opening yourself
up as a business people can see what you
do they can see how you do it and they
can also see when you're doing things
wrongly
yeah when you're doing things not the
way it should be done it's okay when
things go well but it can be disastrous
when things go bad as we say it takes
years to build a brand
but on social media you can ruin it
overnight
yeah there's lots of examples of that
um a really
big example was that you remember the
Chinese passenger that was dragged off
of a United Airlines plane
YouTube and Twitter were bombarded with
negative and cynical posts towards
United Airlines how they dealt with that
situation
but hey those are the cons and there's
in any marketing channel that you use
there are cons but the pros far outweigh
the cons that are there it is there it
is a fantastic channel to reach new
audiences yeah and it is only going to
get bigger
right so to close here are a few answers
to questions that I get often asked in
my social media classes
so let me start with giving you a list
of the questions and then we'll do
um the answer so what is viral marketing
All About Now marketing is considered
viral when it reaches the point where
it's being shared by the public
at large rather than just its target
audience
yes so when the
um you reach more people than you
intended to reach
yeah that could be through word of mouth
or through social sharing it means your
content has gone viral
yeah and particularly on YouTube you see
when you are running a campaign for a
particular Market but then the video is
so good that it goes well beyond your
target audience
yeah that is what we call viral
marketing what is earned media earned
media refers to positive reviews or
mentions in Industry Media or user
generated content and guest posts on
third-party websites
so it is basically when other people
talk about you
other people share your content
that is what we call earned media
what are some examples of social media
marketing strategies there is one famous
one which I can highly recommend you
have a look at it is from a company
called Blendtec yeah Blendtec sells
professional blenders if you go to
Starbucks and you order a frappuccino
they blend the ice cubes with Blendtec
blenders they are industrial grade
blenders they need to be very powerful
now nobody talks about blenders online
so they came up with a um an Innovative
campaign called will it blend
yep so where they created a series of
videos where they blend everything you
want them to blend like an iPhone
comparing that with a Samsung which one
Blends the fastest
they had a Facebook page with it a
website with it campaigns with it
through that campaign they managed to
grow their revenue with over 500 percent
a very powerful campaign the Dollar
Shave Club is another good example how a
small company an online company started
to challenge the big shaving companies
yeah who charge lots and lots of money
for shaving blades
they challenged it hey come to us and
you'll buy shaving blades for one dollar
so really Innovative campaign how they
did that so how do you get started in
social media marketing
remember my flirt methodology
yeah Focus that is where you start think
about your Niche what makes you unique
think about your customers think about
your targeting
yeah so focus focus focus that is the
most important part when you get started
on your social media
then what is sticky marketing sticky
marketing is a term for attractive
content that engages customers
and then influences them not only to
purchase the product but also to share
the content
yeah so is people they like the content
so much that they it helps them going
through the buying cycle but also they
start sharing it with their friends yeah
which gives you additional traffic to
your website which may lead to
additional leads to your website for
your business
