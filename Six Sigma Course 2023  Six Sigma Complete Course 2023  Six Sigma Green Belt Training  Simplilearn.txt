without further delay over to our
training imagine you've been tasked with
a really important project at work the
company you're working for produces
luxury cars the production numbers are
going down and a lesser number of cars
are getting manufactured each day there
also seems to be an issue with the
quality of the windshield wipers that go
on these cars the question you are faced
with is there a way for the company to
stop the stall and production and
increase the production per day from
1,000 to 2,000 also is there a way to
find out what's causing the drop in the
wiper quality there is Six Sigma Six
Sigma gives you the tools and techniques
to determine what's making the
manufacturing process slow down how you
can eliminate the delays improve the
process and fix further issues along the
way the concept was introduced in 1980
by Bill Smith while working for Motorola
since then Six Sigma has seen worldwide
adoption Six Sigma aims to reduce the
time defect
and variability experienced by processes
in an organization thanks to Six Sigma
you can produce a defree product
99.996% of the time allowing only 3.4
errors per 1 million opportunities Six
Sigma also increases Customer Loyalty
towards the brand improves employee
morale leading to higher productivity
Six Sigma has two major methodologies
dmic and DM
madv let's look at the first methodology
dmaic is an acronym for Define measure
analyze improve and control let's have a
look at each of these stages
individually and how it relates to your
earlier problem in the Define phase you
determine what issues you're facing what
your opportunities for improvement are
and what the customer requires of you
here you look at the process as a whole
and determine the issues with the
manufacturing process in this case
finding out why the cars had varying
windshield wiper quality and how to
optimize the current process to
manufacture more cars in the measure
phase you determine how the process is
performing currently in its unaltered
state you determine the current number
of cars that are manufactured in a day
in the current scenario 1,000 cars are
manufactured in a day and each of these
cars are outfitted with a pair of
windshield wipers by one of 30 machines
used used some of the metrics measured
are how many cars are produced in a day
time taken to assemble a car how many
windshield wipers were attached in a day
time that takes them to do so defects
detected from each machine on assembly
completion and so on following this in
the analyze phase you determine what
caused the defect or variation on
analyzing previous data you find out
that one of the machines that installed
the windshield wiper was not performing
as well as it was supposed to production
was taking longer since the car chassis
was being moved across the different
locations slower as cranes had to
individually pick and drop the frame
this was because the wheels were
attached to the car only in the last
stage next in the Improv phase you make
changes to the manufacturing process and
ensure the defects are addressed you
replace the faulty machines that
installed the windshield wiper with
another one you also find a way to save
time by attaching Wheels skills on the
frame in the initial stages of the
manufacturing process unlike how it was
done earlier now the car can be moved
across the assembly area faster and
finally in the control phase you make
regular adjustments to control new
processes and future Performance Based
on the changes made the company was able
to reduce production time and
manufacture about 2,000 cars a day with
a higher quality of output dmaic is one
of the most commonly used methodology in
the world it focuses on improving the
existing products of the organization
the second methodology is dmadv which is
shorted for Define measure analyze
design and verify it is used when the
company has to create a new product or
service from scratch it is also called
dfss or design for Six Sigma let's take
the scenario where the company decides
to build a new model a sports car in the
defined phase you define the
requirements of the customer based on
inputs from customers historical data
industry research you determine what you
need to ensure your car becomes a
success the data collected indicates
customers are drawn to cars which can
achieve more than 150 mph customers are
also more inclined towards cars which
have V6 engines and an aerodynamic frame
then in the measure phase you use the
customer's requirements to create a
specification this specification helps
Define the product in a measurable
method so that data can be collected and
compared with specific requirements some
of the major specifications that you
focus on are the top speed engine type
and type of frame in the analyze phase
you analyze the product to determine
whether there are better ways to achieve
the desired results areas of improvement
are determined and tested based on the
analysis of the Prototype created in
this phase you find that the product
satisfies just about all of the customer
requirements except the top speed so
research begins on an aluminum alloy
that could possibly meet the speed
requirements of the customer following
this the design phase based on the
learnings from the analysis phase the
new process or product is designed
revisions are made to the model and the
car is manufactured with the new
material the analysis phase is repeated
based on the new design you also bring a
focus group and see how they receive it
based on their feedback further changes
are made and finally in the verify phase
you check whether the end result meets
or exceeds customer requirements once
you launch your brand new sports car you
collect customer feedback and
incorporate it into future designs and
guess what your customers are loving the
new design and that is dmad for you Sig
Sigma has also found success in a number
of different Industries the prochemical
healthcare banking government and
software are some of the industries that
have utilized the concepts of Six Sigma
to achieve their business goals another
commonly used methodology adopted by
companies around the world is lean lean
is a methodology that aims to remove any
part of the process that does not bring
value to the customer it means doing
more with less while doing it better the
philosophy behind lean comes from the
Japanese manufacturing industry by Bob
Hartman who at the time was part of
Toyota since then across the world
services and Manufacturing organizations
have Incorporated lean within their
businesses but what if you could have
the best of both worlds a combination of
both Six Sigma and lean that's lean 6
Sigma before we get into lean 6 Sigma
we've got a quiz for you what
methodology is used by companies when
they want to release a new product
created from scratch a design measure
analyze Define verify B Define measure
analyze design verify C demand measure
analyze improve control D Define measure
analyze improve control leave your
answers in the comment section below for
a chance to be one of three people to
win an Amazon voucher now let's get back
to lean 6 Sigma lean 6 Sigma is a
methodology that focuses on eliminating
problems removing inefficiencies and
waste while improving the working
conditions to ensure the customer's
needs are better satisfied it combines
the tools methods and principles of lean
and Six Sigma we'll have another video
detailing the process of lean Six Sigma
very soon imagine you're the manager of
a supermarket chain you've noticed that
two two things need your immediate
attention the first issue is how to
handle the different kinds of waste that
you encounter at your
Supermarket the next one requires you to
address the supply chain issues at the
supermarket which are causing delays to
the morning delivery of milk leading to
customer dissatisfaction and attrition
these problems can be solved by
incorporating two of the most popular
quality management methodologies in the
world lean and Six Sigma one famous for
its ability to handle waste and another
known for process Improvement but what
if there was a methodology that combined
the concepts of both Six Sigma and lean
one that could solve all your issues
well there is lean 6 Sigma before we
dive into lean 6 Sigma let's take a
closer look at its parent
methodologies first off lean is a
methodology that focuses on providing
value to the customer eliminating what
waste continuous Improvement reducing
cycle time lean and Six Sigma both aim
to handle waste but what is this waste
waste is any step or action in the
process that a user does not gain any
value from in short things that users
wouldn't want to pay for why would a
consumer want to pay extra for the
additional truck that was required to
deliver milk to the supermarket just
because the other one broke down this
way can be divided into eight categories
let's have a look at each of them One
Transportation this waste refers to the
excess movement of people tools
inventory equipment and other components
of a process than it is required two
inventory this waste occurs due to
having more products and materials than
required this can cause damage and
defects to products or materials greater
time for completion inefficient
allocation of capital and so on
three motion this refers to the time and
effort wasted due to unnecessary
movement of people equipment or
Machinery this could be sitting through
inventory double data entry and so on
four waiting this can be time wasted
waiting on information instructions
materials or equipment five
overproduction this is the waste created
due to producing more products than
required
six
overprocess it refers to more work more
components or more steps in a product or
service than required seven defects this
is the waste originating from a product
or service that fails to meet customer
expectations eight skills this waste
refers to the waste of human potential
under utilizing capabilities and
delegating tasks to people with
inadequate training for years now many
systems have emerged that use the lean
methodology to identify and handle the
different kinds of waste some of the
more popular in effective ones are jit
or just in time 5s and can ban the jit
methodology focuses on reducing the
amount of time the production system
takes to provide an output and the
response time from suppliers to
customers 5S is another methodology that
focuses on cleanliness in organization
while improving profits and efficiency
canb is also another popular methodology
to achieve Lane it is a visual method to
manage tasks and workflows can ban
enables users visualize the workflow to
identify issues in the process and fix
them these methodologies help in
optimizing the waste production and are
often used together to maximize results
so that's the first problem solved now
let's have a look at how you can improve
the supermarket supply chain efficiency
for that let's have a look at the other
part of lean Six Sigma Six Sigma Six
Sigma is a set of tools and techniques
that are used for process Improvement
and removing defects let's see how Six
Sigma makes that possible Sig Sigma has
two major methodologies dmaic and
dmadv you can learn more about these two
methodologies by checking out our Six
Sigma in 9 Minutes video by clicking on
the top right corner let's have a closer
look at dmic since lean 6 Sigma uses the
dmaic methodology of Six Sigma dmaic is
an acronym for Define measure analyze
improve control it is used to improve
existing products and processes so that
it can meet the customer requirements in
the Define phase you determine what the
goals of the project are in this case
you want to reduce the amount of time
taken to deliver milk from the warehouse
to the supermarket so that it is stocked
on the supermarket shelves before 8:30
in the morning in the measure phase you
measure the performance of the current
unaltered process the milk truck leaves
at 7:30 a.m. in the morning and can take
one of three routes a b and c route a is
currently the preferred one as it takes
only 60 Minutes to reach the supermarket
compared to the routes B and C which
takes 70 and 80 minutes respectively in
the analyze phase you find out why the
defects exist since routes B and C were
school bus routes by reducing the
starting time by 1 hour at 6:30 instead
of 7:30 meant avoiding the traffic
routes B and C now take 40 to 45 minutes
to reach the supermarket route a still
takes the milk truck 1 hour to get to
the supermarket even when the truck
leaves at 6:30 a.m. in the improved
phase performance can be improved by
addressing and eliminating the root
causes now that you've realized that
advancing the milk pick up by an hour
and changing the route to Route B can
save time you change the process
accordingly providing your workers with
ample time to stock the milk into the
shelves before the morning rush and
finally in the control phase you make
regular adjustments to control new
processes and future performance you
continue to monitor the delivery times
and try out alternate routes to
continually improve the process and
ensure even faster delivery this process
change LED to reduced man hours and cost
enhanced sales and customer retention
the lan6 sigma methodology offers many
such benefits to businesses let's take a
look at some of them one increase in
profits two standardized and simplified
process three reduced errors four
employee development five value to
customers
and that is lean Six Sigma for you Six
Sigma is a set of tools and techniques
that have helped several companies
around the world achieve business
success hi guys I'm Ral from Simply
learn and let's get started with our
introduction to Six Sigma now let's
understand this better with an example
here let's talk about how things were
before Sig Sigma was introduced here
Jenny and James are having a
conversation with each other Jenny is
James's manager and she's not happy at
all she says James is in a lot of
trouble this is because she found out
that the customer cers weren't happy
with the organization service and the
operational costs were way too high and
as manager James had to make sure that
this did not happen now let's have a
look at the same scenario in present day
here we have Jenny congratulating James
she's very impressed with his work but
James says it's all thanks to Six Sigma
methodology so Jenny asks she wants to
know more about Six Sigma so to
understand Sig Sigma here's what you
need to know firstly we'll have to
understand what is Sig Sigma what its
advantages are some of its methodologies
what are the different r roles in a Six
Sigma team what is lean what is a lean
process and what is lean Six Sigma so
now let's get started with understanding
what exactly is Six Sigma the Six Sigma
methodology makes sure to find as well
as eliminate any sort of defect or
variation that could be affecting your
product service or process now this
methodology is statistics based is data
driven and focused on continuous
Improvement now this means that there's
no end goal in the Horizon there's
always another goal to reach there are
three core ideologies behind Six Sigma
the first one states that for any
business to be successful there's
continuous efforts that are required so
that you can achieve stable as well as
predictable process results the second
ideology states that in any business or
manufacturing process there are certain
characteristics that can be defined
measured analyzed and controlled the
final ideology says that along with the
rest of the organization the top level
management plays a very important role
to making sure that there sustained
quality now let's talk about the
advantages of Six Sigma Six Sigma can
help produce a road map or a path
through which you can easily find and
reduce any sort of organizational risk
and reduce the operational costs another
Advantage is that it helps improve the
efficiency of the process and making
sure that it works in a timely manner it
decreases defects improves the overall
tracking and monitoring process and
ensures that the products are aligned
with the company's policies it is also
reported that it greatly helps improve
customer as well as vendor satisfaction
it helps improve the C cash flow and
ensures that the products are complying
with the regulations of the organization
now let me tell you about the process of
Six Sigma now Six Sigma projects are of
basically two methodologies the dmaic
and the dma DV now let's talk about
dmaic in detail that's short for Define
measure analyze improve and control this
is one of the most commonly used
methodologies in the world this is
commonly used by companies when they
have to fix or improve an already
existing product or process that does
not meet the company's standards now
let's have a look at the process first
phase is the defined phase in this phase
you define the problem that the
customers are facing you find out where
you can improve and you clearly
understand what the customers require of
you the second phase is the measure
phase now in this phase you actually
identify how well the process is doing
in its current unaltered state in the
analyze phase you process the data that
you get from the measure phase and
determine what exactly is the cause of
the delay or variation ation in the
improve phase you start by making small
changes to the business process and make
sure that the problem you identified
earlier is being taken care of and
finally in the control phase you control
the new process so that it doesn't go
wrong and use the same knowledge for
future processes now let's have a look
at dmadv this is short for Define
measure analyze design and verify now
this is also commonly known as dfss or
the design for Six Sigma now this is
commonly used by companies around the
world when they have a new product that
needs to be created all the way from
scratch in the first phase which is the
defined phase you define what the goal
of the project is and what the customers
require of you in the measure phase you
measure as well as determine what the
customer needs and how they respond to
your products in the analyze phase you
perform analyses to determine how you
can improve your product or service so
they can better serve your customers in
the design phase you set up process
details and make optimizations to the
design to make sure your customer
customer is satisfied and finally in the
verify phase you check how well the
design is working out and how well it
meets the customer's needs now before we
go on let's talk about how Six Sigma was
used in reference to the earlier example
the situation that James was facing a
survey conducted by the organization
James was working for indicated that the
customers weren't very happy with the
organization so they decided to fix that
with the help of Six Sigma so they
decided that the dmaic methodology would
be best suited to solve their problem so
let let's have a look at what they did
firstly in the defin phase they used a
tool called the voice of the customer
this tool represented the needs as well
as requirements of the customer this
showed that the customers expected drum
delivery the correct product selection
and a knowledgeable distribution team
from the company and now onto the
measure phase the company wanted to know
why the customers didn't like them so
they performed some data collection from
there they found out that they took 56%
longer than other companies to deliver
their product so they decided to reduce
the amount of time it takes between
order entry and the delivery of the
product and now in the analyze phase
here they knew what the issue was but
they wanted to know what exactly made
their products delivery so slow why were
the customers receiving the product so
late then they performed some analysis
their analysis showed the possible
causes it could have been inaccurate
sales plans issues with their safety
stock issues with their vendors delivery
performance and falling behind on the
manufacturing schedule further analysis
also indicated that most of their sales
almost 80% came from 30% of their
products the issue was that they didn't
have enough Safety stock to satisfy the
customers who required that 30% of
products and now on to the improve phase
so now that they knew what was causing
their problem they wanted to solve it
they began to have monthly reviews and
tried to make sure that their in demand
products stayed in demand another thing
that they wanted to focus on was to make
sure that they could order and provide
the customer with the products that they
wanted and finally on to the control
phase they began to set up plans so that
they could monitor the sales of that 30%
of products that were selling the most
each year they would review how well a
product was selling and replace it if it
had fallen out of favor now let me tell
you what a Six Sigma team consists of
let's talk about the roles in a Six
Sigma team first up is level seven now
these are individuals who are at the
noest level now these individuals don't
know in great detail about what the
project is but they have a basic
understanding of the principles and the
methodology behind the program now they
usually support with smaller projects
and with smaller issues but these
individuals found the foundation for the
people who decide where the program is
going and now we're at level six now
these are individuals who have a yellow
Belt certification now they are core
members of the Six Sigma team who have
an understanding of how the basic
metrics work and how they can perform
some sort of improvement now they have
their own areas of expertise and they're
required to determine certain processes
that need to improve at the same time
they're also in charge of smaller
Improvement projects now level five
these are people who have a Green Belt
certification now these individuals are
usually part-time professionals who have
a number of different duties to fulfill
they focus on smaller Six Sigma projects
they're usually involved with Gathering
data performing some sort of experiment
and analyzing information they also
assist with black belt projects and now
we're at level four these are
individuals who have a Black Belt
certification they usually team leaders
of a Six Sigma project they complete
four to six projects a year and are
experts in the principles methodologies
and lean Concepts thanks to their
understanding of statistical
experimental design they can also
understand the hidden reasons behind why
a particular product failed and now
we're at level three these are
individuals who have a master black Bel
certification now these are individuals
who are experts when it comes to
resources the practices and the
methodologies that are employed in Six
Sigma their main emphasis is to coach
train and certify PL bels they also are
involved with other Six Sigma leaders to
ensure a company's goals are met now
level two these individuals are called
Champions so they work really closely
with the executives and usually have a
role like a senior or a middle executive
level role they also have a clear
understanding of what exactly is the
company's vision and Mission they also
understand metrics so that they can set
up a Six Sigma project that lines up
with the company's goals they're
responsible for removing any sort of
Roadblock that could hamper the for the
success of a project and finally we're
at level one these are the executives
now these individuals represent the
highest level when it comes to a Six
Sigma team now they have training as
well as experience through which they
can set up Six Sigma projects that
clearly line up with the company's goals
their main emphasis is to ensure that
the project is able to add value to the
organization and at the end of the day
is successful now this is when Jenny
interjects she wants to know about lean
John tells her that lean just like SE
Sigma is is another methodology so what
exactly is lean now lean is a
methodology that has a very important
ideology to make sure that there's
continuous optimization of the processes
and there's an elimination of waste so
what's waste so waste is basically any
part of the process that the customer
doesn't want to pay for it is a process
that does not add any value to the
customer now coming back to lean here
are some of its characteristics whenever
decisions are being made in a lean team
the main emphasis is is to understand
how it exactly adds value to the
customer every member in a lean team has
a clear understanding of what exactly
are the goals of the organization it
also encourages employees to push for
further success even if the organization
is in a good place or is already doing
well there's also an emphasis on cross
functional collaboration and
communication lean focuses on answering
the difficult question or the complex
ones rather than employing short-term
fixes and with lean you can easily
prepare for issue that can come up in
the future or improvise in unexpected
circumstances so let's talk about how
lean and Six Sigma are different from
one another the lean methodology aims to
reduce waste it does so by analyzing the
workflow it also emphasizes on
minimizing resource usage and improving
customer value now let's talk about Six
Sigma the aim of Six Sigma is to provide
near perfect results it wants to reduce
costs and improve customer satisfaction
basically both of them are moving
towards what the same goal to reduce the
amount of waste and to create efficient
processes now let's talk about the
process of lean now there are five
different steps let's start with the
first one identifying value you need to
identify value by determining what
exactly is the problem you're trying to
solve for the customer the second step
is to map your value stream you need to
map the workflow of your company you
need to focus on the different actions
and the people that are involved with
the process you need to be able to
identify which parts of the process are
able to add value and the ones that
don't the third step is to create a flow
you need to break up your work into
smaller silos and visualize the workflow
so that you can easily identify problems
that might show up later the next step
is to establish pull you need to set up
a system through which products are
created only when there's a demand or a
requirement for it through this you can
optimize resource capacity and finally
we're at the fifth step which is
continuous Improvement you need to
ensure all your employees at all levels
are involved in the continuous
Improvement of the process so what
exactly is lean 6 Sigma what if you
could combine The Best of Both Worlds
the combination of Six Sigma and lean
methodology led to the creation of lean
6 Sigma lean Six Sigma is a methodology
that aims to solve problems removes any
form of waste or inefficiency and
improving the working conditions of
employees to make sure that they can
serve the customers better now this is a
combination of the tools methods and
principles that are employed in lean and
6 Sigma let's talk about some of its
advantages it aims to provide customers
with a better experience by streamlining
the process with efficient power flows
it aims to drive higher results it can
reduce cost remove waste and prevent
effects it can help the organization
handle day-to-day problems the decreased
lead times help increase capacity and
profitability and finally it helps with
people development and improving the
moral of the organization Six Sigma
certification is a globally recognized
qualification that signifies expertise
in process Improvement and quality
management developed in the 1980s by
Motorola Six Sigma has since gained
prominence across Industries for its
systematic approach to eliminating
defects and improving overall
organization performance this
certification provides professionals
with the necessary tools and
methodologies to analyze data identify
inefficiencies and Implement strategic
Solutions moreover the benefits of
obtaining a Six Sigma Black Belt
certification extends Beyond
professional growth the average Six
Sigma back Bel salary in the United
States is
$130,000 making it an attractive career
path for individuals seeking Financial
rewards are you curious about the salary
of a Six Sigma professional well if
you're are already here at simply learn
let's hear directly from these
professionals on how they have
successfully achieved impressive
salaries in the field of Six Sigma as a
working professional it's crucial to
stay competitive in today's fast-paced
business environment that is exactly
what I did and I even got a 21%
increment in my stien as a re researcher
in between my undergraduate degree and
my Master's I took training in the lean
Six Sigma expert Masters program from
Simply learn and became a green belt the
projects were challenging but gave us
the freedom to apply what we learned in
a logical manner since completing the
program I have been able to take on
newer projects with much more confidence
and perform way better than before
upskilling is no longer a luxury but a
necessity so in this video we will be
covering what is Six Sigma certification
levels of Six Sigma which Six Sigma belt
or level you should choose and how Six
Sigma training can advance your career
so these are the things that we will be
covering we will also discuss levels of
Six Sigma in detail now before moving
forward let me ask you a quick question
so what is the primary goal of a Six
Sigma to reduce defects and variations
in process B to maximize profits for
organization C to implement agile
management practices or option D to
improve employee satisfaction now you
can pause this video and answer in the
comment section below now let's start
with the first topic which is what is
Six Sigma certification Six Sigma
certification is a program that helps
individuals learn a set of problem
solving skills and techniques to improve
processes in a company or organization
it is named Six Sigma because it aims to
achieve a very high level of quality by
reducing defects or errors to just a few
per million opportunities the
certification program teaches people how
to identify and measure problems in appr
analyze data to find the root cause of
for those problems and come up with
effective Solutions it provides a
structured approach to problem solving
and emphasizes the use of data and
statistics to make informed Decisions by
obtaining a Six Sigma certification
individual demonstrate their ability to
lead Improvement projects and apply the
methodologies of Six Sigma to drive
positive changes in the workplace this
certification is highly regarded in many
Industries as it shows a person's
expertise in process Improvement and
their commitment to Quality and
efficiency to attain a Six Sigma
certification individuals must go
through a structured progression now so
let's discuss these levels of Six Sigma
so levels of Six Sigma each level
represents a varying degree of expertise
and responsibilities in implementing Six
Sigma methodologies here are the levels
of Six Sigma so as you can see we have
five belts but actually we have six
belts that is white belt yellow belt
green belt black belt Master black belt
and Champion executive leadership belt
so let's understand each one of these
belts we'll start with the white belt at
the white Bel level individuals are
introduced to the basic concepts and
language of Six Sigma they gain a
foundational understanding of the
methodology and how it can be applied to
improve processes white belt often
supports projects by providing
assistance with data collection
participating in team discussions and
helping Implement small processes
improvements the goal of a white belt is
to understand the fundamental concepts
of Six Sigma next we have is yellow belt
yellow belt receive more comprehensive
training in Six Sigma tools and
techniques they have a deeper
understanding of data analysis process
mapping and problem solving
methodologies yellow belts typically
work alongside green belts and support
them in their Improvement projects they
assist with data Gathering analysis and
contribute to small scale processes
improvements within their areas of
responsibility next we have is green
belt green belts undergo more extensive
training and are capable of leading
smaller scale Improvement projects
within their organizations they
possesses a solid understanding of
statistical analysis process
optimization and project management
green belts work closely with black
belts collect and analyze data to
identify areas for improvement and
contribute to the implementation of
solutions they may also lead teams and
coordinate Improvement initiatives then
there is black belt black belts are
highly skilled professionals who have
undergone rigorous training in Six Sigma
methodologies and statistical analysis
they are capable of leading and managing
larger Improvement projects within their
organizations black belts apply Advanced
statistical techniques to identify root
cause of problems develop and Implement
Solutions and monitor project progress
they often Mentor green belts provide
guidance and support and help Drive
significant improvements in process and
quality next we have is Master black
belt so the master black belts are the
experts in Six Sigma methodologies they
have extensive experience and knowledge
of St statistical analysis project
management and Leadership Master black
builds provides strategic guidance and
direction for Six Sigma initiatives
across organizations they train and
Mentor black belts ensuring the
consistent application of Six Sigma
principles Master black belts also
oversee multiple projects identify
improvements opportunities and drive
organizational transformation all right
now we have his Champion executive
leadership Belt certification so
Champions are senior Executives or
managers who play a crucial role role in
promoting and supporting Six Sigma
initiatives within their organizations
they provide the necessary resources
support and Leadership to ensure the
success of Six Sigma projects Champions
align Six Sigma efforts with the overall
strategic goals of the organization
Foster a culture of continuous
Improvement and facilitate the
implementation of Six Sigma
methodologies through various
departments and teams so are you eager
to pursue a career in quality management
look no further our postgraduate program

publishing case studies and kpmg's
Capstone projects don't miss this
opportunity to master lean methodologies
and Propel your career forward enroll
today and Unleash Your Potential so
these were different levels of Six Sigma
certifications now let's understand
which Six Sigma belt or level should
should you choose first is whiteb
certification whiteb certification is
suitable for anyone who wants to gain
General awareness of Six Sigma and how
can it drive process improvements it
provides a solid foundation for
individuals to explore further
certifications or decide if they want to
pursue a more in-depth understanding of
Six Sigma it is important to note that
the white Belt certification does not
equip individuals with the same level of
Knowledge and Skills as the higher
certifications like yellow belt green or
black belt it serves as a starting point
and can be a stepping stone for those
who wish to progress further in Sig
Sigma Journey so this was about white
belt now let's understand who should
choose yellow belt so the yellow Belt
certification expands upon the
foundational knowledge acquired through
the white Bel certification and
encompasses a broader range of subject
and tools these includes areas like
process mapping data collection root
cause analysis and control charts
choosing to pursue a yellow Bel
certification is an excellent option for
individuals who desire greater
involvement in Improvement project
whether as a team member or leaders or
small scale initiatives additionally
obtaining a yellow Bel certification
AIDS in the development of problem
solving and communication skills while
also serving as a tangible evidence of
one's dedication to maintaining high
standards of the quality next is Green
Belt certification the Green Belt
certification expands your knowledge of
lean Six Sigma and empowers you to
utilize a comprehensive of tools and
techniques for incate and cross function
projects opting for a Green Belt
certification is suitable for
individuals aspiring to lead or
facilitate Improvement initiatives
additionally achieving this
certification can enhance your
professional opportunities and establish
your reputation as a proficient expert
in process Improvement
methodologies now let's understand who
should choose black Bel certification
typically the tainment of Black Belt
certification requires a training period
spanning 4 to 6 weeks alongside the
completion of a substantial project or
examination the acquisition of a black
belt equips you with the comprehensive
expertise in proficiency to oversee
numerous Improvement projects execute
strategic initiatives and Foster
transformative charge within an
organization pursuing a blackw
certification is particularly suitable
for individuals aspiring to assume
leadership or manal positions in the
realm of process Improvement either
within their current organization or as
an independent consultant this
certification also serves as a catalyst
for enhancing analytical statistical and
project management skills while
concurrently argumenting your potential
for higher earnings next we have is
Master Belt certification or Master
Black Belt certification this
prestigious certification is not widely
available and typically requires a
substantial number of years of practical
experience accompanied by noteworthy
portfolio of achievements a master
blackb certification is well suited for
individuals aspiring to become senior
leaders or subject matter experts in the
field of process Improvement whether
Within their current organization or as
a trainer or coach this certification
empowers you to drive significant
Transformations and optimize operational
efficiency by obtaining a master Belt
certification you unlock new
opportunities and challenges that can
Propel your career to new heights then
we have is Champion Belt certification
senior Executives and high level
managers who are responsible for
overseeing multiple Improvement projects
can benefit from the champion Bel
certification it equips them with the
Knowledge and Skills necessary to
Champion process Improvement effort at a
strategic level align Improvement
initiatives with business objectives and
provide guidance and support to project
teams the champion Bill certification is
designed for individuals who want to
excel in leading and supporting process
Improvement efforts at a strategic level
now let's understand how Six Sigma
certification can advance your career
first is advancement within the
organization many companies prioritize
providing Six Sigma training to their
employees by obtaining sixma
certification you gain a competitive
Advantage for career prog progression
within your organization having a deep
understanding of the company's internal
culture and operations combined with Six
Sigma knowledge positions you favorably
for promotion opportunities next is
overcoming barriers to achievement
unlike other certifications that have
strict prerequisites Six Sigma
certification does not have Universal
requirements this means there are no
significant barriers preventing you from
becoming a Six Sigma certified allowing
you to pursue this training and
certification to advance your career
then third is enhance visibility and
knowledge Six Sigma projects require
employees to analyze and improve the
entire organization not just specific
departments or operations engaging in
Six Sigma training not only expands your
knowledge about different facets of the
business but also increas visibility
among senior level Executives so this
was about Six Sigma certifications which
Six Sigma belto level should you choose
and much more this lesson provides an
overview of the Certified Six Sigma
Green Belt or cssgb course a process is
a series of steps designed to produce a
product Andor service according to the
requirement of the customer a process
mainly consists of four parts input
process steps output and feedback input
is something put into a process or
expended in its operation to achieve an
output or a result for example man
material machine and management output
is the final product delivered to an
internal or external customer for
example product or Services it is
important to understand that if the
output of a process is an input for
another process the latter process is
the internal
customer each input can be classified as
controllable represented as C
non-controllable represented as NC noise
represented as n and critical represent
Ed as X the most important aspect of the
process is the feedback as can be
inferred from the image any change in
the inputs causes change in the output
therefore y equal F ofx feedback helps
in process control because it suggests
changes to the inputs let us learn about
the process of Six Sigma in the next
screen let us understand how Six Sigma
Works in this screen
Six Sigma is successful because of the
following reasons Six Sigma is a
management strategy it creates an
environment where the management
supports Six Sigma as a business
strategy and not as a standalone
approach or a program to satisfy some
public relations need Six Sigma mainly
emphasizes the dmac method of problem
solving Focus teams are assigned
well-defined projects that directly
influence the organization's bottom line
line with customer satisfaction and
increased quality being byproducts Six
Sigma also requires extensive use of
statistical methods the next screen will
focus on some key terms used in Six
Sigma let us look at the sigma level
chart in this screen as discussed
earlier the Six Sigma quality means 3.4
defects in 1 million opportunities or
process with a
99.999 66% yield the sigma level chart
given on the screen shows the values for
other Sigma levels please take a look at
the values carefully let us understand
the benefits of Six Sigma in the next
screen the organizational benefits of
Six Sigma are as follows a Six Sigma
process eliminates the root cause of
problems and defects in a
process sometimes the solution is
creating robust products and services
that mitigate the impact of a variable
input or output on a customer's
experience for example many Electrical
Utility Systems have voltage variability
up to and sometimes exceeding a 10%
deviation from nominal value thus most
electrical products are built to
tolerate the variability drawing more
amperage without damage to any
components or the unit itself using Six
Sigma reduces variation in a process and
thereby reduces waste in a process it
ensures customer satisfaction and
provides process
standardization rework is substantially
reduced because one gets it right the
very first time further Six Sigma
addresses the key business requirement
Six Sigma can also be used by
organizations to gain advantage and
become world leaders in their respective
Fields ultimately the whole Six Sigma
process is to satisfy customers and
Achieve organizational goals in the next
screen let us understand Six Sigma and
quality taking a process to Six Sigma
level ensures that the quality of the
product is maintained the primary goal
of improved quality is increased profits
for the organization in very simple
terms quality is defined as the degree
of Excellence of a product or a service
provided to the customer it is
conformance to customer requirement if
the customer is satisfied with the
product or service then the product or
service is of the required quality let
us look at the history of quality in the
next screen in the mid 1930s statistical
process control SPC was developed by
Walter shuart and used extensively
during World War II to quickly expand
the US's industrial
capabilities SPC is the application of
statistical techniques to control any
process Walter schu Hart's work on the
common cause of variation
and special cause of variation
assignable has been used proactively in
all Six Sigma projects the approach to
Quality has varied from time to time in
the 1960s there were quality circles
which originated in Japan it was started
by koru
ishakawa quality circles were
self-improvement groups composed of
small number of employees belonging to a
single Department quality circles
brought in improvements with little or
no help from the top Management in 1987
ISO 9000 was introduced ISO stands for
International Organization for
standardization ISO 9000 is a set of
international standards on quality
management and quality assurance to help
organizations Implement Quality
Management Systems ISO 9000 is still in
effect Baldridge award now known as the
Malcolm Baldridge National Quality award
was developed developed by the US
Congress in 1987 to raise awareness of
Quality Management Systems as well as
recognize and award us companies that
have successfully implemented Quality
Management Systems in 1988 another
quality approach was developed known as
benchmarking in this approach an
organization measures its performance
against the best organizations in its
field determines how such performance
levels were achieved and the information
is used by the organization to improve
itself then in the 1990s there was the
balanced scorecard approach it is a
management tool that helps managers of
all levels to monitor their results in
their key areas so that one metric is
not optimized while another is ignored
during the year 1996 through 1997 an
approach known as re-engineering was
developed this approach involved the
restructuring of an entire organization
ation and its processes integrating
various functional tasks into cross
functional processes is one of the
examples of
re-engineering in the next screen let us
find out about the quality gurus and
their contribution to the field of
quality let us focus on Six Sigma and
the business system in this screen
business systems are designed to
implement a process or a set of
processes a business system ensures Ur
es that process inputs are at the right
place and at the right time so that each
step of the process has the resource it
needs a business system design should be
responsible for collecting and analyzing
data so that continual Improvement of
its processes products and services is
ensured a business system has processes
subprocesses and steps as its subsets
Human Resources manufacturing and Market
marketing are some examples of processes
in a business system Six Sigma improves
a business system by continuously
removing the defects in its processes
and also by sustaining the changes a
defective item is any product or service
that a customer would reject a customer
can be the user of the ultimate product
or service or can be the next process
Downstream in the business system let us
learn about six sign projects and
organizational goals in the following
screen let us understand the structure
of the Six Sigma team in this screen
there are totally five levels in the Six
Sigma screen the first level consists of
the top Executives of the organization
these people lead change and provide
direction as they own the vision of the
organization for any Improvement
initiative to work it is important that
top management of the organization be
actively involved in its propagation the
top Executives own the Six Sigma
initiatives next in the level are Six
Sigma Champions they identify and scope
projects develop deployment and strategy
and support cultural change they also
identify and Coach master black belts
three to four Master black belts work
under every Champion Six Sigma Master
black belts train and Coach black belts
green belts and various functional
leaders of the organization they usually
have at least three to four black belts
under them the fourth level in Six Sigma
structure is Six Sigma Black belts they
apply strategies to specific projects
and lead in direct teams to execute
projects finally there are Six Sigma
Green belts they support the black belt
employees by participating in Project
teams green belts play a dual role they
work on the project and perform
day-to-day jobs related to their work
area in the next screen we will
understand the drivers and metrics of
organizational
strategy while financial accounting is
useful to track physical assets the
balanced scorecard or bsse offers a more
holistic approach to strategy
implementation and performance
measurement by taking into account
perspectives other than the financial
one for an organization traditional
strategic activities that concentrate
only on financial metrics are not
sufficient to predict future performance
they are not sufficient to implement and
control the Strategic plan either bsse
translates the organizational strategy
into actionable objectives that can be
met on an everyday basis and provides a
framework for performance measurement
the balanced scorecard helps clarify the
organizational vision and Mission to
workable action items to be carried out
and measured it also provides feedback
on both internal business processes and
external outcomes by doing so it enables
continuous Improvement in strategic
performance toward achieving
organizational goals the balanced
scorecard achieves all this by
integrating the organizational strategy
with a limited number of key metrics
from four major areas of performance
Finance customer relations internal
processes and learning and growth many
organizations in the world use balance
scorecard approaches and the number is
increasing every day in the next screen
we will describe the balanced scorecard
framework we will learn about developing
a balanced scorecard in this screen
while applying the balanced scorecard in
an organization care must be taken to
account for interactions between
different perspectives or strategic
business units and avoid optimizing the
results of one at the expense of another
to outline the strategy a top- down
approach is followed by determining the
Strategic objectives measures targets
and initiatives for each perspective the
Strategic objectives refer to the
strategy to be achieved in that
perspective three or four leading
objectives are agreed upon the progress
toward strategic objectives is assessed
using specific measures these measures
should be closely related to the actual
performance drivers this enables
effectively evaluating progress
highlevel metrics are linked to lower
level operational measures the target
values for each measure are set the
initiatives required to achieve the
target value are
identified as already mentioned this
exercise is carried out for all the
perspectives finally the scorecard is
integrated into the management system in
the next screen let us understand the
change in the approach to to the balance
scorecard from the four boox model of
BSE to strategy
maps in earlier approaches to the
balance scorecard the perspectives were
presented in a four boox model this kind
of scor card was more a comprehensive
glance at the key performance indicators
or metrics in different perspectives
however the key performance indicators
or metrics of different perspectives
were viewed independent of each other
which led to a silo based approach and
lack of
integration however modern scorecards
place the focus on the interrelations
between the objectives and metrics of
different perspectives and how they
support each other a well-designed
balanced score card recognizes the
influence of one perspective on another
and the effect of these interactions on
organizational strategy to achieve the
objectives in one perspective it is
necessary to achieve the objectives in
another perspective in short the four
perspectives form a chain of cause and
effect
relationships a map of interl objectives
from each perspective is created these
objectives represents the performance
drivers which determine the
effectiveness of strategy
implementation this is called a strategy
map the function of a strategy map is to
outline what the organization wants to
accomplish and how it plans to
accomplish it
the strategy map is onepage view of how
the organization can create value for
example financial success is dependent
on giving customers what they want which
in turn depends on the internal
processes and learning and growth at an
individual level in the next screen we
will look at the impact of the balance
scorecard on the
organization the balance scorecard and
strategy map Force managers to consider
cause and effect relationship ships
which leads to better identification of
key drivers and a more rounded approach
to strategic planning the BSC enables
the organization to improve in the
following ways being a one-page document
a strategy map can easily be
communicated and facilitates
understanding at all levels of the
organization an organization is
successful in meeting its objectives
only when everyone understands the
strategy the balance scorecard also
forces an organization to measure what
really matters and manage information
better so that quality of decisionmaking
is higher creating performance reports
against a balance scorecard allows for a
structured approach to reporting
progress it also enables organizations
to create reports and dashboards to
communicate performance transparently
and meaningfully as expected a balance
scorecard helps an organization to
better align itself and its processes to
the Strategic IC goals outlined in the
bsse the overall objectives of the BSE
can be cascaded into each business unit
to enable that unit to work toward the
common organizational goal all the
activities of the organization such as
budgeting or risk management are
automatically aligned to the Strategic
objectives to conclude the balance
scorecard is a simple and Powerful tool
that when implemented correctly equips
an organization to perform better
let us proceed to the next topic of this
lesson in the following screen in this
topic we will look at what lean is and
how lean is applied to a process let us
start with the lean Concepts in the next
screen let us look at the process issues
in this screen lean focuses on three
major issues in a process known by their
Japanese names muda Maura and mie muda
refers to nonv Value adding words work
MAA represents unevenness and Marie
represents over burden together they
represent the key aspects in lean let us
look at the types of waste in the next
screen there are seven types of muda or
waste as perlene principles let us
understand these seven types of muda
over production this refers to producing
more than is required for example a
customer needed 10 products and 12 were
delivered inventory in simple words this
refers to stock the term inventory
includes finished goods semi-finished
Goods raw materials supplies kept in
waiting and some of the work in progress
for example test scripts waiting to be
executed by the testing team defex
repairs rejects any product or service
deemed unusable by the customer or any
effort to make make it usable to the
original customer or a new customer for
example errors found in the source code
of a payroll module by quality control
team motion a waste due to poor
ergonomics of the workplace for example
finance and account team sit on the
first floor but invoices to customers
are printed on the ground floor causing
unnecessary Personnel movement
overprocess additional process on a
product or service to remove unnecessary
attribute or feature is
overprocess for example a customer needs
a bottle and you deliver a bottle with
extra plastic casing a customer needs
ABC3 bearing and your process is tuned
to produce more precise ABC seven
bearings taking more time for something
the customer doesn't need waiting when a
part waits for processing or the
operator waits for work the wastage of
waiting occurs for example improper
scheduling of staff members transport
when the product moves unnecessarily in
the process without adding value for
example a product is finished and yet it
travels 10 km to the warehouse before it
gets shipped to the customer another
example an electronic form is
transferred to 12 people some of them
seeing the form more than once that is
the form is traveling over the same
space multiple times next we will look
at lean wastes other than the seven
types of discussed some lean experts
talk about additional areas of waste
underutilized skills skills are
underutilized when the workforce has
capabilities that are not being fully
used toward productive efforts people
are assigned to jobs in which they do
not fit underperforming processes
automation of poorly performing process
improving a process that should be
eliminated if possible for example the
product returns department or product
discounts process a symmetry in
processes that should be eliminated for
example two signatures to approve a cost
reduction and six signatures to reverse
a cost reduction that created higher
costs in other areas in the next screen
we will look at an exercise on
identifying the waist type we will cover
each step of the lean process in the
next few screens in this screen we will
learn about the first step identify
value to implement lean to a process
it is important to find out what the
customer wants once this is done the
process should be evaluated to identify
what it needs to possess to meet
customer requirements the next screen
will focus on the next step of the lean
process value stream
mapping in this screen we will discuss
the differences between push and pull
processes an organization can adopt
either of these processes depending on
the requirement contrary to a pull
process in a push process the first step
is to forecast the demand for a product
or service the production line then
begins to fill this demand and produced
parts are stocked in anticipation of
customer demand for example a garments
manufacturer produces 200 shirts based
on expected demand and then waits for
customer orders for them note that the
demand is expected and not actual
discounts offer to customers by big
retailers are examples of the push
process if the Garment company adopts a
pull process instead it would start
making the shirts only after receiving a
confirmed demand from customers note
that although the pull approach seems
better it is not applicable to all
situations for example a pharmacy uses a
push process in the next screen we will
learn about theory of
constraints let us look at an example
for the TOC methodology in this screen
the three subprocesses in the packing
process are coding or printing filling
and sealing the data for the three
subprocesses are observed and collected
as number of units produced in an hour
the data is as follows coding or
printing is 900 units per hour filling
is 720 units per hour and ceiling is 780
units per hour how can can you implement
the TOC methodology in this
example let us build the TOC map for
this example the first step in the TOC
methodology is to identify the
constraint looking at the data the
output per hour from The Filling process
is
720 this is the constraint in the system
in the Second Step the constraint is
exploited by analyzing the performance
using data to break the constraint a
repair and maintenance Personnel can be
assigned to maintain the filling machine
on a daily basis in the third step the
other fixes in the repair and
maintenance function are made as
subordinate decisions to the one taken
in step two in this example carry out
the maintenance of the filling machine
in the fourth step the constraint is
elevated by implementing the decisions
in this example remove the damages from
the filling machine the next step is to
go back to step one and identify the
next system constraint as per the data
collected after implementation of the
first cycle of the TOC ceiling can be
identified as the next system
constraint let us now analyze the data
before and after Toc implementation in
this example the number of units
produced per hour before implementing
the TOC in coding or printing process
was 900 units filling process was 720
units and sealing process was 780 units
after implementing the TOC the number of
units produced per hour for the filling
process increased to 840 from 720
units let us proceed to the next topic
of this lesson in this topic we will
discuss the concepts in design for Six
Sigma or
dfss let us first understand dfss in the
next
screen dfss or design for Six Sigma is a
business process methodology that
ensures that any new product or service
meets customer requirements and the
process for that product or service is
already at Six Sigma level dfss uses
tools such as Quality Function
deployment or qfd and failure mode and
effects analysis or
FMEA dfss can help a business system to
introduce an entire enely new product or
service for the customer it can also be
used to introduce a new category of
product or service for the business
system for example an fmcg company plans
to make a new brand of hair oil a type
of product already in the market dfss
also improves the product or service and
adds to the current product or service
lines to implement dfss a business
system has to know its customer
requirements
dfss can be used to design a new product
or service a new process for a new
product or service or redesign of an
existing product or service to meet
customer requirements let us learn about
processes for dfss in the next
screen the two major processes for dfss
are idov and
dmadv idov stands for identify Des
design optimize and verify dmadv stands
for Define measure analyze design and
verify in the idov process the first
step involves identifying specific
customer needs based on which the new
product and business process will be
designed the next step involves design
which involves identifying functional
requirements developing alternate
Concepts evaluating the alternative
selecting a best fit concept and
predicting Sigma capability tools such
as FMEA are used here the third step
optimize uses a statistical approach to
calculate tolerance with respect to the
desired output when idov is implemented
to design a process expected to work at
Six Sigma level this is checked in the
optimized phase if the process does not
meet expectations the the optimize phase
helps in developing detailed design
elements predicting performances and
optimizing design the last stage of idov
is to verify that is to test and
validate the design and finally to check
conformance to Six Sigma standards the
other process dmadv has five stages the
first stage is to define the customer
requirements and goals for the process
product or service next measure and
match performance to customer
requirements the third stage involves
analysis and assessment of the design
for the process product or service the
next step is to design and implement the
array of latest processes required for
the new process product or service the
final stage is to verify results and
maintain
performance in the next screen we will
look at the differences between idov and
dmadv the the primary difference between
idov and
dmadv is that while idov is used only to
design a new product or service dma DB
can be used to design either a new
product or service or redesign an
existing product or service idov
involves design of a new process while
dmadv involves redesigning an existing
process in idov no analysis or
measurement of EX existing process is
done and the whole development is new
the design step immediately follows the
identification of customer requirements
in contrast
dmadv the existing product service or
process is examined thoroughly before
moving to the design phase the design
stage comes only after defining
requirements and analyzing the existing
product service or process in the
following screen we will learn about
tool Quality Function deployment or qfd
which is one of the dfss
tools qfd also called voice of customer
or VOC or House of quality is a
predefined method of identifying
customer requirements it is a systematic
process to understand the needs of the
customer and convert them into a set of
design and Manufacturing
requirements qfd motivates business to
focus on its customers and design
products that are competitive in lesser
time and at lesser cost the primary
learning from qfd includes which
customer requirements are most important
what the organization's strengths and
weaknesses are where an organization
should focus their efforts and where
most of the work needs to be done to
learn from qfd the organization should
ask relevant questions to customers and
tabulate them to bring out a set of
parameters critical to the design of the
product apart from understanding
customer requirements it is also
important to know what would happen if a
particular product or service fails when
being used by a customer it is necessary
to understand the effects of failure on
the customer to ensure preventive
actions are taken and to be able to
answer the customers in the event of
failure in the next screen we will look
at another dfss tool failure modes and
effects analysis or
FMEA failure modes and effects analysis
or FMEA is a preemptive tool that helps
any system to identify potential
pitfalls at all levels of a business
system it helps the organization to
identify and prioritize the different
failure modes of its product or service
and what effect the failure would have
on the customer it helps in identifying
the critical areas in a system on which
the organization's efforts can be
focused note that while FMEA enables
identification of critical areas it does
not offer solutions to the identified
problems we will look at the varieties
of FMEA such as dfmea and pfmea in the
next
screen pfmea stands for process failure
mode and effects analysis and DF mea
stands for design failure mode and
effects
analysis
pfmea is used on a new or existing
process to uncover potential failures it
is done in the quality planning phase to
act as an aid during production a
process FMEA can involve fabrication
assembly transactions or Services dfmea
is used in the design of a new product
service or process to uncover potential
failures
the purpose is to find out how failure
modes affect the system and to reduce
the effect of failure on the system this
is done before the product is sent to
manufacturing all designed deficiencies
are sorted out at the end of this
process in the following screen we will
understand FMEA risk priority
number FMEA risk priority number or rpn
is a measure used to quantify or assess
risk associated with the design or
process assessing risk helps identify
critical failure modes higher the rpn
higher the priority the product or
process receives rpn is a product of
three numbers severity of a failure
occurrence of a failure and the
detectability of a failure all these
numbers are given a value on a scale of
one to 10 the minimum value of rpn is 1
and the maximum value is 1,000 a failure
mode with a high occurrence rating means
the failure mode occurs very frequently
a mode with a high severity rating means
that the mode is really critical to
ensure safety of operations a mode with
a high detection rating means that the
current controls are not sufficient in
the next screen we will look at the FMEA
table the FMEA table helps plan
Improvement initiatives by underlying
ing why and how failure modes occur and
helps organizations plan for their
prevention typically FMEA is applied on
the output of root cause analysis and is
a better tool for Focus or
prioritization as compared to multiv
voting one important aspect of FMEA is
that it does not need data experts in a
particular area can form the FMEA table
without having to look at data from any
source in functions such as human
resources the FMEA table is very useful
as there might not be much data
available to the problemsolving
team the sample FMEA table is given on
the screen please go through the
contents for better understanding in the
following screen we will discuss
severity of risk priority number and
scale
criteria let us first discuss severity
severity refers ref to the seriousness
of the effect of the failure mode or how
critical the failure mode is to the
customer or the process the severity of
a failure mode is rated on a scale of 1
to 10 using a severity table different
Industries follow different structures
for the severity table a high severity
rating indicates a mode is critical to
operational safety for example a team
working on FMEA of a radioactive plant
May insert fatal as the effect with
rating 10 another example is the
severity table for a sports team the
team manager wants to rate the severity
of failure of the team in an upcoming
game she might rate it at nine given
that the team would lose a big
sponsorship should they face defeat
which could in turn be hazardous to the
team's future shown here is a
generalized table of severity the
severity rating can never be changed for
example if a mode has a rating of nine
before Improvement it will continue to
have a rating of nine after Improvement
to let us look at occurrence of RPM and
scale
criteria occurrence is the probability
that a specific cause will result in the
particular failure mode as with severity
occurrence is rated on a scale of 1 to
10 based on a table like the severity
table higher the occurr of a failure
higher is its rating again this table
might vary depending on the industry and
scenario sometimes the project team can
use data here if available based on past
data the probability of occurrence of a
failure can easily be rated shown here
is a generalized table let us next look
at detection of rpn and scale
criteria detection is the probability
that a particular f failure will be
detected the table shown here is again a
generalized one the rating here is a bit
different from severity or occurrence
higher the detectability of a failure
lower is its rating this is because if
the failure can easily be detected then
everyone would know of it and therefore
there would be less or no damage for
example if detection is impossible the
failure is given a rating of 10 please
note note that at the start of a Six
Sigma project the failure mode is given
a relatively High detection rating let
us look at an example of FMEA and rpn in
the next
screen in this example A Bank wants to
recognize and prioritize the risks
involved in the process of withdrawing
cash from an
ATM it can be observed from the table
that not having a control in place for
network issues has the highest RPM
this is due to the detectability for a
network issue being very low the next
set of information in the table shows
the action taken by the bank's
management to address the failure modes
following the implementation the new rpn
is calculated retaining the security
level at nine this is because the
actions were not directed at reducing
the severity but at the causes of
failure it can be seen that the new rpn
is much lower and the risk for both
causes has been
mitigated this lesson will cover the
details of the Define phase Six Sigma
can be applied to everything around it
can be applied across almost 70
different sectors however it cannot be
applied to all problems the first step
is to check if the project qualifies to
be a Six Sigma project the questions
that need to be asked are as follows is
is there an existing process to
implement the dmac methodology of
problem solving a process needs to exist
the process should be an operation for
the development of the product or
service is there a problem in the
process ideally the process should not
have any problem if there is a problem
in the process performance the process
needs to be
improved is the problem
measurable the problem has to be
measurable in order to assess the root
cause and the impact of the problem on
the
process does the problem impact customer
satisfaction if the problem affects
customer satisfaction an action needs to
be taken immediately else the customer
may start finding alternate products or
switch to competitor's
products does working on the problem
impact profits of the company it is very
essential to assess the impact of the
project on the profits of the company if
the project affects the profits of the
company adversely then such a project is
not
feasible is the root cause of the
problem
unknown if the root cause of the problem
is visible then a Six Sigma project is
not required other problemsolving
techniques can be used in this
case is the solution
unknown if the solution solution to the
problem is already known then there is
no need for any project the company can
directly implement the
solution the defin phase of dmac will be
introduced in the next
screen the Six Sigma project process is
known as a dmac process Define is the
first phase in the Six Sigma project
process in the defined phase the problem
is defined and the six team is formed
the objectives of the defined phase are
as follows clearly Define the problem
statement through customer
analysis understand customer
requirements and ensure that the Six
Sigma project goals are aligned to these
requirements Define the objectives of
the Six Sigma project plan the project
in terms of time budget and resource
requirements Define the team structure
for the project and establish roles and
responsibilities in the next screen let
us learn about
benchmarking benchmarking is the process
of comparing an organization's business
processes practices and performance
metrics with that of Industry leaders
there are various types of benchmarking
let us briefly look at each type process
benchmarking entails comparing specific
processes to a leading company or an
industry standard this is useful to
obtain a simplified view of business
operations and enables a focused review
of major business
functions process benchmarking includes
comparisons of production processes data
collection processes performance
indicators and productivity and
efficiency
reviews Financial benchmarking is
performed to assess overall
competitiveness and productivity
it is done by running a detailed
financial analysis and analyzing the
result performance benchmarking involves
comparison of products and services with
those of competitors with the intention
of evaluating the organization's
competitiveness product benchmarking
involves designing new products or
services or upgrading existing products
or
services this can involve reverse
engineering a competitor's products to
study the strength and WI weaknesses and
modeling the new product on these
findings strategic benchmarking refers
to studying strategies and
problemsolving approaches in other
Industries functional benchmarking is
the focused analysis of a single
function with the aim of improving it
complex functions may need to be divided
into processes before benchmarking is
done competitive benchmarking includes
standardizing organizational strategies
process process products services and
procedures against the competitors in
the same
industry collaborative benchmarking is a
type of benchmarking where the
standardization of various business
parameters is carried out by a group of
companies and the information is shared
if the subsidiary units of a company or
its various branches carry out the
benchmarking it is called collaborative
benchmarking let us take a look at Best
Practices for benchmarking in the next
screen best practice is a method that
ensures continuous Improvement leading
to exceptional performance it is also a
method to sustain and develop the
process
continuously some of the best practices
in benchmarking are as
follows increase the objectives or scope
of
benchmarking set the standards and path
to be followed at the initial stage
reduce unnecessary effort and comply
with the scope recognize the best in the
industry to set a
benchmark share the information derived
from
benchmarking in the next screen we will
discuss project
selection let us understand process
business process and business system in
this screen a process is a series of
steps designed to produce a product or
service to meet the requirement of a
customer a process mainly consists of
three elements input process and output
a business process is a systematic
organization of objects such as people
machinery and materials into work
activities designed to produce a
required product or service as shown on
the screen a process is a subset of a
business process a business process is
in turn a part of a business system a
business system is a value added chain
of various business processes such as
sales or
Finance for example payroll calculation
is a process in the HR business process
of an IT company which is a business
system in the next screen we will look
at the process
elements let us discuss the challenges
to business process Improvement in this
screen the Improvement to a business
process of an organization faces
challenges due to the traditional
business system structure because it is
generally grouped around the functional
aspect the main problem in a
functionally grouped organization is the
movement or flow of a product or service
a product or service has to go through
various functions and their functional
elements to reach the customer or end
user the other problem is management of
the flow of prodct products or Services
across various functional elements this
is difficult as usually there is no one
in charge these business process
Improvement problems can be solved using
the project management approach to
produce the product or
service in the next screen we will learn
about process owners and different
stakeholders of a
project the representation of where the
process owner and stakeholders are
placed in the organizational hierarchy
is on the screen the process owner is a
person at a senior level in the
hierarchy he is the one who takes
responsibility for the performance and
execution of a process and also has the
authority and the ability to make
necessary
changes on the other hand a stakeholder
is a person group or organization which
is affected or can affect an
organization's actions businesses have
many stakeholders like stockholders cust
customers suppliers company management
employees of an organization and their
families the society Etc let us discuss
the effects of process failure on
various stakeholders in the next
screen while it is an absolute business
necessity to keep one's stakeholder
satisfied at all times failure to meet
one or more process objectives may
result in negative effects on them in
such situations for the stockholders the
perceived value for the company gets
reduced customers May seek other
competitors for their deals while
imposing penalties and finding recourse
in legal action against the company
suppliers may be on the losing front
with delayed payments or not being paid
at all company management may require
cost cutdown employees will receive
diminishing wages the community and
Society will be affected due to
pollution created by the
organization in the next screen we will
understand the relationship between
business and the
stakeholder in the diagram shown on the
screen each stakeholder is both a
supplier as well as a customer forming
many closed loop processes that must be
managed controlled balanced and
optimized for the business to thrive
communication is the key in such
situations and is facilitated through
internal company processes the next
screen covers the importance and
relevance of State stolder
analysis stakeholder analysis is an
important task to be completed before
doing a Six Sigma project a business has
many stakeholders and any change to a
business process affects some or all of
them when a process does not meet its
objectives it results in the
stakeholders being negatively affected
which in turn affects the organization's
performance the Six Sigma team must
factor in the reasons why a stakeholder
May oppose the change effort let us
proceed to the next topic of this lesson
in the following
screen in this topic we will discuss
voice of the customer let us start with
how to identify the customer in the
following
screen customers are the most important
part of any business a customer is
someone who decides to purchase pays
consumes and gets affected by a
particular product or service it is
critical to identify and understand the
customer requirements the products or
Services can be designed according to
these requirements consequently the
company is able to provide products or
Services the customers are willing to
purchase there are two types of
customers internal and external
customers in the next screen we will
learn about internal customers
an internal customer can be defined as
anyone within the business system who is
affected by the product or the service
while it is being developed most often
internal customers are the employees of
the company for example let us assume
that there is a series of processes in a
particular business system in such a
scenario the second process is the
internal customer for the first process
the third process is an internal
customer for the second process and so
on the basic needs of an internal
customer are to be provided proper tools
and necessary equipment imparted proper
training and given Specific Instructions
to carry out their
responsibilities however the needs are
not limited to these alone other needs
include the provision of company
newsletters projects storyboards to
display the letters Etc team meetings to
share business news and announcements
staff meeting to share information and
quality awards from
suppliers an internal customer is
important first of all the activities of
an internal customer directly affect the
final or ultimate customer secondly the
activities of an internal customer
affect the next process in the system
finally an internal customer also
affects the quality of the product
developed or service provided
when the needs of the internal customers
in most cases employees are met they are
more likely to have higher perceptions
of quality and also contribute to
Greater
productivity the satisfaction levels of
the internal customers can be improved
in various ways these include a higher
amount of internal communication through
company newsletters and team meetings
recognitions for work quality Awards Etc
constant training on how to be ahead and
well equipped in a competitive
environment is very essential too in the
next screen we will learn about external
customers this screen focuses on the
positive effects of a project on the
customers the most important aspect of
any process Improvement project is the
customers internal customers are the
ones who drive the project hence the
effect of the project on internal
customers is a critical factor that
needs to be considered the positive
impact of a project on the internal
customers is as follows the project is
driven by highly motivated individuals
or internal customers who are aware of
the project objectives and scope
individuals belonging to a credible
project understand the project
deliverables and display high levels of
job
satisfaction these individuals go the
extra mile to take up tasks beyond their
job description ion such individuals
make a highly motivated team focused on
delivering their responsibilities in
order to meet the customer
requirements working together in a
positive environment also improves team
spirit and
bonding the positive impact of a project
on the external customers is as
follows process Improvement projects
analyze the problems and come up with an
effective solution consequently ensuring
a better product a successful process
Improvement project assists the
organization in effectively meeting
customer expectations or
requirements there is visible
Improvement in customer service good
quality product and service ensures High
customer
satisfaction let us learn about
different methods of customer data
collection in the following
screen once you begin to identify the
customer types you need to look forward
to collecting customer data collecting
data from customers is very essential as
it helps consider the levels at which
these customers affect the business
Begin by collecting feedback from both
internal as well as external customers
customer feedback helps fill the gaps
and improve the various business
processes in the
organization it helps Define a good
quality product as perceived by the
customer and identify qualities that
make the competitor's products or
service better it also helps identify
factors which provide a Competitive Edge
to the product or service on offer there
are various methods to collect feedback
from the customers many of you might be
involved in a similar activity at some
point or the other popular and common
methods are surveys conducted through
questionnaires focus groups individual
interviews with the customers customer
complaints received via call centers
emails and feedback forms are also quite
prevalent feedback received in this form
are from dissatisfied customers in the
next screen we will learn about
questionnaires let us discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of
questionnaires in this
screen the advantages of a questionnaire
are that it costs less the phone
response rate is high anywhere from
around 70 to
90% And it produces faster results also
analysis of maale questionnaires
requires few trained
resources questionnaire is a method used
to gather data however there are a few
disadvantages associated with it there
may be incomplete results and unanswered
questions leading to a lack of clarity
the response rate of mail surveys is
about 20 to 30% only at times phone
surveys can produce undesirable results
as the interviewer can can influence the
person being
interviewed we will differentiate
between telephone survey and web survey
in the next
screen there are different methods to
collect data for a survey the methods
need to be based on the requirements and
needs of the organization the popular
methods of survey are the telephone
survey and web survey both have their
own drawbacks and benefits which are
given on the screen the organization
needs to choose a method of collecting
data according to the situation it is
recommended to go through the content
for a better understanding in the next
screen we will learn about focus
groups let us now discuss the advantages
and disadvantages of using a focus group
for data collection the interaction in a
focus group generates information
provides in-depth responses and can
address more complex questions or
qualitative data it is an excellent
platform to get critical to Quality or
ctq definitions as well on the other
hand the disadvantages of focus groups
are that the learning only applies to
those within the group and it is not
possible to generalize The information
collected is more qualitative than
quantitative which is another drawback
additionally they can also generate a
lot of information from anecdotes and
incidents experienced by the individuals
in the group in the next screen we will
discuss the interview
technique this screen discusses
advantages and disadvantages of using
the interview technique for data
collection interviews have a capability
to handle complex questions and a large
amount of information they also allow us
to use visual aids in the process it is
a better method to be employed when
people do not respond willingly Andor
accurately by phone or email however
there are some shortcomings as as well
interviews are timec consuming and the
resources or interviewer needs to be
trained and experienced to carry out the
task let us discuss the importance and
urgency of these inputs in the next
screen the table shows the importance
and urgency of different kinds of input
to understand the kind of input to be
chosen different kinds of methods for
collecting data are identified telephone
survey web survey and interview are the
data collection methods
identified to select the best methods
the criteria or the factors which are
important to the organization are listed
the criteria are the factors based on
which an organization is going to make
decisions the list of factors is then
given weightage based on the importance
of each factor in decision making as
seen cost is the most important
Criterion for which the weightage is
given 20 response rate of the customer
customer is next important factor and
the list follows visualizing feature and
compiling and analyzing data are the
factors which have the lowest impact on
the decision of selecting the methods
for data
collection each of the data collecting
methods is rated between 1 and 10 based
on its impact on the listed factors with
10 being highly favorable to the
organization and one being least
favorable after rating all the methods
with the factors listed the sum more
total is calculated the calculation of
the total involves multiplying each
method's rating with the factor
weightage and adding all the multiplied
values of the column that is for a
telephone survey the rating is
Multiplied with factors rating 8 * 12 +
8 * 6 + 3 * 20 + 5 * by 5+ 3 multiplied
by 5 + 7 multiplied by 15 + 1 * 10 + 7
multiplied 3 + 0 * by 2 + 3 multiplied
by 2 + 1 multiplied by 10 + 7 multiplied
5 + 8 multiplied by 5 and the total of
this is
471 in a similar way calculate the total
value for the remaining two methods the
total of other two methods are 745 4 and
522 respectively looking at the overall
total of the methods 744 is the highest
hence web survey is the best method for
the organization to use for data
collection let us look at the pros and
cons of customer complaints data in the
next
screen there are pros and cons in
gathering information from customer
complaints advantages include
availability of specific feedback
directly from the customer and ease in
responding appropriately to every
customer on the contrary feedback in
this method does not provide an adequate
sample size and may lead to process
changes based on one or two inputs from
the customer the next screen will
discuss the difference between product
complaint and expedited service
request product complaints and expedited
service requests can act as inputs to
the company for improving their process
these details address the needs of the
customer in an indirect way a product
complaint means that the customer is not
happy with the product that he has
purchased from the company an expedited
service request means a service request
is being rushed if the customer requires
the items immediately then an expedited
service request is raised from the
customer and the organization tries to
fulfill it to please the customer
product complaint implies that a product
is not meeting customer specification
hence it has to be improved expedited
service request implies that service
timeliness are not meeting customer
requirements hence service has to be
improved product complaint also implies
that the customer needs for product are
not completely identified whereas
expedited service request implies that
the customer timings need to be
recalculated let us discuss the
importance and urgency of these inputs
in the next
screen
the table shows the importance and
urgency of different kinds of input to
select the best methods the criteria or
the factors which are important to the
organization are listed the criteria are
the factors based on which organization
is going to make decisions these factors
are then given weightage based on the
importance of each factor in decision-
making as seen cost involved and
identification of customer need are the
most important criteria for which the
weightage given is 15 and the list
follows time consumption and compiling
and analyzing data are the factors which
have the least impact on the decision of
selecting the methods for data
collection each method is rated between
1 and 10 based on its impact of the
listed factors with 10 being highly
favorable to the organization and one
being least favorable to the
organization after rating all the
methods with the factors listed the sum
or total is calculated
calculation of the total is derived by
multiplying each method's rating with
the factor weightage and adding all the
multiplied values that is for product
complaint the rating is Multiplied with
the Factor's rating 8 multiplied 15 + 4
multiplied by 15 + 3 multiplied by 2 + 1
multiplied by 10 + 1 multiplied by 10 +
1 * by 10 + 1 multili 8 + 1 multi by 10
+ 4 * 2 + 1 * 8 + 1 multiplied 10 and
the total of this is
260 in the similar way calculate the
total value for expedited service
request the total of expedited service
request is 817 and hence it is effective
to the
organization let us discuss the key
elements of data collection tools in the
next
screen data collection tools will be
selected based on the type of data to be
collected the key elements that make
these tools effective are as follows
data is collected directly from the
primary source or customer hence there
is no scope for miscommunication or loss
of
information data is collected
exclusively for the stated purpose hence
data is highly reliable the data is
captured is after understanding the
organizational purpose this makes the
data exclusively relevant and serves the
purpose of the
organization data is collected
instantaneously when there is a
requirement this ensures that the data
is up to date hence the data is valid
the tools accurately Define customer
requirements the customer requirements
could be current needs or Improvement to
the product or service that they are
currently using the tools help to get
enough information about customer
requirement through which the process
for improving or creating the process
ctor service that the customer requires
can be developed in the next screen we
will discuss how the collected data can
be
reviewed cated data must be reviewed to
eliminate vagueness ambiguity and any
unintended bias Neutra worldwide buys
laptops for its employees from a company
that is into manufacture and sales of
laptops the company also provide
servicing and repairs for their products
to the customers to understand the level
of customer satis faction in neutral
worldwide and to improve its process the
laptop company is conducting a survey
the questionnaire which was prepared
initially questionnaire before review
had questions that led to ambiguity
vagueness and unintended bias let us
look at each item on the survey to
understand the level of usage of the
laptop and to know their customer better
the survey is raising a question related
to the occupation of the customer it
gives the option of student or
professional but with this low amount of
information the company is neither able
to gather the information nor will the
given option cover the entire possible
occupation in the market including an
option of other please specify would
help the customer to choose and provide
the information if he does not belong to
one of the two given groups hence the
same is added in the review so that the
customer will not be in any ambiguity
while filling the questionnaire
the question whether the sales executive
was supportive with an option of yes or
no is a question which leads again to
ambiguity and unintended bias the
customer might be partially happy or
partially not happy but the choice does
not let them inform their exact feeling
if the customer selects no as the option
then the company does not get enough
information to understand where their
sales executive went wrong hence in the
reviewed questionnaire the customer is
asked to rate the qualities of their
sales executive which will provide
better data to the company in order to
improve the process next we will discuss
a technique named voice of
customer the voice of customer is a
technique to organize analyze and
profile the customer's requirements
voice of the customer is an expression
for listening to the external customer
the table shows the customer
requirements while purchasing an air
conditioner
in all cases the customer is purchasing
for his or her domestic usage each
customer is further categorized
according to his needs and requirements
when the customer says that he needs a
silent air conditioner he needs sound
sleep at night in the bedroom this is
primarily to remain fresh the next
morning and to get rid of the noisy
ceiling fan being used currently in case
the customer says that he needs an
efficient AC he needs a machine which
provides good cooling at night in the
bedroom this is mainly because it gets
extremely hot in summer also he
currently uses a ceiling fan which is
not so effective in Summers on the other
hand when the customer wants to buy an
AC which is not too costly he has
limited cash for the purchase he wants
to purchase a lowcost AC let us discuss
the importance of translating customer
requirements in the next
screen customer requirements is the data
collected from customers that gives
information about what they need or want
from the process customer requirements
are often high level bague and
non-specific some customers may give you
a set of specific requirements to the
business but broadly customers
requirements are a reflection of their
experience customer requirements when
translated into critical process
requirements that are specific and
measurable are called critical to
Quality ctq fact factors a fully
developed ctq has four major elements
output characteristic y metric Target
and specification or tolerance limits we
will discuss the meaning of ctq in the
next
screen let us understand what Quality
Function deployment is in this screen
qfd is a process to ensure that the
customer's wants and needs are heard and
translated into technical
characteristics itics it is also known
as the voice of the customer or House of
quality qfd is a process to understand
the customers needs and translate them
into a set of design and Manufacturing
requirements while motivating businesses
to focus on their customers it also
helps companies to design and build more
competitive products in less time and
lesser costs qfd helps in prioritizing
customer requirements recognizing
strengths and weaknesses of an
organization and recognizing areas that
need to be worked on and areas that need
immediate focus of efforts qfd is
carried out by asking relevant questions
to the customers and tabulating them to
bring out a set of parameters critical
to the product design let us discuss
phases of qfd in the next
screen Quality Function deployment
involves four phases phase one product
planning
in this phase the qfd team translates
the customer requirements into product
technical
requirements phase two product design in
this phase the qfd team translates the
identified technical requirements into
key part characteristics or
systems phase three process planning in
this phase the qfd team identifies the
key process operations necessary to
achieve the identified key part
character
characteristics phase four production
planning or process control in this
phase the qfd team establishes process
control plans maintenance plans and
training plans to control
operations next we will understand the
structure of
qfd let us see what happens after
completing the hoq
Matrix completing one hoq Matrix is not
the end of the qfd process the the
output of the first HQ Matrix can be the
first stage of the second qfd phase as
shown in the image the translation
process is continued using linked HQ
type matrices until the production
planning targets are developed let us
proceed to the next topic of this lesson
in the following
screen in this topic we will discuss the
basics of project management let us
start with a discussion on problem
statement
every Six Sigma project targets a
problem that needs to be resolved the
first step of project initiation is
defining the problem statement a problem
statement needs to describe the problem
in a clear and concise manner a problem
statement needs to identify and specify
The observed Gap in performance it
should indicate the current performance
state of a process and the required
performance State completely derived
from customer requirements a problem
statement should be
quantifiable this means it should have
specified metrics including the
respective units please note that the
problem statement cannot contain
Solutions or causes for the problem in
the next screen we will discuss the is
or is not
template the is or is not technique was
first popularized by Kepner Trio
Incorporated in the 1970s it is a
powerful tool that helps Define the
problem and gather required information
an example of a problem statement of
paper cup leaks is given on the
screen the Six Sigma team has to answer
what is the problem what isn't the
problem where is it where isn't it when
is it when isn't it a problem to what
extent is it a problem and to what
extent isn't it a problem the
information is then used to fill the
question areas in the is and is not
issue template in the the analysis phase
if a cause cannot describe the is and
the is not data then it's not likely the
main cause in the next screen we will
list the criteria for the project
objectives the project objectives must
meet the smarts criteria smarts is an
acronym of the characteristics desired
in Project objectives specific
measurable attainable relevant
time-based and stretch the project
deliverables should be specific example
hospitals maintain records of all
patients often a few forms are rejected
or missed due to errors in recording the
ID numbers in this case setting the
objective as reduce form rejection is
very vague instead reduce patient ID
errors in recording lab results is
specific and effectively targets solving
the problem
the project objectives should be
quantifiable example setting the
objective as fewer form rejections is
very vague instead reduce patient ID
Errors By 30% sets a specific goal the
project objectives should be achievable
and practical the project objectives
should be relevant to the problem the
project objectives must specify a time
frame within which they should be
delivered
the project objectives must not be
easily achievable example most problems
and errors can be reduced by creating
awareness hence the objective must
stretch beyond the easily attainable
state in the next screen we will
understand project
documentation project documentation
refers to creating documents to provide
details about the project such documents
are used to gain a better understanding
of the project prevent and resolve
conflict among stakeholders and Share
Plans and status for the project
documentation of a project is critical
throughout the project some of the
benefits achieved through project
documentation are mentioned below
documentation serves as written proof
for execution of the project it helps
teams achieve a common understanding of
the requirements and the status of the
project it removes personal bias as
there is a documented history of
discussions and decisions made for the
project depending on the nature of the
project each project produces a number
of different documents some of these
documents are the project Charter
project plan and its subsidiary plans
other examples of project documentation
include project status reports including
key Milestones report risk items and and
pending action items the frequency of
these reports is determined by the need
and complexity of the project these
reports are sent to All stakeholders to
keep them AB breast of the status of the
project another example of project
documentation is the final project
report this report is prepared at the
end of the project and includes a
summary of the complete project project
storyboard inputs generated from
statistical tools outputs from
spreadsheets checklists and other
miscellaneous documents are also
classified as project documents in the
next screen we will understand project
Charter we will list the project Charter
sections in this screen the major
sections of a project Charter are
project name and description business
requirements name of the project manager
project purpose or justification
including Roi stakeholder and
stakeholder requirements broad timelines
major deliverables constraints and
assumptions and the budget summary of
the charter in the next screen we will
understand the project
plan a project plan is the final
approved document which is used to
manage and control the various processes
within the project and ensure its
seamless execution the project manager
uses the project Charter as an input to
create a detailed project plan a project
plan comprises various sections
prominent among them being the project
management approach the scope statement
the work breakdown structure the cost
estimates scheduling defining
performance baselines marking major
Milestones to be achieved and the key
members and required staff Personnel for
the project it also includes the various
open and pending decisions related to
the project and the key risks involved
additionally it also contains references
to other subsidiary plans for managing
risk scope schedule Etc in the next
screen we will learn about project
scope we will look at different
techniques used for interpreting the
project scope in this screen project
scope can be interpreted from the
problem statement and project Charter
using VAR ious tools like the parito
chart and the cypo map the principle
behind the parito chart or the 8020
Principle as we know it is a vital few
trivial many the burito chart helps the
teams to trim the scope of the project
by identifying the causes which have a
major impact on the outcome of the
project the cyoc map is a highlevel
process map which helps all team members
in understanding the process functions
in terms of addressing questions like
who are the suppliers what are the
inputs they provide what are the outputs
that can be obtained and who are the
customers as discussed earlier cypo
stands for suppliers inputs process
outputs and customers in the subsequent
screen we will learn about process
Maps cypo is a macro level map that
provides an overview of the business
process where a process map is a micr
level flowchart that provides an
in-depth detail of a process the process
map covers details at all levels and
provides a walk through the current
process experience the cypo map is used
as a basis while drawing a process map a
level one process map provides in-depth
information but the final process map
drills further into into detail in the
following screen we will understand the
project
metrics let us discuss consequential
metrics in this screen consequential
metrics measure any negative
consequences these can be business
metrics process metrics or both they
measure the negative effects of
improving the primary or key metrics
they are used to measure the indemnity
triggered by any damage in the project
the inconsistent use of consequential
metrics can lead to loss of opportunity
and rework after a project ends
consequential metrics help to understand
the cause and effect relationship
between the primary and the secondary
metrics and the impact it has on the
organization let us take a look at an
example for consequential metrics in the
next
screen we will discuss the best
practices in this screen the following
are some of the best practices of
consequential metrics setting
consequential metrics during the measure
phase and monitoring these metrics after
finalizing the project will help to
analyze whether the link between
previous primary and secondary metrics
has been
established also linking consequential
metrics with primary metrics and finally
linking them with secondary metrics
provides Clarity on the impact of these
metrics assessing and evaluating the
cause and effect relationship between
these metrics is helpful to the
organization as a whole in the next
screen we will list some project
planning
tools the project manager uses various
tools to plan and control a project one
of the tools which he uses is the Paro
chart other prominent tools include the
network diagram the critical path method
also called
CPM the program evaluation and review
technique which is also known as per
Gant charts and the work breakdown
structure also known as
WBS in the next screen we will discuss
parito
chart parito chart is a histogram
ordered by the frequency of occurrence
of events it is also known as the 8020
rule or vital Fe trivial many it helps
project teams to focus on the issues
which cause the highest number of
defects or complaints to explain further
the given chart plots all the causes for
defects in a product or service the
values are represented in descending
order by bars and the cumulative total
is represented by the line Paro chart
emphasizes that 80% of the effects come
from 20% of the causes thus a Paro chart
Nar Narrows the scope of the project or
problem solving by identifying the major
causes affecting quality parito charts
are useful only when required data is
available if data is not available then
other tools such as brainstorming and
multiv voting should be used to find the
root cause of any problem in the
following screen we will continue to
discuss parito chart with an
example a hotel receives plenty of
complaints from it customers and the
hotel manager wishes to identify the key
areas of complaints complaints were
received in the following areas cleaning
check-in pool timings mini bar room
service and
miscellaneous cleaning and checkin can
be noted as areas of concern with 35 and
19 complaints
respectively percentage is calculated
for each cause of complaint and the
cumulative is derived parito chart is
plotted using this data in the next
screen we will discuss Network
diagrams Network diagrams are one of the
tools used by the project manager for
project planning they are also sometimes
referred to as Arrow diagrams because
they use arrows to connect activities
and represent precedence and
interdependencies between activities of
a project there are some assumptions
that need to be made while forming the
network diagram
the first assumption is that before a
new activity begins all pending
activities have been completed the
second assumption is that all arrows
indicate logical precedence this means
that the direction of the arrow
represents the sequence that activities
need to follow the last assumption is
that a network diagram must start from a
single event and end with a single event
there cannot be multiple start and end
points to the network diagram in the
next screen let us discuss some terms
related to network
diagram for the network diagram to
calculate the total duration of the
project the project manager needs to
Define four dates for each task the
first two dates relate to the date by
when the task can be started the first
date is early start this is the earliest
date by when the task can start the
second date is late start this is the
last date by when the task should start
the second two dates relate to the dates
when the task should be complete early
finish is the earliest date by when the
task can be completed late finish is the
last date by when the task should be
completed the duration of the task is
calculated as the difference between the
early start and early finish of the task
the difference between the early start
and late start of the task is called the
slack time available for the task slack
can also be calculated as the difference
between the early finish and late finish
dates of the task slack time or float
time for a task is the amount of time
the task can be delayed before it causes
a delay in the overall project
timeline in the next screen we will
discuss critical path
method critical path method also known
as CPM is an important tool used by
project managers to monitor the progress
of the project and to ensure that the
project is on schedule the critical path
for a project is the longest sequence of
tasks on the network diagram the
critical path in the given Network
diagram is highlighted in Orange
critical path is characterized by zero
slack for all tasks on the sequence this
means that the smallest delay in any of
the tasks on the critical path will
cause cause a delay in the overall
timeline of the project this makes it
very important for the project manager
to closely monitor the tasks on the
critical path and ensure that the tasks
go smoothly if needed the project
manager can divert resources from other
tasks that are not on the critical path
to tasks on the critical path to ensure
that the project is not delayed when a
project manager removes resources from
such tasks he needs to ensure that the
task does not become a critical path
task because of the reduced number of
resources during the execution of the
project the critical path can easily
shift because of multiple factors and
hence needs to be constantly monitored
by the project manager a complex project
can also have multiple critical paths in
the next screen we will discuss project
evaluation and review
Technique we will understand the concept
of RIS risk in this
screen risk is an uncertain event or
consequence probable of occurring during
a project the main objectives of any
project are time cost quality and scope
risk affects at least one of the four
project objectives it is important to
understand that risk can be both
positive as well as negative a positive
risk enhances the success of the project
whereas a negative risk is is a threat
to a Project's success some of the terms
used in Risk analysis and management are
risk probability issue and risk
consequences the likelihood that a risk
will occur is called risk probability to
assess any risk is to assess the
probability and impact of the risk issue
is the occurrence of a risk risk
consequences are the effects on Project
objectives if there is an occurrence of
a risk or issue in the subsequent screen
we will understand the process of risk
analysis and
management we will list and understand
some of the elements of risk analysis in
this screen qualitative method
qualitative methods like interview
checklists and brainstorming are used to
identify potential risks quantitative
method quantitative methods are
databased and a computer is required to
calculate and analyze these methods are
used to evaluate the cost time and
probalistic combination of individual
uncertainties
feasibility feasibility is the study of
the project risk this is usually carried
out in the beginning of the project when
the project is most flexible and risks
can be reduced at a relatively low cost
it helps in deciding different
implementing options for the projects
potential impact once the potential
risks are identified the impact of these
on the project is determined using this
data possible solutions for the risks
are
identified
rpn rpn of a failure is the product of
its probability of occurrence severity
and
detectability a failure is prioritized
based on its rpn value a high rpn
indicates high risk rpn assists to
prioritize
risks avoiding risk when potential risks
are identified their impact in terms of
cost time resources and objective
perspective is
calculated if the impact is huge then
avoiding the risk is the best
option mitigating risk mitigating is the
second option when dealing with risks
the loss that arises from mitigating a
risk is much less than the loss that
arises from the temporary avoiding of
risk accepting the risk if a risk cannot
be avoided or mitigated then it has to
be accepted the risk will be accepted if
it doesn't greatly impact the cost time
and product objective in the following
screen we will discuss benefits of risk
analysis benefits of risk analysis are
as follows once the risk has been ident
identified it can be either mitigated
transferred or accepted when risk is
identified in a task slack time is
provided as a buffer identifying risks
also helps in setting up an actual
timeline for a project slack time for an
activity in a project could be the
result of a risk identified
proactively identifying risks helps in
setting realistic expectations from the
project by communicating the risk
probability and consequence to
stakeholders risk analysis also helps to
identify and plan contingency activities
if the risk becomes an issue the project
team is then well prepared to work on
the issue thereby reducing the impact of
the risk in the following screen we will
take a look at the risk assessment
Matrix the potential risks of a project
are assessed using the risk assessment
Matrix if covers potential risk areas
like project scope team Personnel
material facility and equipment and
communication each of these areas is
assessed in terms of risk of loss of
money productivity resources and
customer confidence in the subsequent
screen we will discuss project
closure by definition a project has a
beginning and an end but without a
formal closure process project teams can
fail to recognize the end and then the
project can drag on sometimes at Great
expense every project requires closure
for large or complex projects it's a
good idea to close each major project
phase for example design code and test
individually project closure ensures
that outcomes match the stated goals of
the project customers and stakeholders
are happy with the results critical
knowledge is captured the team feels a
sense of completion and project
resources are released for new projects
in the next screen we will list the
goals of a project closure
report the project closure report is
created to accomplish the following
goals review and validate the success of
the project confirm outstanding issues
limitations and
recommendations outline tasks and
activities ities accomplished to
complete the activity highlight the best
practices for future projects provide
the project report or summary provide a
project background
overview summarize the planned
activities of a
project evaluate project
performance provide a synopsis of the
process generate discussions and
recommendations generate project closure
recommendation
in the following screen we will list and
understand project closure
activities during project closure the
project manager needs to take care of
the following
activities finalize the project
documents much of a Project's
documentation is created during the life
of the project document collection and
update procedures are well established
during the project
Lifeline capture the project
knowledge project documents are helpful
for future projects in troubleshooting
the product or in a future audit set up
a project
Library ideally the project library is
set up at the beginning of the project
and team members add documents as they
produce them document the project
learnings project learnings can be
captured through team meetings meetings
with stakeholders and sponsor and
through feedbacks from consultants and
vendors provide knowledge
transfer the project manager needs to
provide a summary of the project results
to team members either as a presentation
at a meeting or as a formal document
Consultants should not be relieved from
their position until they have
transferred all the important product
maintenance knowledge to the team get a
final sign off schedule a meeting with
the project sponsor and key stakeholders
get get their final sign off on the
project close the project office if the
project team used a project management
office or a dedicated work area
Arrangements need to be made to return
that space for General
use recognize and reward the project
manager has the best understanding of
which of the team members have worked
the best have transformed themselves
with new skills and who might be ready
for a new level of responsibility
the project manager needs to report to
the team superiors what each team member
has brought to the project
celebrate after completion of every
project the team needs and deserves a
celebration a team dinner a team outing
gift certificates or other rewards are
minor costs that generate a large return
in terms of morale and job
satisfaction make a public announcement
an announcement to the organization is a
good way to highlight the success of the
project and its benefits to the company
conclude formal project closure ensures
that the team has met its objectives
satisfied the customer captured
important knowledge and been rewarded
for their efforts let us proceed to the
next topic of this lesson in the
following
screen in this topic we will discuss
management and planning tools let us
start with the discussion on affinity
diagram in the next
screen the Affinity diagram method is
employed by an individual or team to
solve unfamiliar problems it is an
effective medium where the consensus of
the group is
necessary the given Affinity diagram is
based on an organization where the
employees are not
satisfied to begin with each member
writes down ideas and opinions on sticky
notes each note can have a single idea
the points which have surfaced during
the brainstorming session are that the
workers are unkind pay is low and it is
difficult to survive on the pay
structure working hours are too long
Etc in The Next Step all the sticky
notes are pasted on a table or wall the
sticky papers are arranged according to
categories or thought patterns members
happen to arrange their ideas based on
Affinity in case a particular idea is
good to go go into more than one
category it is duplicated and added to
several
categories after the arrangement is done
each category is named with a header
card the header card captures the
central idea of all the cards in that
category and draws a boundary around
them poor compensation combines ideas
like low pay long working hours and
complaints about wages poor work
environment encompasses issues like poor
lighting uncomfortable rooms and stuffy
air similarly poor relationships Prevail
in the workspace as the workers are
unkind and there is mutual
dislike lack of motivation is due to
repetitive work and no work related
challenges you can see in the diagram on
that slide that once all the ideas are
grouped to the respective header cards a
diagram is drawn and borders are placed
around the group of ideas thus Affinity
diagram helps in grouping ideas with the
common theme in the next screen we will
discuss the interrelationship
diagram during problem solving the inter
relationship diagram technique helps in
identifying the relationship between
problems and ideas in complex
situations if the problem is really
complex it may not be easy to determine
the exact relationship between ideas
the given interrelationship diagram is
the result of a team brainstorming
session which identified 10 major issues
involved in developing an organization's
quality
plan initially the problem is defined
and all the members put down their ideas
on sticky notes each note contains only
one idea all the sticky notes are put on
a table for a random
display in The Next Step the causes or
area of concern are identified and a
cause effect arrangement of cards is
constructed by drawing an arrow between
the causes and effects of the
cause this is done until all the ideas
on the sticky notes are accounted for
and made a part of the inter
relationship
diagram take a large sheet of paper and
replicate the cause effect Arrangement
on it as depicted in the image a large
number of outgoing arrows indicate the
root cause whereas a higher number of
incoming arrows indicates an outcome
there are as many as six arrows
originating from lack of quality
strategy this leads us to understand
that it is a root cause on the other
hand there are three arrows ending with
the idea lack of tqm commitment by
managers making it an outcome in the
next screen we will understand the tree
diagram
the tree diagram is a systematic
approach to outline all the details
needed to complete a given objective in
other words it is a method used to
identify the tasks and methods needed to
solve a problem and reach a predefined
goal it is mostly used while developing
actions to execute a solution while
analyzing processes in detail during the
evaluation of implementation issues for
several potential Solutions and also as
a communication tool to explain the
details of a process to others the given
tree diagram shows the plan of a coffee
shop trying to set standards for the
coffee it
delivers first the objective is noted on
a note card and placed on the far left
side of the board the basic goal of the
coffee shop is to provide a delightful
cappuccino
experience in The Next Step the coffee
shop needs to determine the means
required to achieve the goal and furnish
three different solution Solutions in
other words the answers to the how or
why questions of the
objectives in this case the cappuccino
needs to be at a comfortable temperature
and it should have strong and pleasing
coffee Aroma with the right amount of
Sweetness in The Next Step the three
issues mentioned in the second stage are
addressed at length each issue is
answered by maintaining the espresso and
steamed milk temperature the cappuccino
can be served at a palatable temperature
strong flavored cappuccino can be
prepared using a good amount of finely
ground coffee banss and a good quality
sweetener used in the right amount makes
a great
cappuccino thus the tree diagram can be
used to achieve a goal or Define a
process in the following screen we will
discuss prioritization
matrices let us learn about Matrix
diagram in this screen Matrix diagrams
show the relationship between objectives
and methods results and causes tasks and
people Etc their objective is to provide
information about the
relationship they provide importance of
task and Method elements of the subject
they also help determine the strength of
relationships between a grid of rows and
columns they help in organizing a large
amount of interprocess related
activities let us discuss various types
of matrices in the next
screen let us learn about a processed
decision program chart in this
screen processed decision program chart
or the pdpc method is used to chart the
course of events from the beginning of a
process till the goal while emphasizing
the ability to identify the failure of
important issues on activity plans the
PDP helps create appropriate contingency
plans to limit the number of risks
involved the pdpc is used before
implementing a plan especially when the
plan is large and complex if the plan
must be completed on schedule or if the
price of failure is quite High the given
process decision program chart shows the
process which can help in securing a
contract the process starts when the
seller receives an order order request
from a potential buyer this can lead to
fixing an appointment with the buyer
confirming the appointment date and
meeting the buyer if a date is not fixed
then buyer should be contacted till the
meeting is confirmed without a meeting
there is a risk of losing the
order considering an optimistic scenario
where a meeting is fixed with the buyer
the seller describes the price of the
product or service if the price is
competitive the the order is secured if
the price is not competitive the seller
may have to repeat the bid until the
buyer agrees and the order is
secure however the buyer may not agree
to a revised bid either in which case
the seller might lose the bid in such a
scenario the seller can justify the
pricing and pursue the buyer to agree to
the bid it might work and the seller
might secure the order in the next
screen we will discuss the activity
Network
diagram an activity Network diagram is
used to show the time required for
solving a problem and to identify items
that can be done in parallel it is used
in scheduling and monitoring tasks
within a complex project or process with
interrelated tasks and resources
moreover it is also used when you know
the steps of the project or process
their sequence and the time taken by
each of the steps involved the original
Japanese name for this tool is aerody
diagram the given activity Network
diagram shows a house construction plan
and identifies the factors involved
separately like the amount of time for
each operation in one situation the
relationship of work without time for
each operation and an operation by
itself the number of days is denoted by
D so the time taken for an activity like
found Foundation to scaffolding takes
around 5 days plus 4 days which is 9
days in total the line joining
electrical work and interior walls is
dotted this shows relation between them
but without any timeline basically it
means that electrical work has to be
done before interior walls but the time
is either not important or not available
let us proceed to the next topic of this
lesson in the following
screen in this topic we will introduce
business results for projects let us
start with the discussion on defect per
unit we will learn about throughput
yield in this screen throughput yield or
tpy is the number of acceptable pieces
at the end of a process divided by the
number of starting pieces excluding
scrap and rework throughput yield is
used to measure a single process only if
the dpu is known tpy can be easily
calculated as e to the power of the
negative of
dpu here e is the mathematical constant
and has a value of 2.718 3 the
expression can also be stated as dpu
equals the negative of natural logarithm
e of
tpy in the next screen we will discuss
rolled throughput yield
rolled throughput yield or rty is the
probability of the entire process
producing zero defects rty is the true
measure of process efficiency and is
considered across multiple processes it
is important as a metric when a process
has excessive rework TDP U is total
defects per unit and is defined for a
set of processes when the total defects
per unit is known rolled throughput
yield is calculated using the expression
e to the power of negative of T
dpu the expression can also be written
as T dpu is equal to negative of natural
logarithm of
rty when the defectives are known roll
throughput yield can be calculated as
the product of each process's first pass
yield or
fpy first pass yield is the number of
products which pass without any rework
over the total number of units first
pass yield is calculated as total number
of quality products over total number of
units total number of quality products
is total number of units minus total
number of defective units in the
following screen we will understand fpy
and rty with an
example we will discuss process
capability in this
screen process capability or CP is
defined as the inherent variability of a
characteristic of a process or a product
in other words it might also mean how
well a process meets customer
requirement CP is an indicator of
capability of a process and is expressed
as difference of USL and LSL divided by
product of Six Sigma us L stands for
upper specification limit LSL is lower
specification limit and sigma is the
standard deviation of a process the
difference between USL and LSL is also
called the specification with or
tolerance in the following screen we
will discuss process capability
indices process capability indices or
CPK was developed to objectively measure
the degree to which a process meets or
does not meet customer requirements it
was developed to account for the
position of mean with respect to USL and
LSL to calculate
CPK the first step is to determine if
the process mean is closer to the LSL or
the USL if the process mean is closer to
LSL CPK is
determined CPK L is mean minus LSL /
product of three and sigma if the
process mean is closer to USL cpku is
calculated cpku is USL minus mean ided
product of three and sigma here mean is
the process average and sigma represents
the standard deviation if the process
mean is equidistant either of the
specification limit can be chosen
CPK takes up the value of cpku and CPK L
depending on whichever is the lower
value in the next screen we will
understand process capability indices
with an
example in this screen we will discuss
CPK and CP
interpretations a CP value of less than
one indicates the process is not capable
even if CP is greater than one to add
ascertain if the process really is not
capable check the CPK value a CPK value
of less than one indicates that the
process is definitely not capable but
might be if CP is greater than one and
the process mean is at or near the
midpoint of the tolerance range the CPK
value will always be less than CP
especially as long as the process mean
is not at the center of the process
tolerance range
non centering can happen when the
process has not understood the customer
expectations clearly or the process is
complete as soon as the output reaches a
specific limit for example a shirt size
of 40 has a Target chest diameter of 40
in but the process consistently delivers
shirts with a mean of 41 in as the chest
diameter a machine stops removing
material as soon as the measured
Dimension is within specified limit let
us proceed to the next topic of this
lesson in the following
screen in this topic we will discuss
Team Dynamics and performance let us
start with a discussion on team
stages there are five typical stages in
the team building process each team
passes through these stages as they
start and proceed through the project
the five stages in the team building
process C are as follows forming
storming norming performing and
adjourning in the next screen we will
discuss the first stage
forming the first stage in the team
building process is called the forming
stage in this stage the team comes
together and begins to formulate roles
and
responsibilities the team leader is
identified and he or she starts
directing the team and assigning
responsibilities to other teams members
most team members at this stage are
generally enthusiastic and motivated by
desire to be accepted within the team
the leader employs a directive style of
management which includes delegating
responsibility within the team providing
a structure to the team and determining
processes needed for the smooth
functioning of the team toward the end
of this phase the team should achieve a
commitment to the project and an
acceptance of a common purpose
in the next screen we will discuss the
second stage
storming the second phase in the team
building process is called the storming
stage as suggested by the name itself in
this stage conflicts start to arise
within the team team members often
struggle over responsibilities and
control within the project it is the
responsibility of the team leader to
coach and conciliate the team the leader
employs a coaching style of management
which is reflected through facilitating
change managing conflict and mediating
understanding between different parties
towards the end of this phase team
members need to learn to voice
disagreement openly and constructively
while staying focused on common
objectives and areas of agreement in the
next screen we will discuss the third
stage
norming the third stage in the team
building process process is called the
norming stage in this stage people get
along and the team develops a unified
commitment toward the project goal the
team leader promotes the team and
participates in the team activities team
members look to the leader to clarify
their understanding as some leadership
roles begin to shift within the lower
rungs of the group The Leader employs a
participatory style of management
through facilitating change working to
build consensus and overseeing quality
control toward the end of this phase
team members need to accept individual
responsibilities and work out agreements
about team procedures in the next screen
we will discuss the fourth stage
performing the next stage in the team
building process is called the
Performing stage this is the most
productive stage for the project team in
this stage team members manage complex
tasks and work toward the common goal
goals of the project the leader employs
a supervisory style of management by
overseeing progress rewarding
achievement and supervising process the
team leader leads the project on more or
less an automated mode when the project
has completed successfully or when the
end is in sight the team moves into the
final stage in the next screen we will
discuss the fifth stage
adjourning the last stage of team
building is called the adjourning stage
in this stage the project is winding
down and the goals are within reach the
team members are dealing with their
impending separation from the team the
team leader provides feedback to the
team the leader employs a supportive
style of management by giving feedback
celebrating accomplishments and
providing closure the team leader needs
to adopt a different style of leadership
at every stage
it is therefore important for a leader
to understand these stages and identify
the current stage that a team is in the
success of the team depends on how well
the leader can guide them through these
phases in the next screen we will learn
about negative
Dynamics team members can exhibit
negative behavior in more than one way
during the Project Life Cycle this
Behavior has a negative effect on the
dynamic of the team the first kind of
negative participants fall in the
category of overbearing
participants these participants use
their influence or expertise to take on
a position of authority discounting
contributions from other team members to
cope with such participants team leaders
must establish ground rules for
participation and reinforce that the
group has the right to explore any area
pertinent to team goals and objectives
another kind of negative participant is
often referred to as the dominant
participant these participants take up
an excessive amount of group Time by
talking too much focusing on trivial
concerns and otherwise preventing
participation by others team leaders
need to be able to control dominant
participants without inhibiting their
energy or
enthusiasm some other participants are
reluctant part participants who feel
intimidated and are not happy with the
team process owing to their reluctance
they miss opportunities to bring up data
that is valuable to the project this can
often lead to hostility within the team
one way to deal with reluctant
participants is to respond positively
and with encouragement to any
contribution from the team member
teamwork is more than a natural
consequence of working together
team management is more than building a
relationship with individual team
members all teams face group challenges
that need group-based diagnosis and
problem solving to ensure that negative
participants are able to contribute and
perform as part of the team in the next
screen we will learn about group
challenges Six Sigma team and their
responsibilities are described here
various roles assist the smooth
execution of a Six Sigma project these
roles are required to support the
project by providing the information and
resources that are needed to execute the
project the first important member of
the Six Sigma team is the executive
sponsor sponsors are the source or
conduit for project resources and they
are usually the recipients of the
benefits the project will produce the
sponsor is respon responsible for
setting the direction and priorities for
the
organization the sponsor may be a
functional manager or an external
customer the next important role is that
of the process owners they work with the
black belts to improve their respective
processes they provide functional
expertise about the process to the
project usually this role is played by
the functional managers in charge of
specific
processes the the next role in the
project is that of the Champions they
are typically upper level managers who
control and allocate resources to
promote process improvements they ensure
the organization is providing necessary
resources to the project and the project
is fitting into the Strategic plans of
the
organization the first role related to
the execution of the project is the role
of the master black Bel this role acts
as a consultant to team team leaders and
offers expertise in the use of Six Sigma
tools and
methodologies Master black belts are
experts in Six Sigma statistical tools
and are qualified to teach highlevel Six
Sigma methodologies and
applications each Master black belt will
have multiple black belts under him
black belts are the leaders of
individual Six Sigma projects they lead
project teams and conduct the detailed
analysis requir IR ired in Six Sigma
methodologies black belts act as
instructors and mentors for green belts
and educate them in Six Sigma tools and
methods they also protect the interests
of the project by coordinating with
functional managers green belts are
trained in Six Sigma but typically lead
project teams working in their own areas
of expertise they are focused on the
basic Six Sigma tools for acceleration
of projects
green belts work on projects on a
part-time basis dividing time between
project and functional
responsibilities an executive is the
person who manages and leads the team to
ensure smooth working of tasks and has
the power to execute
decisions a coach takes on a number of
roles he or she is the person who trains
mentors teaches and guides the team when
required coach also motivates and builds
confidence of the
members a facilitator is a guide for the
team or group also known as a discussion
leader facilitators help the group or
team to understand their common
objective and plan their
activities a sponsor is a person who
supports the event or the project by
providing all the required
resources a team member is an individual
who belongs to a particular project team
a team member contributes to to the
performance of the team and actively
participates for fulfillment of the
project
objectives the progress achievements and
the details of the project have to be
effectively communicated to the team
management customers and
stakeholders we will learn about modes
of communication in the next
screen let us understand communication
within the team in this screen the
purpose of communication within the team
and the modes of communication used are
as follows meetings and emails are
suitable to communicate the roles and
responsibilities of the team members
meetings memos and emails are used by
the team to understand the project
status workshops and meetings are
conducted to identify the outstanding
tasks risks and their corrective actions
team meetings assist
decision-making meetings and emails
ensure coordination and efficient work
the next screen will focus on
communication with
stakeholders the purpose of
communication with stakeholders and the
modes of communication used are as
follows meeting emails and events are
suitable to convey project objectives
and goals to
stakeholders meetings emails and
newsletters assist stakeholders in
understanding project status work
workshops meetings and events help
stakeholders to identify the adverse
effects of a
situation meetings with stakeholders
assist decision-making process in the
next screen we will discuss the
communication technique communication
techniques can be grouped in various
ways the first grouping of communication
techniques is based on the direction in
which communication flows vertical
communication consists of two subtypes
namely downward flow of communication
and upward flow of
communication in the downward flow of
communication the managers must pass
information and give orders and
directives to the lower levels in the
organization on the contrary upward
communication consists of information
relayed from the bottom or grassroot
levels to the higher levels of the
company horizontal communication refers
to the sharing of information across the
same levels of the
organization this can be in the form of
formal and informal
communication formal Communications are
official company sanctioned methods of
communicating to the
employees the grape vine Rumor Mill Etc
are some of the means of informal
communication in the
organization the second grouping of
communication techniques is based on the
usage of words verbal communication
includes use of words for communication
via telephone face Toof face
Etc non-verbal communication conveys
messages without the use of words
through body language facial expressions
Etc the last grouping of communication
techniques is based on participation of
the people involved in
communication One Way communication
happens when information is relayed from
the sender to the receiver without the
expectation of a response like memos and
announcements two-way communication is a
method in which both parties are
involved in the exchange of
information team tools are a part of the
team Dynamics and performance the
various team tools that are used are
brainstorming nominal group technique
and multiv voting if getting your
learning started is half the battle what

this lesson will cover the details of
the measure phase the key objective of
the measure phase is to gather as much
information as possible on the current
processes this involves three key tasks
that is creating a detailed process map
Gathering Baseline data and summarizing
and analyzing the data let us understand
process modeling in the following
screen process modeling refers to the
visualization of a proposed system
layout or other change in the process
process modeling and simulation can
determine the effectiveness or
ineffectiveness of a new design or
process they can be done using process
mapping and flowcharts we will learn
about these in the forthcoming
screens let us understand process
mapping in this screen process mapping
refers to a workflow diagram which gives
a clear understanding of the process or
a series of parallel processes it is
also known as process charting or flow
charting process mapping can be done
either in the measure phase or the
analyze phase the features of process
mapping are as follows process mapping
is usually the first step in process
improvement process mapping gives a
wider perspective of the problems and
opportunities for process
Improvement it is a systematic way of
recording all the activities
performed process mapping can be done by
using any of the methods like flowcharts
written procedures and detailed work
instructions let us learn about
flowchart in the following
screen a flowchart is a pictorial
representation of all the steps of a
process process in consecutive order it
is used to plan a project document
processes and communicate the process
methodology with others there are many
symbols used in a flowchart and the
common symbols are shown in the given
table it is recommended you take a look
at the symbols and their description for
better understanding click the button to
view an example of a
flowchart the given flowchart shows the
processes involved in software
development the flowchart starts with
the start box which connects to the
design box in a software project a
software design is followed by coding
which is Then followed by testing in The
Next Step there is a check for errors in
case of Errors it is evaluated for the
error type if it is a design error it
goes back to the beginning of the design
stage if it is not a design error it is
then routed to the beginning of the
coding stage on the contrary if there
are no errors the flowchart
ends let us learn about written
procedures in this screen a written
procedure is a step-by-step guide to
direct The Reader through a task it is
used when the process of a routine task
is lengthy and complex and it is
essential for everyone to strictly
follow the rules written procedures can
also be used when you want to know what
is going on during product or process
development
phases there are a number of benefits of
documenting
procedures writing procedures help you
avoid mistakes and ensure
consistency they streamline the process
and help your employees take relevant
decisions and save a lot of time written
procedures help in improving quality
they are simple to understand as they
tend to describe describe the processes
at a general level in the next screen we
will discuss how work instructions are
helpful in understanding the process in
detail work instructions Define how one
or more activities involved in a
procedure should be written in a
detailed manner with the aid of
technology or other resources like
flowcharts they provide stepbystep
details for a sequence of activities
organized in a logical format so that an
employee can follow it easily and
independently for example in the
internal audit procedure how to fill out
the audit results report comes under
work
instructions selection of the three
process mapping tools is based on the
amount of detail involved in the process
for a less detailed process you can
select flowchart and for a detailed
process with lots of instructions you
can select work
instructions click the button to view an
example of work
instructions this example shows the work
instructions for shipping electronic
instruments the company name is neutri
worldwide Inc the instructions are
written by Brianna Scott and approved by
Andrew Murphy it is a one-page
instruction the work instructions are
documented for the shipping of
electronic instruments by the shipping
Department the scope of the project
states that it is applicable to shipping
operations
the procedure is divided into three
broad steps as a first step the order
for the shipment must be prepared in
this step the shipping person receives
an order number from the sales
department through an automatic order
system the quantity of the instrument
and its card number are looked up from
the system file and the packaging is
done as per the instructions on the card
the next step is packaging special
packing instructions must must be
checked the instruments are then marked
as per the instructions on the card and
packed in a special or standard
container as per the requirement the
order number is written in the shipping
system and the packing list and shipping
documentation are
obtained finally the quantity of
instruments and the documents is
checked let us understand process input
and output variables in this
screen any Improvement of a process has
a few
prerequisites to improve a process the
key process output variables
kpv and key process input variables KP I
should first be measured metrics for key
process variables include percent
defective operation cost elapsed time
backlog quantity and documentation
errors critical variables are best
identified by the process owners process
owners know and understand each step of
a process and are in a better position
to identify the critical variables
initially once identified the
relationship between the variables is
depicted using tools such as cypo and
cause and effect Matrix the process
input variables results are compared to
determine which input variables have the
greatest effect on the output
variables let us proceed to the next
topic of this lesson in the following
screen in this topic we will discuss
probability and statistics in detail let
us learn about probability in the
following screen probability refers to
the chance of something occurring or
happening an outcome is the result of a
single trial of an experiment Suppose
there are n possible outcomes that are
equally likely the probability that a
specific type of event or outcome say F
can occur is the number of specific
outcomes divided by the total possible
outcomes click the button to view an
example of
probability in the event of tossing a
coin what is the probability of the
occurrence of heads a single trial of
tossing a coin has two outcomes heads
and tails hence the probability of heads
occurring is 1 / two the total number of
outcomes let us look at some basic
properties of probability in this screen
there are three basic properties of
probability click each property to know
more property one states that the
probability of an event is always
between Zer and one both
inclusive according to Property 2 the
probability of an event that cannot
occur is zero in other words words an
event that cannot occur is called an
impossible
event property three states that the
probability of an event that must occur
is one in other words an event that must
occur is called a certain event if e is
an event then the probability of its
occurrence is given by P of e it is also
read as the probability of event
e in this screen let us look at some
common terms used in probability along
with an example the commonly used terms
in probability are sample space Bend
diagram and event sample space is the
collection of all possible outcomes for
a given experiment in the coin example
discussed earlier the sample space
consists of one instance each of heads
and tails if two coins are tossed the
sample space would be four in total a b
diagram shows all hypothe atically
possible logical relations between a
finite collection of sets an event is a
collection of outcomes for an experiment
which is any subset of the sample space
click the button to view an example of
probability what is the probability of
getting a three followed by two when a
dice is thrown
twice when the dice is thrown twice the
first throw can have any number from 1
to six similarly the second throw can
also have any number from 1 to six so
the total sample space is 6 * 6 that is
36 the event in this case is 3 followed
by two this can happen in only one way
so the probability in the question is 1
/
36 let us discuss the basic concepts of
probability in this screen some basic
concepts of probability are independent
event dependent event mutually exclusive
and mutually inclusive events click each
concept to know
more when the probability of occurrence
of an event does not affect the
probability of occurrence of another
event the two events are said to be
independent suppose you rolled a dice
and flipped a coin at the same time the
probability of getting any number on the
dice in no way influences the
probability of getting heads or tails on
the
coin when the probability of one event
occurring influences the likelihood of
the other event the events are said to
be
dependent events are said to be mutually
exclusive if the occurrence of any one
of them prevents the occurrence of all
the others in other words only one event
can occur at a time consider an example
of flipping a coin when you flip a coin
you will either get heads or tails but
not both you can add the probabilities
of these two events to prove they are
mutually
exclusive any two events wherein one
event cannot occur without the other are
said to be mutually inclusive
events in this screen let us learn about
the multiplication rules also known as
and rules the multiplication rules or
and rules depend on the event
dependency for independent events that
is if two events are independent of each
other the special multiplication rule
applies for mutually independent events
the special multiplication rule is as
follows if the events a b c and so on
are independent of each other then the
probability of A and B and C and so on
is equal to the product of their
individual
probabilities click the button to view
an example of this
rule Suppose there are three events
which are independent of each other such
as the event of flipping a coin and
getting heads drawing a card and getting
an Ace and throwing a dice and getting a
one what is the probability of
occurrence of all these events the
answer is the probability of A and B and
C is equal to the product of their
individual
probabilities which is half multiplied
13 multiplied 1 16 the result is
0.0064 which is
0.64% hence there is
0.64% probability of all of the events
occurring we will continue the
discussion on multiplication rules in
this screen the multiplication rule for
non-independent or conditional events
which is also the general multiplication
rule is as follows if a and b are two
events then the probability of A and B
is equal to the product of probability
of a and the probability of B given a
alternatively we can say that for any
two events their joint probability is
equal to the probability that one of
these events occurs multiplied with the
conditional probability of the other
event given the first event click the
button to view an example of this
rule a bag contains six golden coins and
four silver coins two coins are drawn
without replacement from the bag what is
the probability that both of the coins
are silver let a be the event that the
first coin is silver and B be the event
that the second coin is silver there are
10 coins in the bag four of which are
silver therefore P of a equals 4 / 10
after the first selection there are nine
coins in the bag three of which are
silver therefore P of B given a equal 3
/ 9 therefore based on the rule of
multiplication probability of a
intersection b equal 4 / 10 multiplied 3
/ 9 the answer is 12 / 90 which is
01334 hence there is 133% probability
that both the coins are
silver in this screen we will look at
the definitions and formula of
permutation and
combination permutation is the total
number of ways in which a set group or
number of things can be arranged the
order matters to a great extent in
permutation the manner in which the
objects or numbers are arranged will be
considered in
permutation the formula for permutation
is NPR Ral P of N and Ral n factorial /
nus R factorial where n is the number of
objects and R is the number of objects
taken at a time the unordered
arrangement of set group or number of
things is known as combination the order
does not matter in combination the
formula for combination is NCR equal C
of N and r = n factorial / R factorial
multiplied nus R factorial where n is
the number of objects and R is the
number of objects taken at a time let us
look at an example for calculating
permutation and combination in the
following
screen for from a group of 10 employees
a company has to select four for a
particular project in how many ways can
the selection happen given the following
conditions when the arrangements of
employees needs to be different when the
arrangement of employees need not be
different click the button to know the
answer in the given example the values
of N and R are 10 and four
respectively let us consider the first
condition from a group of 10 employees
four employees need to be selected the
arrangement needs to be different using
the permutation formula n p r = p of N
and r = n factorial / nus R
factorial 10 P4 = P of 10 and 4 = 10
factorial / 10 - 4 factorial equal
5,40 therefore the four employees can be
selected in 5,40 ways let us now
consider the second condition from a
group of 10 employees four employees
need to be selected the arrangement of
employees need not be different using
the combination formula
ncal C of N and r = n factorial divided
R factorial multiplied N - R
factorial 10 C4 = C of 10 and 4 = 10
factorial / 4 factorial ultied 10 - 4
factorial equals
210 therefore the four employees can be
selected from a group of 10 employees in
210 different
ways let us understand the two types of
Statistics in this screen statistics
refers to the science of collection
analysis interpretation and present
ation of data in Six Sigma statistical
methods and principles are used to
measure and analyze the process
performance and
improvements there are two major types
of Statistics descriptive statistics and
inferential
statistics descriptive statistics is
also known as enumerative statistics and
inferential statistics is also known as
analytical
statistics descriptive statistics
include organizing summarizing and
presenting the data in a meaningful way
whereas inferential statistics includes
making inferences and drawing
conclusions from the data descriptive
statistics describes what's going on in
the data the main objective of
inferential statistics is to make
inferences from the data to more General
conditions histograms pie charts box
plots frequency distributions and
measures of central tendency me mean
median and mode are all examples of
descriptive statistics on the other hand
examples of inferential statistics are
hypothesis testing scatter diagrams
Etc the main objective of statistical
inference is to draw conclusions on
population characteristics based on the
information available in the sample
collecting data from a population is not
always easy especially if the size of
the population is Big the easier way is
to collect a sample from the population
and from the sample statistic collected
make an assessment about the population
parameter click the button to see an
example of statistical
inference the management team of a
Cricut Council wants to know if the
team's performance has improved after
recruiting a new coach the management
conducts a test to prove this
statistically let us consider ya a and
YB where ya a stands for efficiency of
Coach a and YB stands for efficiency of
Coach B to conduct the test the basic
assumption is coach a and Coach B are
both effective this basic assumption is
known as null
hypothesis here let us assume the status
quo is null hypothesis hence null
hypothesis ho can be given by y AAL YB
the management team also challenges
their basic assumption by assuming the
coaches are not equally effective this
is their alternate
hypothesis the alternate hypothesis
states that the efficiencies of the two
coaches differ if the null hypothesis is
proven wrong the alternate hypothesis
must be right hence alternate hypothesis
H1 can be given ya a is not equal to YB
the these hypothesis statements are used
in a hypothesis test which will be
discussed in the later part of the
course in this screen we will learn
about the types of Errors when
collecting data from a population as a
sample and forming a conclusion on the
population based on the sample you run
into the risk of committing errors there
are two possible errors that can happen
type one error and type two error the
type one error occurs when the null
hypothesis is rejected when it is in
fact true type one error is also known
as producers risk the chance of
committing a type 1 error is known as
alpha alpha or significance level is the
chance of committing a type 1 error and
is typically chosen to be
5% this means the maximum amount of risk
you have for committing a type 1 error
is
5% let us consider the previous
example arriving at a conclusion that
Coach B is better than coach a when in
fact they are at the same level is a
type one error the risk you have of
committing this error is 5% which means
there is a 5% chance your experiment can
give wrong results the type two error
occurs when the null hypothesis is
accepted when it is in fact false also
when you reject the alternate hypothesis
when it is actually true you commit a
type 2 error type 2 error is also
referred to as consumer's risk in
comparing the two coaches the coaches
were actually different in their
efficiencies but the conclusion was that
they are the same the chance of
committing a type two error is known as
beta the maximum chance of committing a
type two error is
20% in the next screen we will learn
about Central limit theorem
Central limit theorem CLT states that
for a sample size greater than 30 the
sample mean is very close to the
population mean in simple words the
sample mean approaches the normal
distribution for example if you have
sample one and its mean is mean one
sample two and its mean is mean 2 and so
on take the means of mean one mean 2 Etc
and you will find that it is the same as
the population mean population mean is
the average of the sample means in such
cases the standard error of mean also
known as sem that represents the
variability between the sample means is
very less the semm is often used to
represent the standard deviation of the
sample the formula for sem is population
standard deviation divided by the square
root of the sample size selecting a
sample size also depends on the concept
called power also known as power of the
test we will cover this concept in
detail in the later part of the course
let us look at the graphical
representation of the central limit
theorem in the following
screen the plot of the three numbers 2 3
and four looks as shown in the graph it
is interesting to note that the total
number of times each digit is chosen is
six when the plot of the sample mean of
nine samples of size two each is drawn
it looks like the red line which is
plotted in the figure the x-axis shows
numbers of the mean which are two 2.5 3
and four on the Y AIS the frequency is
plotted the point at which arrows from
number two and three converge is the
mean of two and three similarly the
point at which arrows from two and four
converge is the mean of the numbers 2
and four let us discuss the concluding
points of the central limit theorem in
the next
screen the central limit theorem
concludes that the sampling
distributions are helpful in dealing
with non-normal data if you take the
sample data points from a population and
plot the distribution of the means of
the sample you get the sampling
distribution of the means the mean of
the sampling distribution also known as
the mean of means will be equal to the
population mean also the sampling
distribution approaches normality as the
sample size in
increases note that CLT enables you to
draw inferences from the sample
statistics about the population
parameters this is irrespective of the
distribution of the
population CLT also becomes the basis
for calculating confidence interval for
hypothesis tests as it allows the use of
a standard normal table let us proceed
to the next topic of this lesson in the
following screen in this topic we will
cover the the concept of statistical
distributions let us start with discrete
probability distribution in the
following screen discrete probability
distribution is characterized by the
probability Mass function it is
important to be familiar with discrete
distributions while dealing with
discrete data some of the examples of
discrete probability distribution are
binomial distribution po distribution
negative binomial distribution GE
ometric distribution and Hyper geometric
distribution we will focus only on the
two most useful discret distributions
binomial distribution and pant
distribution like most probability
distributions these distributions also
help in predicting the sample behavior
that has been observed in a population
let us learn about binomial distribution
in the following
screen binomial distri distribution is a
probability distribution for discrete
data named after the Swiss mathematician
Jacob bernui it is an application of
popular knowledge to predict the sample
Behavior binomial distribution also
describes the discrete data as a result
of a particular process like the tossing
of a coin for a fixed number of times
and the success or failure in an
interview a process is known as Bern's
process when the process output has only
two possible values like defective or
okay pass or fail and yes or no binomial
distribution is used to deal with
defective items defect is any
non-compliance with a specification
defective is a product or service with
at least one defect binomial
distribution is most suitable when the
sample size is less than 30 and less
than 10% of the population it is the
percentage of non-defective items
provided the probability of creating a
defective item Remains the Same over a
period let us look at the equation the
probability of exactly R successes out
of a sample size of n is denoted by P of
R which is equal to NCR whole multiplied
P to ^ of R and 1 - P whole to the^ of
nus R in the equation p is the
probability of success R is the number
of successes desired and N is the sample
size to continue discussing the binomial
distribution let us look at some of its
key calculations in the following
screen the mean of a binomial
distribution is denoted by mu and is
given by n multiplied by P the standard
deviation of a binomial distribution is
denoted by Sigma which is equal to n
multiplied P * 1 minus P the method of
calculating factorials say factorial of
five is the product of 5 4 3 2 and 1
which is equal to
120 similarly factorial of four is the
product of 4 3 2 and 1 which is equal to
24 let us look at an example of
calculating binom distribution in the
next
screen suppose you wish to know the
probability of getting heads five times
in eight coin tosses you can use the
binomial equation for the same click the
answer button to see how this is
done the tossing of a coin has only two
outcomes heads and tails it means that
the probability of each outcome is
0.5 and it remains fixed over a period
of time additionally the outcomes are
statistically
independent in this case the probability
of success denoted by P is 0.5 the
number of successes desired is denoted
by R which is five and the sample size
is denoted by n which is8 therefore the
probability of five heads is equal to
factorial of 8 CR which is 8 / factorial
of 5 and factorial of 8us 5 whole
multiplied by 0.5 to the power of 5
multiplied 1 - 0.5 to the^ of 8 - 5 this
calculation gives a result of
0.287 which is equal to
21.87% let us learn about Pon
distribution in this screen Pon
distribution is named after Simeon Deni
Pon and is also used for discrete data
Pon distribution is an application of
the population number knowledge to
predict the sample Behavior it is
generally used for describing the
probability distribution of an event
with respect to time or space some of
the characteristics of Pon distribution
are as follows Pon distribution
describes the discrete data resulting
from a process like the number of calls
received by a call center agent or the
number of accidents at a signal unlike
binomial distribution which deals with
binary discrete data Bon distrib ution
deals with integers which can take any
value Pon distribution is suitable for
analyzing situations wherein the number
of Trials similar to the sample size in
binomial distribution is large and tends
towards Infinity additionally it is used
in situations where the probability of
success in each trial is very small
almost tending toward zero this is the
reason why Pon distribution is
applicable for predicting the occurrence
of rare events events like plane crashes
car accidents Etc and is therefore
widely used in the insurance sector Pon
distribution can be used for predicting
the number of defects as well given a
low defect occurrence rate let us look
at the formula for calculating Pon
distribution in the next
screen the pon distribution for a
probability of exactly X occurrences is
given by P of x = 2 Lambda to the power
of X multiplied with log e to^ of minus
Lambda / factorial of X in this equation
Lambda is the mean number of occurrences
during the interval X is the number of
occurrences desired and E is the base of
natural logarithm which is equal to
2.71828 the mean of the pon distribution
is given by the Lambda and the standard
deviation of a Pon distribution is given
by Sigma which is the square root of
Lambda
let us look at an example to calculate
poon distribution in the next
screen the past records of a road
Junction which is accident prone show a
mean number of five accidents per week
at this Junction assume that the number
of accidents follows a Pon distribution
and calculate the probability of any
number of accidents happening in a week
click the button to know the
answer given the situation you know that
the value of Lambda or mean is five so P
of0 that is the probability of zero
accidents per week is calculated as 5 to
the power of 0 multiplied e to^ of -5
whole / factorial of 0 the answer is
0.006 applying the same formula the
probability of one accident per week is
0.03 the probability of more than two
accidents per week is 1 minus the sum of
probabilities of 0 1 and two accidents
which is
0.884 in other words the probability is
88.4% let us learn about normal
distribution in this screen the normal
or gaussian distribution is a continuous
probability distribution the normal
distribution is represented as n and
depends on two factors mu which stands
for mean and sigma which gives the
standard deviation of the data points
normal distribution normally has a
higher frequency of values around the
mean and lesser occurrences away from it
it is often used as a first
approximation to describe real valued
random variables that tend to Cluster
around a single mean value the
distribution is bell-shaped and
symmetrical the total area under the
normal curve is one which is p of X
various types of data such as as body
weight height the output of a
manufacturing device Etc follow the
normal distribution additionally normal
distribution is continuous and
symmetrical with the tails asymptotic to
the x-axis which means they touch the
xaxis at Infinity let us continue to
discuss normal distribution in the
following
screen in a normal distribution to
standardize comparisons of dispersion or
the different measurement units like
inches meters G Etc
a standard Z variable is used the uses
of Z value are as follows while the
value of Z or the number of standard
deviations is unique for each
probability within the normal
distribution it helps in finding
probabilities of data points anywhere
within the distribution it is
dimensionless as well that is it has no
units such as millimeters liters colums
Etc there are different formulas to
arrive at the normal distribution we
will focus on one commonly used formula
for calculating normal distribution
which is zal Yus mu whole / Sigma here Z
is the number of standard deviations
between Y and the mean denoted by Miu
why is the value of the data point in
concern Miu is mean of the population or
data points and sigma is the standard
deviation of the population or data
points let us look at an example for
calculating normal distribution in the
following
screen suppose the time taken to resolve
customer problems follows a normal
distribution with a mean of 250 hours
and standard deviation of 23 hours find
the probability of a problem resolution
taking more than 300 hours click the
button to know the
answer in this case Y is equal to 300
muu = 250 and sigma = 23 applying the
normal distribution formula Z is equal
to 300 - 250 whole divid 23 the result
is
2.17 when you look at the normal
distribution table the Z value of 2.17
covers an area of
0.984 N9 under itself this means the
probability of a problem taking 0 to 300
hours to be resolved is 98.5 5% and
therefore the chances of a problem
resolution taking more than 300 hours is
1.5% let us understand the usage of
ztable in this screen the graphical
representation of ztable usage is given
here the probability of areas under the
curve is one for the actual value one
can identify the zcore by using the Z
table as shown this probability is the
area under the curve to the left of
point plus a to zero using the actual
data when you calculate mean and
standard deviation and the values are 25
and five respectively it is the normal
distribution if the same data is
standardized to a mean value of zero and
standard deviation value of one it is
the standard normal
distribution in the next screen we will
take a look at the Z
table the Z table gives the probability
that Z is between zero and a positive
number there are different forms of
normal distribution Z tabls followed
globally the most common form of ztable
with positive Z scores is shown here the
value of a called the percentage point
is given along the borders of the table
in bold and is to two decimal places the
values in the main table are the
probabilities that Z is between 0 and
plus a note that the values running down
the table are to one decimal place the
numbers along the column change only for
the second decimal place let us look at
some examples on how to use a z table in
the following
screen let us find the value of P of Z
less than Z the table is not needed to
find the answer once we know that the
variable Z takes a value less than or
equal
to0 first the area under the curve is
one and second the curve is symmetrical
about Z equal 0 hence there is 0.5 or
50% above chance of Z equals 0 and 0.5
or 50% below chance of Z equals
z let us find the value of P of Z
greater than
1.12 in this case the chance of Z is
greater than a number in this case
1.12 you can find this by using the
following fact the opposite or compl of
an event of a is the event of not a that
is the opposite or complement of event a
occurring is the event a not occurring
its probability is given by P of not
equal a = 1 minus P of a in other words
P of Z greater than 1.12 is 1 minus the
opposite which is p P of Z lesser than
1.12 using the table P of Z less than
1.12 equal 0.5 + P of 0 less than Z less
than 1.12 = 0.5 + 0
3686 which is
0.868 hence the answer is p of Z greater
than 1.12 = 1 -
0.868 which is 0
1314 note the answer is less than
0.5 let us find the value of P of Z lies
between 0 and
1.12 in this case where Z Falls within
an interval the probability can be read
straight off the table P of Z lies
between 0 and 1.12 equal 0.36 86 we will
learn about Kai Square distribution in
this screen Kai Square distribution is
also known as Kai squar or Kai squar
distribution Kai squar with K -1° of
freedom is the distribution of a sum of
the squares of K independent standard
normal random
variables the kai Square distribution is
one of the most widely used probability
distributions in inferential statistics
it is also known as hypothesis testing
and the distribution is used in
hypothesis tests
when used in hypothesis tests it only
needs one sample for the test to be
conducted conventionally degree of
freedom is K minus one where K is the
sample size for example if WX y and z
are four random variables with standard
normal distributions then the random
variable F which is the sum of w² x² Y
sare and Z square has a Ki Square
distribution
the degrees of the freedom of the
distribution DF equals the number of
normally distributed variables used in
this case DF is equal to 4 let us look
at the formula to calculate Ki Square
distribution in the following
screen Kai Square calculated or Sigma or
the kai Square index equals F of O minus
F of e squ / f of e here F of o stands
for an observed frequency and F of e
stands for an expected frequency
determined through a contingency table
let us understand T distribution in the
next screen the T distribution method is
the most appropriate method to be used
in the following situations when you
have a sample size of less than 30 when
the population standard deviation is not
known when the population is
approximately normal unlike the normal
distribution a t distribution is lower
at the mean and higher at the Tails as
seen in the image T distribution is used
for hypothesis testing also as seen in
the image the T distribution is
symmetrical in shape but flatter than
the normal
distribution as the sample size
increases the T distribution approaches
normality for every possible sample size
or degrees of freedom there is is a
different T
distribution let us learn about F
distribution in the following
screen the F distribution is a ratio of
two Ki Square distributions a specific F
distribution is denoted by the ratio of
the degrees of freedom for the numerator
Kai square and the degrees of freedom
for the denominator Kai Square the F
test is performed to calculate and
observe if the standard deviations or
variances of two processes are
significantly different the project
teams are usually concerned about
reducing the process variance as per the
formula f calculated equal S1 s / by S2
Square where S1 and S2 are the standard
deviations of the two samples if the F
calculated is one it implies there is no
difference in the variance if if S1 is
greater than S2 then the numerator must
be greater than the denominator in other
words df1 = N1 -1 and df2 = N2
-1 from the F distribution table you can
easily find out the critical F
distribution at Alpha and the degrees of
freedom of the samples of two different
processes df1 and
df2 let us proceed to the next topic of
this lesson in the following
screen in this topic we will discuss
collecting and summarizing data in
detail let us learn about types of data
in the following
screen data is objective information
which everyone can agree on it is a
collection of facts from which
conclusions may be drawn the two types
of data are attribute data and variable
data click each type to know more
discrete data is data that can be
counted and only includes numbers such
as 2 40 or
1,50 attribute data is commonly called
pass fail or good bad data attribute or
discrete data cannot be broken down into
a smaller unit meaningfully it answers
questions such as how many how often or
what type some examples of attribute
data are number of defective products
percentage of defective products
frequency at which a machine is repaired
or the type of award
received any data that can be measured
on a continuous scale is continuous or
variable data this type of data answers
questions such as how long what volume
or how far examples of continuous data
include height weight time taken to
complete a task temperature and so
on let us understand the importance of
selecting the data type in this screen
deciding the data type facilitates
analysis and
interpretation therefore the first step
in the measure phase is to determine
what type of data should be collected
this can be done by considering the
following the first consideration is to
identify what is already known for this
the values already identified for the
process are listed these include
critical to Quality parameters or
ctqs key process output variables or
KPS and the key process input variable
or
KPS next to understand how to proceed
with the data gathered it is necessary
to determine the data type that fits the
metrics for the key variables
identified the question now arises why
should the data type be
identified this is important as it
enables the right set of data to be
collected analyzed and used to draw
inferences it is not advisable to
convert one type of data into another
converting attribute data to variable
data is difficult and requires
assumptions to be made about the process
it may also require additional data
Gathering including retesting units let
us look at measurement scales in the
following
screen there are four measurement scales
arranged in the table in increasing
order of their statistical
desirability in the nominal scale the
data consists of only names or
categories and there is no possibility
of ordering an example of this type of
measurement can be a bag of colored
balls which contains 10 green balls five
black balls eight yellow balls and nine
white balls this is the least
informative of all scales the most
appropriate measure of central tendency
for this scale is mode in the ordinal or
ranking scale data is arranged in order
and values can be compared with each
other an example of this scale can be
the ratings given to different
restaurants three for a five for B two
for C and four for D the central
tendency for this scale is median or
mode the interval scale is used for
ranking items in Step order along a
scale of equidistant points for example
the temperatures of three metal rods are
100° 200° and 600° F respectively note
that 3 * 200° is not the same as 600° as
a temperature measurement the central
tendency here is mean median or mode
mean is used if the the data does not
have any
outliers the ratio scale represents
variable data and is measured against a
known standard or increment however this
scale also has an absolute zero that is
no numbers exist below zero an example
of the ratio scale are physical measures
where height weight and electric charge
represent ratio scale data Note that
negative length is not possible again
here you would use use mean median or
mode as the central tendency measure in
the next screen we will learn about
assuring data
accuracy to ensure data is accurate
sampling techniques are used sampling is
the process act or technique of
selecting an appropriate test group or
sample from a larger population it is
preferable to survey 100 people to
surveying 10,000 people sampling saves
the time money and effort involved in
collecting data the three types of
sampling techniques described here are
random sampling sequential sampling and
stratified sampling click each type to
know
more random sampling is the technique
where a group of subjects or a sample
for study is selected from a larger
group or population at
random sequential sampling is similar to
multiple sampling plans except that it
can in theory continue indefinitely in
other words it is a nonprobability
sampling technique wherein the
researcher picks a single subject or a
group of subjects in a given time
interval conducts the study analyzes the
results and then picks another group of
subjects if needed and so
on in stratified sampling the idea is to
take samples from subgroups of a
population this technique gives an
accurate estimate of the population
parameter in this screen we will compare
simple random sampling with stratified
sampling simple random sampling is easy
to do while stratified sampling takes a
lot of time the possibility of simple
random sampling giving erroneous results
is very high while stratified sampling
minimizes the chances of error simple
random sampling doesn't have the power
to show possible causes of variation
while stratified sampling if done
correctly will show assignable causes in
the next screen we will look at the
checksheet method of collecting data the
process of collecting data is expensive
wrongly collected data leading to wrong
analysis and inferences results in
resources being wasted a check sheet is
a structured form prepared to collect
and analy analyz data it is a generic
tool that is relatively simple to use
and can be adopted for a variety of
purposes check sheets are used when the
data can be observed and collected
repeatedly by the same person or at the
same location they are also used while
collecting data from a production
process a common example is calculating
the number of absentees in a company the
table shows absentee data collected for
a week
we will discuss data coding and its
advantages in the following
screen data coding is a process of
converting and condensing raw data into
categories and sets so that the data can
be used for further analysis the
benefits of data coding are listed here
data coding simplifies the large
quantity of data that is collected from
sources the large amount of data makes
analysis and drawing conclusions
difficult it leads to chaos and
ambiguity data coding simplifies the
data by coding it into variables and
then categorizing these
variables raw data cannot be easily
entered into computers for analysis data
coding is used to convert raw data into
process data that can be easily fed into
Computing systems for calculation and
Analysis coding of data makes it easy to
analyze the data converted data can
either be analyzed directly or fed into
computers the analyst can easily draw
conclusions when all the data is
categorized and
computerized data coding also enables
organized representation of data
division of data into categories helps
organize large chunks of information
thus making analysis and interpretation
easier data coding also ensures that
data repetition does not occur and
duplicate entries are eliminated so that
the final result is not affected in the
following screen we will discuss
measures of central tendency of the
descriptive statistics in
detail a measure of central tendency is
a single value that indicates the
central point in a set of data and helps
in identifying data Trends the three
most commonly used measures of the
central tendency are mean median and
mode click each measure to know
more mean is the most common measure of
central tendency it is the sum of all
the data values divided by the number of
data points also called arithmetic mean
or average it is the most widely used
measure of central
tendency also known as positional mean
median is the number present in the
middle of the data set when the numbers
are arranged in ascending or descending
order order if the data set has an even
number of entries then the median is the
mean of the two middle numbers median
can also be calculated by the formula n
+ 1 / 2 where n is the number of
entries mode also known as frequency
mean is the value that occurs most
frequently in a set of data data sets
that have more than one mode are known
as bodal data
let us look at an example for
determining mean median and mode in this
screen the data set has the numbers 1 2
3 4 5 five 6 7 and 8 click the button to
know the
answer as previously defined mean is the
sum of all the data items divided by the
number of items therefore the mean is
equal to 41 / 9 which is equal to
4.56 the number in the middle of the
data set is five therefore the median is
five mode is the most frequently
occurring number which is again five in
this screen we will understand the
effect of outliers on the data set let
us consider a minor change to the data
set a new number 100 is added to the
data set on using the same formula to
calculate mean the new mean is
15.11 ideally 50% of values should lie
on either side of the mean value however
in this example it can be seen that
almost 90% of values lie below the mean
value of
15.11 and only one value above the mean
the data point 100 is called an outlier
an outlier is an extreme value in the
data set that skews the mean value to
one side of the data set note that the
median remains unchanged at five
therefore mean is not an appropriate
measure of central tendency if the data
has outliers median is preferred in this
case in the next screen we will look at
measures of dispersion of the
descriptive
statistics apart from central tendency
another important parameter to describe
a data set is spread or dispersion
contrary to the measures of central
tendency such as mean median and mode
measures of dispersion Express the
spread of values higher the variation of
data points higher the spread of the
data the three main measures of
dispersion are range variance and
standard deviation we will discuss each
of these in the upcoming screens let us
start with the first measure of
dispersion range the range change of a
particular set of data is defined as the
difference between the largest and
smallest values of the data in the
example the largest value of the data is
nine and the smallest value is one
therefore the range is 9 -1 8 in
calculating range all the data points
are not needed and only the maximum and
minimum values are required let us
understand the next measure of
dispersion variance in the following
screen the variance denoted as Sigma
square or S square is defined as the
average of squared mean differences and
shows the variation in a data set to
calculate the variance for a sample data
set of 10 numbers type the numbers in an
Excel sheet calculate the variance using
the formula equals VP or
vs the VP formula gives the population
variance which is 7.24 for this example
the vs formula gives the sample variance
8.04 population variance is calculated
when the data set is for the entire
population and Sample variance is
calculated when data is available only
for a sample of the
population population variance is
preferred over sample variance as as the
latter is only an estimate sample
variance allows for a broader range of
possible answers for the true mean of
the population that is the confidence
levels are higher in Sample variance
note that variance is a measure of
variation and cannot be considered as
the variation in a data set in the
following screen we will understand the
next measure of dispersion standard
deviation standard deviation denoted by
Sigma or S is given by the square root
of variance the statistical notation of
this is given on screen standard
deviation is the most important measure
of dispersion standard deviation is
always relative to the mean for the same
data set the population standard
deviation is
2.69 and Sample standard deviation is
2.83 as in variance calculation if the
data set is measured for every unit in a
population the population standard
deviation and Sample standard deviation
can be calculated in Excel using the
formula given on the
screen the steps to manually calculate
the standard deviation are first
calculate the mean then calculate the
difference between each data point and
the mean and square that answer next
calculate the sum of the squares
next divide the sum of the squares by n
or n minus one to find the variance
lastly find the square root of variance
which gives the standard
deviation in the next screen we will
look at frequency distribution of the
descriptive statistics frequency
distribution is a method of grouping
data into mutually exclusive categories
showing the number of observations in
each class an example is presented to
demonstrate frequency
distribution a survey was conducted
among the residents of a particular area
to collect data on cars owned by each
home a total of 20 homes were surveyed
to create a frequency table for the
results collected in the survey the
first step is to divide the results into
intervals and count the number of
results in each interval for instance in
this example the intervals would be the
number of households with no car one car
two cars and so on next a table is
created with separate columns for the
intervals the tallied results for each
interval and the number of occurrences
or frequency of results in each
interval each result for a given
interval is recorded with a tally mark
in the second column the tally marks for
each interval are added and the sum is
entered in the frequency column the
frequency table allows viewing
distribution of data across a set of
values at a glance in the following
screen we will look at cumulative
frequency
distribution a cumulative frequency
distribution table is similar to the
frequency distribution table only more
detailed there are additional columns
for cumulative frequency percentage and
cumulative percentage in the cumulative
frequency column the cumulative
frequency or the previous row or rows is
added to the current Row the percentage
is calculated by dividing the frequency
by the total number of results and
multiplying by 100 the cumulative
percentage is calculated similar to the
cumulative
frequency let us look at an example for
cumulative frequency
distribution the ages of all the
participants in a chess tournament are
recorded the lowest age is 37 and the
highest is 91
keeping intervals of 10 the lowest
interval starts with the lower limit as
35 and the upper limit as
44 similar intervals are created until
an upper limit of
94 in the frequency column the number of
times a result appears in a particular
interval is recorded in the cumulative
frequency column the cumulative
frequency of the previous row is added
to the frequency of the current Row for
the first first row the cumulative
frequency is the same as the frequency
in the second row the cumulative
frequency is 1 + two which is three and
so on in the percentage column the
percentage of the frequency is listed by
dividing the frequency by the total
number of results which is 10 and
multiplying the value by 100 for
instance in the first row the frequency
is one and the number of results is 10
therefore the percentage is 10 the final
column is the cumulative percentage
column in this column the cumulative
frequency is divided by the total number
of results which is 10 and the value is
multiplied by 100 note that the last
number in this column should be equal to
100 in this example the cumulative
frequency is one and the total number of
results is 10 therefore the cumulative
percentage of the first row is 10 let
let us look at the stem and leaf plots
which is one of the graphical methods of
understanding
distribution graphical methods are
extremely useful tools to understand how
data is
distributed sometimes merely by looking
at the data distribution errors in a
process can be identified the stem and
leaf method is a convenient method of
manually plotting data sets it is used
for presenting data in a graphical
format to assist visualizing the shape
of a given
distribution in the example on the
screen the temperatures in Fahrenheit
for the month of May are given to
collate this information in a stem and
leaf plot all the 10 digits are entered
in the stem column and all the units
digits against each 10's digit are
entered in the leaf column to start with
the lowest value is considered in this
case the lowest temperature is 51 in the
first row five is entered in the stem
column and Z in the leaf column the next
lowest temperature is
588 is entered in the leaf column
corresponding to five in the stem the
next number is 59 all the temperatures
falling in the 50s are similarly entered
in the next row the same process is
repeated for temperatures in the 60s
this is continued till all the
temperature values are entered in the
table let us understand another
graphical method in the next screen box
and whisker
plots a box and whisker graph based on
medians or cor tiles is used to display
a data set in a way that allows viewing
the distribution of the data points
easily consider the following example
the lengths of 13 fish caught in a lake
were measured and recorded the data set
is given on the screen the first step to
draw a box and whisker plot is therefore
to arrange the numbers in increasing
order next find the median as there is
an odd number of data entries the median
is the number in the middle of the data
set which in this case is 12 the next
step is to find the lower median or
quartile this is the median of the lower
six numbers the middle of these numbers
is halfway between 8 and N which would
be
8.5 similarly the upper median or
cortile is located for the upper six
numbers to the right of the median the
upper median is halfway between the two
values 14 and 14 therefore the upper
median is
14 let us now understand how the box and
whisker chart is drawn using the values
of the median and upper and lower
quartiles the next step is a numbered
line is drawn extending far enough to
include all the data points then a
vertical line is drawn from the median
Point 12 the lower and upper coord tiles
8.5 and 14 respectively are marked with
vertical lines and these are joined with
the median line to form two boxes as
shown on the screen next two whiskers
are extended from either ends of the
boxes as shown to the smallest and
largest numbers in the data set five and
20 respectively the box and whiskers
graph is now complete the following
inferences can be drawn from the box and
whisker plot the lengths of the fish
range from 5 to 20 the range is
therefore 15 the quartiles split the
data into four equal parts in other
words one qu of the data numbers is less
than
8.5 one quarter between 8.5 and 12 next
quarter of the data numbers are between
12 and 14 and another quarter has data
numbers greater than
14 in this screen we will learn about
another graphical method scatter
diagrams a scatter diagram or scatter
plot is a tool used to analyze the
relationship or correlation between two
sets of variables X and Y with X as the
independent variable and Y as the
dependent variable a scatter diagram is
also useful when cause effect
relationships have to be examined or
root causes have to be
identified there are five different
types of correlation that can be used in
a scatter diagram let us learn about
them in the next
screen the five types of correlation are
perfect positive correlation moderate
positive correlation no relation or no
correlation moderate negative
correlation and perfect negative
correlation click each type to learn
more in perfect positive correlation the
value of dependent variable y increases
propor proportionally with any increase
in the value of independent variable X
this is said to be 1 is to one that is
any change in one variable results in an
equal amount of change in the other the
following example is presented to
demonstrate perfect positive
correlation the consumption of milk is
found to increase proportionally with an
increase in the consumption of coffee
the data is presented in the table on
the screen the SC diagram for the data
is also shown it can be observed from
the graph that as X increases y also
increases proportionally hence the
points are
linear in this type of correlation as
the value of the X variable increases
the value of y also increases but not in
the same proportion to demonstrate this
the following example is presented the
increase in savings for increase in
salary is shown in the table as you can
notice in the scattered diagram the
points are not linear although the value
of y increases with increase in the
value of x the increase is not
proportional when a change in one
variable has no impact on the other
there is no relation or correlation
between them let us consider the
following example to study the relation
between the number of fresh graduates in
the city and the job openings available
data for both was collected over a few
months and tabulated as shown the
scatter diagram for the same is also
displayed it can be observed that the
data points are scattered and there is
no Trend emerging from the graph
therefore there is no correlation
between the number of fresh graduates
and the number of job openings in the
city
in moderate negative correlation an
increase in one variable results in a
decrease in the other variable however
this change is not proportional to the
change in the first variable to
demonstrate modern negative correlation
the prices of different products are
listed along with the number of units
sold for each product the data is shown
in the table from the scatter diagram
shown it can be observed that higher the
price of a product lesser are the number
of units of that product sold however
the decrease in the number of units with
increasing price is not
proportional in perfect negative
correlation an increase in one variable
results in a proportional decrease of
the other variable this is also an
example of one is to one
correlation as an example the effect of
an increase in the project time
extension on the success of project is
considered the data is shown in the
table the scattered diagram for the data
shows a proportional decrease in the
probability of the project success with
each extension of the project time hence
the points are linear perfect
correlations are rare in the real world
when encountered they should be
investigated and
verified in this screen we will look at
another graphical method
histograms histograms are similar to bar
graphs except that the data in
histograms is grouped into intervals
they are used to represent category-wise
data graphically a histogram is best
suited for continuous data the following
example illustrates how a histogram is
used to represent data data on the
number of hours spent by a group of 15
people on a special project in one week
is collected the this data is then
divided into intervals of two and the
frequency table for the data is created
the histogram for the same data is also
displayed looking at the histogram it
can be observed at a glance that most of
the team members spent between 2 to four
hours on the project in the following
screen we will look at the next
graphical method normal probability
plots normal probability plots are used
to identify if a sample has been taken
from a normal distributed population
when sample data from a normal
distributed population is represented as
a normal probability plot it forms a
straight line the following example is
presented to illustrate normal
probability plots a sampling of
diameters from a drilling operation is
done and the data is recorded the data
set is given to create a normal
probability plot the first first step is
to construct a cumulative frequency
distribution table this is followed by
calculating the mean rank probability by
dividing the cumulative frequency by the
number of samples plus one and
multiplying the answer by 100 the fully
populated table for mean rank
probability estimation is shown on the
screen please take a look at the same in
The Next Step a graph is plotted on log
paper or with mini tab using this data
mini tab is a statistical software used
in Six Sigma mini tab normal probability
plot instructions are also given on the
screen the completed graph is shown on
the screen from the graph it can be seen
that the random sample forms a straight
line and therefore the data is taken
from a normally distributed
population let us proceed to the next
topic of this lesson in this topic we
will discuss measurement system analysis
or MSA in detail let us understand what
MSA is in the following screen
throughout the dmac process the output
of the measurement system Ms is used for
metrics analysis and control efforts an
error prone measurement system will only
lead to incorrect data incorrect data
leads to incorrect conclusions it is
important to set right the MS before
collecting the data measurement system
analysis or MSA is a technique that
identifies measur error or variation and
sources of that error in order to reduce
the variation it evaluates the measuring
system to ensure the Integrity of data
used for
analysis MSA is therefore one of the
first activities in the measure phase
the measurement system's capability is
calculated analyzed and interpreted
using gauge repeatability and
reproducibility to determine measurement
correlation bias linearity percent
agreement and precision or tolerance let
us discuss the objectives of MSA in the
next
screen a primary objective of MSA is to
obtain information about the type of
measurement variation associated with
the measurement system it is also used
to establish criteria to accept and
release new measuring equipment MSA also
Compares measuring one method against
another it helps to form a basis for
evaluating a method which is suspected
of being deficient the measurement
system variations should be resolved to
arrive at the correct baselines for the
project objectives as baselines contain
crucial data based on which decisions
are taken it is extremely important that
the measurement system be free of error
as far as possible let us look at
measurement analysis in detail in the
next
screen in measurement an analysis The
observed value is equal to the sum of
the true value and the measurement error
the measurement error can be a negative
or a positive value measurement error
refers to the net effect of all sources
of measurement variability that cause an
observed value to deviate from the True
Value true variability is the sum of the
process variability and the measurement
variability process variability and
measurement variability must be
evaluated and improved together
measurement variability should be
addressed before looking at process
variability if process variability is
corrected before resolving measurement
variability then any improvements to the
process cannot be trusted to have taken
place owing to a faulty measurement
system in the following screen we will
identify the types of measurement
errors the two types of measurement
errors are measurement system bias and
measurement system variation click each
type to know more measurement system
bias involves calibration study in the
calibration study the total mean is
given by the sum of the process mean and
the measurement mean the statistical
notation is shown on the
screen measurement system variation
involves gauge repeatability and
reproducibility or grr study in the RR
study the total variance is calculated
by adding the process variance with the
measurement variation the statistical
notation is shown on the
screen in this screen we will discuss
the sources of variation the chart on
the screen list the different sources of
variation observe process variation is
divided into two actual process
variation and measurement
variation actual process variation can
be divided into long-term and short-term
process variations in a gauge RR study
process variation is often called part
variation measurement variation can be
divided into variations caused by
operators and variations due to the
gauge the variation due to operators is
owing to
reproducibility variation due to gauge
is owing to
repeatability both actual process
variation and measurement variation have
a common factor that is variation within
a sample let us understand gauge
repeatability and reproducibility or grr
in the next screen gauge repeatability
and reproducibility or grr is a
statistical technique to assess if a
gauge or gauging system will obtain the
same reading each time a particular
characteristic or parameter is measured
gauge repeatability is the variation in
measurement when One op operator uses
the same gauge to measure identical
characteristics of the same part
repeatedly gauge reproducibility is the
variation in the average of measurements
when different operators use the same
gauge to measure identical
characteristics of the same part the
figures on the screen illustrate gauge
repeatability and
reproducibility in the next screen we
will discuss the components of grr
study the figure on the screen
illustrates the difference between gauge
repeatability and
reproducibility the figure shows the
repeatability and reproducibility for
six different parts represented by the
numbers 1 to six for two different trial
readings by three different operators as
can be observed a difference in reading
for part one indicated by the color
grein by three different operators is
known as reproducibility error a
difference in reading of part four in
indicated by Red by the same operator in
two different trials is known as the
repeatability error in the following
screen we will look at some guidelines
for gauge repeatability and
reproducibility
studies the following should be kept in
mind while carrying out gauge
repeatability and reproducibility or grr
studies grr studies should be performed
over the range of expected
observations care should be taken to use
actual equipment for grr studies written
procedures and approved practices should
be followed as would have been in actual
operations the measurement variability
should be represented as is not the way
it was designed to be after grr the
measurement variability is separated
into casual components sorted according
to priority and then targeted for action
in the following screen let us look at
some more Concepts associated with
grr bias is the distance between the
sample mean value and the sample True
Value it is also called accuracy bias is
equal to mean minus reference value
process variation is equal to six times
the standard deviation the bias
percentage is calculated as bias divided
by the process variation the next term
is linearity linearity refers to the
consistency of bias over the range of
the gauge linearity is given by the
product of slope and process
variation Precision is the degree of
repeatability or closeness of data
smaller the dispersion in the data set
better the Precision the variation in
the gauge is the sum of variation due to
repeatability and the variation due to
reproducibility in the following screen
we will understand measurement
resolution measurement resolu solution
is the smallest detectable increment
that an instrument will measure or
display the number of increments in the
measurement system should extend over
the full range for a given parameter
some examples of wrong gauges or
incorrect measurement resolution are
given here a truck weighing scale is
used for measuring the weight of a tack
a caliper capable of measuring
differences of 0.1 mm is used to show
compliance when the tolerance limits are
plus orus 0.07 mm thus the measurement
system that matches the range of the
data should only be used an important
prerequisite for grr studies is that the
gauge has an acceptable resolution in
the next screen we will look at examples
for repeatability and
reproducibility repeatability is also
called equipment variation or EV it
occurs when the same technician or
operator repeatedly measures the same
part or process under identical
conditions with the same measurement
system the following example illustrates
this concept a 36 km perh Pace mechanism
is timed by a single operator over a
distance of 100 m on a stopwatch and
three readings are taken trial 1 takes 9
seconds trial two takes 10 seconds and
trial three takes 11 seconds the process
is measured with the same equipment in
identical conditions by the same
operator assuming no operator error the
variation in the three readings is known
as repeatability or equipment
variation reproducibility is also called
appraiser variation or AV it occurs when
different technicians or operators
measure the same part or process under
identical conditions using the same
measurement system let us extend the the
example for repeatability to include
data measured by two operators the
readings are displayed on the slide the
difference in the readings of both
operators is called reproducibility or
appraiser variation it is important to
resolve equipment variation before
appraiser variation if appraiser
variation is resolved first the results
will still not be identical due to
variation in the equipment
itself in this screen we will learn
about data collection in grr there are
some important considerations for data
collection in grr studies there are
usually three operators and around 10
units to measure General sampling
techniques must be used to represent the
population and each unit must be
measured two to three times by each
operator it is important that the gauge
be calibrated accurately it should also
be ensured that the gauge has an
acceptable resolution another practice
is that the first operator measures all
the units in random order then this
order is maintained by all other
operators all the trials must be
repeated in the next screen we will
discuss the Anova method of analyzing
grr
studies the Anova method is considered
to be the best method for analyzing grr
studies this is because of two reasons
the first being Anova not only separates
equipment and off operator variation but
also provides Insight on the combined
effect of the two second an NOA uses
standard deviation instead of range as a
measure of variation and therefore gives
a better estimate of the measurement
system variation the one drawback of
using an NOA is the considerations of
time resources and cost in the next
screen we will understand how MSA can be
interpreted two results are possible for
an MS a in the first case the
reproducibility error is larger than the
repeatability error this occurs when the
operators are not trained and
calibrations on the gauge dial are not
clear the other possibility is that the
repeatability error is larger than the
reproducibility error this is clearly a
maintenance issue and can be resolved by
calibrating the equipment or performing
maintenance on the equipment this
indicates that the gauge needs
redesigned to be more rigid and the
location needs to be improved it also
occurs when there is ambiguity in
Sops MSA is an experiment which seeks to
identify the components of variation in
the measurement in the following screen
we will look at a template used for grr
studies a sample gauge RR sheet is given
on this screen The Operators here are
Andrew Murphy and Lucy Wang who are the
appraisers in this study they have
measured and rated the performance of
three employees Ibraham glasso Brianna
Scott and Jason Schmidt this is a sample
template for a gug RNR study the parts
are shown across the top of the sheet in
this case the measurement system is
being evaluated using three parts the
employees Abraham glasso Brianna Scott
and Jason Schmidt The Operators measure
each part repeatedly from this data the
average X and ranges R for each
inspector and for each part are
calculated the grand average for each
inspector and each part is also
calculated in this example a control
limit UCL in the sheet was compared with
the difference in averages of the two
inspectors to identify if there is a
significant difference in their
measurements their difference is
0.111 which is outside the UCL of
0.108 given the r average of
0.042 in the next screen we will look at
the results page for this grr
study the sheet on the screen displays
the results for the data entered in the
template in the previous screen please
spend some time to go through the data
for a better understanding of the
concept in the following screen we will
look at the interpretation to this
results
page the percentage grr value is
highlighted in the center right of the
table in the previous screen there are
three important observations to be made
here about the gaug RR study first this
study also shows the interaction between
operators and parts If the percentage
grr value is less than 30 then the gauge
is acceptable and the measurement system
does not require any change
if the value is greater than 30 then the
gauge needs correction the equipment
variation is checked and resolved first
followed by the appraiser variation
second if EV equals zero it means the MS
is reliable the equipment is perfect and
the variation in the gauge is
contributed by different
operators if the AV is equal to zero the
MS is precise third if EV is equal to Z
and there is Av The Operators have to be
trained to ensure all operators follow
identical steps during measurement and
the AV is minimal the interaction
between operators and parts can also be
studied under grr using part variation
the tress and precision cannot be
determined in a grr if only one gauge or
measurement method is evaluated as it
may have an inherent bias that would go
undetected merely by by varying
operators and parts let us proceed to
the next topic of this lesson in the
following screen in this topic we will
discuss process and performance
capability in detail in the following
screen we will look at the differences
between natural process limits and
specification limits natural process
limits or control limits are derived
from the process data and are the voice
of the process the data cons consists of
real-time values from past process
performance therefore these values
represent the actual process limits and
indicate variation in the process the
two control limits are upper control
limit UCL and lower control limit
LCL specification limits are provided by
customers based on their requirements or
the voice of the customer and cannot be
changed by the
organization these limits act as targets
for the organization and processes are
designed around the requirements the
product or service has to meet customer
requirements and has to be well within
the specification limits If the product
or service does not meet customer
requirements it is considered as a
defect therefore specification limits
are the intended results or requirements
from the product or service that are
defined by the customer the two
specification limits are upper
specification limit or USL and lower
specification limit or
LSL the difference between the two is
called
tolerance an important point to note is
that for a process if the control limits
lie within the specification limits the
process is said to be under control
conversely if specification limits lie
within the control limits the process
will not meet customer
requirements in the following screen we
will look at process performance metrics
and how they are
calculated the two major metrics used to
measure process performance are defects
per unit or dpu and defects per million
opportunities or
dpmo dpu is calculated by dividing the
number of defects by the total number of
units dpmo is calculated by multiplying
the defects per opportunity with 1
million in the following screen we will
look at an example for calculating
process
performance in this example the quality
control Department checks the quality of
finished goods by sampling a batch of 10
items from the produced lot every hour
the data is collected over 24 hours the
table displays the data for the number
of defectives for the sampling period if
items are consistently found to be out
inside the control limits on any given
day the production process is stopped
for the next day let us now interpret
the results of the sampling in this
example as the sample size is constant
dpu or P bar is used to calculate the
process capability the total number of
defectives is 34 and the subgroup size
is 10 the total number of units is 10
multiplied by 24 which is 240 the
defects per unit is
0.0124 the defects per million
opportunities is obtained by multiplying
the defects per unit with 1 million
which is
141,000 Sigma or
86.4%
yield we will learn about process
stability studies in this screen the
activities carried out in the measure
phase are MSA collection of data
statistical calculations and checking
for accuracy and validity this is
followed by a test for stability as
changes cannot be made to an unstable
process with a set of data believed to
be accurate the process is checked for
stability this is important because if a
process is unstable no changes can be
implemented why does a process become
unstable a process can become unstable
due to special causes of variation
multiple special causes of variation
lead to
instability a single special cause leads
to an out-of control condition run
charts in mini tab can be used to check
for process stability let us look at the
steps to plot a run chart in mini tab in
the following
screen to plot a run chart in mini tab
first enter the sample data collected to
to check for stability next click stat
on the mini tab window followed by
quality tools next click run charts
select the column and choose the
subgroup size as two click okay the
graph shown in the screen is interpreted
by looking at the last four values if
any of the P values is less than
0.05 the presence of special causes of
variation can be validated this means
there is a good chance that the process
will become
unstable in the following screen we will
look at process stability studies causes
of
variation variation can be due to two
types of causes common causes of
variation and special causes of
variation click each type to learn more
common causes of variation are the many
sources of variation within a process
which have a stable and repeatable
distribution over over a period they
contribute to a state of statistical
control where the output is
predictable some other factors which do
not always act on the process can also
cause variation these are special causes
of variation these are external to the
process and are irregular in nature when
present the process distribution changes
and the process output is not stable
over a period special causes may result
in defects and need to be eliminated to
bring the process under control run
charts indicate the presence of special
causes of variation in the process if
special causes are detected the process
has to be brought to a stop and a root
cause analysis has to be carried out if
the root cause analysis reveals the
special cause to be undesirable
corrective actions are taken to remove
the special
cause we will learn about verifying
process stability and normality in this
screen based on the type of variation a
process exhibits it can be verified if
the process is in control if there are
special causes of variation the process
output is not stable over time the
process cannot be said to be in control
conversely if there are only common
causes of variation in a process the
output forms a distribution that is
stable and predictable over time a
process being in control control means
the process does not have any special
causes of variation once a process is
understood to be stable the control
chart data can be used to calculate the
process capability indices in the
following screen we will discuss process
capability studies process capability is
the actual variation in the process
specification to carry out a process
capability study first plan for data
collection next collect the data data
finally plot and analyze the results
obtaining the appropriate sampling plan
for the process capability study depends
on the purpose and whether there are any
customer or standard requirements for
the study for new processes or a project
proposal the project capability can be
estimated by a pilot run let us look at
the objectives of process capability
studies in the next grade the objectives
of a process capability study are to
establish a state of control over a
manufacturing process and then maintain
the state of control over a period of
time un comparing the natural process
limits or the control limits within the
specification limits any of the
following outcomes is possible first the
process limits are found to fall between
the specification limits this shows the
process is running well and no action is
required the second possibility is that
the process spread and the specific
appication spread are approximately the
same in this case the process is
centered by making an adjustment to the
centering of the process this would
bring the batch of products within the
specifications the third possibility is
that the process limits fall outside the
specification limits in this case reduce
the variability by partitioning the
pieces of batches to locate and Target
the largest Defender a design experiment
can be used to identify the primary
source of
variation in the following screen we
will learn about identifying
characteristics in process
capability process capability deals with
the ability of the process to meet
customer requirements therefore it is
crucial that the characteristic selected
for a process capability study indicates
a key factor in the quality of the
product or process also it should be
possible to influence the value of the
characteristic by adjusting the process
C the operating conditions that affect
the characteristic should also be
defined and controlled apart from these
requirements other factors determining
the characteristics to be measured are
customer purchase order requirements or
industry standards in the following
screen we will look at identifying
specifications or tolerances in process
capability the process specification or
tolerances are defined either by
industry standards based on customer
requirements or by the organization's
engineering department in consultation
with the customer a stability study
followed by a comprehensive capability
study also helps in identifying if the
process mean meets the Target or the
customer mean the process capability
study indicates whether the process is
capable it is used to determine if the
output consistently meets specifications
and the probability of a defect or
defective this information is used to
evaluate and improve the process to meet
the tolerance requirements in the
following screen we will learn about
process performance
indices process performance is defined
as a statistical measurement of the
outcome of a process characteristic
which may or may not have been
demonstrated to be in a state of
statistical control in other words it is
an estimate of the process capability of
a process during its initial setup
before it has been brought into a state
of statistical control it differs from
the process capability in that for
process performance a state of
statistical control is not required the
three basic process performance indices
are process performance or PP process
performance index or PPK and process
capability index denoted as PPM or CPM
click each index to no
more PP stands for processed performance
it is computed by subtracting the lower
specification limit from the upper
specification limit the whole divided by
natural process variation or Six
Sigma PPK is the process performance
index and a minimum of the values of the
upper and lower process capability
indices the upper and lower process
capability indices are calculated as
shown on the screen PPU or upper process
capability index is given by the formula
USL - x /
3s PPL or lower process capability index
is given by x minus LSL divided 3s here
x is process average better known as xar
and S is sample standard
deviation CPM denotes the process
capability index mean which counts for
the location of the process average
relative to a Target value it can be
calculated as shown on the screen here
myu stands for process average Sigma
symbol denotes the process standard
deviation USL is the upper specification
limit and LSL is the lower specification
limit T is the target value which is
typically the center of the tolerance XI
is the sample reading and N is the
number of sample
readings we will look at the key terms
in process capability in this screen zst
or short-term capability is the
potential performance of the process in
control at any given point of time it is
based on the sample collected in the
short term the long-term performance is
denoted by zlt it is the actual
performance of the process over a given
period of time subgroups are several
small samp samples collected
consecutively each sample forms a
subgroup the subgroups are chosen so
that the data points are likely to be
identical within the subgroup but
different between two subgroups the
process shift is calculated by
subtracting the long-term capability
from the short-term capability the
process shift also reflects how well a
process is controlled it is usually a
factor of
1.5 let us look at short-term and
long-term process capability in the next
screen the concept of short-term and
long-term process shift is explained
graphically on this screen there are
three different samples taken at time
one time two and time three the smaller
waveforms represent the short-term
capability and they are joined with
their means to show the shift in
long-term performance the long-term
performance curve is shown below with
the target value marked in the center it
is important to note that over a period
of time or subgroups a typical process
will shift by approximately 1.5 times
the standard deviation also long-term
variation is more than short-term
variation this difference is known as
the sigma shift and is an indicator of
the process control the reasons for a
process shift include changes in
operators raw material used wear and
tear and time periods we will discuss
the assumptions and inventions of
process variations in the following
screen long-term variation is always
longer than short-term variation click
each term to know
more short-term variations are due to
the common causes the variance is
inherent in the process and known as the
natural variation short-term variations
show variation within subgroup and are
therefore called within subgroup
variation they are usually a small
number of samples collected at Short
intervals in short-term variation the
variation due to common causes are
captured however common causes are
difficult to identify and correct the
process may have to be redesigned to
remove common causes of
variation long-term variations are due
to common as well as special causes the
added variation or abnormal variation is
due to factors external to the usual
process long-term variation is also
known as the overall variation and is a
sample standard deviation for all the
samples put together long-term variation
shows variations within the subgroup and
between subgroups special causes
increasing variation include changes in
operators raw material and wear and tear
the special causes need to be identified
and corrected for process
Improvement this screen explains how the
factors of stability capability spread
and Def effect summary are used to
interpret the process condition this
table gives the process condition for
different levels or types of variation
with reference to common causes and
special causes the table is read as
follows in the first scenario the
process has lesser common causes of
variation or CCV and no special causes
of variation or
SCV in this case the variability is less
the capability is high the possibility
of defects is less and the process is
said to be capable and in control next
if the process has lesser CCV and some
SCV are present then it has high
variability low capability and a high
possibility of defects the process is
said to be out of control and
incapable the third possibility is that
the process has high CCV and no SCV in
this case the variability is moderate to
high the capability is very low and
possibility of defects is very high
although the process is in control it is
incapable finally at the Other Extreme
is the situation where the process has
high CCV and SCV is also present here
the process has high variability low
capability high possibility of defects
and is out of control and
incapable this table is a quick
reference to understand process
conditions in the next screen we will
compare the CPK and CP values when CPK
and CP values are compared three
outcomes are possible when CPK is lesser
than CP it can be inferred that the mean
is not centered when CPK is equal to CP
the inference is that the process is is
accurate the process is considered
capable if CPK is greater than one this
will happen only if variations are in
control CPK can never be greater than CP
if this situation occurs the
calculations have to be rechecked we
will look at an example problem for
calculating process variation in the
following screen the table on this
screen shows data for customer complaint
resolution time over a period of 3 weeks
each week's data forms a subgroup for
example the resolution time is 48 hours
for a particular case in week one in
week two the case takes up 50 hours and
in week three it takes about 49 hours
the subgroup size is 10 let us
understand how to calculate long-term
and short-term standard deviations are
calculated for this
data the average for each week is
calculated by dividing the total number
of complaints resolved by by the
subgroup size a grand average is also
calculated for all the three weeks the
variations within subgroups and between
subgroups for each week are calculated
this is followed by calculating the
total variations within and between
subgroups overall variation is given by
the sum of total variation within
subgroups and total variation between
subgroups finally the standard
deviations for the short-term and the
longterm are calculated using the
formula given on the screen the results
for the process variation calculations
are as follows the grand average for all
three weeks is
47.5 the total variation within
subgroups is
1,238 the total variation between
subgroups is 161.5 7 both these
variations are added to give the overall
variation of
1,185
5.5 the short-term standard deviation is
6.2 and the long-term standard deviation
is
6.4 note that the overall variation can
also be calculated with the usual sample
variance
formula let us discuss the effect of
mean shift on the process capability in
this screen the table given here shows
the def level at different Sigma
multiple values and different mean
shifts from the table it can be seen
that when the mean is centered within
the specification limits and the process
capability is one that is plus or minus
3s fits within the specification limits
the dpmo is
2700 and the probability of a good
result is
99.73% if the mean shifts by 1.5 Sigma
then a tail moves outside the
specification limit to a greater extent
now the dpmo increases to over 66 ,000
this is almost a 25 200% increase in
defects if the process has a process
capability of 2 that is plus or minus 6s
fits within the specification limits and
the mean shifts by 1.5 Sigma then the
probability of a good result is
99.999
66% this is the same as a process with a
capability of 1.5 that is plus or minus
4.5s fitting within the specification
limits and no shift in the mean the
long-term and short-term capability
table shows the variations in
capabilities for the purposes of Six
Sigma the assumption is that the
long-term variability will have a 1.5s
difference from the short-term
variability as seen in statistical
process control this assumption can be
challenged if control charts are used
and these kinds of shifts are detected
quickly in the chart it can be seen that
the mean shift is negligible as the
process capability increases therefore
for a Six Sigma process the long-term
variation does not have much effect in
the next screen we will look at Key
Concepts in process capability for
attribute data the customary procedure
for defining process capability for
attribute data is to define the mean
rate of non-conformity defects and
defectives are examples of
non-conformity defects per million
opportunities or DPA MO is the measure
of process capability for attribute data
for this the mean and the standard
deviation for attribute data have to be
defined for defectives p bar is used for
checking process capability for both
constant and variable sample sizes for
defects c bar and uar are used for
constant and variable sample sizes
respectively the P Bar C bar and uar are
the equivalent of the standard deviation
denoted by Sigma for continuous data in
this topic we will learn about the
patterns of variation in detail let us
start with the classes of distributions
in the following screen when data
obtained from the measurement phase is
plotted on a chart it is observed that
it exhibits a variety of distributions
depending on the data type and its
source these distribution patterns will
help you understand the data better
probability statistics and inferential
statistics are the methods used to
describe the parameters for the classes
of
distributions click each method to know
more probability is based on the assumed
model of distribution and it is used to
find the chances of a certain outcome or
event to
occur statistics uses the measured data
to determine a model to describe the
data
used inferential statistics St istics
describe the population parameters based
on the sample data using a particular
model in this screen we will discuss the
types of distributions there are two
types of
distributions discrete distribution and
continuous
distribution discrete distribution
includes binomial distribution and Pon
distribution continuous distribution
includes normal distribution Kai Square
distribution
T distribution and F distribution let us
learn about discrete probability
distribution in the following screen
discrete probability distribution is
characterized by the probability Mass
function it is important to be familiar
with discrete distributions while
dealing with discrete data some of the
examples of discrete probability
distribution are binomial distribution
po distribution negative binomial distri
distribution geometric distribution and
Hyper geometric
distribution we will focus only on the
two most useful discrete distributions
binomial distribution and pant
distribution like most probability
distributions these distributions also
help in predicting the sample behavior
that has been observed in a population
let us learn about binomial distribution
in the following
screen
binomial distribution is a probability
distribution for discrete data named
after the Swiss mathematician Jacob
bernui it is an application of popular
knowledge to predict the sample
Behavior binomial distribution also
describes the discrete data as a result
of a particular process like the tossing
of a coin for a fixed number of times
and the success or failure in an
interview a process is is known as beri
process when the process output has only
two possible values like defective or
okay pass or fail and yes or no binomial
distribution is used to deal with
defective items defect is any
non-compliance with a specification
defective is a product or service with
at least one defect binomial
distribution is most suitable when the
sample size is less than 30 and less
than 10% of the population it is the
percentage of non-defective items
provided the probability of creating a
defective item Remains the Same over a
period let us look at the equation the
probability of exactly R successes out
of a sample size of n is denoted by P of
R which is equal to NCR whole multiplied
P to the^ of R and 1 - P whole to the^
of nus r R in the equation p is the
probability of success R is the number
of successes desired and N is the sample
size to continue discussing the binomial
distribution let us look at some of its
key calculations in the following screen
the mean of a binomial distribution is
denoted by mu and is given by n
multiplied by P the standard deviation
of a binomial distribution is denoted by
Sigma which is equal to n * P * 1 minus
P the method of calculating factorials
say factorial of five is the product of
5 4 3 2 and 1 which is equal to
120 similarly factorial of four is the
product of 4 3 2 and 1 which is equal to
24 let us look at an example of
calculating B omal distribution in the
next
screen suppose you wish to know the
probability of getting heads five times
in eight coin tosses you can use the
binomial equation for the same click the
answer button to see how this is
done the tossing of a coin has only two
outcomes heads and tails it means that
the probability of each outcome is
0.5 and it remains fixed over a period
of time Additionally the outcomes are
statistically
independent in this case the probability
of success denoted by P is 0.5 the
number of successes desired is denoted
by R which is five and the sample size
is denoted by n which is8 therefore the
probability of five heads is equal to
factorial of 8 CR which is 8 divided by
factorial of 5 and factorial of 8 minus
5 whole multiplied by 0.5 to the power
of 5 multiplied 1 - 0.5 to the^ of 8 - 5
this calculation gives a result of
0.287 which is equal to
21.87%
let us learn about pant distribution in
this screen pant distribution is named
after Simeon Deni Pon and is also used
for discrete data pon distrib tion is an
application of the population knowledge
to predict the sample Behavior it is
generally used for describing the
probability distribution of an event
with respect to time or space some of
the characteristics of Pon distribution
are as follow pron distribution
describes the discrete data resulting
from a process like the number of calls
received by a call center agent or the
number of accidents at a signal unlike
binomial distribution which deals with
binary discrete data Pon distribution
deals with integers which can take any
value Pon distribution is suitable for
analyzing situations wherein the number
of Trials similar to the sample size in
binomial distribution is large and tends
towards Infinity additionally it is used
in situations where the probability of
success in each trial is very small
almost tending toward zero this is the
reason why Pon distribution is a appable
for predicting the occurrence of rare
events like plane crashes car accidents
Etc and is therefore widely used in the
insurance sector Pon distribution can be
used for predicting the number of
defects as well given a low defect
occurrence rate let us look at the
formula for calculating Pon distribution
in the next screen the pon distribution
for a probability of exactly X
occurrences is given by P of x = 2
Lambda to the power of x multiplied with
log e to the^ of minus Lambda /
factorial of X in this equation Lambda
is the mean number of occurrences during
the interval X is the number of
occurrences desired and E is the base of
natural logarithm which is equal to
2.71828 the mean of the pon distribution
is given by the Lambda and the standard
deviation of a Pon distribution is given
by Sigma which is the square root of
Lambda let us look at an example to
calculate proon distribution in the next
screen the past records of a road
Junction which is accident prone show a
mean number of five accidents per week
at this Junction assume that the number
of accidents follows a Pon distribution
and calculate the probability of any
number of accidents happening in a week
click the button to know the
answer given the situation you know know
that the value of Lambda or mean is five
so P of 0 that is the probability of
zero accidents per week is calculated as
5 the power of 0 multiplied e to^ of - 5
whole / factorial of 0 the answer is
0.006 applying the same formula the
probability of one accident per week is
0.03 the probability of more than two
accidents per week
is 1 minus the sum of probabilities of 0
1 and two accidents which is
0.884 in other words the probability is
88.4% let us learn about continuous
probability distribution in this screen
continuous probability distribution is
characterized by the probability density
function a variable is said to be
continuous if the range of possible
values Falls along a Continuum for
example loudness of cheering at a ball
game weight of cookies in a package
length of a pen or the time required to
assemble a car continuous probability
distributions help in predicting the
sample Behavior observed in a
population let us learn about normal
distribution in this screen the normal
or gaussian distribution is a continuous
probability distribution the normal
distribution is represented as n and
depends on two factors mu which stands
for mean and sigma which gives the
standard deviation of the data points
normal distribution normally has a
higher frequency of values around the
mean and lesser occurrences away from it
it is often used as a first
approximation to describe real valued
random variables that tend to Cluster
around a single mean value
the distribution is bell-shaped and
symmetrical the total area under the
normal curve is one which is p of X
various types of data such as body
weight height the output of a
manufacturing device Etc follow the
normal distribution additionally normal
distribution is continuous and
symmetrical with the tails asymptotic to
the x-axis which means they touch the x
axis at Infinity let us continue to
discuss normal distribution in the
following
screen in a normal distribution to
standardize comparisons of dispersion or
the different measurement units like
inches meters Gams Etc a standard Z
variable is used the uses of Z value are
as follows while the value of Z or the
number of standard deviations is unique
for each probability within the normal
distribution it helps in finding
probabilities of data points anywhere
within the distribution
it is dimensionless as well that is it
has no units such as millimeters liters
colums Etc there are different formulas
to arrive at the normal distribution we
will focus on one commonly used formula
for calculating normal distribution
which is z = Yus muu whole / Sigma here
Z is the number of standard deviations
between Y and the mean denoted by Miu Y
is the value of the data point in
concern muu is mean of the population or
data points and sigma is the standard
deviation of the population or data
points let us look at an example for
calculating normal distribution in the
following
screen suppose the time taken to resolve
customer problems follows a normal
distribution with a mean of 250 hours
and standard deviation of 23 hours find
the probability of a problem resolution
taking more than 300 hours click the
button to know the
answer in this case Y is equal to 300
muu = 250 and sigma equal 23 applying
the normal distribution formula Z is
equal to 300 - 250 whole / 23 the result
is
2.17 when you look at the normal
distribution table the Z value of 2.17
covers an error area of
0.984 N9 under itself this means the
probability of a problem taking 0 to 300
hours to be resolved is
98.5% and therefore the chances of a
problem resolution taking more than 300
hours is
1.5% let us understand the usage of
ztable in this screen the graphical
representation of ztable usage is given
here the probability of areas under the
curve is one for the actual value one
can identify the zcore by using the Z
table as shown this probability is the
area under the curve to the left of
point plus a to zero using the actual
data when you calculate mean and
standard deviation and the values are 25
and five respectively it is the normal
distribution if the same data is
standardized to a mean value of Z
and standard deviation value of one it
is the standard normal
distribution in the next screen we will
take a look at the Z
table the Z table gives the probability
that Z is between zero and a positive
number there are different forms of
normal distribution Z tabls followed
globally the most common form of Z table
with positive Z scores is shown here the
value of a called the percentage point
is given along the borders of the table
in bold and is to two decimal places the
values in the main table are the
probabilities that Z is between Z and
plus a note that the values running down
the table are to one decimal place the
numbers along the column change only for
the second decimal place let us look at
some examples on how to use a z table in
the following screen let us find the
value of P of Z less than Z the table is
not needed to find the answer once we
know that the variable Z takes a value
less than or equal to zero first the
area under the curve is one and second
the curve is symmetrical about Z equals
0 hence there is 0.5 or 50% above chance
of Z equals 0 and 0.5 or 50% below
chance of Z equals 0
let us find the value of P of Z greater
than
1.12 in this case the chance of Z is
greater than a number in this case
1.12 you can find this by using the
following fact the opposite or
complement of an event of a is the event
of not a that is the opposite or
complement of event a occurring is the
event a not occurring its probability is
given by P of not a = 1us p of a in
other words P of Z greater than 1.12 is
1 minus the opposite which is p of Z
lesser than
1.12 using the table P of Z less than
1.12 = 0.5 + P of 0 less than Z less
than 1.12 = 0.5 + 0.
3686 which is 0.8 8
686 hence the answer is p of Z greater
than 1.12 = 1 - 0.86 86 which is
01314 note the answer is less than
0.5 let us find the value of P of Z lies
between 0 and
1.12 in this case where Z Falls within
an interval the probability can be read
straight off the table P of Z lies
between 0 and 1.12 equal 0.
3686 we will learn about Kai Square
distribution in this screen Kai squar
distribution is also known as Kai squar
or Kai Square distribution Kai squar
with K1 degrees of freedom is the
distribution of a sum of the squares of
K independent standard normal random
variables the kai Square distribution is
one of the most widely used probability
distributions in inferential statistics
it is also known as hypothesis testing
and the distribution is used in
hypothesis tests when used in hypothesis
tests it only needs one sample for the
test to be conducted conventionally
degree of freedom is k1 where K is the
sample size click the button to view the
Ki Square distribution
formula Kai Square calcul or Sigma or
the kai Square index equals F of O minus
F of e the whole squar / f of e here F
of O stands for an observed frequency
and F of e stands for an expected
frequency determined through a
contingency table we will learn about
the Ki Square distribution in detail in
the later part of this lesson let us
proceed to the next screen to discuss T
distribution
the T distribution method is the most
appropriate method to be used in the
following situations when you have a
sample size of less than 30 when the
population standard deviation is not
known when the population is
approximately normal unlike the normal
distribution a t distribution is lower
at the mean and higher at the Tails as
seen in the image T distribution is used
for hypothesis testing
also as seen in the image the T
distribution is symmetrical in shape but
flatter than the normal
distribution as the sample size
increases the T distribution approaches
normality for every possible sample size
or degrees of freedom there is a
different T
distribution let us learn about F
distribution in the following
screen the F distribution is a ratio of
two Kai Square distribution butions a
specific F distribution is denoted by
the ratio of the degrees of freedom for
the numerator Kai square and the degrees
of freedom for the denominator Kai
Square the F test is performed to
calculate and observe if the standard
deviations or variances of two processes
are significantly different the project
teams are usually concerned about
reducing the process variance as per the
formula
F calculated equal S1 s / S2 s where S1
and S2 are the standard deviations of
the two samples if the F calculated is
one it implies there is no difference in
the variance if S1 is greater than S2
then the numerator must be greater than
the denominator in other words df1 = N1
minus1 and df2 2 = N2
-1 from the F distribution table you can
easily find out the critical F
distribution at Alpha and the degrees of
freedom of the samples of two different
processes df1 and
df2 let us proceed to the next topic of
this lesson in the following
screen in this topic we will discuss
exploratory data analysis in detail let
us learn about multivar studies in the
following
screen multivar studies or multivariable
studies are used to analyze variation in
a process analyzing variation helps in
investigating the stability of a process
more stable the process less is the
variation multivar studies also help in
identifying areas to be
investigated finally they help in
breaking down the variation into
components to make the required
improvements
multivar studies classify variation
sources into three major types
positional cyclical and temporal click
each type to learn
more positional variation occurs within
a single piece or a product variation in
pieces of a batch is also an example of
positional variation in positional
variation measurements at different
locations of a piece would produce
different
values a company is manufacturing a
metal plate of thickness 1 in and the
plate thickness is different at many
points it is an example of positional
variation some of the other examples can
be pallet stacking in a truck
temperature gradient in an oven
variation observed from cavity to cavity
within a mold region of a country and
line on
invoice cyclical variation occurs when
measure measurement differs from piece
to piece or product to product but over
a short period of time time is important
because certain measurements may change
if a product such as a hot metal sheet
is measured after a long interval if the
measurement at the same location in a
piece varies with different pieces it is
an example of cyclical variation other
examples of cyclical variations are
batch to batch variation Lotto lot
variation and account activity week to
week temporal variation occurs over a
longer period of time such as machine
wear and tear and changes in efficiency
of an operator before and after lunch
temporal variations may also be seasonal
if the range of positional variation in
a piece is more in Winter than in summer
it is an example of temporal variation
the variation may occur because of
unfavorable working conditions in winter
process drift performance before and
after breaks seasonal and shift based
differences month-to-month closings and
quarterly returns can be examples of
temporal
variation we will learn about creating a
multivari chart in this screen the
outcome of multivar studies is the
multivar chart it depicts the type of
variation in the product and helps in
identifying the root cause there are
five major steps involved in creating a
multivar chart they are select process
and
characteristics decide sample size
create a tabulation sheet plot the chart
and Link The observed values click each
step to learn
more the first step is to select the
process and the relevant characteristics
to be investigated for example selecting
the process where the plate of 1 in
thickness is being manufactured
in this process four equipment numbered
1 to four produce the 1-in plates the
characteristic to be measured is the
thickness of the plate ranging from 0.95
in to 1.05 in any plate thickness
outside this range is a
defect the second step is to decide the
sample size and the frequency of data
collection in this example the sample
size is 5 pieces per equipment and the
frequency of collecting data is every 2
hours starting from 88: in the morning
to 2 in the
afternoon then the tabulation sheet is
created where the data will be recorded
So one should measure the thickness of
the plate being produced by the four
equipment at a data collection frequency
of 2
hours the third step is to create a
tabulation sheet in this example the
tabulation sheet with d data records
contains the columns with time equipment
number and thickness as
headers the fourth step is to plot the
chart in this example a chart can be
plotted with time on the X AIS and plate
thickness on the Y
AIS the last step is to link The
observed values in this Example The
observed values can be linked by
appropriate
lines we will continue to learn about
creating a multivar chart in this screen
the path to create a multivar chart in
many tab is by selecting stat then
quality tools followed by multivar chart
the multivar chart created from the data
recorded is shown here the upper
specification limit of 1.05 in and the
lower specification limit of 0.95 in has
been marked by Green lines
data outside these lines are defects the
blue dots show the positional variation
the dots are the measurements of pieces
in a batch of any single equipment the
black lines join the mean of the data
recorded from the equipment the mean of
the data recorded from the products of
equipment number three is much below the
similar mean of other
equipment this shows that equipment
number three is producing more def
effects than the other
equipment the red line is the mean of
the data recorded at a particular time
the Red Line Rises toward the right
which means the data points shift up
after 12:00 p.m. this may be because of
the change in operator efficiency after
a lunch break at 12:00 p.m. multivar
chart helps us visually depict the
variations and establish the root causes
of
variations in the next scrip we will
learn about simple linear
correlation correlation means
association between variables simple
linear regression and multiple
regression techniques are very important
as they help in validating the
association of X with Y the coefficient
correlation shows the strength of the
relationship between Y and X to
associate y with a single X and
statistically valid at the relationship
correlation is used in Excel use equals
correl Open Bracket close bracket
function to calculate correlation
coefficient the dependent variable y may
depend on many independent variables X
but correlation is used to find the
behavior of Y as one of the X's changes
correlation helps us to predict the
direction of movement in values in y
when X changes statistical significance
of this movement is denoted by
correlation coefficient R it is also
known as Pearson's coefficient of
correlation in any correlation the value
of the correlation coefficient is always
between minus1 and + one positive value
of R denotes the direction of movement
in both variables is the same as X
increases y also increases and vice
versa
negative value of R denotes that the
direction of movement in both variables
is in inverse fashion as X increases y
decreases and as X decreases y increases
when the value of R is zero it means
that there is no correlation between the
two
variables higher the absolute value of R
stronger the correlation between Y and X
absolute value of a number is is its
value without the sign + 4 has an
absolute value of 4 and minus 4 again
has an absolute value of four an R value
of greater than plus
0.85 or lesser than
-0.85 indicates a strong correlation
hence r value of- 0.95 shows a stronger
correlation than the R value of minus
0.74 the next screen will elaborate on
correlation with the help of an example
and illustrations through Scatter
Plots the four graphs on the screen are
Scatter Plots displaying four different
levels of correlation correlation
measures the linear association between
the dependent variable or output
variable Y and one independent or input
variable X as can be deduced from the
graphs a definite pattern emerges as the
absolute value of correlation
coefficient R increases it is easy to
see a pattern in r value of 0.9 and
above than to see a pattern in r value
of
0.07 it is difficult to find a pattern
below correlation coefficient of 0.5
click the example button to know
more to understand how correlation helps
let us consider an example a correlation
test was performed on the scores of a
set of students from their first grade
high school and
undergraduation the undergraduation
score was the dependent variable and
first grade score the independent
variable the value of correlation
coefficient R was calculated to be
0.29 and the correlation between
undergraduation scores and high school
scores was
0.45 this means the high school scores
have higher correlation compared to the
first grade scores
this States the performance of students
in high school is a better indicator of
their performance in undergraduation
than their performance in the first
grade although the correlation exists as
both the values of R are less than
0.85 it will be difficult to draw a
straight line on the scanner
plot in this screen we will learn about
regression although correlation gives
the direction of movement of the
dependent variable y as independent
variable X changes it does not provide
the extent of the movement of Y as X
changes this degree of movement can be
calculated using
regression if a high percentage of
variability in y is explained By changes
in x one can use the model to write a
transfer equation Y is equal to FX and
use the same equation to predict future
values of Y given x and x given y y the
output of regression on Y and X is a
transfer function equation that can
predict values of Y for any other value
of x transfer function is generally
denoted by F and the equation is written
as y equal to f ofx y can be regressed
on one or more X's
simultaneously simple linear regression
is for 1 x and multiple linear
regression is for more than 1X the next
screen will focus on key concepts of
regression there are two key concepts of
regression transfer function to control
Y and vital X click each concept to
learn
more the output of regression is a
transfer function f ofx although the
transfer function f ofx gives the degree
of movement in y as X changes it is not
the correct transfer function to control
y as there may be a low level of
correlation between the
two the main thrust of regression is to
discover whether a significant
statistical relationship exists between
Y and a particular X that is by looking
at P values based on regression one can
infer the vital X and eliminate the
unimportant X's the analyze phase helps
in understanding if there is statistical
relevance between Y and X if the
relevance is established using metrics
from regression analysis one can move
forward with the tests the simple linear
regression or SLR should be used as a
statistical validation tool in the
beginning of this
phase in this screen we will understand
the concept of simple linear regression
a simple linear regression equation is a
fitted linear equation and is
represented by the equation shown here
in this equation Y is the dependent
variable and X is the independent
variable a is The Intercept of the
fitted line on the Y AIS which is equal
to the value of y at x equal to z b is
the regression coefficient or the slope
of the line and C is the error in the
regression model which has a mean of
zero
the next screen will focus on the least
squares method in simple linear
regression with reference to the error
mentioned earlier if correlation
coefficient of Y and X is not equal to
one meaning the relation is not
perfectly linear there could be several
lines that could fit in the scatter plot
notice the two graphs displayed for the
same set of Five Points two different
types of lines are drawn and both of
them have errors error refers to the
points on the scatter plot that do not
fall on the straight line drawn the
second graph shows the Y intercept
statistical software like minitab fits
the line which has the least value of
Errors squared and added as is clear
from the graph error is the distance of
the point from the fitted line typically
the data lies off the line in perfect
linear relation All Points would lie on
the line and error would be zero the
distance from the point to the line is
the error distance used in the ssse
calculations let's understand SLR with
the help of an example in the next
screen consider the following example
suppose a farmer wishes to predict the
relationship between the amount spent on
fertilizers and the annual sales of his
crops he collects the data shown here
here for the last few years and
determines his expected Revenue if he
spends $8 annually on fertilizers he has
targeted sales of $31 this
year the steps to perform simple linear
regression in Ms Exel are as follows
copy the data table on an Excel
worksheet select all the data from B1 to
C6 this is assuming the year table
appears in cells a A1 to
A6 click insert and choose the plain
scatter chart it is titled scatter with
only markers the basic scatter chart
will appear as shown on the screen
rightclick on the data points in the
scatter chart and choose the option add
trend line then choose the option linear
and select the boxes titled display R 2
value and display equation a linear line
line will appear which is called the
best fit line or the least squares
line to use the data for regression
analysis the interpretation of the
scatter chart is as follows the R square
value or the coefficient of
determination conveys if the model is
good and can be used the R square value
here is 0
3797 it means 38% of variability in y is
explained by X the remaining 62%
variation is unexplained or due to
residual factors other factors like rain
amount and variability Sunshine
temperatures seed type and Seed quality
could be tested the low value of R
square statistically validates poor
relationship between Y and X thus the
equation presented cannot be used for
further analysis in a similar situation
one should refer to the cause and effect
Matrix and study the relationship
between Y and a different X
variable we will discuss multiple linear
regression in this screen if a new
variable X2 is added to the R square
model the impact of X1 and X2 on y gets
tested this is known as multiple linear
regression the value of r R square
changes due to the introduction of the
new variable the resulting value of R
square which can be used in cases of
multiple regression is known as R square
adjusted the model can be used if R
square adjusted value is greater than
70% we will look at the key Concepts in
the next
screen the key Concepts in multiple
linear regression are as follows the
resid uals or the differences between
the actual value and the predicted value
give an indication of how good the model
is if the errors or residuals are small
and predictions use X's that are within
the range of the collected data the
predictions should be fine the sum of
squares total can be calculated as
follows sum of squares total or SST
equals the sum of squares of regression
or s s SR plus sum of squares of error
or
SS to arrive at sum of squares of
regression SSR use the formula SSR
equals sum of squares total or SST minus
sum of squares of error or
SSE since SSR is SS subtracted from
SST value of ss should be less than SST
t r squar is sum of squares of
regression or SSR / sum of squares total
or
SST calculating SST and SS helps in
determining SSR and R square to get a
sense of the error in the fitted model
calculate the value of y for a given
data using the fitted line equation to
check for error take two observ of Y at
the same X the most important thing to
remember in regression analysis is that
the obtained fitted line equation cannot
be used to predict y for values of X
outside the data for example it would
not be possible to predict the amount
spent on fertilizers for a forecasted
sales of $15 or
$60 both data points lie outside the
data set on which regression analysis is
is
performed if Y is dependent on many X's
then simple linear regression analysis
can be used to prioritize X but it
requires running separate regressions on
y with each X if an X does not explain
variation in y then it should not be
explored any further these were the
interpretations of the simple linear
regression equation in the next screen
we will learn that despite a
relationship being established between
two variables the change in one may not
cause a change in the other let us
discuss the difference between
correlation and causation in the
following screen a regression equation
denotes only a relationship between the
Y and the X this does not mean that a
change in one variable will cause a
change in the other if number of schools
and incidents of crime in a city rise
together there may be a relationship but
no causation the increase in both the
factors could be due to a third factor
that is population in other words both
of them may be dependent variables to an
independent variable consider the graphs
shown on the screen the graphs on the
left show the relations between number
of sneezes and incidents of death with
respect to population both have a
positive correlation finding a positive
correlation between incidents of deaths
and number of sneezes does not mean we
assume sneezing is the cause of
somebody's death despite the correlation
being very strong as depicted in the
graph on the right let us proceed to the
next topic of this lesson in the
following
screen in this topic we will discuss
hypothesis testing in detail let us
learn about statistical and practical
significance of of hypothesis test in
the following
screen the differences between a
variable and its hypothesized value may
be statistically significant but may not
be practical or economically
meaningful for example based on a
hypothesis test Neutra worldwide Inc
wants to implement a trading strategy
which is proven to provide statistically
significant returns however it does not
guarantee Trading on this strategy would
result in economically meaningful
positive returns when the logical
reasons are examined before
implementation the returns are
economically significant the returns may
not be significant when statistically
proven strategy is implemented directly
the returns may not be economically
significant after accounting for taxes
transaction costs and risks inherent in
the strategy thus there should be a
practical or economic significant study
before implementing any statistically
significant data the next screen will
briefly focus on the conceptual
differences between a null and an
alternate
hypothesis the conceptual differences
between a null and an alternate
hypothesis are as
follows assume the specification of the
current process is itself the null
hypothesis null hypothesis denoted as
the basic assumption for any activity or
experiment is represented as
ho no hypothesis cannot be proved it can
only be rejected or disproved it is
important to note that if null
hypothesis is rejected alternative
hypothesis must be right for example
assuming that a movie is good one plans
to watch it therefore the null
hypothesis in this scenario will be
movie is good alternative hypothesis or
ha challenges the null hypothesis or is
the converse of the null
hypothesis in this scenario alternate
hypothesis will be movie is not good in
the following screen we will discuss
type one and type two
error rejecting a null hypothesis when
it is true is called type 1 error it is
also known as reducers risk for example
the rejection of a product by the QA
team when it is not defective will cause
loss to the producer suppose when a
movie is good it is reviewed to be not
good this reflects type one error in
this case the null hypothesis is
rejected when it is actually true the
two important points to be noted are
significance level or Alpha is the
chance of committing a type one one
error the value of alpha is
0.05 or
5% accepting a null hypothesis when it
is false is called type two error it is
also known as consumer's risk for
example the acceptance of an effective
product by the quality analyst of an
organization will cause loss to the
consumer who buys it minimizing type two
error requires acceptance criteria to be
very strict suppose when a movie is not
good it is reviewed to be good this
reflects type two error in this case the
alternate hypothesis is rejected when it
was actually true the two important
points to be noted are beta is the
chance of committing a type 2 error the
value of beta is 0.2 or
20% any experiment should have as less
beta value as possible the next screen
will cover the key points to remember
about type one and type 2
error as you start dealing with the two
types of Errors keep the following
points in mind the probability of making
one type of error can be reduced when
one is willing to accept a higher
probability of making the other type of
error suppose the management of a
company producing pacemakers wants to
ensure no defective pacemaker reaches
the consumer so the quality assurance
team makes stringent guidelines to
inspect the
Pacemakers this would invariably
decrease the beta error or type 2 error
but this will also increase the chance
that a non- defective pacemaker is
declared defective by the quality
assurance team thus Alpha error or type
1 error
increases if all null hypotheses are
accepted to avoid rejecting true null
hypothesis it will lead to type two
error typically Alpha is set at
0.05 which means that the risk of
committing a type one error is one out
of 20
experiments in case of any product the
teams must decide what type of error
should be less and set the value of
Alpha and beta accordingly in the next
screen we will discuss the power of
test the power of of a hypothesis test
or the power of test is the probability
of correctly rejecting the null
hypothesis when it is false power of a
test is represented by 1 minus beta
which is also the type 2 error the
probability of not committing a type two
error is called the power of a
hypothesis test the power of a test
helps in improving the advantage of
hypothesis testing the higher the power
of a a test the better it is for
purposes of hypothesis testing given a
choice of tests the one with the highest
power should be
preferred the only way to decrease the
probability of a type 2 error given the
significance level or probability of
type one error is to increase the sample
size it is important to note that
quality inspection is done on Sample
pieces and not on all the products so
beta error is a function of the sample
size if the sample size is not
appropriate the defects in a product
line could easily be missed out giving a
wrong perception of the quality of the
product this will increase the type two
error to decrease this error the quality
assurance team has to increase the
sample size in hypothesis testing Alpha
is called the significance level and 1
minus Alpha is called the confidence
level of the test in the next screen we
will focus on the determinance of sample
size for continuous
data the sample size can be calculated
by answering three simple questions how
much variation is present in the
population at what interval does the
true population mean need to be
estimated and how much representation
error is allowed in the
sample continuous data is data which can
be measured the sample size for
continuous data can be determined by the
formula shown on the screen we will
learn about the standard sample size
formula for continuous data in the next
screen representation error or Alpha
error is generally assumed to be 5% or
0.05 hence the expression of 1us alpha /
2 amounts to
0.975 or 9
7.5% looking up the value of
z97.5 from the Z table gives the value
1.96 the expression reduces to the one
shown on screen when Alpha is 5% Z is
1.96 to detect a change that is half the
standard deviation one needs to get at
least 16 data points for the sample
click the example tab to view an example
of continuous data calculation using
standard sample size
formula the population standard
deviation for the time to resolve
customer problems is 30 hours what
should be the size of a sample that can
estimate the average problem resolution
time within plus or minus 5 hours
tolerance with 99% confidence to know
with 99% confidence that the time to
resolve a customer problem ranges
between 25 and 35 hours the value of Z
for 99.5 must be
2.57 a good result should fall outside
the range of
0.5% which is one in 200 trials it is
expected that 199 out of 200 trials will
confirm a proper
conclusion the calculation gives a
result of
23870 one cannot have 70 of a sample so
one needs to round up to the nearest
integer if there are 239 samples the
significance level is greater than
0.01 which indicates the confidence is
less than
99% using 239 reduces Alpha and
increases the confidence level the
rounded up value 239 means the
expectations are being met for the
confidence level of the
test
we will learn about the standard sample
size formula for discrete data in this
screen like continuous data one can find
out the sample size required while
dealing with discrete population if the
average population proportion non
defective is p then population standard
deviation can be calculated by using the
expression shown on the screen the
expression for sample size is present it
is important to note that in this
expression the interval or tolerance is
in percentage click the example tab to
view an example of discrete data
calculation using standard sample size
formula the non-defective population
proportion for pen manufacturing is
80% what should be the sample size to
draw a sample that can estimate the
proportion of compliant pans within plus
or minus 5% with an alpha of 5% consider
calcul in the sample size for discrete
data for which the population proportion
non-defective is 80% and the tolerance
limit is within plus or minus
5% substituting the values it is found
the sample size should be
246 in this example to know if the
population proportion for good pens is
still within 75 to
85% and to have 95% confidence that the
sample will allow a good conclusion one
needs to inspect
245.20 point8 of a pen cannot be
inspected so the value is rounded up to
maintain the confidence level inspecting
245 or fewer pens reduces the confidence
level this means the Z value would be
lower than
1.96 and Alpha would be greater than
0.05 suppose one is willing to accept a
greater range in the estimate the
proportion is within 20% of the past
results and approximately within one
standard deviation of the proportion
Delta changes to
0.20 and the number of needed samples is
15.4 is approximately equal to
16 this screen will focus on the
hypothesis testing road map though the
basic determinants of accepting or
rejecting a hypothesis remain the same
various tests are used depending on the
type of data from the figure shown on
the screen You can conclude the type of
test to be performed based on the kind
of data and values available for
discrete data if mean and standard
deviation are both known the Z test is
used and if mean is known but standard
deviation is unknown the T test is used
if the standard deviation is unknown and
if the sample size is less than 30 it is
preferable to use the T Test if variance
is known one should go for Kai squar
test if mean and standard deviation are
known for a set of continuous data it is
recommended to go for the Z test for
mean comparison of two with standard
deviation unknown go for T Test and for
mean comparison of many with standard
deviation unknown go for f test also if
the variance is known for continuous
data go for f test the next few screens
will discuss in detail the tests for
mean variance and proportions let us
understand hypothesis test for means
theoretical through an example in the
next
screen the examples of hypothesis
testing based on the types of data and
values available are discussed here the
value of alpha can be assumed to be 5%
or
0.05 suppose you want to check for the
average height of a population North
American males are selected as the
population here from the population 117
men are gathered as the sample and the
readings of their height are taken the
null hypothesis is that the average
height of North American males is 165 cm
and the alternate hypothesis is that the
height is lesser or greater than 165 cm
consider the sample size n as 117 for Z
test and and sample size n is 25 for T
Test sample average or xar is
164.512 CM and the average height of the
sample group is
should be
conducted first let us compute zal value
using the formula given on the screen
hence the Z Cal is
1.04 Which is less than 1.96 or t
critical therefore the null hypothesis
cannot be rejected since
z0.05 =
1.96 the null hypothesis is not rejected
at 5% level of significance the
statistical notation is shown on the
screen thus a conclusion based on the
sample collected is that the average
height of North American males is 165
cm if the population standard deviation
is not known a t test is used it is
similar to the Z test instead of using
the population parameter or Sigma the
sample statistic standard deviation or S
is used in this example the S value is
5.0 let us now compute T value using the
formula given on the screen the
statistical notation to reject null
hypothesis is shown on the screen the T
critical value is
2.64 and we know the T Cal value is
0.5 Which is less than
2.64 therefore the null hypothesis
cannot be rejected at 5% level of
significance thus a conclusion based on
the sample collected is that the average
height of North American males is 165
cm the conclusion of not rejecting the
null hypothesis is based on the
assumption that the 25 males are
randomly selected from all males in
North America null and alternative
hypotheses are same for both Z test and
T Test in both the examples the null
hypothesis is not rejected in the next
screen we will understand the hypothesis
test test for variance with an
example in hypothesis test for variance
Kai Square test is used in the case of a
Ki Square test the null and Alternate
hypotheses are defined and the values of
Kai Square critical and Kai Square are
calculated to understand this concept
with an example click the button given
on the
screen the null hypothesis is that the
proportion of winds in Australia or
abroad is independent of the country
played against the alternate hypothesis
is that the proportion of winds in
Australia or abroad is dependent on the
country played against Kai Square
critical is 6.25 one and Kai Square
calculated is
1.36 since the calculated value is less
than the critical value the proportion
of wins of the Australia hockey team is
independent of the country played or or
place in this screen we will discuss
hypothesis test for proportions with an
example the hypothesis test on
population proportion can be performed
to understand this with an example click
the button given on the
screen let us perform hypothesis test on
population proportion the no hypothesis
is that the proportion of smokers among
males in a place named R is 0
.10 represented as p 0 the alternative
hypothesis is the proportion is
different than
0.10 in notation it is represented as
null hypothesis is p equal P0 against
alternative hypothesis is p different
than
P0 a sample of 150 adult males are
interviewed and it is found that 23 of
them are smokers thus the sample
proportion is 23 / 150 which is
0.153 substituting this value in the
expression of Z given on the screen
gives the result of
1.80 you can reject the null hypothesis
at level of significance Alpha if Z is
greater than z alpha for 5% level of
confidence the Z value should be
1.96 since the calculated Z value is
more than what is required for 5% level
of confidence the null hypothesis is
rejected hence it can be concluded that
the proportion of smokers in R is
greater than
0.10 in this screen we will focus on
comparison of means of two
processes means of two processes are
compared to understand whether the
outcomes of the two processes are
significantly different this test is
helpful in understanding whether a new
process is better than an old process
this test can also determine whether the
two samples belong to the same
population or different populations it
is especially required for benchmarking
to compare an existing process with
another benchmarked process let us
proceed to the next screen to learn
about the paired comparison hypothesis
test for means the example of two mean t
test with unequal variances is discussed
here null and Alternate hypotheses are
defined the average heights of men in
two different sets of people are
compared to see if the means are
significantly different for this test
the sample sizes means and variances are
required to calculate the value of t two
samples of sizes N1 of
125 and N2 of 110 are taken from the two
populations the mean value of sample
size size 1 is
167.5 and sample size 2 is
165.1 the standard deviation for sample
sizes 1 and two are 4.2 and 5.0
respectively using the formula given on
the screen the T value is derived as
2.47 the null hypothesis is rejected if
the calculated value of T is more than
the required value of t
in other words reject null hypothesis at
level of significance a if computed T
value is greater than T of DF a / 2 with
a T Test we're comparing two means and
the population parameter Sigma is
unknown therefore we're pulling the
sample standard deviations in order to
calculate T the variances are weighted
by the number of data points in each
sample group since T2 223 and
0.025 =
1.96 the null hypothesis is rejected at
5% level of
significance the test used Here is known
as the paired T Test and is considered a
very powerful test in the next screen we
will look into the example of the paired
comparison hypothesis test for variance
of f
test it is important to understand the
different types of tests through an
example
Susan is trying to compare the standard
deviation of two companies according to
her the earnings of company a are more
volatile than those of Company B she has
been obtaining earnings data for the
past 31 years for company a and for the
past 41 years for Company B she finds
that the sample standard deviation of
company A's earnings is
$4.40 and of company B's earnings is $3
90 determine whether the earnings of
company a have a greater standard
deviation than those of Company B at 5%
level of significance click the button
given on the screen to know the
answer Susan has the data of the
earnings of the companies distributions
rarely have the same spread or variance
when processes are improved one of the
strategies is to reduce the variation it
is important to be able to compare
variances with each other a null
hypothesis would indicate no change has
occurred if it can be rejected and the
variance is lower one can claim success
the statistical notation for this
example is given on the screen suppose
one has to compare two sets of company
data Susan has looked at the earnings of
two companies she has been studying the
effects of strategy management styles
and Leadership profiles on the earnings
of these companies there are significant
differences in these
kpvs she wants to know if they have an
effect on the variance in the earnings
she has sample data over several decades
for each company by the given data it
can be concluded that earnings of
company a have a greater standard
deviation than those of
companyb in calculating the F test
statistic always put the greater
variance in the new
numerator let us look at the F Test
example of hypothesis test for equality
of variance in this screen the degrees
of freedom for company a and Company B
are 30 and 40 respectively the critical
value from ftable equals
1.74 the null hypothesis is rejected if
the F test statistic is greater than
1.74 the calculated value of f test
statistic is 1.
1273 and therefore at the 5%
significance level the null hypothesis
cannot be
rejected the next screen will focus on
hypothesis test F test for independent
groups a restaurant which wants to
explore the recent overuse of avocados
suspects there is a difference between
Two Chefs and the number of avocados
used to prepare the salads the data
shown in the table is the measure of
avocad
in ounces the weight of avocado slices
used in salads prepared by two different
chefs is to determine if one Chef is
using more avocados than the other
perhaps the restaurant's expenditures on
avocados is greater this month than the
average of the past 12 months this is
assuming there is no change in avocado
prices or the amount of avocados being
used click the tab to learn to conduct
an F test in msxl
the F test is conducted in Ms Exel
through the following steps Open
msxl click data click data analysis
please follow the facilitator
instruction on how to install addins
select F test two sample for variances
in variable one range select the data
set for group a and select data set for
Group B in variable two range click okay
a the screenshot of the Fest window is
also shown
here in this screen we will discuss the
ftest assumptions before interpreting
the F test the assumptions to be
considered are null hypothesis there is
no significant statistical difference
between the variances of the two groups
thus concluding any variation could be
because of chance this is common cause
of
variation alternate hypothesis
there is a significant statistical
difference between the variances of the
two groups thus concluding that
variations could be because of
assignable causes too this is special
cause of variation the following screen
will focus on F test
interpretations the interpretations for
the conducted F test are from the Excel
result sheet the P value is
0.03 if P value is low or below
0.05 the null must be rejected thus null
hypothesis with 97% confidence is
rejected also the fact that variation
could only be due to common cause of
variation is rejected it is inferred
from the test that there could be
assignable causes of variation or
special causes of
variation Excel provides the descriptive
statistics for for each variable it also
gives the degrees of freedom for each f
is the calculated F statistic F critical
is a reference number found in a
statistics Book Table P of f less than
or equal to F is the probability that F
really is less than F critical or that
the null hypothesis would be falsely
rejected since the p value is less than
the alpha the null hypothesis can be
confidently rejected alongside
conducting a hypothesis test a
meaningful conclusion from the test has
been drawn the following screen will
focus on hypothesis test T test for
independent
groups as discussed earlier the table
shows the measure of avocados in ounces
and the significant difference in their
means needs to be inspected if a
significant amount of difference is
found it can be concluded that there is
a possibility of special cause of
variation the next screen will
demonstrate how to conduct the two
sample T
Test the two sample independent T Test
inspects two groups of data for
significant difference in their means
the idea is to conclude if there is a
significant amount of difference if
there is a statistical evidence of
variation one can conclude a possibility
of special cause of variation the steps
for conducting a two sample T Test on R
Open msxl click data and click data
analysis select two sample independent T
Test assuming unequal
variances in variable one range select
the data set for group a and select the
data set for Group B in variable two
range keep the hypothesized mean
difference as zero click okay in the
following screen we will focus on two
sample independent depent T Test
assumptions the assumptions for a two
sample independent T Test are null
hypothesis there is no significant
statistical difference between the means
of the two groups thus concluding any
variation could be because of chance
this is common cause of
variation alternate
hypothesis there is a significant
statistical difference between the means
of the two groups thus concluding that
Vari ations could be because of
assignable causes too this is special
cause of
variation the null hypothesis States the
mean of group a is equal to the mean of
Group B the alternate hypothesis states
that the mean of group a is not equal to
the mean of Group B note that alternate
hypothesis test two conditions mean of a
is less than mean of B and mean of a is
greater than mean of B thus a two-tailed
probability needs to be used before we
interpret the T test results let us
compare the two-tailed and one-tailed
probability in the next screen
two-tailed probability and one-tailed
probability are used depending on the
direction of the alternate hypothesis if
the alternate hypothesis tests more than
one direction either less or more use a
two-tail probability value from the test
example if mean of a is not equal to
mean of B then it is two-tailed
probability if the alternate hypothesis
tests Only One Direction use a
one-tailed probability value from the
test example if mean of a is greater
than mean of B then it is one-tailed
probability in the next screen let us
look at the two sample independent T
test results and
interpretations the results are are
shown in the table on the screen the
inference is as the two-tail probability
is being tested the P value of two-tail
probability testing is
0.24 which is greater than
0.05 if P value is greater than
0.05 the null hypothesis is not rejected
this means one cannot reject the fact
that there is no significant statistical
difference between the two means similar
to the F test Excel provides the
descript statistics for each group or
variable the tat is shown Excel also
shows one-tailed or two-tailed data for
the one-tailed test the alpha is
0.05 the error is expected to be in one
direction for the two-tailed test the
error is
alpha/2 or
0.025 in this example T Stat or t
calculated is less than either T
criticals therefore the null hypothesis
is cannot be rejected thus it can be
inferred that both the groups are
statistically same we will discuss the
paired T Test in the next
screen paired T Test is another
hypothesis test from the family of T
Test the following points will help in
understanding the paired T Test in
detail the paired T Test is one of the
most powerful tests from the T Test
family the paired T Test is conducted
before and after the process to be
measured for example a group of students
score X in
cssgb before taking the training program
post the training program the scores are
taken again one needs to find out if
there is a statistical difference
between the two sets of scores if there
is a significant difference the
inference could be that the training was
effective it is important to note that
the paired test interpretation shows the
effectiveness of the Improvement
measures
this is the main reason why paired T
tests are often used in the improve
stage let us learn about sample variance
in the following screen sample variance
is defined as the average of the squared
differences from the mean the sample
variance that is s Square can be used to
calculate and understand the degree of
variation of a sample it can also be
used in statistics however it cannot be
used or explained directly
because its value does not provide any
information to use the value you have to
first convert it into standard deviation
and then combine it with the mean click
the button to know the steps for
calculating the sample
variance step one calculate the mean or
average of the sample step two subtract
each of the values from the mean step
three calculate the square value of the
the results step four take the average
of the squared
differences let us understand how to
calculate the sample variance with the
help of an example in this screen
consider the sample of Weights the mean
value is 140 When you subtract the
individual values from the mean take the
Square value of the results and then
take the average of the squared
differences you will get 1,9 936 as the
sample variance this number is not
useful as it is in order to get the
standard deviation take the square root
of the sample variance square otk of
1936 =
44 the standard deviation in combination
with the mean will tell you how much the
majority of the people weigh in this
example if your mean is 140 and your
variance is 44 you can conclude that the
majority of people weigh between 96 lb
mean minus 44 and 184 lb mean plus
44 let us proceed to the next screen
that focuses on the analysis of variance
or a NOA which is the comparison of more
than two
means a t test is used for one sample
two sample tests are used for comparing
two means to compare the means of more
than two samples use the Anova method
Anova stands for analysis of variance
Anova does not tell the better mean it
helps in understanding that all the
sample means are not equal the
short-listed samples based on Anova
output can further be tested one
important aspect of Anova is it
generalizes the T Test to include more
than two samples performing multiple two
sample T tests would increase the chance
of committing a type type one error
hence anovas is useful in comparing two
or more means the next screen will help
in understanding this concept through an
example as an example consider the
takeaway food delivery time of three
different Outlets is there any evidence
that the averages for the three Outlets
are not equal in other words can the
delivery time be benchmarked on the
outlet the null hypothesis will assume
that the three means are equal if the
null hypothesis is rejected it would
mean that there are at least two outlets
that are different in their average
delivery
time in mini tab one can perform a Nova
in one of the statistics packages ensure
that the data of the table is stacked in
two columns in the main menu go to stat
Anova and then one way the left column
of the table will have the outlets and
the right column will have the time in
minutes this is similar to to the table
shown on the screen in the one-way
analysis of variance window select the
response as delivery time and Factor as
outlet and click
okay the output of this process is shown
here notice the P value which is much
higher than
0.05 the steps to perform a Nova in
Excel are as follows after entering the
data to a spreadsheet select the Inova
single Factor test from the data
analysis tool pack select the array for
analysis designate that the data is in
columns and select an output
range Excel shows the descriptive
statistics for each column in the top
table in the second table the Anova
analysis shows whether the variation is
greater between the groups or within the
groups it shows the sum of squares or SS
degrees of freedom DF means of squares
Ms or sum of squares divided n minus one
or variance the F statistic Ms between
divided Ms within P value and F critical
from a reference table the F and P are
calculated for the variation that occurs
within each of the groups and between
the groups if the conditions in the
groups are significant it would be
expected to see the between groups SS
much higher and the MS slightly higher
let us now interpret the mini tab Anova
results since the p value is more than
0.05 the null hypothesis is accepted
this means there is no significant
difference between means of delivery
time for the three Outlets based on the
confidence intervals it is found that
the intervals overlap which means there
is little that separates the means of
the three samples in oneway an NOA where
there was only one factor to be bench
marked that is the outlet of delivery if
there are two factors you may use the
two-way
Anova in this screen we will learn in
detail about Kai Square
distribution the Ki Square distribution
is one of the most widely used
probability distributions in inferential
statistics it is also known as
hypothesis testing and the distribution
is used in hypothesis tests when used in
hypothesis test needs one sample for the
test to be conducted the kai Square
distribution is also known as Kai
squared it has K1 degrees of freedom and
is the distribution of a sum of the
squares of K independent standard normal
random variables suppose in a field four
nine players player one comes in and can
choose amongst all nine positions
available player two can choose only
amongst eight and so on after all the
eight players have chosen their
positions the last player gets to choose
the last position left the eight players
are free to choose in a playing field of
nine 8 is the degree of freedom for this
example conventionally degree of freedom
is N1 where n is the sample size for
example if WX y and z are four random
variables with standard normal
distributions the random variable F
which is the sum of w s x square Y sare
and Z Square has a Ki Square
distribution the degrees of freedom of
the distribution or the DF equals the
number of normally distributed variables
used in this case DF equals 4 the
formula for KI squ distribution is shown
on the screen it is important to note
that F of O stands for an observed
frequency and F of e stands for an
expected
frequency the next screen will explain
Ki Square test through an
example suppose the Australian hockey
team wishes to analyze its wins at home
and abroad against four different
countries the data has two
classifications and the table is also
known as a 2x4 contingency table with
two rows and four columns the expected
frequencies can be calculated assuming
there is a
relationship thus expected frequency for
each of the observed frequency is equal
to product of row total and column total
divided by overall total one has to find
out how to calculate the expected
frequency if the observed frequency is
three wins against South Africa in
Australia then it would convert to Total
wins at home which is 21 divided by the
total number of winds or 31 and is the
result multiplied by five the result is
3.39 similarly the expected population
parameters for all cases are
found in this step all the information
of the previous screen is combined and
the table is populated the estimated
population parameters are calculated and
added the formula estimates The observed
frequency to calculate the final Kai
Square index which in this case is
1.36 it is important to note that there
is a different Kai squar distribution
for each of the different numbers of
degrees of freedom for the kai Square
distribution the degrees of freedom are
calculated as per the number of rows and
columns in the contingency table the
equation for degrees of freedom should
be noticed the number of degrees of
freedom is equal to three assuming an
alpha of 10% the Ki Square distribution
in the Ki Square table is noticed and a
critical Ki Square index of 6251 is
arrived at KI Square calculated value is
1.36
both the values of the Ki Square index
should be plotted the critical Ki Square
distribution divides the whole region
into acceptance and rejection while the
calculated Ki Square distribution is
based on data and conveys whether the
data falls into an acceptance or
rejection region therefore as the
calculated value is less than the
critical value and falls in the
acceptance region the proportion of wins
of the aie team at home home or abroad
has nothing to do with the opponent
being played against let us proceed to
the next topic of this lesson in the
next screen in this topic we will learn
in detail about hypothesis testing with
nonnormal data let us begin with the man
Whitney test in the next
screen the man Whitney test also known
as the will coxen rank Su test is a
non-parametric test which is used to
compare two unpaired groups in this test
the value of alpha is by default set at
0.05 and the rejection and acceptance
condition Remains the Same for different
cases that is if p is less than Alpha
reject the null hypothesis if p is
greater than Alpha reject the alternate
hypothesis the aim of this test is to
rank the entire data available for each
condition and then compare the total
outcome of the two ranks click the
button to know the steps to perform the
mon Whitney
test to perform the mon Whitney test
first rank all the values from low to
high without paying any attention to the
group to which each value belongs the
smallest number gets a rank of one the
largest number gets a rank of n where n
is the total number of values in the two
groups if there are ties continue to
rank the values anyway pretending they
are slightly different then find the
average of the ranks for all the
identical values and assign that rank to
all these values continue this till all
the whole number ranks have been used
next sort the values into two groups
these can now be used for the mon
Whitney U test summate the ranks for the
observations from sample one and then
summate the ranks in Sample two larger
group let us look at an example of the
mon Whitney test in this screen suppose
you have two sets of data G1 and G2 the
G1 values are 14 2 5 16 and 9 and the G2
values are 4 2 18 14 and8 now combine
the G1 and G2 values sort them in
ascending order and mention the group
name against each value next rank the
groups from 1 to 10 and check if any
value Val are identical take an average
of the ranks of the identical values and
place it against the identical values in
the final rank column hence the average
final rank is 1.5 for ranks 1 and two
similarly the average final rank is 7.5
for ranks s and 8 next calculate R1 and
R2 by adding the ranks of the groups 1
and two respectively in this example the
R1 value is 28 and R2 value is 27 from
the given data five is the value of both
N1 and
N2 the formula for the man Whitney U
test for N1 and N2 values is U1 = N1 *
N2 + N1 * N1 + 1 / 2 - R1 similarly U2 =
N1 * n2+ N2 MTI N2 + 1 whole / 2 - R2 in
this example the value of U1 is 12 and
U2 is 13 now the U value can be
calculated by taking the minimum value
among 12 and 13 which is 12 look up the
mon Whitney U test table for N1 = 5 and
N2 = 5 you will get the critical value
of U as two to be statistically
significant the obtained U has to be
equal to or less than this critical
value our calculated value of U is 12
which is not less than two that means
there is no statistical difference
between the means of the two groups in
this screen we will learn about the
crcll Wallace test the crcll Wallace
test is named after William crcll and W
Allen Wallace it is also a nonparametric
test used for testing the source of
origin of samples for example whether
the samples originate from the same
distribution or not the characteristics
of the crusco Wallace test are as
follows it is the only way to analyze
variants by ranks this test compares the
medians of two or more samples to find
out if the samples are from different
populations since this test is a
nonparametric method it does not assume
the normal distribution of the residuals
unlike the analogous one way analysis of
variant for this test the null
hypothesis is that the medians of all
groups are equal and the alternate
hypothesis is that at least one
population median of one group is
different from the population median of
at least one other group let us learn
about the mood's median in the next
screen the moods median is also a
nonparametric test that is used to test
the equality of medians from two or more
different
populations this test works when the
output y variable is continuous and
discrete ordinal or discrete count while
the input X variable is discrete with
two or more attributes click the button
to view the steps involved in the mood's
median
test following are the steps in the
mood's median test first find the median
of the combined data set next find the
number of values in each sample that are
greater than the median and form a
contingency table then find the expected
value for each cell and finally find the
kai Square
value we will learn about the fredman
test in this screen the fredman test is
another form of a nonparametric test it
does not make any assumptions about the
specific shape of the population from
which the sample is drawn and therefore
allows smaller sample data sets to be
analyzed unlike an NOA the Freedman test
does not require the data set to be
randomly sampled from normally
distributed populations with equal
variances this test uses a two-tailed
hypothesis test where the null
hypothesis is that the population
medians of each treatment are
statistically identical to the rest of
the group in the next screen we will
learn about the one sample sign
test the one sample sign test is the
simplest of all the non-parametric test
that can be used instead of a one sample
T Test it is similar to the concept of
testing if a coin is fair in showing
heads or tails here the null hypothesis
represented as ho is the hypothecated
median or assumed median of the sample
which belongs to the population click
the button to view the steps involved in
the one sample sign
test following are the steps in a one
sample sign test
first count the number of positive
values these are the values that are
larger than the hypothesized median next
count the number of negative values
these are the values that are smaller
than the hypothesized median finally
test the values to check if there are
significantly more positive values or
negative values than
expected this screen will focus on the
one sample will coxen test the one
sample will coxen test also known as The
Wil coxen signed rank test is another
form of a non-parametric test this test
is equivalent to the parametric one
sample T Test and more powerful than the
non-parametric one sample sign test let
us discuss the characteristics of this
test in the following screen some of the
characteristics of this test are as
follows this test assumes that the
sample is randomly taken from a
population with a symmetric fre
frequency distribution around the median
also in this test the Symmetry can be
observed with a histogram or by checking
if the median and mean are approximately
equal the conclusion in this test is
that if the value is on the midpoint you
can continue and accept the null
hypothesis if not you need to reject the
alternate hypothesis click the button
given on the screen to view an
example let us consider an example
the median customer satisfaction score
of an organization has always been
3.7 and the management wants to see if
this has changed they conduct a survey
and get the results grouped by the
customer type the conclusion will be as
follows if the median value is 3.7 the
null hypothesis ho can be accepted if
not the alternate hypothesis needs to be
rejected the alpha value will be 0. 05

will focus on the improved phase of the
dmac process the improve phase comes
after the analyze phase in the analyze
phase the data was analyzed and some
patterns were found to identify where
the problem
lies design of experiments or doe
consists of a series of planned and
scientific experiments that test various
input variables and their eventual
impact on the output variable design of
experiments can be used as a One-Stop
alternative for analyzing all
influencing factors to arrive at a
successful model doe is applicable where
multiple input variables known as
factors affect a single response
variable an output variable is the
variable which may get affected due to
multiple input variables doe is
preferred over one factor at a time or
ofat experiments because it does not
miss
interactions with techniques like
blocking experimental error can be
eliminated the trials should be
randomized to avoid concluding that a
factor is significant when the time at
which it is measured or the sequence
followed may have influenced the
response's result an example of blocking
is highlighted in the table given on the
screen with techniques like replication
many experiments can be conducted to
ensure a robust model we will understand
the concept of design experiments
through an example in the upcoming
screen to understand doe and the main
effects consider the following example
suppose the objective of the experiment
is to achieve uniform part Dimensions at
a particular Target value to reduce
variations the inputs X or factors that
affect the output are cycle time time
mold temperature holding pressure
holding time and material type the
process is the molding process and the
output or the response of the experiment
is the part hardness the components of
the doe in this example will be
described in the next
screen output response factors levels
and interactions are the components of
the doe in the given example click each
component to learn more
the response variable is the part
hardness and is measured as a result of
the experiment and is used to judge the
effects of
factors factors of this experimental
setup are cycle time mold temperature
holding pressure holding time and
material
type factors can be varied and are
called levels the molding temperature
can be set at 600° fah or 700° F plastic
type can be filters and no filters and
the material type has two levels of
nylon or
acetal interactions refer to the degree
to which factors depend on one another
some experiments evaluate the effect of
interactions in the molding example the
interaction between cycle time and
molding temperature is critical the best
level for time depends on what
temperature is set if the temperature
level is higher the cycle time may have
to be decreased to achieve the same
response from the
experiment let us understand full
factorial experiments through an example
full factorial experimental design
contains all combinations of all levels
of all factors this experimental design
ensures no possible treatment
combinations get omitted hence full
factorial designs are often preferred
over other designs
the table shown here is for a two-way
heat treatment experiment there are two
factors oven time X2 and the temperature
X1 at which the material is drawn out of
the oven the output y of the experiment
is the hardness of the material each of
the factors has two levels this example
illustrates the concepts of main factor
and interaction effects from the table
it is clear that without repetition the
experiment will have four different
outcomes based on the changes in levels
of factors each experimental trial here
is repeated to give a total of eight
values let us now analyze the mean
effect an analysis of the means helps in
understanding how a change in
temperature at which the material is
drawn creates a difference in the
average part hardness this affects the
output and is called the main effect
analysis of means also tells how how a
change in oven time creates a difference
in the average part hardness this is
also the main effect analysis of means
explains how interaction between
temperature and time affects the average
part hardness this is known as the
interaction
effect let us next understand the
concept of main effect for calculating
the main effect the means have to be
calculated hence to calculate the main
effect of draw temperature the mean of
the hardness values has to be calculated
the values are populated in the
corresponding Columns of draw
temperatures The Columns have been
labeled A1 and A2 the value of the mean
of A1 is 91 and of A2 is
82 plotting the data on a graph shows
that changing draw temperatures changes
the average hardness similarly we
calculate the mean of hardness values in
B1 and B2 the values are 87 and 86 which
are plotted on a graph it can be seen
that changing the oven time does not
affect the average
hardness now let us understand how the
interaction between temperature and time
affects the average part hardness to
check how draw temperature and oven time
interact the mean values are calculated
by taking the repetition response hence
the cell A1 B1 has the mean of the
values 90 and 87 the cell A2 B1 has the
mean of the values 84 and
87 after the mean values are calculated
they are plotted on a graph the graph
shows that to reduce interactions low
temperature and high oven time should be
selected to have the desired output of
high hardness also called brenel
hardness if low hardness is the desired
output the experimental setup should
have High draw temperature and high oven
time the ideal case is represented by
the parallel lines which give the
desired output based on the main effect
without being affected by the
interaction between the factors the
parallel lines are shown as a dotted
line the mean of the factors are also
calculated and shown in the small
table in this we will introduce the
concept of runs in design of experiments
the numbers of experiments in a doe
setting is known as runs a full
factorial experiment without replication
on five factors and two levels is 2 ra
to the power of 5 which equals 32 runs a
full factorial experiment with one
replication on five factors and two
levels is 32 + 32 which equals 64 runs a
half fractional factorial experiment
without replication on five factors and
two levels is 2 raed to the^ of 5 - 1
which equals 16 runs a half factorial
experiment with one replication on five
factors and two levels is 16 + 16 which
equals 32 runs the number of
combinations can be determined using the
formula L to the power of f where L is
the number of levels and F is the number
of factors half fractional factorial is
calculated using the formula l the^ F
minus1 at three levels five factors full
factorial experiment would amount to 243
trials and half factorial experiments
would require 81 trials the difference
between full factorial and half
fractional factorial experiments can be
seen from the number of runs let us
proceed to the next topic of this lesson
in the following
screen in this topic we will discuss
root cause analysis in detail we will
learn about residuals analysis in the
following
screen while performing the regression
analysis of a linear or nonlinear model
you will get a model with the predicted
values some of the data might fit within
that model whereas others may be
scattered across the model equation
predicts one value for Y at level X
however the actual value for y observed
at that level of X is different from the
predicted value this difference between
the observed value of the dependent
variable Y and the predicted value is
called residual the formula to calculate
residual is observed value minus
predicted value residuals are considered
to be errors and each data point has one
residual you can validate the
assumptions on random errors as they are
independent exhibit normal distribution
have a constant various Sigma Square for
all all the settings of the independent
variables and finally have a mean as
zero in the next slide we will continue
to discuss residuals
analysis as discussed in the previous
screen while performing any regression
analysis you will observe that not all
the data fits into the linear model as
the linear regression model is not
always appropriate for the data
therefore you should assess the
appropriateness of the model by defining
residual
and examining the residual plots if all
assumptions are satisfied the residuals
should randomly vary around zero and the
spread of the residuals should be the
same throughout the plot that is no
systematic patterns are observed
remember in residuals analysis both the
sum and the mean of the residuals are
zero residuals and diagnostic statistics
allow you to identify patterns that
either poorly fit in the model with a
strong influence on the estimated
parameters or have a high leverage it is
helpful to interpret these Diagnostics
together to understand any potential
problems with the model in the next
screen we will learn about data
transformation using the Box Cox method
the available data must be transformed
when it does not exhibit the normal
distribution box and Cox in the year
1964 developed a procedure for
estimating the best transformation to
normality within the family of power
transformation it works by taking the
current Y data and raising it to the
power known as Lambda the formula for
transformation of Y is represented as y
asteris equal y to the power Lambda
minus one the whole divided by Lambda
this formula is used where the value of
Lambda is not zero if the value of
Lambda is zero you can use natural
logarithm to transform y the family of
power Transformations can be used for
the following for converting a data set
so that parametric statistics can be
used here Lambda is a parameter to be
defined from the data for any continuous
data greater than zero this will not
work when the values are less than or
equal to zero transforming specs note
that the use of the transformation does
not guarantee
normality in the next screen we will
continue the discussion on data
transformation using box and
Coxs the table on the screen shows how
the data can be transformed using Lambda
the First Column lists down values of
Lambda and the second column shows the
transformed value if the value of Lambda
is -2 it becomes y ^ -2 after the
transformation which is 1 / Y 2
similarly if the value of Lambda is1
after transformation it becomes y to
the^ power of1 which is 1 / Y and so on
note that you will use a different
formula when you have the value of
Lambda as zero wherein you will take
natural log of the value y similarly
transformed values are also shown on the
screen click the example button to know
more Let us look at an example of how
data transformation is done using box
coocks the difference between original
data and the data transformed using box
Cox is shown on the screen figure one
shows the original data plotted on a
histogram here you can see that this
data is abnormal in figure two the box
and Cox procedure is applied on the
original data and it is
transformed you can see that the data in
the second figure is more normal than
figure one let us learn about process
input and output variables in the
following
screen process Improvement has a few
prerequisites before a process can be
improved it must first be measured to
assess the level of improvement required
the first step is to know the input
variables and output variables and check
for any
relationship the sipoc map and the cause
and effect Matrix are very helpful there
are many ways to measure the key process
variables metrics such as the percent
defective operation cost elapse time
backlog quantity and documentation
errors can be used critical variables
are best identified by the process
owners once they are identified cause
and effect tools are used to establish
the relationship between variables a
cause and effect Matrix is shown on the
screen the key process input variables
have been listed vertically and the key
process output variables horizontally
for each of the output variables a
prioritization number is assigned
numbers which reflect the effect of each
input variable on the output variable
are entered in the
Matrix the process output priority is
Multiplied with the input variables to
arrive at the results for each input
variable the values are added to
determine the results for each input
variable for process input variable one
the output variables are 3 4 and 7 with
a prioritization value of 4 7 and 11
respectively therefore multiplying the
output variables with their
corresponding prioritization numbers and
adding those gives
117 which is around 33% of the total
effect the process input variables
results are compared to each other to
determine which input variable has the
greatest effect on the output variables
click the cause and effect Matrix
template button to view another template
a sample of the cause effect Matrix or C
Matrix is shown here the C Matrix gives
the correlation between input and output
variables in this grade we will discuss
the steps to update the C Matrix the
steps for updating the cause and effect
Matrix are list the input variables
vertically under the column process
inputs list the output variables
horizontally under the numbers 1 to 15
these output variables are important
from the customer's perspective one can
refer to either the qfd or the ctq tree
to know the key output variables rank
the output variables based on customer
priority these numbers can also be taken
from the
qfd the input variables with the highest
score become the point of focus in the
project another method to establish the
cause effect relation is the cause and
effect effect diagram this is explained
in detail in the following screen the
cause and effect diagram is used to find
the root cause and the potential
solutions to a problem a cause and
effect diagram breaks down a problem
into bite-sized pieces and also displays
the possible causes in a graphic manner
it is also known as the fishbone the 4M
or the ishakawa diagram it is commonly
used to examine effects or problems to
find out the possible causes and to
indicate the possible areas to collect
data the steps involved in the cause and
effect diagram are all the possible
causes of the problem or effects
selected for analysis are
brainstormed the major causes are
classified under the headings of
materials methods machinery and
Manpower the cause and effect diagram is
drawn with the problem at the point of
the Central Access line and the causes
on the diagram are written under the
classifications chosen the next screen
illustrates the cause and effect diagram
with the help of an
example the diagram shows the cause and
effect diagram for the possible causes
of solder defects on a Reflow soldering
Line This diagram helps in collecting
data and discovering the root cause
during brainstorming the group looked at
all the major causes and then grouped
them under the main headings under
materials causes like types of solder
paste components and the components
packaging used are considered the major
causes under methods are technology and
preventive maintenance similarly
operator and schedule are placed under
Manpower while tools and oven are
grouped under Machinery causes the next
screen will discuss another root cause
analysis tool in
detail 5y is one of of the tools used to
analyze the root cause of a problem the
responsibility of the root cause
analysis lies with the 5y analysis team
the technical experts have a great
responsibility as the conclusion will be
drawn from the way the drill down of the
symptoms is carried out the 5y is a very
simple tool as it poses the Y question
to every problem till the root cause is
obtained it is important to know that
the 5y tool does not restrict the
interrogation to five questions y can be
asked as many times as required till the
root cause for the problem is found it
can be used along with the cause and
effect diagram the following screen will
explain the process of the 5y
technique the process for the fivey
technique is identify the problem and
emphasize the problem statement arrange
for a brainstorming session with the
team including subject matter experts
process owners and team members explain
the purpose and the problem statement
analyze scenarios working backwards from
the problem ask why for the answers
obtained until the root cause is found
normally reasons like insufficient
resources and time become the root
causes if the drill down in
brainstorming is carried out in the
right direction it is often found that
the root cause is related to the process
therefore the occurrence of a problem is
often due to the process and not an
individual or a team in the next screen
we will understand the concept of the
fivey technique with the help of an
example the process for the fivey
technique is identify the problem and
emphasize the problem statement arrange
for a brainstorming session with the
team including subject matter matter
experts process owners and team members
explain the purpose and the problem
statement analyze scenarios working
backwards from the problem ask why for
the answers obtained until the root
cause is found normally reasons like
insufficient resources and time become
the root causes if the drill down in
brainstorming is carried out in the
right direction it is often found that
the root cause is is related to the
process therefore the occurrence of a
problem is often due to the process and
not an individual or a team in the next
screen we will understand the concept of
the fivey technique with the help of an
example in this topic we will discuss
lean Tools in detail let us learn about
lean techniques in the following
screen the eight lean techniques are
Kaizen pooke 5S just in time can ban
jidoka Tac time and hunka click each
technique to know
more Kaizen or continuous Improvement is
the building block of all lean
production methods Kaizen philosophy
implies that all incremental changes
routinely applied and sustained over a
long period of time results in
significant
improvements the second technique is
pooka it is is also known as mistak
proofing it is good to do it right the
first time and even better to make it
impossible to do it wrong the first time
the prompt received to save the word
document before closing it without
saving is an example of
pooka 5S is a set of five Japanese words
which translate to sort set in order
shine standardize and sustain this is a
simple and yet powerful tool of lean the
sort principle refers to sorting items
according to a rule the rule could be
frequency of use or time of use after
sorting the objects are set in order the
place for everything is defined and
everything is placed accordingly
cleaning of the area refers to the shine
principle the fourth step requires
formation and circulation of a set of
written standards the last step refers
to sustaining the process
by following the standards set earlier
5S is useful as a framework to create
and maintain the
workplace just in time or jit is another
lean technique this technique
philosophizes about producing the
necessary units in the necessary
quantity at the necessary time with the
required quality as an item is removed
from a shelf of a supermar the system
confirms it and automat automatically
sends a note for
replenishment this kind of technique can
be used in an organization to prevent
accumulation of
inventory the fifth technique is known
as Canan which means signboard in
Japanese Canan utilizes visual display
cards to Signal movement of material
between the steps of a product process
this is one of the examples of visual
control in
Lane the next technique is Juka
it means automation with human touch and
is sometimes known as autonomation Juka
implements supervisory function in the
production line and stops the process as
soon as a defect is encountered the
process does not start again till the
root cause of the defect is
eliminated tact time is the maximum time
in which the customer demands need to be
met for example a customer needs 100
products and the company has 420 minutes
of available production time tact time
equals time available divided by demand
in this case the company has a maximum
of 4.2 minutes per product this will be
the target for the production
line the final technique is henka which
means production leveling and smoothing
it is a technique to reduce waste
occurring due to fluctuating customer
demand let us understand the concept of
cycle time reduction in this screen
cycle time reduction refers to the
reduction in the time taken for a
complete process implementing lean
techniques reduces cycle time and
releases resources faster than any other
method low cycle time increases
productivity and throughput lean
techniques release resources early
achieving more production with the same
Machinery internal and external waste is
reduced and the oper operational process
is simplified with a decrease in product
damage all these factors help in
satisfying the customer and staying
ahead in
competition the following screen
describes the concept of cycle time
reduction through an
example the changes brought by
implementing lean techniques on an
existing process are Illustrated in the
given diagram things to be noticed are
number of operators used work allocation
to The Operators path or the movement in
the process and flow of the process
notice the changes brought about by
implementing lean techniques on the old
process first the path followed by the
material in between the process is
considerably reduced this decreases the
cycle time for the entire process second
the number of operators is reduced to
three when compared to five in the old
process operator one can now work on
process one and process 4 similarly
Operator 2 can work on process 2 and
process 3 hence there is an increased
productivity of The Operators and the
remaining skilled operators can be used
in some other process or system the next
screen will introduce the concept of
Kaizen and Kaizen Blitz Kaizen means
good change in Japanese Kaizen is a
continuous Improvement method to improve
the functions of an organization the
improvements could be in process
productivity quality Technology and
Safety it brings in small incremental
changes to the process Kaizen Blitz is
known as Kaizen event or Kaizen Workshop
if the event is tightly defined and the
scope is evident for implementation
processes can be easily changed and
improved teams could improve processes
through creative problemsolving methods
in structured workshops over a short
time scale the the next screen will
provide the differences between Kaizen
and Kaizen
Blitz the differences between Kaizen and
kizen Blitz are Kaizen is a method that
brings continuous Improvement in the
organization while Kaizen Blitz is a
workshop or an event that brings in
change Kaizen brings in small
incremental changes in the organization
there are no major changes made within
the processes kizen Blitz is applied
when a rapid solution is required the
Kaizen method follows a stepbystep
process it standardizes measures and
compares the process with the
requirement before improving it kayen
Blitz plans for the event executes it
arrives at a solution and follows it
through all the people of the
organization are involved in Kaizen
whereas Kaizen Blitz is led by the top
management and others are invited to
participate the decision- making lies
with the upper management in Kaizen the
process is standardized and measurements
are regularly collected and compared
before the decision is taken this
relatively delays the process of
decision- making in Kaizen Blitz
decisions are taken soon and the process
change is wrapped in 3 to 5 days Kaizen
is a continuous Improvement method
whereas the kaiz and Blitz is part of
the improving process Kaizen follows
pdca in essence plan do and check and
act for the improvement process kis and
Blitz uses pdca for execution where the
events are planned conducted decided
implemented and followed up the
following screen will elaborate on the
concepts of Kaizen and Kaizen Blitz
through
examples Kaizen and Kaizen Blitz are
practiced in many organizations across
the world the example examples of Kaizen
and Kaizen Blitz method are shown here
click each tab to know
more the Toyota production system is
known for kizen practices in Toyota if
any issue arises in the production line
the line Personnel cease all the
production until the issue is resolved
once the solution is implemented the
team resumes the production
cycle a wood window company in the state
of Iowa us uses the Kaizen Blitz method
to redesign their shop floor and replace
expensive non-flexible automation with
lowcost highly flexible cell
applications eliminating scraps
reorganizing work areas and reducing
inventory are some of the examples of
quick implementation through kaizan
Blitz the term lean refers to creating
more value to customers with fewer
resources it means reducing unwanted
activities or processes
that do not add value to the product or
service for the customer the lean
philosophy is to provide perfect value
to the customer through a perfect value
creation process that has zero
waste while the ultimate goal is to
achieve zero waste you may not always
get that in the first couple of tries
however you will achieve minimum waste
and continue to move toward zero waste
eventually hence lean is the path
towards Perfection lean is about
optimizing the process from beginning to
end eliminating non-value adding
activities n vas and increasing flow to
ensure that parts and services are
provided to customers more quickly if
quality is the word to describe Six
Sigma then speed is the word to describe
lean let's understand the importance of
lean there are many benefits of lean and
some of them are reduce cost reduce
cycle time more throughput and increase
productivity
despite all of these benefits lean is
not implemented by most of the
organizations because of the
misconception that it is only suited in
manufacturing areas the reason for this
misconception is the beginning of lean
it began and grew in popularity in the
manufacturing areas starting with Toyota
in recent years one can notice more
applications of lean and other areas
such as Healthcare and the transactional
space however the truth is that lean
Concepts can be applied in any business
and in any process on the next screen
let's discuss how lean and Six Sigma
combine lean and Six Sigma are two
different principles or methodologies
that combine to form and create one
powerful continuous Improvement
methodology they have various
overlapping goals toward the improvement
with the aim of creating the most
efficient system though the approaches
are different the methods complement
each other
lean Six Sigma takes the power and rigor
of Six Sigma methodology and combines it
with lean Concepts leading to faster
results better quality and improved
customer
satisfaction let's look at the
differences between lean and Six Sigma
lean focuses on efficiency by
identifying value from the customer's
point of view removing unnecessary steps
in the process and improving process
speed or velocity on the other hand Six
Sigma focuses on Effectiveness with the
help of breakthrough processes
identifying root causes and reduction
and
variation therefore when Six Sigma is
combined with lean it is possible to
achieve business
transformation so remember Leen is about
speed with a focus on efficiency Six
Sigma is about quality with a focus on
effectivess and lean Six Sigma brings
the best of both together to yield a
better result
first Implement lean to streamline the
process this helps to understand the
chronic problems and the ways to handle
them quickly once the problem is
identified use S Sigma methodology to
analyze the issues and provide business
Improvement transformation in other
words lean is used to reduce the waste
and S Sigma is used to reduce the
variation hello everyone Welcome to our

course link is added in the description
box below so make sure you check that
out now before we discuss some important
Six Sigma interview questions firstly
let us understand what Six Sigma is now
Six Sigma is a data driven methodology
and set of tools aimed at improving
business processes by minimizing defects
reducing variation and achieving near
perfect levels of quality and efficiency
now it involves rigorous analysis
statistical techniques and a structured
problem approach to identify
improvements and maintain control over
processes well it sounds too technical
right so let's just understand in a
simple way now imagine you at a bakery
and you want to eat your favorite and
most delicious cupcakes but sometimes
the cupcakes may come out too dry or
maybe too sweet sometimes very much
frustrating right now well Six Sigma is
like having a secret recipe to ensure
you bake the best cupcakes every single
time it's a special approach that helps
businesses reduce mistakes and improve
quality in their processes with Six
Sigma you measure everything precisely
and analyze data to find the root Cross
of the problems then with this knowledge
at your disposal you make improvements
and setup controls to prevent those
mistakes from happening again so without
any further Ado let us directly discuss
some of the major interview questions
that you might face in your next
interview on Six Sigma so first on the
list we have what is Six Sigma and why
it is important now Six Sigma is a data
driven approach and methodology for
process Improvement and problem solving
it is a discipline and statistical
approach to process Improvement that
focuses on reducing defects and
variability it utilizes various tools
and techniques to identify and eliminate
the root causes of the problem so the
main aim of Six Sigma is to minimize
defects and variation in business
processes to high levels of quality and
efficiency in order to achieve them now
the second question is can you explain
the key principles of Six Sigma now the
key principles of Six Sigma include
various methodologies like customer
focus process Improvement data driven
decision making and teamwork now
customer focus means understanding and
meeting customer needs and expectations
process Improvement involves a
systematically analyzing and enhancing
business processes data driven decision
making emphasizes the use of statistical
analysis and metrics to drive decisions
and finally teamwork promotes
collaboration and involvement of all
stakeholders in process Improvement
efforts now the next question is what do
you understand about the term
dmic another crucial question in the
concept of Six Sigma now dmaic is a
structured problem solving methodology
used in Six Sigma projects it stands for
Define measure analyze improve and
control so it is a step-by-step approach
for process Improvement it begins with
defining the problem and project goals
followed by measuring current process
performance and collecting data now the
next steps involves analyzing the data
to identify root cause of the problems
and implementing solutions to improve
the process and finally establishing
controls to sustain the improvements Al
together confined as dmic so the next
question is what is the purpose of using
statistical Tools in Six Sigma now
statistical tools are used in Sig Sigma
to analyze data identify patterns
measure process performance and make
data driven decisions these tools
provide a systematic and objective
approach to analyzing data and making
informed decisions they help in
identifying Trends patterns and
relationships within the data which can
guide process Improvement efforts now
some of the examples of statistical
tools used in Six Sigma include control
charts hypothesis testing process
mapping parator charts regression
analysis design of experiments or doe
next question on the list we have is
explain difference between dpu and dpmo
now dpu or defects per unit measures the
average number of defects per individual
unit while defects per million
opportunities or dpmo measures the
number of defects per 1 million
opportunities dpu is a simple measure
that counts the average number of
defects found in each unit of a process
it is calculated by dividing the total
number of defects by the total number of
units well on the other hand dpmo is a
normalized measure that provides a
standardized way of comparing defect
Rays across different processes or
organizations it is calculated by
multiplying dpu by 1 million and
dividing by the total number of
opportunities for defects in a process
so those are some of the main
differences between dpu and dpmo well
the next question on the list we have is
what is the difference between Six Sigma
and lean now the interview wants to know
whether you have a proper knowledge on
how lean and Six Sigma different from
each other and this is why they might be
asking you this question so the answer
for that would be while both Six Sigma
and lean aim to improve process
performance Six Sigma focuses on
reducing defects and variation whereas
lean focuses on eliminating waste and
improving flow now Six Sigma and lean
are two complimentary methodologies
often used together in process
Improvement efforts Six Sigma primarily
aims at reducing defects errors and
variability in processes by lean focuses
on identifying and eliminating waste and
nonv value added activities to improve
efficiency and flow while both
methodologies share common tools and
principles and can be used in
conjunction to achieve even greater
results so these were some of the main
differences between Six Sigma and lean
well moving ahead the next question on
our list is what is the role of a Six
Sigma Green Belt now a Six Sigma Green
Belt is a team member who assists in
process Improvement projects gathers and
analyzes data and participates in
problem solving efforts so basically a
Six Sigma Green Belt is a trained
individual who works as a part of a Six
Sigma project team they support the
project leader that is black belt in
gathering and analyzing data conducting
process analysis and implementing
Improvement Solutions green belts often
lead smaller scale Improvement projects
and play a vital role in implementing
and sustaining process changes so so
moving ahead the next question on our
list is what is the main difference
between type 1 and type two errors in
hypothesis testing well type 1 errors
occurs when a null hypothesis is
incorrectly rejected indicating a
insignificant effect when none exists
whereas type two error occurs when a
null hypothesis is incorrectly accepted
failing to detect a significant effect
now in hypothesis testing typon error
which is also called as an alpha error
refers to the rejection of a null
hypothesis when it is actually true well
this error indicates a false positive
result suggesting that there is a
significant effect when in reality there
is it now type two error on the other
hand is also called a beta error occurs
when the null hypothesis is accepted
despite it being false now this error
indicates a false negative result
failing to detect a significant effect
that exist in reality when there is
actually one in reality so moving ahead
the next question we have is what is
process map and how it is useful in Sig
Sigma now a process map is a visual
representation of steps activities and
inputs outputs of a process it basically
helps in understanding and analyzing
process flow identifying inefficiencies
and finding areas for improvement now a
process map which is also known as a
process flow chart or a process diagram
provides a graphical representation of
the sequence of steps in a process it
helps in documenting and understanding
the flow of activities inputs and
outputs within a process now process
maps are useful tools in Sig Sigma for
identifying bottlenecks redundancies and
non-value added steps which enable
process teams to visualize the current
state identify any Improvement
opportunities and develop future state
maps for process optimization well the
next question on the list is explain
what is FMEA and its purpose now the
purpose of conducting an FMEA is to
proactively identify and prioritize
potential failures in a process or
product determine their effects and take
preventive or corrective actions the
full form of FMEA is defined as failure
mode and effect analysis which is a
systematic method used to identify and
analyze potential failure modes in a
process or product assess their sity
occurrence and detectability and
prioritize them based on their risk now
FMEA helps in understanding the
potential consequences of failures
identifying the root causes and taking
appropriate actions to prevent or
mitigate the risks associated with these
kind of failures all right moving ahead
the next question on our list is what is
the concept of Sigma level and Six Sigma
now Sigma level is a statistical metric
that measures the capability of a
process to perform defect free work it
indicates the number of standard
aviations that can fit within the
specification limits so you can see that
it is a measure of process performance
in terms of defects per million
opportunities or dpmo it provides an
indication of the process capability to
produce products or services within the
desire specification a higher Sigma
level indicates a higher level of
process capability and lower levels of
defects for example a process operating
at a Six Sigma level would have a defect
rate of 3.4 defects per million
opportunities well the next question
question we have is what is the purpose
of control charts in Six Sigma now
control charts are used in Six Sigma to
Monitor and Control process performance
over time detect variations and
distinguish between common cause and
special cause variations these are
basically graphical tools that help in
monitoring process performance over time
you can plot data points against control
limits to determine if the process is
stable or exhibiting special cause
variations control chats provide a
visual representation of process
variation and helping distinguish
between common cause variation and
special cause variation by analyzing
these control chart patterns process
teams can take appropriate actions to
improve process stability and reduce
variations overall so that was what
control charts are and why they are
important well the next question on a
list is explain difference between
attribute data and variable data now
attribute data is a qualitative data
that describes the presence or absence
of a particular characteristic or
attribute while variable data is
quantitative data that can be measured
on a continuous scale now attri
distribute data is collected by counting
the number of occurrences or
non-occurrences of a specific
characteristics it is typically
represented in terms of proportions
percentages or count values now example
of attribute data include number of
defects presence of absence of special
features or the number of
non-conformances while on the other hand
variable data is collected by taking
measurements on a continuous scale now
some of the examples of variable data
include length weight or temperature
variable data is typically analyzed
using numerical values such as as
calculating means ranges and standard
deviations using some parametric
statistical methods so these were some
of the main differences between
attribute data and variable data so
moving ahead the next question is what
is the purpose of conducting a process
capability analysis now the purpose of
conducting a process capability analysis
is to assess whether a process is
capable of producing outputs that Meet
customer requirements and specifications
now process capability analysis is
performed to determine if a processor is
capable of consistently meeting the
customer specifications by calculating
process capability indices such as CP
and CPK which is very important in terms
of conducting a process capability
analysis now CPK which is also know as
process capability index measures how
well a process is able to consistently
produce output within the desired
specifications it helps determine if a
process is capable of meeting customer
requirements process teams can assess
whether the process is capable of
producing within specification limits
overall process capability analysis help
in understanding the level of variation
in the process and identify areas for
improvement to achieve desired levels of
quality and finally on the list we have
what is the concept of design for Six
Sigma or dfss now design for Six Sigma
or dfss is a methodology used to develop
new products services or processes
within a focus of meeting customer
requirements and achieving high levels
of quality and performance it is a
proactive approach to product or process
development that emphasizes meeting
customer needs and achieving high levels
of quality from the outset it utilizes
various tools and techniques such as qfd
Quality Function deployment robust
design and risk analysis to ensure the
customer requirements are effectively
translated into product or process
specifications dfss aims to design
products or processes that are
inherently defect free and capable of
meeting customer requirements and
expectations thereby reducing the need
for subsequent process Improvement
efforts so these are some of the main or
top questions that might be asked in
your next Six Sigma interview questions
now apart from this you might be asked
some generic questions as well so let us
discuss them what they are now you might
be asked this question which is how can
you ensure the sustainability of Six
Sigma improvements now ensuring
sustainability of Six Sigma improvements
requires ongoing monitoring
standardization of improved processes
effective training engagement of
stakeholders and a continuous culture of
improvement well now to sustain Six
Sigma improvements it is essential to
establish controls and monitoring
systems to track process performance
over time this allows organizations to
detect any deviations or issues and take
Collective actions promptly engaging
stakeholders at all levels of
organization and creating a culture of
continuous Improvement encourages
ongoing participation and ownership of
the process regular reviews and audits
can easily help identify opportunities
for further improvements and ensure that
the gains achieved through Six Sigma are
maintained in the long run moving ahead
the next question will be what are the
benefits of implementing Six Sigma in an
organization now the interviewer wants
to know whether you have a perfect
clarity or whether you understand Six
Sigma and how you are implementing in a
real life for an organization of for
their company so you can s like this now
the benefits of implementing 6ine
organizations are numerous it helps in
improving the quality of products or
Services by reducing defects and
variability now this in turn leads to
increased customer satisfaction and
loyalty by analyzing an optimizing
processes Six Sigma helps in enhancing
process efficiency reducing cycle times
and inre increasing productivity now
improved process performance results in
cost savings waste reduction and higher
profitability and additionally Six Sigma
Fosters a culture of continuous
improvement teamw work and data decision
making which can drive Innovation
employment engagement and overall
organization success so the next
question is how would you prioritize
Improvement opportunities in a Six Sigma
project well the interviewer wants to
know that now that you have a clear
understanding of what Six Sigma is and
how you are implementing into the
project well he wants to further know
how can you further optimize Improvement
opportunities in a Sig Sigma project so
you can answer them in this way now when
prioritizing Improvement opportunities
in a Six Sigma project it is important
to consume multiple factors now the
impact on customers should be a primary
consideration as it aligns with the
organization's focus on meeting customer
needs and expectations evaluating the
potential cost savings or financial
benefits associated with the Improvement
opportunity is also very crucial
assessing the process risk or the
likelihood of it and the impact of
failures can help prioritize areas that
POS the highest risk to the business and
finally consider the feasibility of
implementing the improvements including
resource availability timeline
complexity in order to ensure that
selected opportunities can be
successfully executed so these are some
of the main generic Six Sigma interview
questions that might be asked apart from
the technical questions and with that we
