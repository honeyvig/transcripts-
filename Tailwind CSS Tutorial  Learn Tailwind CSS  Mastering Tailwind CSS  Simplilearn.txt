some of the features of Tailwind CSS so
here are some key Concepts and features
of Tailwind CSS the first one is utility
classes till when CSS offers a
comprehensive set of utility classes
that can be applied directly in your
HTML marker these classes define
specific Styles such as margins paddings
colors typography positioning and mode
the next one is automatic design
Tailwind CSS follows the automatic
design principle which encourages
composing UI Elements by combining
smaller building blocks by using utility
classes you can easily assemble and
customize components without writing
custom CSS for each individual component
the next one is responsive design
Tailwind CSS includes a responsive grid
system that allows you to create
responsive layout you can Define
different sizes and alignments for
various screen sizes using the
responsive classes like SM MD LG and
Excel next we have customization Telvin
CSS is highly customizable it provides a
configuration file where you can modify
various aspects of the framework such as
color font breakpoints and more this
allows you to tail a Tailwind CSS to
match your Project Specific design
requirements the next we have just in
time mode jid in addition to regular
mode Telvin CSS introduced a just in
time mode jit mode dynamically generates
only the CSS classes that are used in
your project resulting in a smaller
final CSS file sizes by combining these
features Telvin CSS offers a highly
flexible and efficient way to create a
custom design without writing extensive
CSS code it empowers developer to
rapidly prototype integrate and build
modern user interfaces to get started
with Tailwind CSS you can install it via
npm or include it via a CDN and then
start applying the utility classes
directly in your HTML markup Telvin CS
is highly customizable it provides a
configuration file where you can modify
various aspects of the framework now
let's move on to the demo and let's
create something from Tailwind CSS and
see how we can use it now before moving
ahead you should know HTML in CSS before
diving into this demo luckily we have
full courses on HTML and CSS the link
will be in the description box below you
can definitely check it out let's see
the dev tools that you need for this
tutorial you should have Chrome browser
and vs code in your system now let's
install npm or npx in your system also
you should have node.js to check whether
you have node.js installed in your
system or not you can just press Ctrl
tactic and this terminal will open you
can also go here to open the terminal
and new terminal okay
now here I'll write node
hyphen V to check the version of the
node so it's for me it's version 16.20
yeah you have different versions also so
it's fine let's open the Chrome and I'll
show you how to install node
.js for
Windows or Mac you can download from the
node website so if you have Windows
laptop you can install
like what type of laptop you have with
the configuration of the laptop you have
and Mac you can also install
which Mac do you have okay
so let's
move ahead
and go to visual studio code
and let's dive into this
now before moving ahead let me tell you
Tillman CA says a modern and Innovative
CSS framework that revolutionize the way
you design and build websites Telvin CA
says Embraces the utility first approach
and let me tell you about this let's
first
rate it
yeah I'll tell you what utility classes
before moving ahead okay
so when we write used to write any CSS
we used to write Dot my class we can say
and we used to give a margin like that
margin
wife name the file HTML it's CSS okay
it's fine I'm just
trying to tell you how we write it
earlier and how we now write it in
see is this okay
now earlier we used to like see a write
CSS like this my class and then we'll
give the margin of this now you would
add the classes directly to your HTML
elements like
now you can add the HTML
like this in the HTML file only inside
it div we will write a class and we'll
give that class
margin of 4
and then we'll close it now with the
help of if this Tailwind CSS
see how much code we have saved with
just one link right so this is how
Tailwind CSS works okay
so reusable classes that empowers you to
create customize and responsive design
with ease now let's install one
extension which is live server
in my system it's already installed by
Electric div
you can install it by just going here
and here you will find the button
install
just install it it will help us
to give our code in the live server okay
we don't have to save again again and
again the same Command right
okay
now moving ahead let's install the CSS
Tailwind CSS that's instantly this HTML
and let's open the terminal and here I
will write npx
third one
CSS in it this will install open the
right this will install a config file of
tail mode okay let's wait a couple of
minutes so as we can see it has
installed
created a file and import its Tailwind
CSS okay
so we need
well let's now create
now let's create
let's create here
create
and let's create another one not inside
this
let's create another one SRC
so we have created
two folders
create an SRC
so
let's go overhead
let's fix HTML
now let's create
so so many people say how we did that so
with this is the abbreviation to create
a demo of
HTML just write one exclamation mark and
just type tab okay
it will create this blank HTML for you
guys right
so you can change the name
okay
fine now our next step is to create
a folder inside this config
to tell till when where B is the HTML
file so for that inside this I'll write
slide slash and inside the create
directory
we have
a stroke or star sign with DOT HDM
right that should be in the
brackets
yep
so
let me just see it again
left it to this right wrong
save it now it will save all the HTML
file
now inside the source we'll create a
file and let's name it as input dot CSS
right
so
let's now add Tailwind
inside this
you can paste it also but
let's write it
base still in component and then when
you delete
and that will always be like that so
don't worry about that lines
okay
let's save this file now
what we are doing here is we have
created this Tailwind CSS the base
component and utility classes
so what we can do is
what this will help is whenever I'll
create write my CSS inside this it will
automatically convert our
CSS to Tailwind CSS so let's do that by
just writing a command npx
Tailwind
CSS
type to install import write dot source
inside the source there is one CSS file
this one this file so to convert that
we'll write the names
like first write this input
dot CSS
and
to open it
into the different folder which we have
created is create
and let's let's write CSS
two
okay
dot CSS
so what we are doing here is we are just
writing the source CSS file to convert
into the
Tailwind file
so let's press enter and see
Express intervention
we'll see yeah so this has created one
folder for us it's inside this folder it
has created one style so inside this
let's look at this
so this is all the Tailwind styles that
this has created for us inside this we
will find it okay
so let's just not a work on that let's
move ahead
now let's open our HTML file and here
after the title
will write
or let's import the compatibility
first with the meta it doesn't matter
but let's add it
equip
with the tax UA
you don't have to learn these lines it
will eventually know
when you learn
HTML
okay
and then
I.E
fill you this container
so let's make it till here
it doesn't matter without this line also
your code will run smoothly
so let's just show you how it is
so main thing is we'll
link the CSS
to Google HTML
that will telling him
there is called study sheet
application
of that will be CSS
Style
okay let's save it
and now inside the body we'll create one
Dev of class
DG
which is this one is
Tailwind component and style
so
we will give it a width in till when we
don't write it with you know and as I
have shown you in the utility classes
part in the earlier
okay
so we'll give it a height of 52.
okay let's write this and save it so
as we have created one HTML to run this
we'll again go back to this previous
command that we wrote right so what will
we will be doing here is
we'll write slash and we'll write watch
what this will function will do it will
again render and render the file without
even saving it we will we have to just
save it and it will again open in the
server
so let's click all right okay and it's
saying reveal thing and it's done let's
now open our file on the live server so
I have just clicked and it is showing me
a small square let's go back and add
some more functionalities to the square
and let's make it a circle for that I'll
be writing grounded
rounded none on the small full
so there are so many with that tell me
let's give it a shadow also to make it
look more good
so with I have only written Shadow and
it's giving me so many functions of
Tailwind right so let's write Delvin uh
Shadow function
to excel and let's save it and by just
pressing save it's just building and
watching our code
going through some changes right let's
go and you will see one Shadow function
is there and it has made that square
into a circle
let's go back to our code and okay yeah
now what I have to do is it's looking
great but it's in the corner so what I
have to do is I have to make the circle
in the center of the page okay so for
that we'll give it a class of Tailwind
and we'll write
Min height
of screen
okay and the grid you know about the
grid you know if you don't know about
grid you can check out our video on grid
and please content Center so what I have
given it a class the it should be
screenshot screenshot should be medium
and the grid of that page should be
placed in the center
so let's save this file and you will see
our circle is in the center and if I
reduce it
we will see it will always be in the
center of the page like that right
okay
let's make it like that only for now
yeah
let's
leave it move forward
Now to create another Circle
will again create another class
inside that div only right so we have
created creating another class and it's
in this it will give it a PG
of
let's give it a video of still
let's give it
200
or it's fine
Beach okay and let's give it a weird of
32
and then a height of 32 as well right
and it should be rounded again and it's
copy this from the
above
or we will write it
surrounded for
that's not in the great part let's save
it now
and see whether it is coming
please
okay
so what I have done here is I have
placed one great place content in Center
in this line also
so let's save it and see yeah it's
looking
exactly like I we pulled it to me now
let's create another circle inside this
second Circle again we'll write the
class
of
Fiji color and let's give it a PC of
yellow
okay and let's give it a height of 16.
because it should come like
similar to everything and let's give
this a height of that
right rounded
yeah
and let's close this div and save it and
see we have created this
right
so with this CSS uh Telvin configuration
or you can say tl1 CSS file
