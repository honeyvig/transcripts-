foreign
is one of the emerging programming
languages according to the most recent
figures python is the most used coding
language for about 80 percent of
developers the syntax of this high level
programming language is simple to
understand Python's large Library System
makes it a best choice for data science
machine learning and artificial
intelligence projects so hello Learners
welcome to Simply learns YouTube channel
and today we have come up with the
Python tutorial from scratch
if you want to start Python programming
for data science machine learning web
development or you want to automate any
task this tutorial is the initial step
for you but before we begin if you love
watching Tech videos subscribe to our
Channel like the tutorial and hit the
Bell icon to never miss an update
and let us have a simple quiz question
to brush up on our knowledge so your
question is in which language is python
written and your options are
PHP
C C sharp or none of these please answer
in the comment section below and we'll
update the correct answer in the pinned
comment
you can pause the video give it a
thought and answer in the comment
section
and an insightful for you guys if you
are focused on building strong
foundational skills for career growth in
that case you can check out a free
course to Learn Python basics for the
completion certificate from scale up by
simply learn you can check the python
Basics free scale of course in the
description box below the link would be
given in the description box
so now starting with the tutorial
first we will create a folder
so we would be doing all our stuff
in a folder only and
directly in an ideally
so before that we will create a folder
and name it as
Python tutorial
and now
we will install the python for that you
guys have to visit the website
python.org
press enter
now you can see the downloads option
just click on that
and you will see the download python
3.11.0 version so just click on that and
it will start downloading for you I've
already downloaded it
so you just have to open this exe file
and just
and you have to select add python.exe to
path if you have
like if you haven't installed python on
your system first time you are
installing it you have to take on this
checkbox else you don't have to
click on install now and like I have
already installed the python on my
system
and it's asking me username and password
so this setup has failed like I have
closed the setup so you just have to
progress with the setup click on the
next button and click on the check boxes
that asks you to agree some terms and
conditions and then the final setup
would be completed
and after this the for the thing we need
to install is the python ideally
in which we would code and learn the
basics
so we would be using the visual studio
code so for that
we will visit the Wheel Studio code
website
and just click on the download button
you could select the windows Os or
Ubuntu in which
like in which operating system you're
working on just click on the
desired option you want to download okay
like if I am using the Windows operating
system I will click on Windows
and I will select the 64-bit so you can
see that the download has been started
software downloading you just open the
exe file
and progress where it says the next and
the stuff
so after downloading
we will open up
folder and inside that we will open the
command prompt
and let our Visual Studio code open
and if you want to learn how to
configure the visual studio code I will
Mark the python playlist that would be
the full-fledged playlist for all the
topics for the python installation then
the first program then the ideal
installation and all the things I will
pin the playlist in the I button so you
can check it out there okay
here we will name the file as tutorial
Dot py
and we'll start with our basics
so first we will write the basic hello
world program
for that we'll create a variable
and inside
all right hello world
and after that you will print the
statement using the print function
we will save the program and run it
so you can see the output that it has
printed hello world here
now the next thing we will
learn is the input method how to get the
input from the user so for that
first we will comment this down
and we'll start with the input method
and for that
we will input the name from the user for
that we have created a variable and I
will tell you what are the conditions to
create a variable
after this
so here we have created the variable and
use the input method and inside
what
you will write what is your name
so this text would be displayed to the
user and he would be knowing that he has
to enter his name
foreign
[Music]
his name
first we'll write a string welcome to
python
tutorial
and
to write the variable that has some
values in it
we will use the addition sign that is
the plus sign and
then write the variable name
so we'll save this
and click on run so you can see that it
is asking us what is your name
so I will write a bissar Ahuja and press
enter
so you can see that it has maintained
welcome to Python tutorial episode
so if you want to add some space here
you could simply do that
foreign
we'll save this and run it again
so it's asking me what's your name I
will write this uhuja
so you could see that it has given us
the output welcome to Python tutorial
so moving on now we'll talk about some
indentation part like how we write code
in Python
so first okay we will comment it
afterwards
so
talking about the indentation
so in Python indentation is of three
types the simple statement empty
statement and the complex statements
if I let you see this is a simple
statement it starts just from the left
of the corner
and the empty statements we don't have
to do anything for that
for the complex statements like the if
else statements
so there are two portions in the complex
statements
uh the indentation here means leaving a
tab space from margin and in Python it
is used to show that statements which
are indented belong to Upper statements
you would see in the loop section and
the IFL section that is the control
statements conditional statement section
so in statements like if else if L if
Etc views indentation because these are
old types of complex statements and they
have two parts that I already stated
that is header and the body
so we have to indent our body statement
to show that these are sub statements of
our main statement which is written in
header portion
and as I have showed you how to comment
foreign
the code
in our program
so we just
have to place the hash before
line of codes like if you want to just
comment down a single line of code
you could simply
just put a hash in front of the
line of code
and there are multi lines command also
we have seen the single line comment
that is using hash their multi-line
comments also so single line comment is
the command which are created in single
line only that is they occupy the space
of single line and they are created just
placing the hash before the code line if
you want to create a multi-line command
I will show you how you can create it
you just have to use
inverted commas but you should have
three inverted commas in that
inverted single commas three inverted
single commands
foreign
foreign
so guys you can see that we have placed
three inverted commas and we have seen
the multi-line comments how to comment
if there are more than one line
and we want to comment it down so we
will use the single inverted commas for
that the three single invertebrates
and moving on now we'll start with
variables
so a variable is a name or an identifier
which is given to any storage area or
memory location it's a name of memory
location and there are some rules for
defining a variable in Python variable
name can contain alphabets digits and
underscore
second variable name can start with an
alphabet and underscore only it can't
start with a digit no white space and
reserved keywords are allowed to use as
a variable name and the variables are
case sensitive so we'll see some
examples how to create a variable
uh
like simply we can create a variable and
assign a value to it equal to 7 so a is
the variable here and we have assigned
a value to it
and
we can start with the variable name with
the underscore that is underscore
b80
and we can assign any value to it we
will assign an integer value to it that
would be a bisar
and if you want to use underscore in
between you can also use that
so for that we will write
a b underscore
bat
and that would be equal to
we'll assign any value to it that would
be Ahuja
these are the variable names and if you
want to add any number to variable you
can edit a b underscore bat one so we
have added a number here also
so these are the methods how you can
create a variable
and just be remember of some basic rules
for that and now moving on to data types
you have seen that variables can store
data of different types and these
different types can do different things
python has the
built-in data types by default and those
are string in numeric types we have int
float and complex types in sequence type
we have list Tuple range in mapping type
we have dictionaries set types we have
set and Frozen set in Boolean type we
have Boolean binary types we have bytes
byte array
memory View
and
we would be using these data types in
the upcoming tutorial
so I'll simply comment this down
and now we will move to
type casting
so typecasting is defined as converting
one data type into another for smooth
functioning of program
and with type function we can find the
type of any variable
I will show you with a demo
so if you have created a variable and
stored a value in it
so to know the data type
we would simply write print
type
in bracket the variable in which the
value has been stored
so we'll just save this
and run the program
and you will see that it has stated the
class as in type so the integer value is
stored in the variable a
and if you store some
value as a float we will see
what does type function return to us
we have saved this and run this
so first
oh sorry
foreign
so you guys can see
that
we have entered the p in the type
function now we will run the program and
you can see then it has returned the
float class
that is stored in the variable B
so this is how typecasting works so you
could identify any data type using the
type method and type casting is done
when we want to perform arithmetic
operations on the variables of the same
data type
and moving on to operators
operators are used to perform operations
on variables and values python divides
the operators in the following Loops
there are arithmetic operators
assignment operators comparison
operators logical operators identity
operators membership operators and the
bitwise operators
the arithmetic operators are addition
subtraction multiplication division
modulus exponentiation and flow Division
I will show you some examples for it
I will comment this down
and start with operators
so we will
Define our value to a variable X
and Define a value to a variable by
and now our first arithmetic operation
that would be addition so for that we'll
simply write
print
X Plus y we will save this and run this
program
you could see that it has showed the
addition of both X and Y
into subtraction you just simply
I have to place the subtraction symbol
between both the variables
that is 15 and -1
and you could see that the other
operations can be done similarly
you just have to place the
arithmetic operation symbol between the
two variables
X
strip y that is a multiplication symbol
we will save this and
run it and if you want to learn about
the variables
and the data types and the arithmetic
operations in a deep manner you could
just click on the I button and check out
the playlist of the Python
there you will get all the topics
discussed in a very vast way
so
we will see
other operators also
that is the division
and save it and run it
you could see that it has given us the
output 0.875
and
the modulus operator
we'll save this and run it you could see
that it has given us the output 7.
so modulus gives us the remainder
foreign
we would be using the exponentiation
operator
so you'll be getting
the value of 7 raised to the power 8.
and for floor division you just simply
have to use
two slash symbols
you could see that it has given you zero
now moving on
we will see assignment operators that is
equal to plus equal to minus equal to s
t equal to division equal to modulus
equal to flow division equal to and many
more so now we'll start with the strings
so we have seen the operators and if you
want to dig deep down into the operators
you can simply click on the I button and
visit the playlist and you will get the
operators
tutorial there
now we'll start with
strings
so string literal in Python are enclosed
in either single quotes or the double
quotes it means hello
is same as hello I will show you what I
am trying to say
that is hello
in
single double quotes or
foreign double quotes that is similar
so this is how a string is represented
in a python
so we will get a single string printed
for that we'll write print
and
store this in a variable
x equal to hello
and get it printed
and save the program and run it you can
see that it has given the output as
hello
so we have seen how we declare the
string in Python
now moving on we will move to list that
is the sequence types
and we'll start with the first sequence
type that is list
so lists are used to store multiple
items in a single variable and lists are
one of four built-in data types in
Python that is used to store collections
of data and the other three types are
double set and dictionaries they all
have different qualities and usage list
items can be of any data type
they are created using square brackets
so we will see a demo how a list
is created so we will name it as list
one that is equal to and inside square
brackets
we will list some costs there will be
BMW
4D
and Mercedes
so you can see that in the square
brackets we have added some cars and in
the inverted commas
and it has been stored in a variable
list one so this is the list
and that is stored in the variable list
one
and the main point list items are
ordered
which means that the items have a
defined order and that order will not
change if you add new items to a list
the new items will be placed at the end
of the list
and the list items are changeable which
means that we can change add and remove
items in a list after it has been
created and this also allows duplicate
values
since lists are indexed list can have
items with the same value
as you have indexes that are starting
from 0 BMW that
is placed on the index 0.
and if you want to find the length of
the list you could just simply use the
length function
for that
we'll write
length of list one
we'll save this
and click on the
run button you could see that it states
that there are three elements stored in
the list
now
moving on to tuples so tuples are used
to store multiple items in a single
variable Interpol is also one of the
four built-in data types in Python that
is used to store collections of data
tuples are written with round brackets
you'll see a demo
how tuples are created
so for that we will create a variable
and
named as
to one and inside the
circular brackets
we will
insert some values
that would be the name of
some pass
then with the car Branch BMW
OD
d
and Mercedes
and
then you can print the stepper
just save it
and click on the Run button you can see
that the Tuple is created and it has
given us the output three values that we
have stored in that upper and some
important facts about the properties
about the tuples that the Tuple items
are ordered it means that the items have
a defined order or that order will not
change
and the elements in the Tuple are
unchangeable that we cannot change add
or remove items after the Tuple has been
created
and it allows duplicate values since
tuples are indexed that is BMW is
indexed at index value 0 OD at 1 and
Mercedes at 2 so they can have items
with the same value
and if you want to find the length of
the Tuple you could use the length
method
for that we'll just write print
and inside print we'll use the length
function and
the name
of the double we'll save this
and run this
you could see that it has given us the
output 3 that is it has saved three
elements in the topic
now moving on to sets sets are used to
store multiple items in a single
variable and it is also one of the four
built-in data types that is used to
store collection data
and a set is a collection which is
unordered unchangeable and unindexed
so we'll see a demo for that
now we'll see the demo for sets
to create a set we just need to use
curly braces
so for that we will create a variable
set 1 and inside that
in curly braces
we would add the car brands that is BMW
then OD
once it is
and after that we will print
set one
and save this
and run the program you could see that
the set has been created
and uh set items are unordered you have
seen that the list and Tuple items are
ordered but in sets the items are
unordered
they do not have a defined order so the
items can appear in a different order
every time you use them and cannot be
referred to by any index or key value
and they are unchangeable that is we
cannot change the items after the set
has been created and it do not allow
duplicate values also
we have seen the sets and moving on
we'll see dictionaries
as the container values so dictionaries
are used to store data values in key
value pairs they are written with curly
braces and have keys and values
and the collection is ordered and as of
python version 3.7 dictionaries are
ordered in Python version 3.6 and
earlier dictionaries are unordered
we will
see a small demo for dictionaries
now starting with dictionaries first
we'll command this set
we will create a dictionary
when the variable detect one
that is equal to
curly braces and inside curly braces we
will
and option carbon and that
its value is BMW
and the second car
its value is 4D
and we have to place a comma after every
item
let's move on the car 3
is Mercedes
so now we will get this dictionary
printed
print
indictment
so we'll save this
and click on the Run button so that the
dictionary
get created and
we also get the printed dictionary that
is carbon is associated with the value
BMW car 2 is associated with value OD
car 3 is associated with value Mercedes
and in dictionaries the items are
changeable that that means you can
change add or remove items after the
dictionary has been created and it does
not allow duplicate items that is
with the same key you can't have two
values
two same values
with the two different Keys you can't
have two same values so it does not
allow duplicate items
now moving on
you'll see some if else conditions
so
that we will understand the eiffel's
condition using
an example only
so first we will create a variable and
assign a value to it
and then
another variable
in the same value to it and now we will
use if statement
and write if B is greater than
a
then
we will print
B is greater than
a okay
so we'll save this
and click on none you could see that the
condition is true that is B that stores
the value 9 is greater than a so it has
printed B greater than a
and if we reverse the condition if a is
greater than V
and B greater than a
and if we run this you can see you
didn't go to any value as the condition
is false so it won't run the print
statement here
so now moving on
now after
as you've seen that
if the condition is not true it will not
print the print statement
now we will also
use the LF statement here
so if the above condition is not true
it will move to the next statement that
would be alif and if B is greater than a
it will print
p is greater than a okay so we'll save
this and click on run button
you could see that it has first gone
through this if statement and this is
not correct it has not printed this
print statement then it has moved to the
end if statement and it could be greater
than a
and it has printed p is greater than a
so you can use as many and if statement
as you want
and now we will be using the else
statement
the else keyword catches anything which
isn't code by the preceding conditions
so for the L statement
and if we
just
get this b equal to equal to a that is
if B value is equal to equal to a then
it should print B is greater than a
and if these both conditions are not
true then it would be shifted to add
statement
and
for and statement we will write
print
be equal to 9.
so we'll save this
then run it
so you could see that it has given us
the output as b equal to 9. as it has
gone through the if statement if a is
greater than B that is 7 is not greater
than 9 so
it has
augmented that statement then it has
moved to the next statement that is alif
statement that is b equal to equal to a
and 7 is not equal to 9 so it has
omitted that statement and moved to next
statement that is else and it has
printed P equal to right in b equal to
9.
if the above statements mentioned above
the else statement are not true then the
else statement would be executed and it
will print what is inserted in the else
statement
so moving on
we will start with python loops and
python has two Loop commands that is two
primitive two commands while loop and
for Loop
and with the while loop we can execute a
set of statements as long as a condition
is true
you will see
this with the help of an example
first of all comment this down
foreign
and while
I is
less than
99
it will print
I and it will increment
I width
value 1 so I'll save this and run this
program
you can see that
the value while loop has been executed
and it has printed one two three four
five six seven eight
till ninety eight
while I is less than 99 if we put I is
less than equal to
99 so it will
run the loop till 99.
you could see that the loop has been
executed 10.99
so this is how we use the while loop and
four four loops
the for Loop is used for iterating over
a sequence that is list double and
dictionaries
so I will show you an example for that
we'll comment it down
foreign
Loop
I will create a list
and inside the list we will add the
brand names only that would be BMW
OD
and then Mercedes
and now
to print all these values we'll use the
for Loop
or I in
this one
print I
will save this
and click on run button
you could see that this Loop has printed
all the values one by one that is PMW OD
and Mercedes
this is how the loops are used
now moving on
we will
see the python functions so a function
is a block of code which only runs when
it is called and you can pass any data
that is known as parameters into a
function
so we'll see
how we Define Encore function in Python
that
we use the keyword DF and then the
function name
so we'll name the function hello
and after the colon
we will print
hello simply
learn
ers
and after that we'll call this function
that is hello
and we'll simply call this we'll save
this and run it
you can see that it has printed hello
simply another so we have defined the
function here and pull the function here
now we will see some functions with
argument
so for that
you can just pass an argument in
this function only F name as an argument
so any information can be passed into
functions as arguments and arguments are
specified after the function name inside
the parenthesis you can add as many
arguments as you want just separate them
with a comma
so we have added a single argument here
and
here
we will do print hello simply learn
learners
and after that
just say hello and the name of the
person
with that we will write F name
now we'll call the function with the
parameter
so we'll pass the parameter
first would be a Visa
second you pass
anurag
and uh as James
so we will save this
and run it
you could see that it has given the
output as hello abyssar hello anurag
hello James
so we have passed an argument here that
is f name and we have printed the
statement with a string that would be
constant that is hello and F name as we
will pass the parameter when we call the
function
so we have passed a bissar here so it
has printed first hello abisa then we
have called the function again and we
have passed the value anurag there the
name anurag there so it will display
hello anurag then hello James
so these are with the function now we
will move to python built-in math
functions so python has a set of
built-in math functions including an
extensive math module that we'll see in
the further tutorial
that will allow you to perform
mathematical tasks or number so we will
see a demo
using these functions
first we will see the built-in functions
and when we'll study about the module
then we'll
see some functions from the module also
so we'll start with minimum and maximum
functions
so for that first we'll create a
variable
and
apply the minimum function there so the
minimum and maximum functions they can
be used to find the lowest or highest
value in an I travel
so we will add some values that is three
nine seven
nineteen
and another value that is B equal to Max
and then we'll pass values 2 9 8 8.
and
71.
now we will get
printed print text
and then
print B
so we'll save this
and run it so you can see that it has
given us the output as three that is we
have used the minimum function so it has
get the minimum value from all the items
we have
passed in the minimum function that is 3
9 7 19 the minimum value is 3 and in the
max function the max value that is 88.
so moving on now we have absolute
function
so first we will comment down this
and moving on we'll use the absolute
function so the absolute function
Returns the absolute positive value of
the specified number
if we would write a negative number
and we will use the absolute function
for that
inside absolute function write a
negative value that would be
um
99.75 okay
and after that
you have to print this value print X
and save this program
and run it
you could see that the value has been
turned into positive that is 99.75 so
absolute converts the negative value
into positive that it it only prints
positive value but you pass whether it's
positive or negative
so we'll see another function that would
be the power function
so
the power function
its syntax would be like this x comma y
so I will show you
with the help of a demo with the help of
an example so
for that and write x equal to
power function and inside will pass
4
comma 3 that is 4 raised to power 3 and
then we'll print its value
now we'll save this program and run it
so you could see that it has given us
the value as 64. so 4 4 is a 16 16 4 64.
oh
raised to the power 3.
so we have seen another built-in
function that is Spa
no
moving on
we have python Lambda function
now moving on
we have python Lambda function
so a Lambda function is a small
Anonymous function and it can take any
number of fire documents but can only
have one expression so we'll see an
example
first we'll commend this down
and for Lambda function
we will create a variable and inside
will it Lambda
variable
X
and we will
Define an expression for that that would
be X
for multiplication operator
into 10
and then we will
print it
X
no r
function name is a and inside we will
pass
5.
so 5 would be placed in place of X that
would be
it will return the value as 50. so you
could see that we have created a Lambda
function in a variable a and we have
defined the expression that is we have
used the variable X for the expression
and we have defined the expression as X
using the multiplication operator into
10 and then we have printed it that is
print the name of the Lambda function
and the value we have passed that would
be replacing X
so now
moving on to the next item
python iterator but before pythonite
return I want to tell you one thing that
in Python we do not have arrays like we
do not have built-in support for arrays
but python lists they can be used as
arrays
so for that you can just click on the I
button then you would get the playlist
and there is a video particularly in
list apple and dictionaries so there you
will be getting all the details about
the list and how you can use them as
array
so moving on we would
start with python iterator so an
iterator is an object that can be
iterated upon meaning that you can
Traverse through all the values which
consist of the methods
I will show you two methods
that is underscore underscore
ITR
and its current score
and the second method is next
so these are the two methods that we
used in a nitrator
so
I will make you understand with the help
of an example
so first we will create a tuple and name
it as
top one
and inside the circular brackets
I will write the
brand name of the cars
so that would be PMW
the next is OD
and the next is
Mercedes
and now
we will create a variable
my
Tuple equal to
identity of function
and inside we will pass the name of the
variable
that we have created as a tuple
and now to iterate this Tuple we will
write print
and using the next function
inside
we will just write the name of the
variable in which you have passed the
Tuple here
that is
my
Tuple
and again
we will print this statement
now we'll save this and run the program
you could see that it has printed
the first value in the Tuple one
that is PMW and then OD so we have
created it upper and stored three items
in that and then we have created a
variable and use the iterator function
and pass the Tuple in that and after
that we have created
a print statement inside we have passed
my top variable inside the next function
so it has printed the value BMW then OD
and if we
print this value again and save this and
run this
you could see all the three values that
are stored in the topper they have been
printed
so we have seen the iterator
pythonitrator now moving on to the next
topic
that is python modules
so a module
a python module is same as a code
library that is a file containing a set
of functions that you want to include in
your applications so we have some
modules setup
repeat yeah
so we have some modules that have
already been defined that is pandas
mat.clip and beautiful soup and Mac
module so there are so many modules
that have been defined
and you can also create a module of your
own and you can import it into another
program
so you just have to save the file with
the extension.py and you can use that
file into another file just using the
word import using the word import
statement or import then the name of the
file that you have created with the py
extension
so here
you would see a module that have been
created
earlier
and that module would be math
so first we'll import that module that
is import math
that is the built-in module and it has
named as math which will extend the list
of mathematical functions in the python
and to use it we have used the import
keyword and after that we have written
the name of the module
and when you have imported the math
module you can start using methods and
constants of the module that is math
so first we'll start with the square
root method
for that we'll create a variable and
inside
right math Dot
sqrt and inside will pass
91.
and then we will print the variable
we will save this
so we'll save this
and run it so you could see that the
square root of 91 is
9.5393920 and it goes on
so this is one of the methods that is
stored in the math module and we have
other methods also
I will see another method that is
ceiling and ceiling method rounds a
number of words to its nearest integer
and there's another method that is flow
that rounds the number downwards to its
nearest integer and Returns the result
so for that
you'll write a variable x equal to
and to use these functions we will write
math Dot
seed function
and
will write the value 5.4
and in another variable that is y equal
to reduce the math
module and here we will use the method
floor
and inside will pass
5.4 only
and then we will print both these
variables it is print X
and
print why now we'll save this
and run the program you could see that
it has returned the value as 6 that it
Returns the value that is upwards to its
nearest integer that is
above the 5.4 that is 5 that is integer
5 and integer 6 we have the value 5.4 in
between and the upward value which
corresponds to 5.4 is 6 so it has
returned the value 6 and with the flow
function it would return the value that
is downward
to 5.4 that is 5.
and with that we have come to the end of
