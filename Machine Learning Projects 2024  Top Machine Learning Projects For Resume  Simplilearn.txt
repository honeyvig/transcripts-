prompt engineering chat GPT and many
more so hurry up now and join the course
the course link is mentioned in the
description box so let's get started so
guys let's start first with a beginner
level project and the first project that
we are going to encounter that is home
value prediction so guys this project
project aims to develop a productive
model to estimate the value of
Residential Properties the model will
analyze various features such as
location square footage number of
bedrooms and bathrooms age of the
property and other relevant factors by
leveraging historical Property Data the
model will be able to provide accurate
home value predictions which can be
useful for real estate agents buyers and
sellers so guys the programming language
that we are going to use all over here
will be pyth
and machine learning libraries that we
will be using will be psychic learn tens
oflow kiras and for data handling
libraries we have pandas numpy and for
visualization we have to use mat plot
lab and cbon now what will be the
approach for this one guys so guys the
first one that we have a data collection
so here what is going to happen guys so
first you have to collect the historical
Property Data from the sources like
Zillow retailer.com you can also get
database from the public real estate
databases like kaggle data sets where
you have Zillo home value prediction
ensure that a data set include features
like location where you have latitude
longitude square footage number of rooms
earu property type and previous sales
The Next Step that comes is data
cleaning you have to handle the missing
values by using imputation techniques or
removing incomplete records removing
outliers that may skew the model's
prediction normalize or standardize the
data to ensure consistency the Third
third one that we have is feature
engineering you have to create new
features such as proximity to schools
crime rates and access to the public
transportation encode categorial
variables example property type location
using techniques like one hot encoding
generate interaction features that
capture relationship between existing
features the fourth one that we have is
model selection use regression models
like linear regression random forest
cradi and boosting neural networks
experiment with different models to
identify the best performing one now now
in the next phase all you have to do
guys is model training and evaluation
split the data set into training and
test sets train the model on the
training set and evaluate their
performance on the testing set using
metrics like rsme which means root means
squared error you can use cross
validation to ensure the model's
robustness and avoid overfitting the six
oneth that we have all over here is
hyperparameter tuning you can optimize
the model's hyperparameter using
techniques such as grid search or random
search to improve accuracy and if you're
looking forward to deploy your model
then you can develop a web interface
using flask or Jango to allow users to
input property features and get
predictions you can deploy the model on
the cloud platform like AWS for
scalability now if we talk about the
complexity level of this we all know
that it is a beginner level project now
let us move on to the one more set that
is music genre classification and
generation so guys this is also one of
the most beginner level project this
project aims to develop a system that
can classify music tracks into different
genres and generate new music
composition within specified genre the
goal is to build a model that analyzes
audio features to categorize music and
uses deep learning techniques to create
new music this project introduces
Advanced concept of audio processing
deep learning and generative models so
guys what will be used in this so we'll
have programming language that will be
python for audio processing we'll be
using librosa for machine learning
libraries we'll be using tensorflow
kiras pytorch for data handling
libraries we'll be using pandas numpy
for visualization we'll be using matplot
list seon for the data set guys you can
use gdan music genre data set or you can
get it from free music archive so guys
in the first phase we are going to have
data collection you can update data sets
containing music tracks and their
corresponding genre from the sources
from gtzan music genre data set and the
free music archive ensure that a data
set includes diverse genre and
substantial number of tracks per genre
next we'll go for data pre-processing
use library librosa to load and
pre-process audio files including
feature extraction such as mil frequency
sepal coefficients chroma features and
spectral contrast you can normalize the
extracted features to ensure consistent
input for the given models now if we
talk about feature engineering guys you
can extract additional features from the
audio files such as Tempo beat zero
Crossing rate Etc create a feature
Matrix TT that represents the extracted
audio features then go for the model
selection use conventional neural
network or recurrent neural networks for
the music genre classification split the
data set into training and testing data
set now if we talk about model training
and evaluation guys then you can train
the selected classification model on the
training set evaluate the model's
performance on the testing set using
metrics like accuracy precision recall
and F1 score use confusion matrices to
understand the classification
performance across different genres
now if you talk about model selection
and training for the music generation
what you will do guys you can use the
generative adverse networks or recurrent
neural network such as lstm long
short-term memory for music generation
train the generative model on the data
set to create new music sequences next
we have model training and evaluation
you can train the generative model on
sequences of audio features you can
evaluate the generated music by
listening tests and by objective metrics
like Inception score or fret audio
distance if I talk about hyperparameter
tuning guys you can optimize the model
you can use the hyper parameters using
techniques like grid search or random
search to improve performance if I talk
about deployment guys you can deploy
these models on cloud platforms like AWS
now let us move on to our next project
so guys the complexity of this project
is at the beginner level now let us move
to the intermediate level projects next
project that we have all over here is
sentiment analysis of Twitter data this
project aims to develop a sentiment
analysis model that can classify to each
set positive negative or neutral the
goal is to analyze public sentiment on
various topics or events using natural
language techniques so guys what will be
used all over here so in this we will
have programming language like python
okay NLP libraries nltk spacy for
machine learning libraries you can use
psych learn tensorflow kiras for data
handling libraries we have pandas dpai
for visualization we have mat plot lip
seon and can use the API Twitter for
data collection now how you're going to
work on it guys so guys if I talk about
the data collection use a Twitter API to
collect tweets based on specific
hashtags like keywords or topics extract
relevant Fields like tweet text user
information timestamp Etc then if I talk
about data pre-processing guys clean the
Tweet text by removing special
characters links mentions hashtags and
stop wordss tokenize the text and
perform liiz or stemming to reduce the
words to their base form next if we talk
about feature engineering guys you
convert the clean text Data into
numerical representation using tfidf bag
of words or word embedding now if I talk
about model selection guys you can
choose a classification algorithms such
as logistic regression name bias or lsdm
split the data set into training and
testing data set now if I talk about
model training and evaluation then you
can train the selected model on the
training set evaluate the model's
performance on the testing set using
metric like accuracy precision recall
and FN score use cross validation to
ensure the model's robustness if I talk
about hyperparameter tuning guys you can
optimize the model's hyperparameters
using grid search or random search to
improve the performance for deployment
which can be optional you can deploy
your model on AWS for realtime sentiment
analysis so if I talk about the
complexity level guys it's complexity is
intermediate so guys our next project is
customer segmentation using K means
clustering
this project aims to segment customers
into distinct groups based on their
purchasing behavior and demographic
information the objective is to
understand customer segments and tailor
marketing strategies accordingly so guys
what programming languages we'll be
using so basically we'll be using python
for machine learning libraries we'll
have pyit learn for data handling
libraries we'll have pandas numpy for
visualization libraries we'll have ma
plot cbon and the data set Source will
be e-commerce transaction data how we
are going to work on on this one for
data collection we can obtain a data set
of e-commerce transactions that include
customer demographics purchase history
and product information next we'll have
data pre-processing for data
pre-processing we are going to do the
cleaning of the data by handling the
missing values and
outliers then for feature engineering we
are going to create features like total
purchase amount purchase frequency and
recency of the
purchases then we are going to proceed
for the model selection you can use K
means clustering to segment the
customers into distinct groups you can
determine the optimal number of clusters
using methods like elbow methods or Sout
score now if I talk about model training
and evaluation you can train the K means
model on the process data set you can
evaluate the quality of clusters by
analyzing intra cluster and intercluster
distances next we have the evaluation
you can visualize the Clusters using
techniques like PCA principal component
analysis TSN Etc next we have the
hyperparameter tuning now now you can
tune this model and interpret the
characteristic of each segment you can
develop a Target marketing strategies
for each segment based on unique
behavior and preferences now deployment
is optional you can develop a dashboard
using flask or Django to visualize
customer segments and track marketing
campaigns so guys if I talk about the
complexity of this project so this is an
intermediate level project so guys for
data set you can use the kles customer
segmentation data set which is available
at the cagles platform form now the
third intermediate level project that we
have all over here is building a
chatboard with rasa this project aims to
build an intelligent chatboard using
rasa framework the chatboard will be
capable of understanding user queries
and providing appropriate responses
making it useful for customer support
personal assistance or information
retrieval what languages we are going to
use so it will be python based we will
have the NLP libraries like rasa nltk
spacy for machine learning libraries we
are going to have psyit learn tensor
flow kiras etc for data handling
libraries we are going to use pandas
numai so guys this was what we are going
to do it and how you can work on this
one by collecting the data collect the
conversation data and FAQs from the
target domain annotate the data to
create training examples for the chatbot
next comes is data pre-processing clean
the text data by removing special
characters and normalizing the text you
can tokenize and limiti the text to
prepare for a training the third one
have the models training you can use
rasa's nlus component to train a model
for intent recognition and entity
extraction you can Define the dialogue
management policies to handle different
conversation flows next guys you can
perform the feature engineering and
integration you can integrate the rasas
nlu and core components to build
complete chatboard you can connect the
chatboard to messenging platform like
Facebook Messenger etc for model
selection and testing what you can do
guys you can test this chatboard with
various inputs to ensure that it handles
the scenarios appropriately and you can
also select the right model using this
now if I talk about model training guys
what you have to do you have to collect
the user feedback and conversational
logs to continuously work on training
the model next similarly you have to
retrain the model periodically with the
new data to see how it is working so
that will be your evaluation now for the
hyperparameter tuning what you going to
do guys you have to check in those
scenarios where it is able to tune up
with those scenarios where it can handle
the input appropriately and next is
deployment so guys for deploying it you
can use AWS so guys for a data set you
can use rasa's open source so that's a
very good data set for you to proceed so
guys if you talk about difficulty of
this project this is an intermediate
level project now let us move on to the
advanced level projects for advanced
level projects the first one that comes
up to my mind is movie similarity from
plot summaries now this project aims to
develop a system that can find out
recommended movies similar to a given
movie based on their plot summaries by
analyzing the textual content of the
movie plot summaries the model will
identify similarities and suggest movies
with similar themes story lines or
genres this project introduces beginers
to natural language processing text
similarly measures and recommendation
systems what languages we are going to
use guys we'll be using python NLP
libraries like nltk Spacey machine
learning library like psyit learn data
handling libraries like pandas numpy
visualization we can use numpy and data
set Source will be IMDb or kagle so guys
this process is also involving the data
collection then you have to go for data
cleaning then feature engineering next
model selection the similar process as I
have discussed in other projects so you
have to also go through the same one
next what you have to do guys similarly
what you have to do you have to train
the model then evaluate the model then
hypertune it and finally proceed for the
deployment so this is overall process of
this project try to research on the
website a lot like how you can extract
it so guys you can use kagle or towards
data science to research more about this
project now guys if I talk about the
difficulty of this project and this is
an advanced level project now let us
move on to the next one that we have all
over here that is image segmentation
project for brain tumor prognosis this
is a very very amazing project and
definitely you can put up on your
portfolio basically guys this project
aims to develop an image segmentation
model to identify and de eliminate brain
tumors from m& scans the goal is to
accurately segment the tumor regions
which can Aid in prognosis treatment
planning surgical interventions this
project introduces intermediate level
concepts of computer Visions deep
learning and medical image analysis so
guys what we'll be using all over here
for programming languages we can use
Python for deep learning libraries we
can use tensorflow kiras pyto for image
processing libraries we can use open CV
psyit image for data handing libraries
we can use pandas numpy for
visualization we can use matte plot Li
cbon now if I talk about what is the
process of developing this project the
first step will be same data collection
so next step you have to go for data
pre-processing third step you have to do
the model selection where you can use
CNN models for image segmentation task
then you go for model selection moving
ahead you're going to have the model
training and evaluation you have to
split the data set into training and
validation and testing data sets next
proceed for the evaluation phase okay
evaluate the model with certain metrics
so here I can give you certain idea like
you can use dice coefficient
intersection over Union or accuracy then
go for hyperparameter tuning where you
have to optimize the model's
hyperparameters you can use GD search or
random search as we have discussed and
finally you can deploy this model on AWS
now guys we have come to the final
project this is also a very amazing
project guys so guys the complexity
level of this project is advanced level
now let us move on to our final project
that is the impact of climate change on
birds this is a very very amazing
project and definitely you can add it on
your resume this project aims to analyze
the impact of climate change on the bird
population and migration patterns by
examining various climatic Factor s and
their correlation with bird spes data
the project seeks to predict how climate
change might affect bird behavior and
distribution this project will introduce
you some advanced level Concepts like
time series analysis environmental data
modeling Etc so guys what programming
languages will be using for data
analysis you can see we'll have pandas
numai for machine learning libraries we
are going to have psychic learn tensor
flow for visualization we're going to
have matte plot plotly for GEOS spatel
we are going to have geopandas folium
for data source we're going to have
public data sets on bird observation and
climate data sources from eBird now what
will the process flow for this one guys
first you have to proceed for data
collection gather bird observation from
the data like eBird which provides
extensive record of bird sightings okay
and for climate data you can collect it
from NOA including temperature
precipitation and other relevant
climatic factors over the time and
similar next process will be the data
preprocessing then you have to proceed
for feature engineering then you have
have to go for model selection okay
moving ahead you have to go for model
training then evaluation then
hyperparameter tuning and finally you
have to deploy the model so research
about this project see what models
you're going to use suppose I can give
you a hint about this you can use time
series analysis models like ARA or ml
models you can also use random forest or
gradient boosting for predicting impact
on the bird population so guys use
Google exhaustively to research about
this project this is also a very amazing
project and it's going to give you a lot
of idea now if I talk about the
complexity level of this it is an
advanced level project so guys that was
