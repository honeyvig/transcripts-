hi guys finally the waiting is over okay
so your D-Day is fixed that is your
March 1st
2023. your neat MDS examination 2023
will be finished and your result will be
out on March 31st 2023
so now in this video I'll be talking
about the plan for the last 50 days okay
and this video is for only a particular
group of people so I'm going to tell you
so only the such category of people
please do go through this video first of
all people who are good with the
preparation
people who are dealing with the GTS
people who are scoring well people who
are attending the classes regularly and
preparing at their core this video is
not for you please you can immediately
exit the video and you can go with a
regular pattern of preparation okay
that is being given by your mentors or
by by the team by the coaching team or
anything okay but people who are about
to start the preparation okay once the
notification out you have a plan to
start the preparation or so if you are
planning to start the preparation now
people who are
planning to start preparation now you
can hear this video people who are
already done with MDS and who are
planning to go to Army
okay Army Corps okay you can or people
who are done with BDS and whose plan is
to just crack army or you have a plan to
crack both Army as well as need MDS
basing upon a situation you can go ahead
so if you have such plans
and come to the Category 3 people who
just want to qualify the exam okay
because they have some expired plans
after the exam but it is mandatory that
everyone has to qualify the exam to pick
MDS from any any of these categories
okay so if you want to qualify the exam
and coming to the category for people
who has service quota
okay who has service quota in their
respective States they need to clear the
exam they need to qualify the exam they
need to end up with something decent
rank to get into the government uh seats
or to get into that private a category
or P category or the convener quota
seats in the respect to States and
people who want to end up with a decent
rank
that can be anything if you're already
going ahead through the preparation the
decent trying can be 500 below or 300
below or less than that and if you are
halfway into the preparation maybe you
can keep thousand as a Target if you
want at the start the preparation maybe
you can keep 3000 below as a target with
which you can end up with extraordinary
clinical departments and deemed colleges
and private colleges may not be
government seats okay you can end up
with such things or the last category of
students I want to talk about people who
have special quota reservations okay St
or SC or physically handicapped or any
of these reservations or if you have a
creamy reservation
OBC or whatever it is like okay so if
you are about to start so this video is
exclusively for you it is well organized
and well planned scheduled with a decent
number of mock exams and lots of
condensed refined filtered material with
which you can easily perform well in the
examination and end up with a very very
decent score and with a decent rank so
let's jump into the contents
first of all I want to just give a brief
idea about the blueprint of the need so
because if you are going or planning to
prepare for neat okay so first of all
you should know what is happening in the
neat question paper so neat question
paper is basically
240 questions okay equally distributed
so so according to the blueprint so
they're going to tell it's a balanced
question paper
and it is this is being splitted into
party a
and Part B
so it's being splitted into part A and
Part B and the most important thing is
part A is more often a basics
and part e is more of an a clinicals and
according to most of the previous
Stoppers Part B is more often a scoring
whereas part A you need to perform well
so I'll tell you what is in detail so
basically it's a balanced question paper
so I want every one of you to have a
balanced preparation it's a balanced
question paper requires
a balanced prep
the most important thing is need is
going to have a negative marking
how much negative marking is minus
one-fourth means every right answer
you're going to get plus 4 marks and
every wrong answer you will get minus 1.
okay I'm just telling a a just
as you go as you want to go ahead with
the preparation so it's better you know
it in the last uh like probably need has
started in the year 2017
okay official needs so 2017 18 19 20 21
and 22. so one two three four five six
so totally six years of need has done
until the highest registered score is
around in and around 200 so out of the
topper in this sixth examination the top
score that is being registered for 240
right options is in and around 200 it is
moving around 195 202 in the last few
years okay so keeping in this mind I can
openly tell even a Topper topper in this
last six years also have lost 40 mcqs so
start with a positive note start with
the positive note don't don't always
keep targets too heavy come let's keep
small targets try to achieve them go
with the positive note go with a
positive one keep still more targets
so this is how you need to move from one
level to other level in this left or 50
days to achieve a better Rank and a
score
so
as already said like it is divided into
party and part P so jumping into part A
Part A is going to be 100 marks and each
is going to carry
four so you're going to have 400 scoring
in park a and out of which general
Anatomy including embryology and
histology is going to be 14 your Anatomy
will touch somewhere around 10 and your
embryo and histo are going to be two and
two followed by histo and biochemistry
is going to carry 14 soils physio is
going to be 7 and biochemistry is going
to be seven then comes your dental
Anatomy Dental histology is going to be
14 that is your dadh so d a is going to
be 7 and DH is going to be 7. followed
by Micron path so they are going to
carry 7 7 H coming to pharmacology
General pharmacology is going to carry 7
marks whereas Dental related
pharmacology that includes your local
anesthesia general anesthesia your
emergency drugs and whatever the drugs
that are used in dentistry and the
treatment plants related to the drugs
and Dentistry they are going to carry
seven and general pharmacology
exclusively is going to carry seven
General pharmacology includes your other
drugs the drugs which are used in git
drugs which are used in CVS CNS ANS
renal all other stuff coming to medicine
and surgery are going to carry the top
score each of 15 each so this is the
rough blueprint of part A which is going
to be 100 mcqs coming to Part B which is
going to be 140 Dental materials is
going to carry 14 oral path is going to
carry 7 and oral microbiology is going
to carry seven oral medicine is going to
carry 7 and oral Radiology is going to
carry 7.
pedo and preventive periodontics
exclusion is going to carry seven
preventive Dentistry which is basically
a part of community and your operative
dentistry and your pedo is going to
carry seven Ortho is going to carry 14
perio is going to carry 14 prosto
including your crowning bridge and
implants is going to carry 14. Endo is
seven conservative is seven oral surgery
is 14 and public health industry is 14.
so on a on a range like most of the
mentors okay they split the subjects or
sometimes they give
a more more uh scoring I mean like more
marks or more questions from a
particular subjects that is basically
there will be many questions in the
examinations which are integrated means
integrated means combined with other
subjects so such combination one
combination I can list out is oral path
oral microbiology oral medicine and
Radiology is one important combination
where you will get 30 mcqs for sure and
followed by coming to the part of oral
surgery
combined with your general surgery is
going to carry somewhere around 30 so
these are very important general
medicine with
General pathology and microbiology
and with pharmacology and with
physiology is one more combination which
is tough and it's going to carry more
marks so these are three uh
extraordinary combinations where more
than half it's almost like more than 60
percentage of your question paper will
move around this particular combination
means out of 240 it will carry like this
combination particular combination is
going to carry 140 and
okay so that's what like most of the
paper set is or most of the mentors
they're going to ask you to do this
particular combination first okay so if
you I mean like mode of preparation is
completely or wish I am going to share
my plan and my ideology but it's not
mandatory that you have to follow this
particular plan but there are few others
they they'll ask you to do uh these
subjects first and they ask you to do
these subjects repeatedly
my plan is as following so I have
divided the entire schedule into five
models okay each model is going to carry
a group of subjects which are more often
integrated to each other and you can
read them combinedly and the knowledge
sharing will be very very easy and I
have followed rule of nine here okay in
splitting the days so basically nine
days for each model where you are going
to cover a group of subjects which are
going to carry an equal distribution of
marks in the examination so this is how
I have divide module one module two
module three module four okay so so this
is going to turn around like 36 days
covering four models and followed by a
four days of revision for each and every
model so this turns around 40 plus the
10 days for your rest of the stuff
so basically this 14 days is your module
file
model file and rest of them are four
models this is how I have splitted so if
you jump in detail into each type of Mo
each model and you just want to know
what are the things that are covered in
each model so module one I'm going I'm
planning to cover endo
and followed by operator Dentistry
followed by Prosthetics
followed by Dental materials okay so
this is basically uh more of an a
restorative replacement tree model so
most of your Endo operative process and
DM are going to come apart from that I
want you to finish Dental Anatomy Dental
histology and few areas of general
medicine Pharma physiology so general
medicine Pharma physiology will will try
to do in every module because that is
the toughest one and very unique you
require multiple rounds of revision so
phase one of this general medicine
Pharma physiology means few systems we
are going to do in module one coming to
module two module two is more often
related to
oral medicine Radiology oral pathology
most of these are integrated to each
other your general pathology your
microbiology your foreigntology
again phase two of general medicine
Pharma physiology we are going to do
here
jumping into module three okay the
module three more often is surgical
model okay so where we are going to
cover oral surgery general surgery
General Anatomy plus general embryology
General histology okay so with
majority of your general medicine Pharma
physiology that is your phase three will
be done here
so Jen jumping into module four we'll do
biochemistry
we'll do community we'll do perio
we will do
Fido and ortho in combination
okay and followed by we are going to do
the last phase of general medicine
Pharma and Physiology that is a fourth
phase
followed by coming to module 5 which is
14 days so we are going to revise we are
going to do repeats we are going to do
as many Grand examinations as possible
basing upon your limitations so in this
particular plan of MBS conquer we are
planning to provide you 25 GTS okay and
followed by we have a plan of providing
you uh
previous year question papers probably
from
2000 2011 to
2022 okay so this is what they are
basically included in this particular
test series or particular plan so basing
upon your ability and basing upon your
comfort and basing upon your time
limitations because there may be few
people who are having a decent
commitment that they are ready to work
more than 10 12 hours per day for this
upcoming 12-day upcoming 50 days but
there may be few maybe like people who
are done with MDS they need to take care
of you their consultations and their
respect to things they may have XYZ
stuff okay such people like basing upon
your convenience and everything you can
interact personally with the mentor talk
with the mentor and get a priority
checklist okay that is mandatory to do
and you can proceed with that
so this is what the 14 days plan of
module 5 which includes as many exams as
possible both repeats as well as Grant
examinations has to be done
coming to the checklist of MDS conquer
checklist mandatory checklist that can
be done in this few days is first is the
quick revision videos
okay quick revision videos what about
the quick revision videos okay available
on the website for that particular
subject has to be done second one quick
notices
whatever the notes is that are given by
the mentor given by the team uh in the
in the descriptive part you have to do
the quick notes is because there are
high chances their questions will be
coming on the concepts which are
discussed in the speak revision videos
and quick nonsense the third important
thing you will have as many activities
as possible okay so you'll have regular
activities so most of these activities
will be on our regular WhatsApp
registered group so activities followed
by sometimes we are going to take some
live sessions so this activities has to
be done thoroughly because most of the
concepts what we discuss in the
activities are very very important from
the examination point of view
the fourth one is of course you need to
do repeats repeatedly okay so that for
that you can follow a hard copy a book
or you can follow the website where the
repeats repeats questions are available
the next and four most important things
are very very important those are yellow
papers
so we have a series of hello papers okay
so they will be opened according to the
schedule and will be given to you so
where High yielding mcqs and the
concepts are being discussed so you'll
have a question paper
and you will have a recorded live
session on it live session will have a
recorded video on it so where High
yielding Concepts High yielding uh
questions High yielding diagrams High
yielding case based things which were
given in the last few years and which
are very very important from the
examination point of view in the active
part of reading okay so what is active
part of reading is most of us we read
but it is very inactive or passive form
of reading what is happening in this
yellow series yellow papers is very
important is Mentor is going to actively
discuss the concepts okay so whenever
you have an active mode of reading so
you don't need to spend more time to
understand the class because it is an
inactive phase you will learn directly
when the class is going on so hello
papers will be available for every
subject you'll have one or two papers
basing upon the depth and intensity of
the uh paper in the blueprint so you
have an yellow papers which you have to
do followed by of course you have to
give as many Grand examinations as
possible and the last but not the least
is regular
regular interaction with the mentor you
need to talk with the mentors you need
to interact with the mentors find out
your areas weak areas interact with them
find a solution with them start
implementing them in your in your grand
examinations and the final goal is to
end up with a good Rank and a better
better scoring okay so this is all the
mandatory checklist that you have to do
for MDS conquer so finally I want every
one of you who are planning to start or
who are planning to restart or who want
to be aggressive so this is a peak time
last 50 days I always always tell the
last 50 days or or the day one once your
notification is out and your day is
confirmed the leftover days are
something called as the golden period of
your preparation so now you are in the
golden breeder of the preparation and
it's all your your play like how well
you play how smart you play how hard you
play the result will be on March 31st
2023. so these are the previous best
rank holders from Team MDS conquer okay
and followed by so with this I mean like
with this you can you can directly
register uh on the MDS conquer where you
can get access to a few uh the free
content and we have planning to conduct
one or two national mock examinations of
course those notifications will be
dropped on our Instagram page as well as
on the YouTube okay so you can be part
of that you can register uh with this
you can scan this and register and you
can get access to those national uh mock
examinations probably in the month of
February we'll we'll update you at the
exact dates and followed by if you want
