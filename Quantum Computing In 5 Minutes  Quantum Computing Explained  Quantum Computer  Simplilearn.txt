Dave and Ryan are two computer engineers
and best friends who decide to play the
game of flip the coin on Dave's computer
with the computer being the opponent and
Ryan decides to observe his game the
computer plays the first move but Dave
doesn't know what it was either heads or
tails now on his turn he can either
choose to flip the coin or not and
similarly even if his results will not
be revealed to the computer now again
the turn goes to the computer and after
playing a few rounds the computer
reveals the result while observing all
this Ryan says hey do you know that
there is only a 50% chance that either
of you will win Dave got curious he
asked how he knew Ryan explained that
it's a computer and he just tried to
analyze its moves but suddenly he says
what are your chances if you play the
same game on quantum computer Dave was
confused and asked what is a quantum
computer and how is it different quantum
computers are Advanced machines inspired
by quantum physics a study of the
behavior of atoms and particles so
quantum computers operate by studying
and controlling the behavior of these
particles which in a way completely is
different from our regular computers or
even
supercomputers it is an upgraded and
Powerful version of these computers but
not exactly the Next Generation
computers like bikes you cannot build a
better bike just by building building
and adding more and more Cycles together
although they both share almost the same
functioning Dave further questions how
does it work Ryan comes forward and
explains to Dave that while playing flip
the coin his computer took heads and
tails as bits of zero and one and
depends on only these two results while
the quantum computer on the other hand
will also have these possibilities
including a possibility of a mixture of
both heads and tails like zero and one
for example with some portion of zero
and some portion of one and due to this
fluid possibility it increases the
chances of you losing the game because
whether you choose to flip the coin or
not the outcome will still be there
between both possibilities just like a
mixture of lemon juice and water even
though the portion of lemon juice is
very little in that mixture you can't
say that it is not there this property
of superposition and entanglement of
quantum physics empowers quantum
computers to handle operations at speeds
that are orders of magnitude faster than
traditional computers while using a
fraction of the energy upon
understanding this Dave was mesmerized
by the concept of quantum computers
quantum computers aims to revolutionize
more future Quantum Technologies and
just like other Transformations around
the world quantum computers have the
potential to impact our lives in so many
ways like our security needs Healthcare
needs Etc
for example it can be used to create
private keys for encrypting messages
from one location to another it can be
difficult for people with ulterior
motives to copy the key of quantum
uncertainty this type of unique and
unbreakable encryption is already tested
by Banks and companies like JP Morgan
Wells Fargo Barclays Etc it can be used
in the medicinal world as it will be
easier for quantum computers to study
each property of atoms and molecules as
it works on a similar concept so here is
a question for you what makes quantum
computers different from
supercomputers a atoms and molecules B
uncertainty of outcomes C algorithm d
none of the above please give it a
thought and drop your answers in the
comments section below three lucky
winners will receive Amazon gift
vouchers due to its benefits currently
it is connected to over 17 billion
devices globally quantum computers are
the future of our coming Generations
although it is still under research work
it is still taking over the technology
and the business World Companies like
Google and Microsoft are competing to
build Quantum Computing tools this
progress could allow some of the
benefits and insights of quantum
computation to be realized long before
the search for a large scale error
corrected quantum computer is complete
