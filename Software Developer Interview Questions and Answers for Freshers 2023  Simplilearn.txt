learn introduction to software developer
so software developer is a professional
who designs creates tests and maintains
software using various programming
languages and Technologies
their roles and responsibilities can
vary depending on the organization and
project but some common tasks of a
software developer include writing code
to create a software application
debugging and troubleshooting existing
software collaborating with other
developers and stakeholders to Define
software requirements participating in
code reviews and ensuring the quality of
the database keeping up with date of new
programming languages and Technologies
to improve a software developer may also
be responsible for project management
mentoring Junior developers or
contributing to the broader strategy of
the organization depending on the size
of the company so in this video we will
go through some software development
interview questions that will be useful
to you and serve as a valuable resource
for interview preparation so let's go
ahead and have a look at some technical
interview questions
so what is a framework so framework is a
set of pre-written code and guidelines
that provide a structure for developing
software application
it is designed to ease the development
process by providing a common set of
tools and conventions for building and
deploying applications
Frameworks can include libraries modules
and apis that can be used to perform
common tasks such as input output
database access and user authentication
examples of popular Frameworks include
Ruby on Rails angularjs and spring
framework now coming to the second
question which is
what is waterfall model and what are its
use cases
the waterfall model is a software
development lifecycle model that
describes a linear sequential approach
to software development
the model is named after waterfall
because it describes a process where
progress flows in a downward or linear
fashion through the phases of a project
much like a waterfall cascading down a
mountain
its use cases are small projects with
well-defined requirements and clear
scope projects that have a clear end
goal and deliverables projects with
clear set of deliverables and a defined
timeline projects that have a
well-defined budget projects that have a
well-defined set of rules and
regulations projects that do not require
much change Revolution over time it is
important to note that the waterfall
model is not well suited for projects
with rapidly changing or evolving
requirements projects that require
multiple rounds of testing and revisions
or projects that require close
collaboration between development and
stakeholders so this was waterfall model
now moving on to the next question that
is what are verification and validation
so verification is a process of making
sure software reaches its goals without
errors it is the process of figuring out
whether or not the product being
generated is accurate it establishes
whether the end product compiles with
the requirements and focuses primarily
on the functionality now comes the
validation the process of determining
whether a software satisfies the
necessary requirements is known as
validation it is a procedure of
confirming product validation or
confirming that the product we are
developing is accurate the quality of
the program is the main focus of the
validation now coming to the fourth
question
so what do you mean by a software scoop
so the scope of a software project
refers to the defined boundaries and
requirements for what the software will
accomplish it includes specific features
functions and deliverables that the
software will provide as well as the
constraints or limitation on the
projects the scope helps to establish a
clear understanding of the Project's
objectives and serves as a guide for
project planning and execution so this
was the software scope now coming to the
fifth question on our list
so how can you measure the project
execution we can measure the project
execution through activity monitoring
status reports and Milestone checklist
so now let's discuss these things
so activity monitoring
so this involves tracking the progress
of specific tasks or activities within
the project such as coding testing or
documentation
this can be done using tools like task
management software or project
management software which allow team
members to update the status of their
task and provide the visibility into the
progress of the project as a whole then
there is status reports these are
regular updates on the Project's
progress including information on what
has been completed what is currently
being worked on and what issues or risks
have been identified status reports can
be shared with stakeholders including
the project manager project sponsor and
the other team members then there is
Milestone checklist so these are the
list of specific deliverables or
Milestones that need to be completed in
order for the project to be considered
successful this checklist includes all
the activities that need to be done who
is responsible for them and the deadline
for the completion
this helps to ensure that all the
critical tasks are completed on time and
that the project stays on track moving
on to the next question which is what
are functional and non-functional
requirements a functional requirements
are those that users expect from the
proposed software product and are
referred to as functional leads whereas
the non-functional requirements on the
other hand are the how of the system and
they describe the quality
characteristics or constraints of the
system that must be met these includes
things like performance security
scalability usability and
maintainability all right moving on to
the seventh question which is what is a
spiral model so the spiral model is a
software development process model that
combines elements of the waterfall model
and the iterative model it is also known
as spiral lifecycle model spiral model
is an evolutionary approach to software
development that emphasizes risk
management and incremental delivery of a
software product the model consists of a
series of iterations each one building
on the previous one so this was the
spiral model
next up we have what are the
disadvantages of a spiral model
so there are some disadvantages of a
spiral model
for example complexity cost time
consuming so let's understand those
complexity the spiral model is a complex
model and requires a highly experienced
team and good project management skills
it is not suitable for smaller simple
projects then cost
the spiral model can be expensive as it
requires multiple iterations and
evaluations which can increase the
overall cost of the project third is
time consuming so the spiral model can
take a long time to complete as it
involves multiple iterations and
evaluations this may not be suitable for
projects with stick time constraints all
right so ninth question now is what is
agile software development model
so agile software development is a
methodology for managing software
development projects that emphasizes
flexibility collaboration and customer
satisfaction the process is divided into
small incremental releases called
Sprints which typically lasts two to
four weeks each Sprint includes a
planning phase development phase testing
phase and a review phase agile
methodologies include scrum kanban and
extreme programming so this was about
the agile software development model
moving on to the 10th question on our
list that is what is Baseline so in
project management a baseline refers to
a set of agreed upon projects objectives
deliverables and performance
measurements that serve as a starting
point for the project planning and
execution it is also used as a reference
point to measure progress and
performance throughout the project
throughout the Journey of the project a
baseline is typically established early
in the project planning process and
include Goods project scope schedule and
budget once established these baselines
are used as a point of comparison to
measure progress and performance
identify variances and make adjustments
as needed next question is what is Black
Box texting and white box testing so
Black Box testing also known as
functional testing is a method of
testing software where the tester does
not have access to the internal
structure or code of the software
the tester is only aware of the inputs
and outputs of the software and test is
based on its functionality and
requirements
the tester does not need to know how the
software Works internally
this type of testing is often used to
verify that the software functions are
expected and meets the requirements
specified by the customer now coming to
the white box testing white box testing
is also known as structural testing it
is a method of testing software where
the tester has access to the internal
structure and code of the software the
tester is able to test the software at a
deeper level and can test for things
like code coverage Branch Testing and
logic testing this type of testing is
often used to verify that the software
is structurally sound and that the code
is of high quality now coming to
question number 12 what is quality
assurance
so quality assurance is a process or set
of procedure intended to ensure that a
product or service meets a defined set
of quality criteria or meet the
requirements of the consumer it is a
process driven approach to verify that a
product of service being developed or
provided is meeting the defined quality
standards this can include activities
such as inspection testing and audits
the goal of quality assurance is to
identify and mitigate issues before a
product or service is delivered to the
customer so this was the quality
assurance
now comes what is quality control all
right so quality control is a process of
inspecting testing or auditing a product
or service to ensure that it meets a
defined set of quality criteria or
customer requirements it is a systematic
and independent examination of the
product or service to evaluate whether
the relevant quality requirements are
fulfilled the quality control focuses on
detecting and preventing the defects in
a product
rather than improving the overall
quality of the product
it typically involves inspecting a
sample of products
to ensure that they meet the required
standards and taking corrective action
if necessary so this was the quality
control now coming to question number 14
which is what are some different sdlc
models
first is waterfall model spiral model
incremental model agile model Big Bang
model and iterative model
so these are various sdlc models that
you must know if you're preparing for
software development interview all right
now coming to question number 15 what is
a use case diagram so a use case diagram
is a type of unified modeling language
diagram that shows the interactions
between actors and use cases in a system
actors represent the external entities
that interact with the system such as
users or other systems while use cases
represent the functionality provided by
the system the diagram illustrates the
relationship between actors and use
cases such as which actors can perform
which use cases use case diagram are
commonly used to model and communicate
the requirements of a system to
stakeholders all right so these were
some of the technical interview
questions now let's understand some HR
interview questions
so the question is how do you stay
current with new technologies and
Industry developments so you can answer
this question this way
I am dedicated to staying current with
new technologies and Industry
developments I do this by regularly
reading the industry Publications
attending relevant conferences and
networking events following influencers
and experts in my field on social media
and taking online courses to learn about
new technologies additionally I am
always open to learning from my
colleagues and actively seek out
opportunities to expand my knowledge
through mentoring training and
professional development programs so
this is how you can answer this kind of
questions so if somebody asks you how do
you stay current with new technologies
and Industry developments this is how
you have to answer the question all
right now moving on to the next question
which is how do you handle deadlines and
pressure
so you can answer this type of question
this way so I am able to handle
deadlines and pressure by staying
organized and prioritizing my task I
make sure to break down projects into
smaller manageable tasks and create a
plan to complete them on time I also set
intermediate deadlines for myself to
ensure that I'm making steady progress
when faced with pressure I focus on
staying calm and keeping my priorities
in mind and I communicate effectively
with my team and stakeholders I also
make sure to take breaks and maintain a
healthy work-life balance to stay
refreshed and focused so this is how you
can answer this kind of a question now
moving on to the question number 18 can
you tell us about a project you have led
and the steps you took to ensure its
success
so if you are being asked this question
during an interview you should provide a
specific example of how you have used
Version Control in your development
process first we set up a central
repository on GitHub where all the team
members had access each member created
their own branches for their specific
task and pushed their code changes to
the those branches
before merging any changes we had a pull
request process in place where any other
team member could review the code
changes and provide feedback after the
code was reviewed and any necessary
changes were made the changes were then
merged into the main development Branch
we also used git tags to Mark specific
versions of the code such as versions
that were deployed to production
additionally we use gits built-in diff
and blame tools to track the changes and
identify any bugs or issues that might
create a problem thanks to the use of
Version Control we were able to
collaborate effectively as a team so
this is how you will answer this kind of
question all right guys now moving on to
the question number 19.
so why do you want to work here
so when answering this question why do
you want to work here it is important to
do your research on the company first
and companies values also it includes
values missions and culture you must do
the research on these things now tailor
your response to show that you align
with these values and are excited about
the opportunity to contribute to the
company's goals additionally it's a good
idea to mention specific aspects of the
job or company that appeal to you and
how your skills and experience make you
a good fit for the role be sincere and
enthusiastic in your response so moving
on to the next question which is what is
your greatest weakness as a software
developer when answering this question
what is your greatest weakness
it is important to be honest while also
framing your answer in a specific way
that shows that you are aware of the
issue and actively working on to improve
that one strategy is to mention a
specific skill or area that you are
aware you need to improve on and then
explain the steps you are taking to do
so such as taking online courses or
seeking feedback from colleagues another
approach is to talk about a time when
you face the challenge in your work and
how you overcame it it is also important
to note that it is better to be honest
but also show that you are self-aware
and proactive in addressing your areas
for improvement all right now question
number 21 is what is your greatest
strength so when answering this question
in an HR interview it's important to be
a specific and provide examples to
backup your answer one approach is to
identify a particular skill or
technology that you must excel in and
explain how you have used that strength
to contribute to the Past projects or
teams for example you might say my
greatest strength as a software
developer is my ability to write highly
efficient and optimized code for example
in my previous role I was able to
significantly improve the performance of
our application by identifying and
addressing bottlenecks in the code I
also enjoy solving complex problems and
coming up with innovative solutions so
this is how you can answer this kind of
a question all right now question number
22 is tell me about your experience as a
software developer
so it's important for this kind of
question to focus on your relevant
experience and skills highlighting
specific examples of projects and
accomplishments while answering this
question be concise use specific
examples show technical skills
demonstrate problem solving skills Etc
that's it all right now next question is
why do you want to work for a company
so here's an example for this kind of a
question
I'm excited about the opportunity to
work for your company because I believe
it aligns with my values
I like its culture and Mission and I
think I can help company to achieve its
goals I am particularly interested in
the company's Innovative approach to a
specific area and I know that my skills
and experience would be a great asset to
the team I am confident that I can make
a positive contribution to the company
and I'm eager to be a part of its future
success so in this way you can answer
this kind of a question like why do you
want to work for our company all right
now question number 24 on our list is
what do you like best about being a
software developer
so when answering this question what do
you like best about being a software
developer it's important to be honest
and authentic but also to show that you
have a passion for the field and that
you are excited about the opportunity to
work as a software developer you can say
few things like the ability to solve
problems the teamwork aspect of the job
and the variety of the field
Etc all right next question on our list
is how do you handle difficult and
challenging situations
so you can answer this question in this
way I have had several experiencing
handling difficult or challenging issues
with customers in my previous customer
service tools one situation that stands
out to me was when a customer was
extremely angry and dissatisfied with
the food I knew that it was important to
remain calm and professional so I took a
deep breath and actively listened to his
or her concerns
I acknowledge the issue and apologize
for the mistake I then worked with my
team to find a solution that satisfied
the customer such as offering a refund
or replacement product I also made sure
to follow up with the customer to ensure
that issue had been resolved to their
satisfaction so this way you have to
answer this kind of question this is bit
tricky one
but you must answer this question this
way all right
now coming to question number 26
so would you like to relocate to or
travel for the company
when answering this question in an
interview it's important to be honest
with your interviewer while also showing
your flexibility and willingness to work
for the company a good response might be
something like I'm open to relocating or
travel for the company if the
opportunity arises
I understand the importance of being
able to adapt to the needs of the
business and am committed to being
valuable asset to the team so this is
how you will answer this question now
question number 27 on our list is what
are your expectations from a company so
a good response might be something like
I am looking for the company that values
professional growth offers opportunities
for advancement and has a positive
supportive work culture I am also
looking for a company that is committed
to making a meaningful impact in its
industry I am excited about the
