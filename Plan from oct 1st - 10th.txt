yeah hi everyone so I just want to give
you a brief idea of what we are going to
do in the upcoming tendance okay so the
ten days of plan of action how you need
to cover the things how you need to
manage the stress levels and how you
need to balance your proposition okay so
that is more important a few people as I
interact with few people in the offline
and a few people through the calls and
messages they're more worried like how
to handle this particular module where
many of the tough subjects are here okay
so don't feel this as a tough area
because this this area is mostly a
combination of subjects okay so it's a
combination of subjects we are dealing
physiology right and physiology is just
the next level of physiology is just
continuation with general medicine a
part of microbiology will be covered
here and next continuation is Pharma so
all these they go hand in hand
okay so don't consider them as separate
subjects or don't don't worry about them
okay
so just try to be focused and try to
follow the things which are given as a
task by the group and the plan for the
next coming 10 days so first October
according to the schedule we need to
cover CNS and painless out of food
Sheamus is already done on the group at
the best and apart from this even even
after completing of chemotheraphy I have
dropped two of us per day for
chemotherapy for the upcoming days
because that is an important area where
the purpose setters regularly ask
questions so chemo therapy you can do
every day only GA and general Varma you
can do every day like whenever you feel
you can open back see the see the chords
mnemonics that are given and
just try to cover these four topics
these topics are common anus is already
done again there is some time for NS
according to the schedule and you need
to be more focused on CMS so how to
cover CMS okay the first thing that you
have to do is you have to cover the
physiology then you need to go and
simultaneously cover the general
medicine then you need to come and cover
the pharmacology of this particular CMS
and most of your questions questions
area of CNS most of your questions will
be from the areas or from the diseases
of dental bells and Thai German and
urology is the most common area where
they allow to ask questions so you need
to go very deep into trigeminal
neuralgia and arrest all diseases or
syndromes of central nervous system
which were just focused on the dental
pulse or which were given as an MCQs in
the dental bells you can just try to
cover them ok that's more than
sufficient so coming to the second
October the SAS that are to be done are
g80
liver and kidney so all the aspects
first you need to cover physiology then
you need to go ahead and try to cover
the general medicine point of view means
the diseases of GI T so mostly most of
your questions will move around peptic
ulcer and their few syndromes again and
GID that you have to make a note and you
have to learn the clinical features
livers is already covered most of the
hepatitis is the area and cirrhosis of
the liver is an area so most of things
are already covered in various other
subjects coming to the kidney mostly
physiology based questions will be more
in this area rather than the disease so
caramel failure and everything are like
very Leslie focused and if not nephrotic
syndrome and a fried egg syndrome is an
area where they allow to ask questions
anyway we are going to cover on the
group you just try to focus on
physiology and just try to cover the
general medicine point of view and few
diuretics and everything in the form of
the point of view that is more than
sufficient for examination point of view
so next course is 3rd October you'll be
focused towards the respirate resistor
so respiratory system first you need to
cover physiology then you need to cover
channel medicine mostly most of your
questions will move around
asthma's squamous cell carcinoma of
lungs and the I mean there few other
diseases which are important which will
be covered on the globe don't worry and
then you can go for the pharmacology the
drugs that are used for the respiratory
system ok so then comes the most
important areas ok
so that are to be done on fourth fifth
and sixth so one most important area is
endocrinology so in Physiology point of
view in general medicine point of view
this topic is very very important and it
is directly or indirectly related to the
dentistry and the next one is blood the
blood is utmost important you need to
cover the physiology of the blood
followed by you need to cover almost all
the diseases enemies that are related to
the blood and followed by you need to
cover the basic blood clotting systems
and the deficiency of the clotting
systems and you need to know about the
antiplatelet drugs Orlandi platelet
drugs anticoagulant drugs and ferric
ferrous supplements and everything which
are very very important in blood point
of view so you need to work more on
blood and coming to the last but not the
least that is muscle and no structure ok
this is more of a physiology topic okay
so these are easy you need to spend some
time they go very fast the trickiest
areas are going to be your CNS anus
areas where you cannot understand few
classifications and tracks and whereas
rest GI T liver kidney respiratory
endocrinology blood muscle and nerves
and these are these are very simple
areas where you have to be focused you
need to you need to prepare you need to
sit for longer duration of time once you
sit for longer duration of time these
things then go
very smooth and they were very cool and
they have something like a concept
oriented things which can be easily
under standard and which can be
remembered for a longer duration of time
so this is what you need to do in the
upcoming few days and followed by the
leftover days like by vi according to
the schedule we are going to finish and
seventh eighth ninth and tenth you can
keep it for revision and tenth is your
grand exam and this grand exam will be
focused on all the subjects that are
covered up to now okay so you plan
revision of these four days whether you
want to focus and of course the most of
your questions more than 90% s of your
questions will be from third module
siller's okay that I can promise you so
you prepare like whether you want to go
with one and two modules and have a
revision or whether you want to focus
only on the three and then you can plan
accordingly with the four okay so next
is we are going to start the fourth
module from October 11th okay so you you
prepare your mind and uses try to manage
but make sure this area is very very
important okay things has to be done
from first October 6th October which are
very very important I'll be more
accuracy in the group also we'll try to
cover as many aspects as possible
ok so first is CNS and ans and second
you need to cover g18 liver and kidney
and third you need to cover respiratory
system fourth you need to cover
endocrinology fifth you need to cover
blood and sixth you need to cover all
the miscellaneous aspects present in
your pharmacology and physiology and in
your general medicine including muscles
and nerves okay so this is what the plan
of action for the upcoming one week and
followed by you have three or four days
for revision and all the best for exam
on 10th okay so on 10th exam exam on
10th so I'm thinking of to keep as as
the aims is approaching so the exam will
be in the neat format but the cushion
models few question models will be from
okay so everything is self-explanatory
on the site don't worry about that and
get ready you need to experience
everything right so the paper will be a
bit tough and I want you guys to score
at your best all the best signing off
