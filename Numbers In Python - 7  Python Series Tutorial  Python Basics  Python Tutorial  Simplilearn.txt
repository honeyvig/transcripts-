hello everyone welcome to another video
on python series of tutorial by simply
learn in this session we will look at
numbers in Python now let's see the
agenda for today first we will learn
different number data types in Python
then we will learn type conversion
between number data types and after that
we will understand how to represent
binary hexadecimal and octal numbers in
Python and then we will understand
different number functions in
Python a programming language needs to
have support for numbers to carry out
calculations in Python the numbers are
categorized into different data types
types are implemented in python as
classes there are three numeric types in
Python int for integers float for
decimal numbers and complex for complex
numbers let's explore these data types
in jupyter
Notebook I have opened my jupyter
notebook and now let's see different
data types in jupyter Notebook for
example first we'll assign a number to a
variable num variable equal to
7 and now we will check the type of this
num variable for that we'll write the
command type round brackets num bracket
close and then we'll run this
command we will get int as the data
type now we will assign a decimal number
to the num variable that would be num
equal to
7.7 and now we will check the type of
the num
variable and run this command what we
get is the float float as the data type
for the num
variable now we will assign a complex
number to the num
variable and we will check the type for
this num
variable and run the command we will get
the complex data type as the
result now if you want to get the real
part of this complex number you just
have to write the command num.
real and just execute the command you
will get
6.0 as the real part of this complex
number here you can see you just quote
the number in flo data type the complex
number in Python are stored in flo data
types whether it's the real part or it's
the imaginary part now we'll see the
imaginary part num. IM Ag and now you
will run this command you will get
7.0 here also you can see that the
imaginary part is also stored as
float in Python for complex
number now we will perform different
arithmetic operations with these data
types first we'll
mention arithmetic operations
now we will assign numbers to the
variables and perform different
arithmetic operations for that we will
assign 17 as a number to the variable
num one num one = to
17 and the second variable number two we
will assign the number
25 and now we will perform different
arithmetic operations first we'll start
with
addition so we'll write the simple
command that would be print num
1+ num 2 and just run the command you
can see the result as 42 it's as simple
as that in Python you just have to write
print and in round brackets just write
the operation you want to
execute now we will see the subtraction
part we'll write print
num 2 minus num 1 and execute this
command and we'll get the result
as8 now we will see
multiplication
print num
one into num2 and execute this command
and we'll get the result as
425 now we will
divide print num 2 divide by num one
and execute this command and we'll get
1.47 here you can see as we have
assigned int values to the num one and
num two variable we got the result for
addition subtraction and multiplication
as in data type only but for division we
got at as
float this is because python always
gives the output for division in decimal
numbers only just to have minimum
accuracy loss so
if you want to just get the output of
the division as an INT value you just
have to perform
this
print num two and 2/ signs and then
number one and then execute the command
you will get one as the output so to
just get int as the output of the
division you can use two
slashes next command will see is to
raise a number to another number so to
just get 2 to the^ of 4 we'll write the
command
print
to two ASC symbols and 4 and Just
execute this command you will get the
output as
16 we go 2 to the^ of 4 by just using
two s symbols now to get the remainder
of the div Vision we just have to use
the modulus
symbol so for that
print 4 modulus 2 and just execute the
command you will get zero as the
remainder you can perform the same
operations on Flo numbers and complex
numbers now we'll see an arithmetic
operation on complex number so we will
assign a complex number to a variable
that would be g = 1
+ 5
J and another variable we will assign
the value 2 + 3 J and we will assign the
operation I equal to
g/h that is the vision and print the
output and we'll execute the command we
will get the following result for the
division of two complex
numbers now we will see type conversions
in Python for that we will
move there are mainly two types of
conversions between numbers in Python
first is using arithmetic operations
that is implicit type conversion and
second is using built-in functions that
is explicit type
conversion let's understand the concept
of conversion with the help of Jupiter
notebook so here we'll write first
conversions first we will assign a
number to a variable that would be a =
to
196 and we have seen in the previous
examples that it's type is int now if we
put this number into double quotes
and now we'll check its type that would
be
type A and run the command we'll get it
as string so in Python when we just put
a number in double quotes it will see it
as a
string and to get this number as an INT
we just have to use explicit type
conversion for that we will write
B equal to
int
a and now we will check its type
type B and run the command we'll get int
as the data type for the B variable the
a variable is still the string data type
and B variable has now turned as int
data type and now to turn a as a flow
data type we can write c equal
to
float
a and check its type
type c and run the command and here we
can see that it has turned into the
float data type so a is still the string
data type but C has been converted the a
variable into the float data type
we can also convert the a string data
type into complex data type just we have
to write t equal to
complex and in Brackets we have to write
a and we can check its
type and we
can
print the T complex number and we have
just execute the
command and we can
see that the complex number is 196 + 0
J and we can also check its type by just
writing
print type D and we'll run the command
and we can see that the class is complex
for the variable D we can Define the
complex data type by different methods
one of the method is we just have to
write
print complex and in round brackets we
just have to assign both real and the
imaginary numbers that would be 3 comma
6 and just execute the command and here
we go to a complex number that is 3 + 6
J now we have seen the explicit type
convergence now we'll see some implicit
type convergence that is using
arithmetic operations for that we will
assign a float number that would be
2.6 to a variable a = to
2.6 and B = to 6 and we will assign an
arithmetic operation that would be C =
to A+
B and print the
output and execute the
command by using just arithmetic
operations we have seen that the
addition of a float number and the
integer number turns out to be a float
number so now we have seen the implicit
type conversion
example now we will see the
representation of binary hexade decimal
and octal numbers in
Python all the integer numbers can can
be represented as binary hexadecimal and
octal to represent it as binary in
Python we have to prefix it by using 0
small b or 0 capital B and for octal we
can prefix it by using 0 small o or 0
capital O and for hexadecimal we can use
0 x or 0 capital x let's see this
representation in Jupiter notebook first
we'll write representation know binary
hexad decimal and octal
numbers
now we will first see binary to decimal
conversion for that we will first write
0
b 1 1 0 1 1 0 0
0 and then we'll just run it and see 216
as the decimal conversion of this binary
number
now we'll see the same for the octal for
that we'll write 0 small o 12 and just
run this
command and we can see that it has
turned 10 in the decimal number system
for hexadecimal we will write 0 small
X and 12 and just run the
command and we can see 18 as the decimal
conversion of the hexadecimal number
system we can also use 0 capital x 12
and just on the command we'll see 18 the
same output as of 0 small
X12 let's see some operations with
fractions for that first we will comment
fractions now we will import the
fraction
module for that we'll write
from
fractions import fraction
SF and first I
will execute the addition operation for
fractions for that we'll write
print
f 1 comma 3
just for the fraction numerator would be
one and the denominator would be
three now we'll write the operation
addition and F the second fraction that
would
be okay we'll write the same only 1
comma 3 and on execution of the command
we will get 2x3 as the
output we can also perform different
operations okay we will just see the
reciprocal of the fraction for that we
will write
print
1 upon
F 5A
6 and just run the command here we can
see the reciprocal function that would
turn out to be 6X 5 now we will explore
different number
functions first one that would be we
would explore would be
absolute absolute function would turn
any negative number into the positive
number for that we'll just assign a
number that would be x = minus
9.8
and we will just apply the absolute
function
ABS on the variable
X and just run the command here we can
see that has turned X = to - 9.8 to
9.8 now we will see some different
functions for that we will import the
math
module
import
math and we have different values stored
in the math module for example Pi we
will print the pi value
print math. pi
and run the
command here we can see the value of the
pi
3.141592653589793
we also have exponential value in math
module for that we'll write the command
print math. e and execute the command
here we will get the value 2.718 2818
2845
9045 for the value of e in the math
module
now we will also see exponential to the^
10 for that we will write the command
print math do exp round brackets 10 and
execute the command we will get the
value
22026
465 we can also perform log
operations for that we will write the
command
print and we will get the log of 1,000
to the base of 10 for that we'll write
math
DOT log to the base
10 the value would be 1,000 and we will
execute the command and we will get
3.0 we can also get the factorial by the
math
module we'll write print
math do
factorial factorial of
6 and we'll execute the command and we
go the factorial of 6 that is
720 now if we want the square root of a
number we'll write the command
print math do
sqrt and in round brackets we will write
the number for which we need the the
square root we'll write 25 and execute
the command and we'll get
5.0 this square root number gives the
float number as its
output and we can also find out the
maximum numbers from a bunch of numbers
for that we have to write the command
max round brackets and the bunch of
numbers from which you want the maximum
value 1A 33a 50
55A 7A 99 and just execute the command
you will get the maximum number that
would be 99 and if you want the minimum
number you can write the command Min and
in round brackets just write the bunch
of numbers 1 comma 3A 66 comma 88
comma
7 and just execute the command you will
get the menu number that would be one
now we'll see the ceiling function for
that we'll write the command
print
math do SE and in round brackets we'll
write the number for which we want to
use the sing function Min -
43.5 and execute the command you'll get
- 43 so what the sing function does is
it would give the highest value or the
greatest value for the number we have
entered in the ceiling
function now we'll see the floor
function for that we'll write the
command
print bracket math.
floor and we'll write the number for
which we want to use the floor function
minus
43.5 and execute the command we will get
-
44 so the floor function will give the
output value just
below the or just the lowest value of
the value entered by us in the floor
function now we'll see the power
function for that we'll write the
command
print math. p and in round brackets we
will write the
number two and the power which we want
that would be six and just execute the
command here we can see that two to the^
6 we have got the output value is
64 now we'll see some trigonometric
functions first we'll see COS of X like
python number method cos Returns the
cosine of x radians for that we will
write the
command
print math Dot
C
of0 and just run the command it will
give one as the
output so this method returns a numeric
value between minus1 and 1 like which
represents the cosine of the
angle we will see another example for
course for that we'll write
print math do course and in Brackets
we'll write the angle math
do
PI and we'll execute the
command and we'll get the output as
minus1 now we'll see tan trigonometric
function so the python method 10 it
Returns the tangent of X radians for
that we will write the command
print math do 10
of angle zero and we will execute the
command we will get 0 as output this
method returns a numeric value between
minus1 and 1 which represents the
tangent of the parameter
X we will also see another example for
10 we'll write
print math do 10
math do PI by 4 and execute the
command it gives us
0.99999 that turns out to be
1 now we will explore some random number
functions for that we will write the
command import
random and import the random module
now we'll see the first function that
would be Rand range for that we'll write
the command
print random dot Rand range and in
circular brackets we'll write the range
from which we want the random
number that would be 10 comma 20 and
execute the command here we go 12 as the
random
number now we will Define a list that
would be x equal to
square
brackets
1
2
3
4 and
5 now we'll see another
function that would be choice and it
would give any random number from string
list or tle so for that we'll write the
command
print random
dot choice and in circular brackets we
will write or we will pass any list
string or tle here we will pass this
list X and execute this
command we will get the random number
three with that we have come to the end
