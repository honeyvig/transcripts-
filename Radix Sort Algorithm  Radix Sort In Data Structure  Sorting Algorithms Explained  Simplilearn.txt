hey everyone i am kundaliwal and i
welcome you all to simply learns youtube
channel in this session we will discuss
radix sort algorithm
we shall begin our session by
introducing radix sort then we will
discuss radix sort algorithm after that
we will implement radix sort algorithm
in the coordinator finally we will sum
up what we have learned from this
session
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon below so you
never miss an update from simply learn's
youtube channel
so without any further ado let's get
started with an introduction to radix
sort
radix sort is a non-comparative sorting
algorithm it avoids comparison by
creating and distributing elements into
buckets according to their radix
and for elements with more than one
significant digit this bucketing process
is repeated for each digit while
preserving
the ordering of the prior step until all
digits have been considered
now let's discuss radix sort algorithm
let's say we have an array
first we will find the largest element
in the array to decide maximum number of
significant digits we will need to
compare to sort this array
we will go through each significant
place and sort the array one by one
first we will solve the array according
to the units place
then we will sort according to the tens
place
and then we will sort according to
hundreds place and so on till the array
is sorted
we have now introduced the radix sort
and its algorithm
now let's implement this algorithm in
the code editor
we will start with the utility function
to get maximum value in this array
so int
get max
with an argument as array arrow
size
n
we will declare variable int mx is
equals to arr at 0
and we will write a for loop
where
i is equals to 1
to i less than n
at i plus plus
if
arr at
is greater than mx
then
mx will be equals to ar
at i
then we will return
the value of mx
now we will write a function to do
counting sort of array arr according to
the digits represented by exponent
so void
count sort
xp we will declare an integer array
output
and
i comma
account array
of size 10.
where all elements are zero
now we will store the count of all the
elements of the array arr
so for loop
i is equals to zero
i less than n
to i plus plus
divided by
exp
modulus of
10
plus plus
we will change count i so that
count i now contain actual position of
this digit in output
so for
i is equals to 1.
i less than 10
i plus plus
count
i
plus equals to
count
i minus 1.
now we will build the output array
so for loop
at i is equals to n minus 1
to i greater than equals to zero
and i minus minus
output
count
arr
at i
divided by exp
modulus
10
minus 1
is equals to
arr at i
and now
count
arr
i divided by exp
modular
10
minus minus
now we will copy the output array of arr
so that arr now contains sorted numbers
according to the current digit
so for
i is equals to zero
i less than n
i plus plus
arr
at i
is equals to
output
now let's write the main function that
will sort the arr using radix sort
so void
red x
sort
and
now we will do the counting sort for
every digit note that instead of passing
digit number exp is passed exp is
basically 10 raised to the power i
where i is current digit number
so
for
exp
is equals to one
and m divided by
exp
is greater than zero
while
exp
is multiplied equals to
10
we will do count sort
on arr
of size n
with exp
now let's write a function to print this
array so void
and array
and arrow
and
n
for
and i is equals to 0
i less than n
i plus plus
layout
array
now let's write the main function
we will declare and arr
bracket
with values
170 comma 45 comma 75
comma
90
comma
802 comma 24
comma 2
comma
66
now we will find out the size of this
array arr
and
is equals to size of
arr divided by
size of
arr first element
now we will call the radix sort function
and we will print this array
now let's try and execute this
as you can see we have successfully
sorted this array using radix sort
let's get back to our slides
at last let's sum up what we have
learned from this session
first up radix sort can be used on
lexographically sortable data
next up radix sort utilizes the count
sort algorithm
next radix sort is done by sorting
elements using significant digits
finally radix sort consumes more memory
space than quick sort
and this was all for today's session
