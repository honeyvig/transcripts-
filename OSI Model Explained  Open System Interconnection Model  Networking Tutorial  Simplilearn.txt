with the increase in the data
transactions over the network channel
have any of us ever wondered what
procedures or protocols does the data
must have to go through when transmitted
over the network node
well this is what we will see in today's
topic
hi guys and welcome to yet another
interesting video by simply learn
but before we begin if you love watching
tech videos subscribe to our channel and
hit the bell icon to never miss an
update from us
now without further ado let's take a
look at the agenda for today's video
for today's topic firstly we'll
understand what is an osr model
then we'll see the structure for the osi
model
continuing with knowing the layer
structure and information in the osi
model
let's start
to better understand the osi model let's
take a look at a scenario
assuming we have two different systems
with different operating system
installed in them
and there is a communication channel
between them over which the data is
shared
but sometimes during transmission of
data
it faces some problems
these errors often arise due to the
different operating system installed in
the system or due to a network problem
during a transmission
but to overcome such situations
the osi model structure is used
using the osi model structure we can
make the transmission of data over the
communication channel error free
let's take a look at the definition for
the osm model
the osm model stands for open system
interconnection model
or a specifically designed set of
protocols and standards that governs the
modeling and conversion of the data for
proper transmission over the network
channels
the osm model is based on the layer
structure where it consists of seven
different layers where each layer has
different set of protocols that are to
be applied on the data during the
transmission
over the network channel
let's take a look at the different
layers of the usm model
the osm model consists of seven
different layers
which perform specific functions and
apply different protocols at different
layers to maintain the quality and
prevent the data from getting corrupted
when it is transmitted over the
communication channel
let's take a look at each of them the
first layer is known as the application
layer
which is a top most layer
then we have the presentation layer
session layer
transport layer
network layer
data link layer
and physical layer which is the last
layer of the asm model
the upper four layers in the isi model
represents the host layers
that is they interact with the
application related issues when the data
is transmitted over the communication
channel whereas the lower layers are
termed as network layers
they specifically deal with the
transmission related steps for the data
over the network channel
let's take a look about some information
in regards to the layers
now let's take a look at the function
and the data format that is handled by
each of the layers during the
transmission of data
the first layer is the application layer
which interacts as a gateway for the
host datum and network applications
and handles the data format
then we have the presentation layer
which handles the initial step towards
the conversation of data for transfer it
also handles the data format
then we have the session layer
session layer establishes a connection
between the network devices for the data
transfer
then we have the transport layer which
oversees the data that is transferred
without any error and is in the same
pattern needed by the destination system
the data format handled by this layer is
segment format
next we have the network layer which
determines the part for the data
transfer
it handles packet related data
then we have the data link layer which
performs the task of connecting the
physical nodes for the transfer of data
it handles frame data
and in the end we have the physical
layer
which is used to transfer the raw bits
that is in terms of ones and zeros over
the physical mode
now that we are clear about different
layers that are present in the osm model
and some information regarding them
let's take a look at each of the layers
in detail
we'll start with top to bottom that is
the application layer will be the layer
that will be starting with
let's take a
look the topmost layer in the osi model
is the application layer which acts as
an interface between the user
and the applications that are being
accessed which can be
internet explorer chrome or
any email client
it also handles different protocols that
are needed for the data transmission
over the network channel which can be
given as
hypertext transfer protocol the http
protocol
and the smtp protocol which is the
simple mail transfer protocols
now let's move on to the next layer
the next layer is known as the
presentation layer
the presentation layer is responsible
for performing conversion tasks over the
data that is received from the
application layer
the conversion of data is done
in accordance to the required format
it also performs encryption over the
converted data so as to prevent it from
getting hacked by cyber criminals or
hackers
the compression of the encrypted data is
also performed by the presentation layer
so that it can be passed on to the
session layer
the next layer in the osi model is known
as the session layer
in this layer
the communication channel between two
different devices is established
the network devices are individually
known as session
the data that is transferred is to be
done over these session channels
the layer that is the session layer
establishes and terminates these
sessions in case of an error or some
other unforeseen event
this layer is also responsible for
authentication checks regarding the data
that is being transferred and also
provides data recovery options in case
an error occurs over the communication
channel it's a model list let's take up
a question
the question is what is the main action
that takes place at the presentation
layer
and the options are
first option data segmentation
second option encryption of data
third option framing of data
and the fourth option
bit conversion of data
you can provide your answers in the
comment section below
let's move on with the next layer
the next layer in the osm model is known
as the transport layer
the main task performed by this layer is
to break the data that is received
from the session layer into different
segments
these segments comprise of protocols
which are udp protocol and tcp protocol
along with the data that is
segmented from the received data
then the segmented data along with the
udp and tcp identification it
transferred over to the transmission
channel where then it's further
transferred to the network devices that
requested for the data
this layer also performs a very crucial
part
which is the flow control
let's understand flow control over the
network channel through a small example
in this example the server has a
capacity to send 50 mbps of data at once
whereas the receiver side has a capacity
for 10 mbps
when the data is transferred from the
server to the client it transfers 50
mbps
but it isn't possible to transfer all
this data at once due to the lower
capacity on the client side
which is why the flow control changes is
required which is provided to the server
side by the transport layer
now let's move on to the network layer
which is the third layer from the bottom
in the osm model
this layer is responsible for breaking
down the segments into data packets
by adding ip address to them that is
received from the transport layer
these data packets are then further
transmitted over to the best possible
route to the destination system which
are governed by the internet protocols
including ip and ipv6 protocols
for example if we have a data that is to
be transferred to the network device too
we
choose the best option
that is the root to be transferred over
to that network device
now let's move on to the next layer in
the osi model which is a data link layer
this layer is responsible for
maintaining and terminating the
established connection between the
devices over the network
the mac address in this layer is added
to the data packets
which are collectively known as data
frames
these data frames are then further
transmitted over to the physical network
these are divided into two different sub
layers
medium access control that is mac which
controls the established connection
device
and the second sub layer is logical link
control layer llc which identifies the
address and provide flow control for the
data
this data frame as earlier told is
transferred over to the physical layer
now let's take a look at another
question to brush up whatever we
learned so far
the question is
which layer includes the mac sub layer
in the osi model
option 1
application layer option 2 session layer
option 3 data link layer option 4
transport layer
you can give your answers in the comment
section below
let's move on to the last layer in the
osm model which is a physical layer
this layer is responsible and provides
the physical medium over which the data
frame is transferred
but the transfer data is converted into
bits before it's transferred
the transmission of data is covered by
different protocols that are embedded in
the physical layer
the transmission of once and 0's format
data is done it also responsible for
maintaining the data quality by applying
different necessary protocols and
maintaining the bit rate throughout the
transfer of data whether it be
wired medium or wireless media with this
we have reached the end of the module
