GPT and many more so guys hurry up and
join the course the course link is
mentioned in the description box so guys
in today's video we will be exploring
the prom structure for various use cases
now first let us try to understand the
prom structure so guys I'll break down
the prom structure so here first we have
the action verbs so guys think of action
verbs like a boss telling chat GPT what
to do it's like giving chat GPT a job so
for example if I say
right you are telling chat gbt to put
words on the page for example if I say
write a story I'm telling chat gbt hey I
want to you to make up a story for me so
this is something like this now let us
ask chat GPT hey so write is your action
verb all over here so this is the first
prompt structure that I would like you
to apply now the second one you could
give a theme or a topic about now if you
say just write a story chat GPT is going
to give any random story so we won't
want that the next thing that we cover
basically is topic or theme so what
theme or topic you are looking about
this is a part where you are giving chat
GPT a subject to talk about imagine
you're telling a friend let's talk about
cats so cats are the given topic so if I
say write about your favorite food I am
telling chat GPT tell me about your
favorite food so you have to always
include a topic or theme along with your
action work so here I can include some
certain thing like this
that write a
story about
food so you could see all over here chat
GPT has given two uh responses this is
response one and this is response to now
the third thing that comes up all over
here is constraints or
limitations think of constraints as a
rules or boundaries for chat gbt to
follow it's like saying you can talk
about cats but only in three sentences
so if I say write a poem in 20 words
it's like I'm telling Chad GB make a
short poem using only 20 words this is
one of the things that you have to
always keep in consideration regarding
what task you want to give so always
include constraints or limitations
fourth one is background or information
context
so this is also one of the most
important parameters uh what exactly it
means is like this Parts sets the scene
for JG like giving it a background story
imagine you are telling someone about a
movie before they watch it so if I say
imagine you are on a spaceship I'm
telling Chad GPT pretend like you are
flying through the space
so this is also very very important for
you to consider to give certain idea
regarding your background or
information now the fifth one is
conflict or challenge guys this adds
some spices to the prom it's like a
puzzle for a problem for chat GPT to
solve it's like saying talk about cats
but tell me why some people don't like
them so if I say CH GPT explain why
reading is important but you can't use
the word book I am challenging chat GPT
to be creative so this is where conflict
or challenge you have to give to chat
GPT now example let us take one example
on this so for example if I say the
action verb as right we'll highlight
this with red and the topic or theme
could be like your favorite
vacation if I talk about a background or
context like say you are on a
beach with your friends
or conflict or challenge we can give all
over here something like in just 50
words so guys this is certain thing to
follow while giving a prompt to char GPD
so in this way putting all together you
could combine all these three things and
form a sentence and this prompt is going
to be very very effective to solve the
problem of generic
responses now with the simple example
you can see how different components
come together to create engaging prompts
for chat GPD to work with so guys
whenever you are giving a prompt I would
request you to always follow this
structure so it's going to create a map
for you to get a more precise answer now
let's take a example and elaborate the
prompt library with examples to make it
more understandable so guys let's take
another example of text classification
so for text classification we'll take
the action verb as classify and our text
type would be product review example
could be classify the following text as
negative positive or neutral
sentiment and after that you could give
like the product
review
exceeded my expectation so if you give
certain thing like this you would say
this is a positive sence so making your
prompts in this manner with a proper
structure you are going to get a very
particular response which fits what you
need so always remember this structure
whenever you are framing any BR now
let's move to the second part that is
testing and validation guys testing and
iterating are essential steps in
refining prompts and ensuring Optimal
Performance from Chad gbd let us break
down this process the first process is
prompt validation so before using a
prompt it's crucial to test to ensure it
that it generates a desired response
accurately then you evaluate the output
you're going to generate responses using
using the prompt and evaluate the
quality relevance and coherence of the
output third check for errors look out
for any errors in consistencies or
unexpected behavior in the generated
responses compare against expectations
compare the generated responses against
your expectation or any requirements to
verify that they meet your desired
criteria the fifth one is solic set
feedback seek feedback from peers
colleagues or domain experts to validate
the effectiveness of the prom for
example like analyzing the results so
you would say analyze the results to
testing to identify areas of improvement
or refining The Prompt next is modifying
The Prompt based on the analysis make
the adjustment to The Prompt structure
next then fine-tune the parameters
experiment with different variations of
the prompt such as adjusting constraints
changing topics or refining prompt to
sess with the changes have resulted in
improvements in the quality of the
generated responses the fourth one is
testing test the modified prompt again
to assess whether the changes have
resulted in improvements in the quality
of the generated responses or not and
the final step is iterate as needed
iterate the testing and modification
process as needed until you achieve the
desired outcomes and generate high
quality responses consistently so this
structure you have to always follow when
you are iterating so I'll give you an
example so like we have given uh initial
prompt as right write a product
description for a new smartphone and I
would say include details about features
specifications and benefits and I would
say add a constant all over here that
keep the response in 100
words this is your initial prompt which
you are given now for
testing the next comes is testing
generate product descriptions using the
initial prompt evaluate the quality and
relevance of the generated descriptions
check for errors if inconsistencies or
missing information is there compare the
description against the expectations and
requirement so this process comes under
testing okay so give it uh like change
your prompt a little bit give a specific
uh description regarding a certain
product and you would ask that and just
next process would be evaluate the
quality and the relevance like what you
are uh getting as a response check for
errors like go to Google like see if
it's same is coming up then what's the
customer expectations regarding that
product so if the overall structure is
like technical structure is maintained
so this gives the first phase of testing
next one comes the analysis some
descriptions lack detail and Fa to
highlight its key features okay so in
the scenario the descriptions vary in
length and structure leading to kind of
inconsistencies certain descriptions
like here will focus more on technical
specifications than the user benefits so
overall the quality and the coherence of
the descriptions needs Improvement so
you have to take all these parameter and
you have to reframe your prompts okay
then next comes is iteration you have to
modify this prompt to provide like more
ofer to give a clear instructions and
emphasize the user benefits write a
captivating product descriptions for a
new smartphone okay then move to
retesting generate product descriptions
using the modified prompt and for the
outcome you would say that the Revis
prompt should yield more compelling and
informative product descriptions so this
is how you have to do iterate
continuously to get the proper response
like which you would be needing okay
guys now let's move to the final part of
this video that is utilizing the prompt
libraries guys utilizing prompt
libraries and resources is essential for
streamlining The Prompt writing process
and access a wide range of pre-designed
prompts for various use cases so you're
going to get a of a predefined prompts
okay so there's one website like which I
want to show you this is called entropic
so entropic has recently released a
prompt Library so guys they have given a
wide data of a prompt Library so if you
just click on this so you're going to
get like what are the effective prompts
in all these domains so give it a shot
uh try to see what are the uh like
resources you're going to get all over
here it definitely is going to fine tune
your responses now let's move to the
process so when we are talking about the
prompt libraries the first step is
explore the existing libraries so you
can see that I have given a reference to
a prompt Library all over here which is
released by anthropic team for cloud and
also workable for chat gbt next is you
have to understand the available prompts
familiarize yourself with the prompts
available in this library and including
their structures topics and constraints
you have to also analyze how prompts are
categorized and organized within the
library to quickly locate relevant
prompts for your needs third is adapt to
prompts to your needs customize existing
prompts to suit your specific objectives
audience and use cases you can modify
prompt by adjusting the action verbs
topics constraints or background
information which aligns with your
requirement create your own prompts like
combine different components such as
action verbs topics constraints to craft
prompts that addresses specific tasks or
challenges next process you have to do
is sharing and collaborating you will
share your prompts with the community to
contribute to the collective pool and
resources so this is one way of learning
that I really really want you to follow
now you have to keep experimenting and
iterating at the same time and finally
you have to see the documents and
organize all your prompts for the scene
so what you can do best is see all the
existing prompt libraries like I'll show
you one more so prompt Library
for
charb GitHub for all use
cases so you could see explore various
repositories and GitHub like what are
the uh kind of like prompts available
like this repo specifically focuses for
the academic writing so just visit this
uh repository and uh you could see they
have given a lot of things like for
brainstorming they say so you can see
the action verbs all over here try to
like uh uh try this prompt and see how
you are getting a response then for
article sections like what's it's there
so you're going to get a lot of like
things and uh more of the experiment and
more uh you are exploring the more idea
you are going to get regarding this same
so my advice would be just explore as
much as libraries you can and depending
upon your use cases you have to make an
organized prom structure so following
this format which I told you follows the
action verb the topic or the background
information then what are the
constraints you have to give okay it's
any particular theme is there you have
to include all those things and use the
existing prompt Library also so you can
refine your uh prompt and always to get
a good response it's my personal
experience that you have to keep
fine-tuning keep testing iterating
analyzing in so that your result comes
very fine so guys that was all for
