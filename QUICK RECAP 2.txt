hi friends this is dr. Strickland from
MDS conquer so here I'll be discussing
few important things which can be used
for you for the last-minute revision for
the okay the first one is abort cardio
inhibitory no fibers okay the cardia in
here between no fibers they belong to
parasympathetic and the second one is
about cardio inhibitory centered okay in
the center is located at Baro receptors
presented in carotid sinus which is
already discussed in the last video and
you have similarly you have another term
called as cardioinhibitory reflex okay
the name of the reflex is mace reflects
the basic ideology about this reflex is
whenever I mean this reflex is generally
get activated when there is increasing
in the 82 blood pressure so this
increasingly it will bad pressure is
going to stimulate stimulate the
baroreceptors so whenever this gets
stimulated the baroreceptors if the
paradise eptas are going to activate the
cardioinhibitory centers so that they
get activated so whenever they get
activated they increase the vagal tone
and this tone which leads to decreasing
in the heart rate I hope you are very
clear okay
the reflects if they get activated
whenever there is increasing in the
blood pressure so they stimulate the
baroreceptors which are nothing but the
inhibitory centers in the cardiac system
which increase the vagal tone and which
decreases the heart rate
