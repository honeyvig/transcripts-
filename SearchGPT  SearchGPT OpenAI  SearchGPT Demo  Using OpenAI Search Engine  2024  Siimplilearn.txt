on July 25th open AI introduce sir gbt a
new search tool changing how we find
information online unlike traditional
search engines which require you to type
in specific keywords sgbt lets you ask
question in natural everyday language
just like having a conversation so this
is a big shift from how we were used to
searching the web instead of thinking in
keywords and hoping to find the right
result you can ask now sir GB exactly
what you want to know and it will
understand the context and give you
direct answers it designed to make
searching easier and more intuitive
without going through links and pages
but with this new way of searching so
there are some important questions to
consider can sgbt compete with Google
The Sur giant we all know what makes
surity different from AI overviews
another recent tool and how does it
compare to chat GPT open AI popular
conversational AI so in this video we
are going to explore these questions and
more we will look at what makes rgbt
special how it it compares to other
tools and why it might change the way we
search for information whether you are
new into Tech or just curious this video
will break it down in simple words stick

description to FasTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back but before we start if you want to
learn Ai and ml from the industry expert
try a simply learn postgraduate program
in Ai and machine learning from py
University and collaboration with IBM
this code teaches in demand skills such
as machine learning deep learning NLP
com
reinforcement learning chat GPT and many
more so don't forget to check out the
course link from the description box
below and the pin comand so without any
further Ado let's get started so what is
sear GPT Ser GPT is a new search engine
prototype developed by open AI designed
to enhance the way we search for
information using AI unlike a typical
jetp like chat GPT search GPT isn't just
about having a conversation it's focused
on improving the search experience with
some key features the first one is
direct answer instead of Simply showing
you a list of links sgpt delivers direct
answer to your question for example if
you ask what is the best wireless noise
cancellation headphone in 2024 sir gbt
will summarize the top choices
highlighting their pros and cons based
on Expert reviews and user opinions so
this approach is different from the
traditional search engines that
typically provide a list of links
leading to various articles or videos
the second one is relevant sources SE
gbt responses come with clear citations
and links to the original sources
ensuring transparency and accuracy so
this way you can easily verify the
information and delve deeper into the
topic if you want the third one
conversational search sgb allows you to
have a back and fourth dialogue with the
search engine you can ask followup
questions or refine your original query
based on the responsive you receive
making your search experience more
interactive and personalized now let's
jump into the next topic which is Sir
GPT versus Google so sir GPT is being
talked about a major competitor to
Google in the future so let's break down
how they differ in their approach to
search the first one is conversational
versus keyword based search search gbt
uses a conversational interface allowing
user to ask question in natural language
and refine their queries through
follow-up question so this creates a
more interactive search experience on
the other hand Google relies on
keyword-based search
where user enter specific terms to find
relevant web pages the second thing is
direct answer versus list of links so
one of the sear gpts standout feature is
its ability to provide direct answers to
the question it summarizes information
from the various sources and clearly
sites them so you don't have to click
through multiple links Google typically
present a list of links leaving user to
shift through the result to find the
information they need the third one AI
powered understanding in versus keyword
matching serps uses AI to understand the
intent behind your question offering
more relevant result even if your query
isn't perfectly worded Google's primary
method is keyword matching which can
sometimes lead to less accurate result
especially for complex queries the
fourth one Dynamic context versus
isolated searches so search gbt
maintains content across multiple
interaction allowing for more
personalized responses whereas Google
treats e search as separate query
without remembering previous interaction
and the last one real time information
versus index web pages Serge is aim to
provide the latest information using
real-time data from the web whereas
Google V index is comprehensive but may
include outdated or less relevant
information so now let's jump into the
next topic which is serd versus AI
overviews so serd and AI overuse both
use AI but they approach search and
information delivery differently it's
all also worth noting that both tools
are still being developed so their
features and capabilities May evolve and
even overlap as they grow so here are
the differences the first one is Source
attribution Ser gbt provides clear and
direct citation linked to the original
sources making it easy for user to
verify the information whereas AI
overviews include links the citation may
not always be clear or directly
associated with specific claims the
second one is transparency control sgbt
promises greater transparency by
offering Publishers control over how
their content is used including the
option to opt out of AI training AI
overviews offer less transparency
regarding the selection of content and
the summarization process used the next
one is scope and depth sgbt strives to
deliver detailed and comprehensive
answers pulling from a broad range of
sources including potential multimedia
content and in AI overviews offers a
concise summary of key points often with
links for further exploration but with a
more limited scope now let's jump into
the next part Ser GPT versus CH gbt sgbt
and sgbt both developed by open AI share
some core features but serve different
purposes so here are some differences
the first one is primary purpose Serb
designed for search providing direct
answer and sources from the web whereas
chity focus on conversational AI
generating text responses the second one
is information sources
s GPT relies on realtime information
from the web whereas sh GPT knowledge
based on the training data which might
not be current the third one is response
format Ser GB prioritize concise answers
with citation and Source links so
whereas s GPT is more flexible
generating longer text summarizes
creative content code and Etc the next
feature is use cases Serge idle for fact
finding research and task requiring
upto-date information whereas CHP is
suitable for creative writing
brainstorming drafting emails and other
openend dat Tas so now question arises
when will sgbt be released sgbt is
currently in a limited prototype phase
meaning it's not yet widely available
open AI is testing with a select group
to gather feedback and improve the tool
so if you are interested in trying Serb
so you can join the weight list on its
web page but you will need a chgb
account a full public release by the end
of 202 four is unlikely as open ey
hasn't set a timeline it's more probable
that Serb features will gradually added
to the chat ZD in 2024 or in 2025 with
the potential Standalone release later
based on testing and the feedback so
