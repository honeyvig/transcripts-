knowledge for writing clean code for any
assigned problem the book also covers
practical examples to understand and
learn every coding aspect moving on next
in the list at number two we have
thinking like a programmer this book was
written by the author V Anton Sproul and
published in the year 2012. it is one of
the most preferred coding books to start
a coding career to become a professional
programmer
which includes some of the most
important coding basic for the learner
to understand the working of a program
this book guides the Learners problem
solving capacity and thinking patterns
for the given problem
it also assists with all the basic
coding topics like pointers classes and
algorithms to build a strong coding base
for the learner the book also covers the
data structure of a program under
organized and well-defined examples
now last but not the least the book at
the top of this list at number one
position we have clean code written by
the author Robert C Martin in 2008 this
specifically designed book will guide
you through becoming a professional
quota with strong algorithmic and
thinking skills with the assistance of
multiple explained examples mentioned
for a better understanding of the
learner let's take a look at some of the
features of this book
the book clean code assist the learner
with writing clean code for assigned
project and consolidating the according
knowledge
it includes patterns and techniques to
write clean code along with multiple
case studies for the learner to take
insights for the project
this book also provides tips for
detecting errors and bugs in the program
score and provides information on how to
handle such issues which is your
favorite book on the list share your
views in the comment section now let's
look at some of the more popular coding
books to begin our coding Journey which
are the art of computer programming it
is one of the most opted books for
starting a coding Journey as it guides
the learner with programming knowledge
through well-designed examples this book
includes understanding the working of
algorithms for coded examples to
multiple well explained examples the
book also includes insights into concept
of programming and data structures the
next book is Introduction to algorithm
and is also one of the most popular
coding books for learning modern
computer algorithms for understanding
programming knowledge this
well-organized book will assist the
learner with explanation of multiple
coding techniques and algorithms for a
better understanding of coding patterns
it also initializes the design and
Analysis of algorithms that are
explained to all Learners through
examples but this we have completed our
