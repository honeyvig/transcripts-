a 1968 newspaper article predicted that
people would be able to carry their
telephones in their pocket in the future
and here we are in the 21st century with
the smartphones that are able to do much
more than just a phone call the world is
advancing in technology at an
unprecedented rate and the future looks
more promising than ever you're already
watching simply learn and here we are
today with the list of top 10 future
Technologies for 2023. before we begin
kindly consider subscribing to Simply
learn and hit the Bell icon to never
miss out trending videos so if you are a
technology geek here is a question for
you which of the following companies
invented their first cell phone is it
Nokia Samsung Motorola or Nippon let us
know your answer in the comment section
below and get a heart from Simply learn
so without any further Ado let's begin
this session on the top 10 future
Technologies for 2023 at number 10 we
have extended reality and metaverse
extended reality is the interaction
between humans and computer generated
graphics the major application of
extended reality or XR can be seen in
the gaming industry extended reality is
important for good user experience in
The Meta words if you are not aware of
metaverse then let me tell you metaverse
focuses on the virtual world in which
users can interact with other users in
the computer graphic environment in 2020
the market of extended reality was
valued at 25.84 billion US Dollars and
is estimated to reach
397.81 billion dollars by the end of
2026 with a cagr of 57.91 some big is in
the industry that often works with
extended reality includes Google
Qualcomm Samsung Microsoft and Apple as
XR technology is emerging day by day the
industry's demand for XR expert is
increasing to keep abreast of the
technology let's focus on the future
technology trending on number nine
digital trust building trust digitally
is really important these days it
ensures customer data protection and
makes purchasing experience secure as
per the survey by Economic Times 40
percent of Asia Pacific organizations
believe that having good digital trust
helps in Faster Innovation and better
digital Solutions moreover twenty
percent of organizations believe that
digital trust is responsible for
increasing Revenue this makes a point of
interest to know what digital trust is
digital trust can be stated as the
user's confidence in the ability of
people processes and Technology the few
benefits of the digital trust includes a
positive repetition of Industries fewer
cyber security events customer loyalty
and much more companies like extender
voice exceed security and many more are
already in action to provide solution
for digital trust thus creating various
job opportunities the market of digital
trust is estimated to increase from 270
billion dollars to 537 billion dollars
by the end of 2027. moving forward with
our next future technology Quantum
Computing Quantum Computing uses the
properties of quantum physics to perform
calculations and simulations that would
not be possible on traditional machines
Quantum Computing is not just a research
experiment anymore and instead now a
tool that's changing the face of several
Industries including medicine biology
and climate change big names like
Microsoft Google IBM and Intel are in
the race to build Quantum Computing
tools to learn Quantum Computing you
need to know programming mathematics
machine scientific Computing and
algorithms reports state that the
quantum Computing Market is established
to reach
411.4 million dollar by 2026 with a cagr
of 24.2 percent the next technology on
our bucket list is completely different
from what we have discussed till now
which is genomics Gene technology
genomics is a branch of biology that
deals with structures functions mapping
Innovation and genome editing it is
mainly used to identify disease-causing
pathogens in humans to understand rare
genetic factors in more the Human Genome
Project is one of the best example of
genomics popular companies working in
genomics are Illumina Thermo Fisher
Scientific and bgi genomics
the average base pay of the genome
scientist is around 94 000 US dollar per
year the market size of genomics is
estimated to reach 54.4 billion dollar
with a cagr of 19 percent by 2025. now
coming to our next widget technology
which is blockchain distributed Ledger
blockchain is one of the Contemporary
Technologies with a bright future it has
been a revolution in almost every sector
banking health care and politics are a
few industries that may profit from
establishing a decentralized digital
Ledger that monitors and save data in
several locations making forgeries
difficult
companies that uses blockchain are HSBC
Barclays Walmart and Pfizer to name a
few blockchain developers need to know
Concepts like cryptography data
structures and computer networking the
report state that by 2023 the market
evaluation of blockchain is expected to
reach 19.9 billion dollars with a cagr
of 42.8 percent next on the list we have
is Edge Computing Edge Computing is more
of architecture rather than technology
it is distributed computing pattern that
brings data storage and computation
closer to the data source thereby
improving the response time and saving
the bandwidth Edge Computing is
considered to be an important factor for
the success of the 5G and iot industries
you will hear the big names like AWS
Google Cloud HP and IBM associated with
Edge Computing as per the demand of H
compute shooting increases job
opportunities are also increasing on
number four we have li-fi we all know
that Wi-Fi provides a wireless internet
facilities but have you ever heard about
a light doing the same thing you have
turned on a lamp and you get a internet
access on your devices this is no
possible due to li-fi technology the
term life I was first introduced by
Harold has in the past decade li-fi is a
wireless technology that enables the
transmission of data through light the
major benefits of using this technology
is that the speed of li-fi will be 100
times faster when compared to the speed
of Wi-Fi li-fi is expected to be used in
underwater vehicles and street lights
this will help in better communication
with smart Vehicles some well-known
li-fi companies are signified OLED com
and pure li-fi creating several job
opportunities in the industry regarding
Market size of this technology li-fi is
estimated to reach from
127.66 million dollars to 15 310 million
dollars with a cagr of 51 percent by the
end of 2030. the next future technology
that we will be focusing on is 4D
printing 4D printing technology is
somewhat similar to 3D printing however
the difference is when we talk about the
material and the ability to change its
shape the design and special materials
used in 4D printing are computer
programmed moreover the print is able to
change its shape it is estimated that 4D
printing technology may play an
important role in the healthcare
Aerospace and automobile Industries 4D
printing technology is used by many
organizations like Autodesk MIT and more
the market value of 4D printing is
estimated to reach 537 million dollars
with a cagr of 42.95 percent by the end
of 2025 though the use of 4D printing is
not common in the present situation in
the next few years it will be the most
used technology coming to the next
contender in our list at position 2
which is human
human augmentation is a field that
implements the development of
Technologies and their application that
helps in enhancing human abilities say
for example with human augmentation a
person with amputated fingers may get
fully functional fingers Prosthetics
just like a normal human such
Innovations are taking medical sciences
and Technologies to another level
which is predicted to be increasing more
and more in the future sub big names
contributed in the growth of this
technology includes
exobionics Google LLC with X Corporation
and Garmin limited the market size of
human augmentation is estimated to reach
498 billion dollar with a cagr of 23
percent by the end of 2028. next and
number one on the list is the present
and the future of technology is AI and

thanks to the powerful AI used by
Google's assistant AI or artificial
intelligence is the top most trending
Technologies these days
it enables machines to think and act
like humans Brands like Tesla
continuously works with AI Technologies
to give the world the best products like
self-driving cars some other top
companies using AI as their core
technology includes Google Amazon apple
and Microsoft the market value of AI is
projected to reach 42.4 billion dollar
with a cagr of 29.75 percent this is all
about the 10 future Technologies for
year 2023 so if you plan to educate
