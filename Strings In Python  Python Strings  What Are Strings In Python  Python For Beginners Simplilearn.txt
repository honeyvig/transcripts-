hi everyone welcome you all to this
video on the python series by simply
loan
in today's video we will learn about
strings in python
but before i begin make sure to
subscribe to the simple one channel to
learn interesting tech videos
let's have a look at the agenda for
today
so we'll understand what is a string in
python and how to create strings in
python
then we look at the different string
methods and how to
perform string indexing
and
all these will see with the help of
hands-on demonstrations on the jupyter
notebook
so let's understand what is a string
so a string in python is an object that
represents a sequence of characters
in python we have str as the data type
of string
now you can create strings
using single quotes or double quotes so
here is an example
where we have used a single quote to
write a string so our string is hello
india which is inside a single quote
below if you see we have the same string
written within double quotes so these
are the two methods in which you can
create strings in python
now you can also use triple quotes which
are generally for multi-line strings or
doc strings
so here is an example we have a string
called str3
and
the content it has is human psychology
is an interesting subject now if you
print the string it will be printed in
two lines and not in a single line
now we'll be exploring much more in
detail in our demo session so please
wait for a while
next we have string indexing so if you
want to extract a few characters from
your string you can use the indexing
method
so in python
a string starts with the
index number 0
so here we have a string which is
healthy
and
the first element is present at the
zeroth index so at the bottom you see
the forward index on the top we have the
reverse index or the negative indexes
so in python as i said the first index
is at the zeroth position so h is at
zero
e is at the first index a is at the
second index so on and so forth
now similarly if you look at negative
indexing it starts with minus 1 in
reverse order so we have minus 1
for y minus 2 for h minus 3 for t and so
on and so forth
now let's head over to our jupyter
notebook where we'll
learn about strings in python in detail
okay so i'm on my jupyter notebook first
i'll create a
new notebook i'll click on new and then
select python3
okay
so here let me
rename my notebook as
strings in python demo
i'll click on rename
okay
now let's start with our first example
i'll create a variable called str1 that
will have a string you can see here i am
using single quotes now i'll write
hi
sam
so here
str1 is holding a string called hi sam
and let's go ahead and print the string
str1
i'll hit shift enter to run it you see
here i have my string printed hi sam
now if you want to check the
data type that str1 holds
you can use the type function
and inside the type function i'll pass
in my variable str1
if i run it you see here it gives us str
which means
it is of type string
now let's create another string str2
using double quotes this time so i'll
write let's say
hello
angela
i can give exclamation mark
okay now let's just print the
second string you see here this is my
second string which is
hello angela if you want you can also
use the print function here
and run it you get hello angela
now let's
write a multi-line string using triple
quotes so i'll write str3 equal to
i'll use triple quotes
and then
i'll say
hi everyone
go to the next line i'll write today
we will
learn
about
i'll go to the next line and i'll write
strings in python
then i'll again give triple quotes to
close my string
and let's just print this str3
if i run it you can see it here i have
now written a multi-line string hi
everyone today we will learn about
strings in python let me just add a s
there you go
okay
now coming to the next topic we'll learn
about indexing
all right
let me declare a string str1
which has
value as simply loan
now
to use indexing and extract
certain
items in a string or values in a string
you can use square brackets and inside
the square brackets you can give the
index
position for example if i write str1
and in the square bracket i'll give
let's say
i want to
find the element or the value present at
the zeroth index let's run it it gives
me s
because as we
learnt in the slides
the first index in a string
starts with the zeroth number
so i have s in my zeroth index so hence
it has printed s
let's explore a few more if i write str1
of let's say i want to know what is
present at the third index if i run it
it gives me p you can check now
so s is at the zeroth index i is at the
first index m is at the second index and
p is at the third index
let's say i'll write str1 of
let's say 12
we can see the difference now it gives
us an error it says string index out of
range the reason being simply learn
does not have any value at the 12th
index so it's printing an error saying
string index out of range
now let's change this to
6 and see what we have at the sixth
index we have l
if you count here
s is at the
zeroth index i is at the first index m
is at the second index p is at the third
index
the first l
is at the fourth index again i is at the
fifth index and then we have the second
l at this sixth index so we have l
printed here
now
let's see how to use
the slicing operator using colon i'll
write
slicing operator
okay
i'll use the same string str1 let me
print it once again we have simply
learned
suppose i write str1
within brackets i'll use the slicing
technique now i want everything starting
from the zeroth index
i get simply learn so here i'm printing
everything that starts with the 0th
index
next let's see
what we have
if i print my string str1
and write 1s2 6
i'll run it
it gives me impli
so if you notice here
i want to extract whatever is present
from the first index
till the sixth index but excluding the
sixth index so in python
the indexing method or the slicing
method will exclude the last index so
here if you see
i is at the first index m is at the
second index
p is at the third index
l is at the fourth index
and then we have i at the fifth index
and we have excluded the sixth index
that is the second l so hence it has
written us impli
now similarly let's see
we'll see another example i'll write
str1
this time i'll use colon
six
if i run it you get
simply so it has printed everything
starting from the zeroth index till
the sixth index but excluding the sixth
index so you have all these values
from zeroth index till the fifth index
okay
now you can also
reverse a string for that you can use
negative slicing using
two colons
if i write print
str1
and within square brackets i'll give
colon colon -1
let's run and see the result
there you go if you see this it has
printed my original string which is
simply learning reverse order now
so this is a very simple method if
someone asks you to reverse a string or
print something in reverse order you can
use the negative slicing method
now let's explore a few more example
if i write str1
and within brackets i'll give minus 1
and run it
it returns me n because in my original
string if i go on the top i have n at
the last index which is
here minus 1.
similarly let's see what we have at
minus
3.
we have a here if i go to the top
you see here
n is at minus 1 r is at minus 2 and a is
at -3 and hence it has given us a
now let's say i'll write str1
i want to print
minus 2
colon and let's see the result it has
given us
r and n
so here we are printing
only the
last two elements in the string hence we
have used minus two
okay
now
python does not allow you to reassign
values
in a declared string let me show you
what i mean
i'll give a comment here reassign
strings
suppose
i have the same string str1 which is
simply learn
say i write str
and i want to replace
the value
present at the third index with let's
say
o
and
if i were to print
str1 now
python will throw an error
saying str object does not support item
assignment
so it is immutable
like tuples where you cannot reassign
any values
you can also
delete a string
see i have another string called str2
which has a value of
let's say python programming
you can use the dl keyword
and write str2
and now let's print
str2 you will see
that
it says name str2 is not defined because
we have already deleted str2
the above stuff
okay
now let's go ahead and see some of the
important string operations
okay
see i have
str1
which has
python
now one thing to note i'm using either
single quote or double quote you can use
whatever you want
let's say i have another string which
has programming
so these are my two strings
let's
perform a few operations on these
strings
see i write
str1
multiplied by 3
and i'll run it
you can see here it has printed python
thrice because i have said str1
multiplied by 3 so in str1 we have
python
and multiplying 3 returns python 3 times
now let's see i'll write str1
plus str1
it has merged python twice so i have
python and python repeated
let's say i write str1 plus str2
we see the result it gives us python
programming so basically
if you use
the plus operator with two strings
python will perform a concatenation
operation which means it will merge both
the strings
now if you want to find if a specific
character is present in a string or not
you can use the in operator for this
let's say i'll print
whether
w
is
present in
str
one
if i run it it gives us false because in
str1 we have python
and if you see here we don't have the
letter w in python and hence it has
given us false
let's
now let me copy this
i'll paste it here
let's try whether o is there in
string one or not it gives us true
because we have
an o here
you can see here we have an o
similarly
let's say
i want to find whether
l a
is there in string
two or not
on it it gives us false because in
string two we have programming and we
don't have any l a
present in programming
let's say we'll see whether r o is
present in
string two or not
this time it returns us true because if
you see here we have ro in programming
and hence it has given us
true
now you can also
print a raw string using the
r alphabet
so the way to write is i'll write r
give a
single quote
let's say i'll give a location
c drive
to forward slash and let's say i'll
write
python 3.7
and run it it gives me a raw string
now
let's see some formatting methods i'll
write a comment saying
format methods
okay
i'll write a print statement
i'll give double quotes and here
let's see the first example where i'm
using
curly braces i'll write
and i'll give another curly braces
you'll get to know what i'm doing once i
finish this
let's say
i have a message
both are
best
friends
then i'm going to use my format
method
and inside this i'll pass in my two
values for these braces
so these curly braces will be replaced
by
the words that i
pass in or the values that i pass in
within the format method
so here i'll write let's say
james
and my second person would be
brad now let me run it you see here
what python does is it replaces
the curly braces with
the names that have passed within the
format method so it takes the first
argument for the first curly brace
and the second argument for the second
curly brace
so
my statement becomes
james and brad
both are best friends
now let me just copy this i will show
you another example
this time i'll
give 1 and
0 inside the curly braces
now if i run this
there you go
so here
james is at the zeroth index so this is
basically a list where james is at the
zeroth index and brad is at the first
index so if i write 1 and 0 it will take
brad here
and then
for 0 it will take james so now my
message becomes brad and james both are
best friends
now let's try out another example i'll
paste it here
i'll use
two variables let's say a and b
and inside my format method
i'll write a
equal to james
and i'll assign b as brad
let's run it
there you go we have our message printed
james and brad both are best friends so
here a refers to james and b refers to
brad
cool
let's explore another example
i have a variable called name and that
has a value
angela
and then i have another variable
that's a salary
of
100 000
i'll use a print statement
i'll print a message
her
name
is
i'll use
percentage
s for string
give
a backslash n for next line and i'll
write
her
salary
is
then i'll write
percentage d
this is for numbers
and then i'll give another percentage
and let's see i'll write
my two variables name and salary
let's
see what we have in the
result
i need to close my double quotes here
i'll exclude it from here let's run it
there you go
so i have my message here her name is
angela her salary is
hundred thousand dollars
i'll just
delete this piece here we'll run it
again okay
now this percentage s
refers to the name
and we have declared her name is angela
so my first statement or the message
becomes her name is angela
and the next
message is her salary is percentage t so
percentage d here refers to the salary
where we have hundred thousand
so the next message is her salary is
hundred thousand
so these are the very basic and
important
print methods or formats that you can
use
while working with strings
now we'll explore a few
functions that are readily available in
python to operate with strings
i'll take my same string str1 as simply
learn
and then
i'll create another variable called str2
i'll write str1 dot
i'm going to use the
capitalize method
okay let me make one correction i'm
going to write everything in
lowercase so that we can see the
difference how we can capitalize the
string
so i'll write my print statement print
old value
this is going to my message
i'll give a colon
followed by my double quotes and i'll
pass in my variable str1
okay
now i'll copy this
in the next line we have
a new value as str2
let's run it and see the difference
there you go so here my old value has
simply learned in all
lower case but
when i used the capitalize method
so python has converted my first letter
and simply learn to
uppercase or capital keys
cool
now let me copy this
i'm going to use the same example
for
the next three methods
let me show you how the case fold method
works
this time i'm going to pass my input
string in all uppercase i'll write
simplylearn in uppercase
and instead of capitalize i'll write
case fold
let's run it and see the difference
there you go
initially we had simply learn in
upper case and now we have converted
into case fold so
all the letters are in lower case
now moving ahead
you can also
use the
upper method to convert a string into
uppercase
let's say i have a string
where
few of the letters are in uppercase and
few of the letters are in lowercase
this time i am going to convert
everything into uppercase so i'll use
the upper function instead of case fold
let's run and see the result there you
go so this time
python has converted my original string
into upper case
and likewise you can also use the lower
case
instead of upper if i write lower you
see here everything has been converted
to lower case
cool
okay
now i'll show you how the
title method works so in title method
all the words
basically the first letter of all the
words will be in upper case so suppose i
have
a string
which is
simply learn
company so i'll write
let's say
this is my string and i'll
i'll convert my str1 to title keys
let me run it
so this is the difference you can see
the first letter of the first word is
upper case
again
the first letter of the second word is
also in uppercase so this is how the
title
case works
you can also count the occurrences of a
particular element in a string
suppose i have string one
that has python programming
in str2
i'll write str1 dot
and use the count function to count how
many times let's say n the letter n is
present
then i'll print
saying
occurrences
give a colon here
and then i'll pass in my variable that
is str2 so this will count the number of
times
n is present in my original string so if
you see here
in python programming we have n present
twice
similarly let's check for
g
the letter g is also present
twice
let's see for y
now y is present only once
which you can see here
okay
next
let's see how the
replace function works in
python
i am giving a comment as replays
so let's say i have a string str1
which has
hamburg
is
located in
france
so hamburg is a city which is actually
located in
germany and not in france so using the
replace method we are going to replace
france with germany
so what i'll do is i'll create another
string str2 equal to i'll write str1 dot
and then i'll
use the replace function
and i'll say replace
my string france
with
country
germany
and then we'll print str2 and see the
result
there you go
so we have changed
hamburg is located in france to hamburg
is located in
germany now coming to the final method
that we are going to explore in this
python strings demo which is
using the split function
okay
so you can split the values for each
word in a string as separate
words
and store it in the form of a list
so i
write str1
i'll just copy this
i'll paste it here
and i'll change france to germany
because hamburg is actually present in
germany and not in france
and then i'll create another variable
called str2
i'll write str1 dot
and then use the split function
now let me print both the strings first
i'll print str1
and then i'll print
str2
if i run it
you see
my original string was hamburg is
located in germany and then using the
split function we have
segregated or divided
each of the words present in the
original string into separate words and
this time it is present in the form of a
list
ok
