box and pin comments so without further
Ado let's get started so let's start
with the first question what is SQL SQL
stands for structured query language
it's a programming language used to
manage and manipulate databases with SQL
you can query update insert and delete
data in a database imagine it as a
librarian who knows where every book in
a library is when you need information
you ask the librarian and they fetch it
for you similarly with SQL you write
queries to get the data you need from a
database for example to find all the
customers in a database who live in New
York you would write select star from
customers where City is equal to New
York now this is a query so this command
tells the database to find all the
records in the customer table where the
city is New York SLE is essential
because it provides a consistent way to
interact with relational databases which
store data in structured tables now the
second question is what is a database
now a database is an organized
collection of data stor electronically
think of it as a digital filing cabinet
where you can store and retrieve inform
information quickly managed by database
Management systems or dbms databases
allow you to use SQL to interact with
data for example an online bookstore
uses a database to keep track of books
authors customers and orders so tables
like books customers and orders stored
all the necessary information secet
queries help the bookstore to find in
stock books top customers a total sales
easily now let's move on to the next
question what is ddl or data definition
language so ddl primarily stands for
data definition language which is a
subset of SQL that deals with the
management of database structures it
includes commands for defining and
modifying the structure of database
objects such as tables indexes and
constraints now here are some key ddl
commands create which is used to create
new databased objects like tables
indexes or views the second one is Alter
which modifies existing database objects
such as adding deleting or modifying
columns in a table next we have drop
which deletes an entire database object
such as a table or index so ddl commands
are crucial for database administrators
and developers to manage the structure
of databases effectively they allow for
the creation modification and deletion
of database objects ensuring the
database remains organized and optimized
for data storage and
retrieval now let's move on to the next
question which is what do you mean by
DML or data manipulation
language so data manipulation language
is a subset of SQL used for managing
data within database objects so unlike
data definition language which focuses
on defining database structures DML
deals with retrieving inserting updating
and deleting data stored in the database
tables so here are some key DML commands
the first one is Select which retrieves
data from one or more tables based on
specified criteria next you have insert
which adds new rows of data into a table
then you have update which modifies
existing data in a table and at last you
have delete which removes rows of data
from a table so DML commands are
essential for applications to interact
with and manipulate the data stored in
databases they allow users to perform
tasks such as querying for specific
information adding new records updating
existing ones and deleting unnecessary
data now let's see what the fifth
question
is what do you mean by a foreign key so
forign key in the context of databases
is a column or a set of columns that
establishes a link between two tables in
a relational database so it represents a
relationship between two tables where a
value in the for and key column of one
table matches a primary key value in
another table so this relationship helps
enforce referential Integrity between
the table tables ensuring that every
forign key value points to an existing
primary key value in the reference table
for example consider two tables orders
and customers so the orders table may
have a column named customer ID which is
a for in key referencing the customer ID
column in the customers table this forq
relationship ensures that every customer
ID in the orders table corresponds to
valid customer ID in the customer's
table thereby maintaining consistency
and integrity of the data so now let's
move on to the next question what are
table and field so in the context of
databases a table is a fundamental
structure in a relational datab base
that organizes data into rows and
columns each table represents a
collection of relatable data entries
table consists of columns and rows
columns Define the types of data that
can be stored in each field such as
integers strings dates Etc tables are
used to store and organize data in a
structured manner facilitating efficient
data retrieval manipulation and
storage now a field also referred to as
a column is a vertical element within a
table that represents a specific
attribute a property of the data being
stored each column in a table has a name
and a data type that defines the kind of
data it can hold such as numbers text
dates or binary data fields are the
building blocks of tables and Define the
structure of the data stored within the
table for example consider students
table so in this example student ID
first name last name date of birth and
grade are Fields or columns within the
students table each storing specific
information about each student record
tables and fields are fundamental
concepts and relational databases
allowing for efficient organization
storage and retrieval of structured data
now moving on to the seventh question
what is
normalization so normalization is a
process of organizing data in a database
efficiently to reduce redundancy and
depend deny it involves breaking down
large tables into smaller related tables
and defining relationships between them
now the main goal of normalization are
to minimize data redundancy ensure data
consistency and improve data Integrity
so in simpler terms normalization helps
to structure data in such a way that
avoids storing the same information
multiple times and reduces the
likelihood of errors or inconsistencies
in the database so typically involves
dividing large tables into smaller ones
and establishing relationship between
them using keys like primary key and
foring keys to ensure data is stored
logically and efficiently now what is a
query so query is a command used to
retrieve update or manipulate data
stored in a database it's written in a
query language like SQL and specifies a
criteria for selecting or modifying data
according to the user's needs for
example a simple query might retrieve
all records from a table while more
complex queries can filter data based on
specific conditions or perform
calculations queries are essential for
interacting with databases and
retrieving meaningful information
efficiently now let's move on to the
ninth question which is what are the
different operators available in SQL SQL
operators are special symbols or
keywords used to perform operations on
data they can be categorized into
several types let's go through them with
examples the first one is arithmetic
operators which perform mathematic
operations like addition subtraction
multiplication and division then you
have have comparison operators which
compare two values and return a Boolean
result which is equal not equal greater
than less than and so on then you have
logical operators which combine multiple
conditions such as and or or not then
you have bitse operators which perform
bit level operations like bitwise and
bitwise or Etc then you have set
operators which Combine results of two
quedes like Union Union all intersect
and accept and then you have other
operators like between in isal
ETC so these were the operators in SQL
now the 10th question is what are user
defined functions in SQL so user defined
functions or udfs in SQL or custom
functions created by users to perform
specific tasks unlike built-in SQL
functions udfs are tailored to meet
particular requirements of your
application or business logic they can
be used to encapsulate complex
calculations or repetitive tasks making
your SQL code more modular and easier to
maintain now there are two types of udfs
which the first one is scalar functions
so these functions return a single value
such as an integer float or string then
you have table valued functions these
return a table which can be used like a
regular table in SQL queries now the
next question is what is an alas command
in SQL so an alas in SQL is a temporary
name given to a table or a column in a
SQL query this helps to make your SQL is
more readable and easier to understand
so think of it as a nickname for a
column or table that you use just for
the duration of the query so here's how
you can use alas with columns and tables
column alas you use a column alas to
rename a column in your quy result this
is useful for making column names more
readable or for when you want to rename
columns in your output so the query you
can give is select first name as first
last name as last from employees so in
this question first name is given the
Alias first and last name is given the
alas last so the result will show these
aliases as the column headers now we
have table aliases you use a table alas
to rename a table in your query this is
particularly useful in complex queries
involving joints where it can help
shorten the query and improve
readability so for example you have this
query so in this following query the
employees is given the AL as e and
department is given the AL as D this
makes the query shorter and easier
easier to follow so hope you understood
this now let's move on to the next
question which is what is ETL in SQL so
ETL stands for extract transform and
load so it's a process used in database
management and data where housing to
move data from one or more sources to
the destination system usually a data
warehouse or database where it can be
used for analysis and Reporting let's
break down each part of ETL first one is
extract so this is the first step where
data is extracted from various Source
systems then you have transform so once
the data is extracted it needs to be
transformed to fit the structure and
format of the destination system so this
step can include cleaning the data
aggregating it and Performing
calculations or conversions and at last
you have load which is a final step
which is loading the transform data into
the target database or data
warehouse now the next question is how
to copy tables in SQL so copying tables
in SQL is a common task whether you are
duplicating data for backup purposes
testing or creating a new table based on
an existing one there are a few methods
to copy tables and I'll guide you
through the most straightforward ones
with examples so the select into
statement is a simple way to copy the
structure and data of a table into a new
table so for example you can give this
query so this command creates a new
table called new table with the same
structure and data as existing table now
what are union minus and intersect
command
s so these commands are used to combine
the results of two or more queries in
different ways let's dive in and
understand each of them with examples
the first one is Union so the union
command is used to combine the results
of two or more select queries into a
single result set it removes duplicate
rows between the combined results so for
example this query combines the first
names from the employees table and the
customer table into a single list
removing any duplicates
next we have minus so the minus command
also known as accept command in some SQL
dialects is used to return the results
from the first query that are not
present in the second query so for
example this query returns first names
that are in the employees table but not
in the customer's table next you have
intersect so the intersect command is
used to return the common results from
two or more select queries it includes
only the rows that are present in all
queries for example this query returns
first names that are present in both the
employees table and the customer's table
now let's move on to the next question
which is what is a SQL injection so SQL
injection is a code injection technique
that attackers use to exploit
vulnerabilities in an application
software by injecting malicious SQL code
so this can allow attackers to read
modify or even delete data in the
database without proper authorization so
SQL injection typically happens when an
application takes user input and inserts
it directly into an SQL query without
proper validation of sanitization so
let's look at an example to understand
this better so imagine you're having a
simple loging form where users enter
their username and password the
application might use a SQL query like
this to check the credentials so if the
application directly inserts user input
into the query an attacker could input
something like the second query so since
one is equal to one is always true the
query returns all ruls in the users
table potentially giving the attacker
access to the system without a valid
password now what is Auto increment so
Auto increment is a feature in SQL that
automatically generates a unique number
whenever the new record is inserted into
a table so this is particularly useful
for creating primary keys where each
record needs a unique identifier so when
you define a column with an
autoincrement attribute the database
automatically assigns a unique value to
that column for each new row the value
usually starts at one and increments by
one for each subsequent row although you
can customize a starting point and
increment value so let's look at a
simple example to understand how
autoincrement works so imagine you are
creating a table to store information
about employees you want each employee
to have a unique ID so in this example
the employee ID column is a set to Auto
increment this means that when you
insert a new employees into the table
you don't need to specify the employee
ID value the database will handle it for
you now the next question is what is the
default constraint so the default
constraint in SQL is used to provide a
default value for a column when no value
is specified during the insertion of a
new record so this helps ensure that
your table always has meaningful data
even if some fields are left blank
during data entry so when you define a
column with the default constraint the
database will automatically insert the
specified default value if no other
values provided for that column so let's
look at an example to understand how the
default constraint works so imagine
you're creating a table to store
information about products and you want
to default stock quantity to be zero if
not specified so in this example the
stock quantity column is given a default
constraint with a value of zero this
means that if you insert a new product
without specifying the stock quantity it
will automatically be set to zero now
let's move on to the next question what
is the difference between the between
and in operators in
SQL so both between and in operators are
used to filter query results based on
certain conditions but they serve
different purposes and are used in
contexts let's break it down the between
operator is used to filter the results
set within a certain range it can be
used with numbers text or dates the
range specified includes both the start
and end values so imagine you have a
table called sales with a column sales
amount you want to find all sales that
are between1 and
$500 so in this query between filters
the results to include only those
records where the sales amount is
between 100 and 500
inclusive so in operators used to filter
the result set based on a list of
specified values it allows users to
specify multiple values in a wear clause
for example let's say you have a
customer table and you want to find
customers who are from either New York
Los Angeles or Chicago so in this query
in filters the results to include only
those records where the city is either
New York Los Angeles or Chicago now
let's move on to the 19th
question what is the difference between
a primary key and unique constraints so
both primary key and unique constraints
are used to ensure that data in a
database remains unique but they have
distinct characteristics and uses so
let's explore each of them in detail so
a primary key is a constraint that
uniquely identifies each record in a
table it's a column or a combination of
columns that ensures all rows in the
table are unique and not null then you
have unique constraint so a unique
constraint also ensures that all values
in a column or a set of columns are
unique however unlike a primary key a
table can have multiple unique
constraints and columns with unique
constraints can contain null
values now what is a join and SQL and
what are the types of joints so a join
and SQL is a way to combine rows from
two or more tables based on a related
column between them joins are used to
fetch data from multiple tables and
present it as a single result set so
there are several types of joints each
serving a specific purpose let's dive
into the main type Ty of joints with
examples inner joint so an inner joint
returns only the rows where there is a
match in both tables left outer joint so
left join returns all rows from the left
table and the match rows from the right
table so if no matches found null values
are returned for columns from the right
table then you have right outer joint so
right join ensures all rows from the
right table and the match rows from the
left table if no matches found null
values are returned for columns from the
left table and at last you have have
full outer John so full John returns all
rows when there is a match in either the
left or right table so if there is no
match null values are returned for
colums where there is no
match now the 21st question is what is
that index so an index in a database is
like a road map that helps quickly find
specific information in a table so
normally data is stored in a specific
order on a disk making it efficient for
sequential reading however when you need
to find specific data quickly like
searching for different values an index
acts like a shortcut sot again to having
a quick reference guide that allows
database to pinpoint relevant data
without scanning every single entry so
this makes searches fast similar to how
a binary search operates so although
indexes require extra disk space and can
slow down data rights they greatly
enhance retrieval speed for commonly
accessed data now what is the on delete
Cascade constraint so an on delete
cascate constraint in MySQL automates
the deletion of related rows in a child
table when corres responding rows in the
parent table are deleted so this ensures
that all dependent records in the child
tables are removed without requiring
manual deletion maintaining data
integrity and simplifying database
management now what is a cursor so a
cursor in SQL is a temporary storage
area allocated by database serving
during DML operations like select insert
update or delete so curses allow you to
process each row in a result set
individually making it useful for row by
row data manipulation so you declare a
cursor with a query open it to execute
the query fet rows one at a time for
processing and close the cursor when
done to release
resources so the next question is what
are the various types of relationships
in SQL so in SQL relationships between
tables are crucial for organizing and
structuring data here are the different
types of relationships the first is one
to one so each row in table a is linked
to one and only one row in table B and
vice versa so example a table of
employees and a table of employee
addresses where each employee has one
unique
address now the next one is one to many
here each row in table a can be linked
to multiple rows in table B but each row
in table B is linked to only one row in
table a for example a table of
departments and a table of employees
where each department has multiple
employees but each employee Belongs to
Only One department now the next one is
many to one so it is a reverse of one to
many where each Row in table B can be
linked to multiple rows in table a so
for example multiple employees can be
linked to one department and the last
one is many to many so each row in table
a can belink to multiple rows in table B
and each row in table B can be linked to
multiple rows in tbling for example a
table of students and a table of courses
where each student can enroll in
multiple courses and each course can
have multiple students so this
relationships s maintain data integrity
and facilitate complex queries by
properly structuring how tables interact
with each other now the 25th question is
what is the difference between SQL
delete and SQL truncate commands so the
delete and truncate commands in SQL are
used to remove data from tables but they
operate differently and have different
implications SQL delete removes specific
rows from a table based on a condition
SQL trunade removes all rows from a
table resetting the table to an empty
State Now what is the difference between
cluster and non-cluster
index clustered index a clustered index
reorders the way records are physically
stored in a table based on the indexed
columns there can only be one clustered
index per table it organizes data rows
in tables based on the indexed columns
it changes the physical order of the
table data to match the index order so
typically it's used on columns that are
frequently used for range queries
example wear order byy Etc now a
non-clustered index a non-clustered
index does not change the physical order
or the table draws and creates a
separate structure for the fast data
retrieval so multiple non-clustered
indexes can exist on a single table does
not affect the physical order of the
table data it stores index entry
separately from the actual data row so
it is typically used for columns that
are frequently used in join wear and
order by Clauses now the next question
is what is a live lock so live log
happens when multiple processes are
actively running but are stuck in a
repetitive cycle of interaction so each
process responds to changes initiated by
others causing a loop where no
meaningful progress is made so unlike a
deadlock where processes are all waiting
for resources in livelock processes
remain active and continue to react to
each other without achieving any
productive outcome this can occer in
concurrent systems where processes are
trying to coordinate actions but end up
in a state where their actions hinder
each other's progress leading to a
persistent Loop of
interactions now the next question is
name different types of case
manipulation functions available in SQL
so these are the three useful functions
in SQL for manipulating the case of
strings the first one is lower the lower
function is used to convert a string
into a lowercase letter it accepts a
string as inputs and Returns the same
string with all characters converted to
lower case for example if you have a
string hello world applying lower case
it would result in a smaller case Hello
World now next we have uppercase so
conversely the uppercase function
converts a string into uppercase letters
it also takes a string as input and
returns a string with all characters
converted to uppercase and the last one
is init cap the init cap function is
used to capitalize the first letter of
each word in a string while converting
all other letters to lowercase so this
function is Handy for formatting names
or titles so these functions are helpful
for standardizing Text data or
formatting it according to specific
requirements and SQL queries now the
next question is what are local and
Global variables so a local variables
are declared within a specific scope
such as within a function or a block of
code so they exist only within that
scope and cannot be accessed or modified
from outside it so local variables are
typically used to store temporary data
or values that are only needed for a
specific task or computation within that
particular scope so once the scope of
the function of block ends the local
variables are usually destroyed or no
longer accessible now the global
variables on the other hand are declared
outside of any specific function or
block and can be accessed and modified
from anywhere within the program or
script the have a wider scope and pures
throughout the entire execution of the
program Global variables are useful for
storing values that need to be accessed
by multiple functions or parts of the
code however excessive use of global
variables can lead to potential issues
like accidental overwriting of values or
difficulty in debuging now coming to the
30th question name the function which is
used to remove spaces in the end of a
string so SQL the trim functions used to
remove spaces or other specified
characters from the beginning and end of
a string it helps clean up data by
eliminating unnecessary white space that
might affect the comparisons or display
the Syntax for trim is straightforward
you provide the string inside the
parenthesis and SQL will trim any
leading and trailing spaces for default
now what is the difference between
truncate and drop statements the
truncate statement quickly removes all
rows from a table it deletes data while
keeping the table structure indexes and
permissions intact now the drop
statement completely removes a table
from the database it deletes a table
structure along with all its data
indexes constraints and
permissions now so Define SQL order by
so AUD by arranges fetch datas based on
specified columns defaulting to
ascending order but by adding DEC
command you can reverse the order for
highest to lowest prices so it's a
simple yet essential feature for
organizing data exactly as needed in SQL
queries now explain SQL having statement
so the having clause in SQL is used to
filter data based on condition for group
results or aggregate functions used in
select statement unlike the we clause
which filters rows before grouping
having filters rows after data has been
grouped together this means you can use
having to apply conditions to summarize
data like finding groups with a total
sum about a certain value or averages
that meet specific criteria it's
important to remember that aggregate
functions like sum count average can
only be used with having not with where
this helps SQL manage and analyze data
effectively whether you looking looking
at individual rows or group results now
the next question is explain SQL and or
statement in SQL the and statement
combines conditions where both must be
true for a road to be
included for example this query
retrieves employees older than 25 who
work in the IT department now the all
statement is used but at least one
condition must be true for instance this
query retrieves products in either the
electronics or clothing category both
statements allow for flexible data fil
ing based on specific criteria in SQL
queries now let's move on to the next
question which is why do we use commit
and roll back commands we use commit and
SQL to finalize and permanently save
changes made by a transaction ensuring
they're visible to other users or
applications and roll back is used to
undo changes if a transaction encounters
an errored or needs to be cancelled
reverting the database as previous date
so these commands are essential for
managing transactional integrity and
ensuring data consistency in equal
databases now let's see what the next
question is what are asset properties so
asset properties are a set of four
essential characteristics that guarantee
the reliability and consistency of
transactions in a database system so the
first one is atomicity it ensures that
all operations within a transaction are
treated as a single unit so either all
operations are successfully completed or
if any operation fails the entire
transaction is rolled back to maintain
data Integrity the second one is
consistency ensures that only valid data
is committed to the database
transactions take the database from one
valid state to another constraints
triggers and validations are applied to
ensure data consistency I stands for
isolation it ensures that the execution
of transactions concent does not
interfere with each other each
transaction is isolated from others
until it completes preventing them from
accessing uncommitted changes and the d
stands for durability ensures that once
a transaction is committed it changes up
permanent and survive system failures
the changes are stored in nonvolatile
memory disk and remain intact even in
case of power loss or system crash now
the next question is are null values the
same as zero or a blank space so no a
null value in SQL are not the same as
zero or a blank space so null represents
a missing or unknown value in a database
column it indicates that the value for
that particular record is undefined or
not applicable it is distinct from zero
or an empty STP zero reprs a numerical
value that is explicitly defined as a
number zero it is a numeric value and
not the same as null now blank space
that I'm testing represents an absence
of characters in a string field it is
different from null which is
specifically used to denote the absence
of any value including numeric or other
data types moving on to the next
question what is the need for group
functions in
SQL in database Management Group
functions also refer to as aggregate
functions are used to process multiple
rows of data together based on specific
criteria resulting in a single
meaningful value these functions operate
across groups of rows rather than
individual rules allowing for
calculations and summaries at a higher
level of abstraction so various group
functions are the first one is Count
function so it calculates the number of
rows that meet the specified criteria
such as counting the number of orders
placed by customers the next one is some
function it adds together the numeric
values in column for all rows that meet
the criteria like totaling the sales
revenue for a specific period and then
you have the average function which
computes the average value of a numeric
column across all selected rows useful
for finding the average salary of
employees the next you have Min function
it retrieves the minimum value from a
column for the selected rows such as
finding the earliest date in a
transaction history and then you have
the max function which retrieves the
maximum value from a column for the
selected Row for example identifying the
highest sales figure achieved in a month
now the next question is is how can you
fetch common records from two tables so
when we have data spread across
different tables in a database and want
to retrieve information that relates
across these tables we use the joint
statement this SQL feature lets us
specify which columns from each table we
want to include in a query
results now the next question is how do
we avoid getting duplicate entries in a
query without using the distinct keyword
so when dealing with SQL queries the
distinct keyword serves to filter out
duplicate rows from the result set so
while useful it can sometimes impact
query performance because it requires
the database engine to sort and compare
the result set to eliminate duplicates
so alternatively there are several
methods to remove duplicates efficiently
the first one is using row numbers so by
assigning new row numbers to each row
Partition by The Columns that Define
uniqueness you can filter out duplicates
by selecting rows where the row number
is one the next is using self jooin so
joining a table to itself based on a
columns that Define uniqueness ows you
to filter duplicate entries selecting
only those rows where corresponding
values match and then by using Group by
so grouping rows based on columns that
Define uniqueness in aggregating the
results helps in eliminating duplicates
as each groups represents a unique
combination of values now the next
question is what is the difference
between a qualis and a null function so
the qualis function Returns the first
non-null expression from its arguments
this means if you have multiple
Expressions separated by commas this
function will evaluate them in order and
return the first Nal value if all
expressions are null then the function
return returns null now in SQL Server
the isnull function serves a different
purpose it replaces null values with a
specified replacement value now the next
question is what's the difference
between rows and range so rows specifies
the window frame based on a physical
number of rows before and after the
current row and the range defines the
window frame based on rows with with the
same values as a current row this is
useful when your data is ordered by
values that can have
duplicates now the next question is what
is a CTE also known as common table
expression and how is it different from
a SE query so Common Table expression or
CTE is a temporary result set that you
can reference within a select insert
update or delete
statement it is defined using the width
clause and is easier to read and
maintain compared to subqueries so
unlike subqueries CTS can be self-
referential and recursive which allows
for more complex query moving on to the
next question explain the difference
between cross joint and full outer join
so cross joint produces a cartisian
product of two tables meaning each row
from the first table is combined with
each row from the second table and the
full outter join returns all records
when there is a match in either the left
or right table it combines the results
of both left join and right joint now as
the 45th question we have what are
windows functions so Windows function
performs a calculation across a set of
table rows related to current row unlike
aggregate functions they do not cause
rows to become grouped into a single
output row common window functions
include row number off rank off and
dense rank off so this is how the query
will look like now what is the
difference between the rank of and dense
rank of functions so a rank of function
assigns ranks to rows within a partition
with gaps in the ranking sequence when
there are ties and the dense rank of
assigns ranks to rows within a partition
without gaps in the ranking sequence
when there are ties how do you perform a
recursive query in SQL recursive queries
are performed using recursive CTS
they're defined using the with clause
and include a union all to combine the
anchor member and the recursive member
so this is how a recursive query looks
like now as the next question we have
write a query to find the top five
customers with the highest total order
amounts so this is your query now this
SQL query selects the customer ID and
calculates a sum of order amount for
each customer from the orders table now
it then groups the results by customer
ID using group buy ensuring each
customer's total order amount is
aggregated the order by total order
amount thec arranges these totals in
descending order placing the customers
with the highest order amounts at the
top finally the limit five restricts the
output to the top five customers with
the highest total ordered amounts now
how can you optimize a slow running
query so there are several techniques
including use appropriate indexes
indexes help retrieve the data Faster by
organizing it efficiently second avoid
unnecessary joins and subqueries
simplify queries to minimize the amount
of data processed third use efficient
functions and operators choose functions
and operators that perform tasks with
minimal overhead and then analyze
execution plans review query execution
plans to identify and address
Performance bottlenecks
effectively moving on to the last
question what is a partitioned table and
why would you use it so a partitioned
table is a large table divided into
smaller Moree manageable pieces called
partitions so partitioning improves
performance and manageability especially
for large data sets by allowing queries
to scan only relevant partitions rather
than the entire table for example the
SQL statement creates a table named
sales with column sale ID of type int
sale date of type date and amount of
type decimal 102 it partitions the table
sales based on a sale date column using
range partitioning two partitions which
is p 0 and P1 are
defined so p 0 includes values less than
20 22 0101 and P1 includes values less
than 2023 0101 this setup allows data in
the sales table to be divided into
separate partitions based on the data
ranges so there you have it as we
