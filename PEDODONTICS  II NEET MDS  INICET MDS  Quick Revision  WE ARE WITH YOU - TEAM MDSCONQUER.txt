hi this is dr srikan from team mds
conquer
now i am in front of you to deal pedo
within
30 minutes at my best the first
important thing that you have to make a
note
is an initial oral visit
should be occurred within six months
of eruption of the first
primary teeth not more than
12 months of this means i hope you know
that the first teeth are represented
oral cavity at six months so
from six months to 12 months your first
visit has to be done
okay right so it should be six months
within six months after the eruption
means
it should be done within six months
means six plus six it should be done
if if you consider it as an age it
should be done before twelve years
or if you consider after the duration
after the eruption of the first
first teeth it should be within six
months the first thing should be the
first
oral visit to the dentist has to be done
even when there are no specific problems
the child's first visit and the oral
examination should take place by at
least
one year of age means at least by first
birthday okay that's what the 12 months
word says this question was given in
neat
okay so that's the reason why i'm
stressing it okay so just
just make it out of it and the next
comes in the last session of operator we
have learned about the keys triad
newborns tetrad and everything so
something more advanced at that time in
1999
uh the brothel is the one who has given
something called as an integrated
karyogram program
which has divided into five sectors
these colors are important and the color
coding is important what is the code for
yellow code for
circumstances and this is what the
diagram based question they can ask
related to this okay
so i mean this is a karyogram and the
percentage diagram based question
uh they can ask me basing upon some
questionary
your your your this software basing upon
some question of the software is going
to give you the color coding
as in the form of a pi diagram
okay so the next one is the primary
window period second row window period
the dates are important
okay and they're correlated with primary
therapists in the oral cavity and the
permanent teeth
the next goes is insufficient carey
solution which is also called as in a
white spot lesion and the treatment is
not restoration it is
by using remineralizing agents yesterday
we have learned that is
recalident you can use you can use
xylitol you can use cppacp or you can
use cppacplus
and this is what you can make a note how
this optical
behavior will make you
to understand the difference between the
white spot lesion and enamel hyperplasia
okay so the differences between these
two and
the normal refractive index of air is
one and water is 1.33 whereas
hydroxyapatite is
1.66 they can ask question refractive
index of your composites most of the
composites the range very similar to
that of the hydroxide that is 1.6s
and this white spot lesion can be easily
diagnosed on diagnodent
okay they cannot be diagnosed by
radiographically or routine radiographic
techniques
linear enamel carries you can see this
this is the linear animal cares they can
ask a diagram based question this is
also called as
odentoclasia and it's most commonly seen
in the case of maxillary anteriors and
it's basically due to the
metabolic defects such as low calcium
level or trauma during the birth
okay and these may uh these areas are
mainly predisposes for the currents of
the dental caries
they're seen on the label surface of the
anterior tip
the next comes is a cycle of
remineralization and demineralization
whenever the ph
is below the critical ph that is 5.2 to
5.5
okay explained by stefan's curve this is
the question that is given in 2020 neet
exam
and if it is below 5.2 to 5.5 then the
d then the re demineralization occurs
and if it is ever
that remineralization occurs that is
basically depends upon the buffering
capacity
of your saliva so buffering capacity
main buffer in the saliva is bicarbonate
the main buffering capacity in the
saliva is bicarbonate okay
so this is how okay you have something
called as an hydroxide whenever it is
treated with fluoride it is going to
convert into fluoro hydroxyapatite
fluorohydroseptate is having a brittle
critical ph that is four point two to
four point five whereas normal hydro
accepted is having a
five point two to five point means below
five point two to five point five
only demineralization occurs whenever it
is treated with fluoride then it should
be below four point two four point five
only then the
demineralization occurs and make a note
about the fluoride bombs
okay i hope you are well familiar with
the fluoride bombs are also called as in
a fluoride syndrome
they can sometimes call as an uh
halo effect it's also sometimes called
as a halo effect
because uh the the outermost surface is
in
intact but you will have a carries
beneath that that is basically due to
the
outermost surface is being remineralized
by
the the fluorides that are present
occasionally you can see this
see this syndrome or see this teeth on
radiograph
hope you are very clear it's diagnosed
so diagnodent
is given by scientist name is important
and
it is a new laser fluorescence system
found
uh and and the diagonal and values
ranges from this
i mean according to show button it is
1999 sometimes it's they can give you
0 to 99 for example if you have minus 9
to 99 is the best option then 0 to 99
so these are the interpretations 5 to 25
initial lesion
it's more than 35 advanced lesions okay
so please do make a note this is once
given in
one state entrance parallel examination
i think it's two zero one five kerala
question
uh if i'm not wrong and uh maybe they
can ask you such questions
so make a note about scientist names
okay one
two three
okay and of course yesterday i was
discussing something related to the
curious risk assessment
again this is a this is one of the chart
that is given by american association of
periodontists
carey's risk assessment so basing upon
this i mean your careless assessment
contribution factors are divided into
contributing factors
general conditions and clinical
conditions so mostly we'll be focusing
on clinical conditions
i hope most of you are familiar with
this so basing upon different types you
are going to give a score of 0 1
and 10 right for example
there are no risks the overall score for
example
uh patient having fluoride exposure in
the case in the case history got to know
florida exposure is there then it is s
so its score is zero for example uh the
next one is visible plaque
is is is present okay uh upon applying
the disclosing asset you see visible
black is present
then you can keep a score one okay so
you
once you're done with all these
questionary you have to add these scores
okay so you have to add this course if
it is more than 10
if it is more than 10 then the patient
is
high risk if it is in the range of
1 to 10 moderate risk
if it is 0 he is low risk hope you are
clear
so this is a finn's modification of geo
black classification i hope most of you
are familiar with g
block classification class one two three
four five regular last questions
and uh the class six was recently and
recently means it is a modification that
is done by science
and class six i hope most of you know
that is the cuspard tips of the molar
teeth
and incisal tips of the anterior teeth
comes under classics
so slight modification of g black
classification was done by fins these
are called as a fins modification of
tubular classification and do make a
note of all these five classes
which is applicable to the primary tip
then few parameters that you have to
make you know when you're talking about
the newborn baby that is the length
of weight hemoglobin hb this was given
as
a question in one of the straight
entrance long back and of course these
are most commonly asked questions either
in the need or either in the
aims for both medical and dental
students okay this is you can see one
one sex chromosome missing i hope most
of you know that the autosomes are
44 and two sex chromosomes will either
xy or xx regularly
so totally you have 46 chromosomes but
if you count this you have 45 there is
one sex chromosome that is missing here
so it is
nothing but 45 x word that is nothing
but turner's syndrome
the next goes okay here what happens
here it is
you have a trisomy of 21 trisomy of 21
is nothing but down
but it is xy xy means it is
a downs male patient
if it is xx it's going to be a female
down special
you have total number of regularly you
should have 44 autosomes
but downs has one extra chromosomes one
extraordinaism that is 45.
they have two sex chromosomes here it is
also two total number of chromosomes is
47
autosomes are 45 and six chromosomes are
two the next comes this is a normal
individual you have
uh what is this okay you have some
you have 44 plus two right two six
chromosomes next
fear of dogs we cannot make it out of
all the fears
uh make a note of all the synonym words
uh that are used for the children
okay uh fear of open crowd fear of pain
do make a note of this okay so please do
make a note of this
uh bulimia is something called as in a
self-induced wanting
okay so please do make a note of these
terms regularly asking the examination
and of course vaccination for the child
is very very important so please do make
a note
at birth is most commonly regularly
asked question what are the vaccines
that are given at the birth
and what are the vaccines that are given
for a pregnant woman what are the
vaccines okay uh pregnant women
what are the vaccines that are given at
the age of 16 so please do make a note
of
all these things and of course the
vaccination recommended
exclusively for hiv patient is again
important which vaccines are given
like according to wh and unicef which
vaccines are given
for an hiv patient are very very
important and of course we have
discussed about this that antibiotic
prophylaxis to prevent
infective endocarditis okay what are the
k
what are the what are the things which
are at high risk very high risk
high risk moderate risk and low risk so
please do make a note of this
already discussed make a note and and
next one is the classification of mouth
guards type one type two type three type
one or callers
least preferred that is the stock mouth
guards which are available in your
market least preferred
okay and type three is mouth formed and
custom made are the most commonly
preferred and most comfortable to the
patient
hope you know this rubber dam sheet the
size of this is six into six inches
regularly if it is a pedo case it is
five into five inches
the next ghost these are rubber dam
clamps
these are rubber dam clamps okay the
next goes this is rubber dam forceps
and this is rubber dam punch
you can keep holes you can you can see
holes
this rubber damp template okay it's six
into six means adults template
the distance between the two holes in
the rubber dam can can be a question
again that's one-fourth
4 inch or 6 millimeters so that is the
distance between the two holes in the
rubber dam
next one this is called as a cool dam
cooldown is nothing but heatless liquid
rubber
okay so this is used to block all the
leaking areas okay so this is something
like this once you have play
uh because of the reaction that occurs
it it's going to convert into hard
structure that is called as a cooldown
this is an angst frame metal frame few
other frames
uh the other other frames like a
foldable frame and all these are
discussed on the group recently just
just have a look
diagram best questions they can ask on
that particular area so this isn't a
this is an angst frame that's what i'm
telling okay this is a strap where you
can strap it to the neck
and make a note of this intra intraoral
sizes size zero what are the dimensions
one dimensions two dimensions
three and what are the uses of this are
very very important
and of course of course this is an
important thing even in the recent need
also
okay so what are the different surveys
and
i mean the survey contents how many
number of normal iops occlusions and the
bitewings
all these are important and pulp
vitality is regularly
not not properly indicated in you know
in them and then patients it's basically
due to
a lack of maturation because both the
primary teeth as well as the immature
permanent teeth
may not exhibit full alpha myelin acts
in innovation they don't have that
myelin innervation okay so it's going to
take minimum
minimum years after the eruption so
until that
even if you give that pulp vitality the
the teeth may not take or
the patient may not feel symptomatically
what is sucralose and a few points
related to this because again this is
the most commonly asked area in the
recent things
of course numbers formulas that now it
is
asked okay so they get the high chances
are there they can ask this
particular formula that is given by
million for
knowing the fluoride concentration
basing upon the temperature
and coming to the school water flow
radiation okay a high concentration of 3
to 5 ppm is added to the school water
fluoridation
long back but however recent
modification if it is three
to five is long back but recent
modification they have increased this
concentration to 4.5 to
6.3 millimeters this is a question
regularly most commonly asked
and approximately forty five to fifty
percentage of k risk reduction was noted
of course these are very very important
and most of you are well familiar in
solving the problems
related to they can ask you the amount
of fluoride content in the water
and they can give you the a's of the
child they can ask you the excess amount
of
uh fluoride that can be given to this
particular child or an individual
so of course we have already discussed
there is cpp acp that is calcine
phosphate amorphous calcium phos
phosphate technology so what are this
the full form is important this helps in
the quick re-mentalization the one of
the example is a chewing gum there is a
recall dent and second one is truth
mousey
which is identifies plus tooth mousey
plus is going to contain an extra
component called as fluoride
which we have discussed in the case of
your operator dentistry video
next is this cinder test of course we
have discussed about the cinder test and
what is the
uh what is the dye that is used in the
cinder test that is a bromocrisol green
and
and of course like what are the color
changes at a different ph this is
because this is basically critical ph
and coming to the classification of
smart video smart
smart nodes which is very smart material
which is very very important smart metal
or the material
which reacts to the uh which
continuously reacts to the surrounding
surrounding temperature or surrounding
situation
so smart materials are the passives
passive smart materials
examples of this and active smart
materials these are the examples
and coming to the brown fact what is the
brown fact brown fact is regularly seen
in the case of baby
that helps in uh maintaining the
thermal regulation of the baby so please
do make it where this brown fact is
present
how much percentage of the body weight
is containing brown fat and what are the
advantages of brown fat and everything
but clearly given self-explanatory
please do read it if you don't know the
next comes
numbering system please do make a note
of all numbering systems very simple
raw question but most of you get
confused learn about all the three or
all four or five numbering systems which
are very very important which were
uh discussed during your regular classes
of your oral
anatomy the next comes okay this is a
question that is given in one of the
state
entrance long back and the high chances
that if you they want to make question
tricky they're going to give you
it's very simple like heart rate
decreases you can see heart rate is more
in the
children of less ace same goes the blood
pressure
what happened to the blood pressure so
the blood pressure
okay it's going to increase okay whereas
uh your respiratory is going to decrease
these these are the normal things we we
know these these are the normal things
so you have to focus more on the one two
three three to six and six to twelve
so apart from this what is the gender
difference between the
uh females and males common sense
questions because nowadays you can see
20 20 need has more common sense
questions like
10 or 15 common sense questions uh
logically it's very difficult for me
uh to find the reference for those
questions i can simply tell the answer
very simple with my common sense
but it's very difficult if you if you
want to drop a reference for that
it sounds very difficult so such common
sense questions can be there in exam for
sure
and i hope you are well familiar with
this that's american association of an
astrologist
physical status classification what is
one two three four five six
questions given in 2020 net
and this is one more classification of
primary uh uh
primary teeth it's it's like a trauma
traumatic classification of primary
earth and i hope most of you know
elise classification of primary teeth is
exclusively class nine
very simple any sort of trauma to that
of the primary teeth comes under class
nine analysis
but there is one more classification
given by this gg
where exclusively is it's a primary date
exclusive for example if it is a
fracture involving enamel dentin and
pulp in primary teeth
comes under class nine analysis but in
this classification
comes under class three so they can they
are going to mention they do if they
don't mention you go for alice if they
mention clearly according to this person
classification
then go for this and this is uh
this is oculus radiograph number two
size is also called as an
uh cookie bite or cracker bite okay so
most commonly useful in the end patients
okay this this is again a smart thing
okay the question is i think this is
this question was given in
uh 20 20 neet okay so please do make a
note these values are important this
pick is directly from your
power playbooks uh if you
like to add i i want to make a note
about uh the nala stages okay please do
go back if you're not clear with nola
stages
uh please do make it make a note about
the knowledge stages smaller stages are
very very important
okay and make a note about fluoride
paste contraindicated below 4 years
fluoride mouthwash contraindicated below
6 years
and fluoride tablets are contraindicated
below 12 months
okay so 4 years is
fluoride paste mouthwash is 6 years and
fluoride tablets are contraindicated
below 18
18 months that is one and a half okay
so all these are important things that
you have to make a note as you move
further into the preparation phase okay
so please do make a note this uh
clacks rule okay i hope you know there
is something called as clark's rule
again what is that
slop even your slop your is also called
as in a buckle shift
is also called as a slop which comes in
which is also called as in a
class role this comes under in your
radiology right i hope most of you are
good and familiar with this
and some considerations when you're
preparing cavities so mostly they'll
focus on this
considerations right so please do go
with each and every time that is
underlined on this
okay because questions were being asked
on this area how the contact areas and
everything
and of course star question most of you
are still
confused at this particular area what is
the alignment of rods in the primary
teeth what is alignment rods and the
permanent teeth
very very important please do read these
lines if you are confused draw the
diagram
it's done it's important it's very very
very very important
i don't want you guys to miss this okay
the next comes is some important things
like
i just want to add a note about uh
period of over
period of over is zero to two weeks
and period of embryo
is two to eight weeks or it is going to
be 14 to 56 days
uh where the development of the facial
and the cranial
structures occurs the next comes is a
period of fetus
the period of fetus is from ninth week
to the birth means after
56 days where the accelerated growth and
proportional growth takes place
in fact means infant so most of these
are discussed by me on the group
infant is up to one year neonate
is up to 14 14 days
okay uh yeah i think right you can move
further like
and uh of course these are the uh these
are obturating material that is
regularly used and
you just make a note regularly used
obturating metal in the case of your
permanent teeth is katapacha
and in your primary the most commonly
used observation material in the primary
teeth
is jet boy and most ideal is they can
ask you most ideal
most idealist what is that weta pex and
metapex are most ideal
these are most ideal this is most
commonly used
you have few questions in your pp books
if i'm not wrong and i hope you have
done it
so few questions on this
i mean like material material that are
useful for the uh
used as an observation material in the
case of your uh deciduous dentition okay
so i hope you are done with the
particular
table which is given in the books and if
you're not done please go back and
finish that that's very very important
most commonly used is deadwood ideal is
vitapex or metapix
whenever you have a bleeding canals or
moist canals better to go with colacota
and whenever you have whenever you feel
like you need
less micro leakage then it betters to
get better to glow with endoclass
and permanent registration is mandatory
in the in the case of your end of last
okay so these are the things that you
have to make a note
of course star question wherever you see
you'll get questions over
this the com pharmacrystal the
composition
okay what are these compositions are
very very very very important
and how the mechanism of this occurs
okay
right so i think it's four minutes we
have discussed recently question is
given in the aims
uh amount of the time okay for microsoft
what are the advantages of
your uh literally head okay regularly
two percent reservability is used in the
case of your disinfection that is called
sydex and even the two percentages is
again used in the case of your
primary teeth palpotomy procedures okay
and the duration is
it's around like four minutes okay two
to five okay we have discussed all those
things with the references on the
group just go back and just have a look
okay some aesthetic crowns i mean most
of your i think it may be new to you
but please do read it okay so aesthetic
crowns are categorized into two types
crowns that loots to the teeth
and crowns that bonds to the table so
they can ask you
the classification which are the
following is this which are the
following is that
the next comes is diagram based
questions okay these are polycarboxylate
crowns
these are called as an appedo pearls
these are called as name face cut crowns
means the face is only open these are
resin
vernier stainless steel you can see
stainless steel but upon which
aesthetic resin is added okay so please
do make a note
make a note these are very very
important questions can come
new areas questions can come okay
so please do make a note of this for the
academic reason
how to pre how to prepare is not
important this is a diagram based
question they're going to ask you
strip crowns most of you are well
familiar with pito pedo jacket crowns
new millennium crowns what are the
advantages of this new millennium crowns
art glass crowns the dark glass crowns
has these three dimensional molecular
structures
with high cross linking structure means
they have more strength when compared to
any other thing
and finally the classification i i mean
this is this is your familiar with
okay if you're not very perfect with the
classification just
have a glance okay
so these are the important areas uh that
that you need to focus when when we are
talking about
uh the fedo in specific uh there are a
few other
areas recently being stressed maybe
maybe a diagram based questions in all
these areas and particularly most of you
are asking questions related to
some controversial stuff i'm just going
to add a note negative growth is seen in
a scene in senior which tissue that is
lymphoid tissue and the best example is
thymus right and mandibular growth is
completed by a's of
18 to 19 years mandible is two bones
up to one to one and half here
at one end of here both the sides of the
mandible fuses together to form one bone
and do make you know the most common or
facial malformation
the malformation of the head and neck is
cleft gluten cleft palate and the oral
body if it is oral body then it is
club foot club foot for the overall body
and if it is focusing only head and neck
that is cleft
lip and cleft palate and coming to the
corneal angles again controversial
things
at birth the angle is 170 degrees at
in in the case of children it is 140 in
the case of adult it is
110 in the case of old days it is going
to be 140 again
and they can ask you the terminal planes
okay terminal planes
see whether they're asking the terminal
plane the primary dentation
or terminal plane in the mixed dentation
if they're asking in the primary
dentition for example if they're asking
the primary dentition
the most common terminal plane the
primary dentition is the mesial step
that is 49
percentage of cases followed by the
flush terminal followed by the digital
step
whereas if they're asking in the mixed
dentation it's going to be flush
terminal plane that is 76 percentage
flush terminal plane and uh mesial step
is 14 percentage and
next goes the digital step is 10
percenters
i hope you're very very clear and a few
other
new things nowadays regularly asked in
the examination
and those will be shared on your group
related to the peter so i i hope
you can you can spend this ample amount
of time like 30 30 minutes
uh to clear piro at the best time make
your note uh
my child psychology and the behavior
modifications
or your nitrous oxide and everything
were untouched
why because you have one or two to three
videos on this on
on your regular sessions and i hope you
have done it so i don't
i i have not included that in this okay
i want you guys along with this go back
okay just have a glance over the notes
of the two videos which are prepared on
child psychology stay positive god bless
you
and make a note don't skip topics like
nitrous oxide
concentration nitrous oxide is very very
important behavior modifications all
this
aversive conditioning techniques are
important
the first part of child psychology is
important because they're
they they have selected the questions
very good very in a very very good
pattern and in a very good fashion okay
so one question from that area behavior
modifications one question next comes
jumps to
uh nitrous oxide conscious tradition one
question so they have
they have they have organized their
questions in a very very decent
pattern okay so we need to appreciate
them uh for a very
beautiful question paper that need 20 20
and hopefully we'll see one more decent
and great session
on december 16th god bless you stay
positive
stay tuned to the group for one more
video
done signing off dr srikanth from team
mds concord
