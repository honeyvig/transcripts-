interviews of your dream company so
please stick till the end of this video
while we give away answers to that one
important programming question that is
the most frequently Asked in software
development interviews data set to play
A Whiter role in the field of software
development every interview will have
questions on data structures and
algorithms they have become essential to
crack every software engineer to get
hired by the top tech companies hey guys
welcome to Simply learn
today we will be learning the top 10 DSA
question and answers
and while we are at it please leave us a
like if you find our content helpful and
a sub to the channel would be
appreciated so without any further delay
let's get started
and the top 10 question is what is data
structure
a data structure is a collection of data
used to store or organize in an
efficient manner to access it
effectively in short it deals with how
the data is organized in the memory
next the top ninth question is what is
the classification of data structure
structure is classified into linear and
non-linear whereas linear data structure
is further classified into a static and
dynamic data structure so now let's look
at a complete classification of a data
structure
the data structures are classified into
linear and non-linear in which
non-linear data structure consists of
tree and graph
a linear data structure is divided into
Aries queues stack and linked list
so what do you mean by static and
dynamic data structure the memory of a
static data structure is fixed in size
which means the memory is allocated
during the compile time arrays are the
example of a static data structure and
in the case of dynamic data structure
the memory is allocated during the
runtime queues stack and linked lists
are the example of a dynamic data
structure
the top eighth question is what are the
applications of data structure
the first application is Graphics that
helps to represent the data virtually
then
data structures are used in artificial
intelligence which is a manual machine
to perform a certain task next
data structures are used in creating
operating systems such as Microsoft
Windows Unix operating system Etc
then
compiler design which is used to compile
the computer programs or translate the
source code into machine code
next image processing
it is used to perform operations on the
image or to get any kind of information
from a particular image
later
numerical and statistical analysis
numerical analysis is used to refer to
the numerical facts whereas statistical
analysis refers to analyzing and
presenting the data and finally database
management it is used to store and
retrieve the data from a computer
top seventh question is what is a stack
and explain the operations performed on
a stack
tag is a linear data structure the items
in a stack are stored in the order of
first in last term or last in first dot
so here let's consider an example where
we have stack of books so suppose
students were asked to keep books for
the corrections one after the other then
each one of them would keep the books on
top of the other book therefore in the
same way items are inserted into this
stack another example could be a stack
of clothes
operations like insertion and deletion
of an item are possible only from the
one end of the stack that is on top of
the stack now let's have a look at the
operations performed on a stack
push operation is to insert the item
into the stack whereas pop is used to
delete or remove the item from this
stack
and top will return the top item of a
stack if MJ Returns the true if the
stack is empty else it will return false
size operation is used to return the
size of a stack
next top six question is
what is sorting and mention the types of
sorting all the terms in C
ertain is the process of arranging the
data in some particular order to access
the data efficiently and the Sorting
algorithms are
insertion sort selection sort bubble
sort
counting sort
Radix sort quick sort and merge sort a
programmer can use any of the following
sorting algorithms to arrange the data
either in ascending or descending order
therefore sorting reduces the complexity
of the problem
the next top fifth question is what is a
linked list and what are the different
types of a linked list
which is a linear data structure
consisting of nodes where each node is
divided into two parts data and address
every node in a linked list is linked
together the different types of linked
lists are
singly linked list doubly linked list
and circular linked list
a single linked list is a collection of
data called nodes where each node is
divided into two parts to store data and
address every node in a linked list is
connected with the other through a
pointer that points to the address of
the next node a special note called the
head node holds the address of the first
node and the last note points to the
none
and a w linked list is a complex
compared to a single linked list each
node is divided into three parts to
store data and the addresses of the
previous and next node
in a doubling list the first note
previous and last note next pointer
points to null indicating no notes
before or after it it is easy to access
elements in the doubling list since it
consists of two pointers to travel from
forward and backward Direction
circular linked list in C programming
performs a reverse table cell with less
memory uses than a doubling case a
circular linked list is a collection of
data called nodes where the last node
links to the first node
the top fourth question is write a
program to convert an infix expression
to a post fixed expression
so as you can see this program is to
convert an infix expression to a postfix
expression so we have a pop priority and
push function which are declared and
then we are declaring stack of size 50
and top initially is equal to -1
then going back to function
push is used to insert an item into the
stack so
n is assigned to stack of plus plus top
and pop is to remove or delete an item
so if top is equal equal to -1 then
return -1 that means top is empty else
returns stack of top minus minus that
means decrementing the top by -1 then
coming to Priority function
checks the condition if x is equal to
open parenthesis then written 0 if x is
equal to plus or minus then written 1 if
x is equal to into or divided by then
written 2 that means the priority of
plus and minus are same and into n
divided by are same
then going to main function
here we have the expression of size 100
and then the pointer variable exp then
asking to enter the expression to
perform in fixed of post fix once you
enter
the expression is assigned to exp so why
exp not equal to null then checks the
condition
so if is Al num X of expression that
means if the expression is
alphanumerical
then print the expression
as if
prints a character and else if
expression is equal to open parenthesis
then push to X calling the push function
then else if expression is equal to
closing parenthesis while n is equal to
pop not equal to
closing parenthesis print character is y
priority of stack of top is greater than
equal to priority of expression then
pops the character and push to the
expression and incrementing the
expression by 1 while top not equal to
-1
then pop that means if stack is not
empty then property character return 0.
so let's try to execute it
enter the expression
so let's enter a plus
day of C into d
and we got the output
the code that I'm executing in this
session and the question and answers
that we will be discussing will be
attached in the description box below so
you can have a look at it and execute
the code for a better understanding and
if you face any issues while executing
the programs then please let us know in
the comment section below and our team
of experts will be happier to reach out
all your queries at the earliest
top third question is what is a binary
search tree and explain its properties
a binary tree is a complete tray in
which every node is spelled except the
last level nodes in a binary tree are
added from left to right
topmost node is a root node of a tree
and the sub tree consists of a parent
note and a child node
the properties of a binary search tree
are the left sub tree of a node contain
only nodes with a K element less than
the root load scheme whereas the right
subtree of a node contains the note with
key elements greater than the root node
scheme
the top second question is what is a
graph data structure in same
a graph is a non-linear data structure
it is a collection of a finite set of
nodes called points connected through
edges called lines as shown in the below
diagram
just to represent networks such as
telephone networks circuit networks and
social networks Etc
now first question is how to implement a
program to find the height of a binary
tray
so as you can see this is a program to
find the height of a binary tree which
means finding the levels of a binary
tree
so first we have a data variable and we
have a pointer to left child and right
child
and then coming to hide function if node
is equal equal to none then written 0
else
the height of nodes left child is
assigned to left height and the height
of nodes right child is assigned to
right height so if left height is
greater than right height then return
left height plus 1 else written right at
Plus 1.
and then creating the new node and
allocating memory for it using m-log
function
and then assigning data so assigning
data for a nodes data and initially
denotes left child and right child is
assigned to null and written node
and coming to main function we are
assigning values to every node so root
node is having the value 10
and Root's left child is equal to 15
Root's right child is equal to 20 and
Roots left child's left child is equal
to 25 and Roots left child's right child
is equal to 30 and print the height of a
binary trick
so let's execute it
so as you can see we got the output the
height of a binary tree is 3.
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the top 10 DSA question
