i think the first is
you need to work if depending on how
well you want to do and particularly if
you're starting a company you need to
work super hard
so what what does super hard mean
well when my brother and i were starting
our first company uh in instead of
getting an apartment we just rented us a
small office and we slept on the couch
uh
and we we showered at the ymca
and uh we're so hot up we had just one
computer so
the website was up during the day
and i was coding at night
seven days a week all the time
um and i i
briefly had a girlfriend that period and
in order to be with me she'd have to
sleep in the office
so
i
work hard like
i mean every waking hour that's that's
the thing i would i would say if you
particularly if you're starting a
company
and i mean if you do simple math say
like okay if somebody else is working 50
hours and you're working 100
you'll get twice as done as much done in
the course of a year as
the other company well i love my work
the work of the foundation is super
interesting i get to meet with the
scientists i get to go out
in the field
i do think your habits are sort of set
in your 20s and 30s
and by my standards of the 20s you know
i didn't believe in weekends back then
uh not to mention vacations so i'm you
know fairly lazy compared to myself in
my 20s where i was a true uh fanatic
you know all i believed in was working
on software
night and day and and for my 20s that
was perfect i didn't have a wife or
family uh
at all and my role was very
hands-on role
you know i i'm very lucky that my
foundation work the part-time work i do
for microsoft i see that extending you
know for decades into the future and
having an understanding of innovation uh
you know i think shaping innovation in
many of these areas
there is a unique role that i can i can
help play work your ass off
nobody ever stumbled upon success by
accident i always believed no stone
unturned
work your butt off that's what i always
believe no matter what you do work work
work it doesn't matter in what area
you're in
no pain no gain
the bottom line is one of my rules
which is work your butt off if you don't
apply that rule
all the other rules won't mean anything
i believe of what ted turner said who is
one of the great entrepreneurs who
started cnn and so on he said early to
bed early the rise
work like hell and advertise
so that's what i believe
just remember you can't climb that
ladder of success
with your hands
in your pockets
you must work your ass off it's that
simple
to become an entrepreneur is not easy
and
and a lot of people who try to become
entrepreneurs they fail
along the way
but good ones pick themselves up and
they try again they try again until they
succeed
and you know what what an entrepreneur
needs to do first of all is come up with
an idea that will make a positive
difference in other people's lives and
if you've got if you've got an idea
that's going to make a positive
difference to other people's lives
you've got a chance of building a
business so play hard and play hard work
hard and
and you know follow certain principles
in life you know be you know
you know love people make make sure you
make a positive difference in this world
while you're on it
i know how much hard work it takes to
pursue a dream of building a business
the long hours
time away from family the rejection
the ideas you know are brilliant that
just don't seem to catch on
there is a great quote from thomas
edison that does the best job of
defining what it's like to be an
entrepreneur
i have not failed i have just found 10
000 ways that don't work people say
you have to have a lot of passion for
what you're doing and it's totally true
and the reason is
uh
is because it's so hard that if you
don't any rational person would give up
it's really hard and you have to do it
over a sustained period of time so if
you don't love it if you're not having
fun doing it you don't really love it
you're going to give up and that's what
happens to most people actually if you
really look at
at the ones that
ended up you know being successful
unquote in the eyes of society and the
ones that didn't oftentimes it's
the ones that are successful loved what
they did so they could persevere
when you know when it got really tough
and and the ones that
didn't love it quit
because they're sane
right who would want to put up with this
stuff if you don't love it so it's a lot
of hard work and and it's a lot of
worrying constantly and
if you don't love it
you're going to fail so you got to love
it you got to have passion
996 is the spirit that i encouraging
alipapa people if you want to have a
bright future
if you don't want to be
give up by the society
it won't be successful you have to work
hard i think most of the people in this
world
whether the great president
whether a good professor we're a good
engineer
a good scientist a good anchor
like you
you work much more than you do when i
have a shower i think i work when i'm
the toilet i think
when i running i think
we never stop working
because today why alibaba need to 996
because we
on our side we have more than 60 million
business rely on us
if we don't work hard
they lose their hope so we have to work
hard but
but
if you don't like your job
if you don't like the work you do
working two hours a day you feel very
bad
if you love your jobs people like me
if i love the job i'm doing i love the
things i'm doing
10 hours a day 15 hours a day it's
nothing
