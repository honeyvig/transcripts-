for maintaining the dialog connection

secure and safe channel for transmission
data between the systems
hi guys and welcome to yet another
interesting video by simply learn but
before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update from us now without further Ado
let's take a look at the agenda for
today's session
to begin with we will look into what is
an osm model
moving forward with what is the session
layer
continuing with the functions of the
session layer
and at the end we will look into
protocols applied in the session layer
let's begin with the first setting that
is what is an osr model
The OSI or Open System interconnection
model is a specifically designed set of
protocols that govern communication
channels through which network devices
share information and data
this task of sharing data is divided
among seven layers of the SI model which
works at micro level in a communication
Channel
now let's move on to the core topic for
the session that is what is session
layer
the session layer controls and maintains
connection between devices to share data
among them
it is also responsible for establishing
and terminating sessions in the channel
it also checks the authenticity and
provides recovery options for the active
sessions in case of a network error
now let's move on to the next heading
that is functions of the session layer
but before we begin let's take a look at
the actual working steps of the session
layer in a communication Channel
the session layer receives data units
from the upper layers in the SM model or
from the communication Channel
where it integrates the data with
session address
and the session layer is responsible for
maintaining the dialogue between the
system that are connected in the
communication Channel
it applies multiple protocols for secure
and safe transmission for example rtcp
pptp pap
after that the session data is being
transferred to the lower layers in the
USM model
now let's take a look at the functions
of the session layer
whereas the first is session
establishment
then we have data transfer
dialogue managing
and synchronization
let's take a look at each of the
functions in detail
the first function is session
establishment
it is responsible for establishing
connections between systems also known
as sessions
this connection allows user to share
data remote access and find handling in
a communication Channel
it acts as a transport connection
that is accompanied in the session
establishment that is the transfer
connection is mapped when the session is
released
through this connection there are three
ways of Transport connection
which are one to one
many to one and one to many
now let's move on to the next function
that is data transfer
one of the core functions of the session
layer is to handle exchange of data
between systems in half duplex of full
duplex Network Mode
the session layer also allows the user
to initiate data transfer in case of
half duplex and simultaneous data
Exchange in case of a full duplex
Network model now let's move on to the
next function that is dialog management
the accession layer is responsible for
keeping log data on which the system
establish connection to exchange data
this is known as dialog management
it also uses a token method to maintain
the efficiency of The Connection by
giving the token to the user sharing
data in case of a half duplex mode and
then transferring it along with the data
to the next system
now let's move on to the next function
that is
synchronization
the session layer maintains proper
interaction between systems and provides
a recovery option known as the known
state in case of an error
it also uses synchronization points to
be added in the communication channel
for using a known state in case of an
error with this we have completed all
the main functions of the session layer
now let's move on to the next heading
that is protocols in the session layer
the session layer provides multiple
Network protocols for security safety
and efficiency between the communication
systems
some of the session layer Protocols are
real-time transport control protocol
rtcp
this protocol provides statistical and
controls the information for an RTP
session in the communication Channel
then we have point-to-point tunneling
process pptp this section layer protocol
provides a way to implement virtual
private networks also known as VPN
using TCP in the network channel
then we have password Authentication
Protocol pap
this protocol in the session layer is
used as a password Authentication
Protocol by the PPP control
to validate users in the communication
Channel
with this we have completed all the
important points related to the session
layer in the OSI model
