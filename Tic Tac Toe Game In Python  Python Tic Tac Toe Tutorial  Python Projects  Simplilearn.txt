python is one of the emerging
programming languages according to the
most recent figures python is the most
used coding language for about 80% of
developers syntax of this high level
programming language is simple to
understand and Python's large Library
System makes it a best choice for data
science machine learning and artificial
intelligence projects so hello learners
welcome to Simply Lars YouTube channel
and today we will be creating a tic Taco
game using python but before we begin if
you love watching Rec videos subscribe
to our Channel like the tutorial and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an update
and before starting let us have a simple
quiz question to brush upon on our
knowledge and our question is in which
year was the python 3.0 version
developed and your options
are 2008 20 000 2010 or 2005 please
answer in the comment section below and
we'll update the correct answer in the
pen comment you can pause the video give
it a thought and answer in the comment
section and I have an insightful for you
guys if you are focused on building
strong foundational skills for career
growth in that case you can check out a
free course to Learn Python Basics with
a completion certification from scaleup
by simply learn you can check the python
Basics free scaleup course with the link
I will give the link in the description
below now we'll start with the tutorial
the first thing we will do is create a
folder we'll go to python projects and
here we will create a folder for TCT
tcto and inside we will open a command
prompt
and open our
ID
and I would be using the visual studio
code so for that I have written a
command that is code uh code space
period so it will open my daily that is
Visual Studio code and before starting I
will show you guys what we are going to
develop or what we are going to create
as a tictac to game
now we'll first see the demo of what we
will
create
so this is our code and we'll just run
it and you can see this is our tic Taco
game that is we have made it using
Python and this is a restart button to
restart the
game that is if you are playing and if
you win so you can just click on restart
and you can restart the game and this
this thing indicates that whose turn it
is now so X turn now
0 x 0 x 0 x 0 x so you got a tie so it
would be displayed here and if someone
wins it will also be displayed here and
if it's a tie the whole box would be
turned to yellow color so these are the
functionings and now we'll move to
create our own game so we have created a
folder and and name it as ticko now we
will create a file and name it as tick.
py and inside this file we will start
our
coding and first thing we should do is
import the
packages and you have to install the
packages I have already installed the
packages and if you face any issues
while installing just comment down and
we will get back to you and ticker is a
python module that is already installed
as a module when you install the python
so you don't have to install it
again so we will be using kter only and
the random Library so for kter we will
import it and write the command from
printer import all the classes that
would import asri and the second module
we will import Is Random so we will
import random
you could see the commands to install
them on the web or you could just simply
type pip install random and the module
would be install you could either write
this command on command prompt on the
ideally that is in the terminal you can
write it and you can get the commands
modules installed so as I told you gter
is a python module that is used to
develop GUI graphical user interface and
there's no need to install any module as
it is already installed as a part of the
standard python Library so moving on now
we will create a kter window and for
that we'll write a small
command that would be
window equal to
TK that is we have created the cter
object and we'll write window do main
Loop so it's a loop that would keep on
repeating
and it will help us to display a CER
window so we'll first save
this and run the
file so we have our cter window here
this is a c window we'll run it
again you can see that we have created a
window and now in this window we'll add
the widgets and the elements to create
our own titico python
game and starting with Title First we'll
give the title to this ticker window and
we'll give it as tick tto game only so
for that we'll write the
command window dot
title and inside we will give the title
that would be tick
Tech
to so this would be the title we'll save
it and run
it so you could see that this is the
title and currently the window is
resizable you could see there's Arrow
coming so you can expand it at any s
so like in the further tutorial we would
mark it as not resizable that is we
would prohib from resizing the
window and the next command we would be
writing would be configure to configure
the configuration of the window that is
we can change the color or configure
anything so here we would configure and
change the color of the
background window. configure and we'll
use background equal
to
gray we'll save this and run
it you could see that the background of
the window has been changed to gray now
we set the geometry of the window that
is how much the length and width it
should have that is width and height it
should have so we'll use window do
geometry and inside in inverted commas
we would set the width that is the first
parameter that is pass its width and
after that X the small X and then the
height of the window so we'll save this
and run
it you could see that the geometry has
been changed and the width is th000 and
the height is 700
pixels now we would make
it unres sizable that is we will
prohibit from resizing the window so for
that we'll write the command window.
resizable
resizable and we would mark it as
PS
PS and save it and run it for you
guys now you could see that if I H or
the edges of the window you won't be
able to see the pointer that expands the
window so it has made it non
resizable now we will create a tic Taco
game and we need a cross and a zero so
for that we will create a variable and
name it as players and inside that in
the square
brackets we
will mark them as X and the other as
capital O that we would count as zero
only and
now we have imported the random function
and whose turn will it come so that
would be the random thing only for that
we use the random and the choice
function for that will create a variable
player and use the random module and
call its function that is
choice and pass the players variable so
that it could choose X or
zero
and and provide us with the output like
who can start first so now we would be
creating as this is our code you could
see the output so now we will be
creating these buttons so these all are
buttons so to create them we will write
buttons equal
to and inside the square
bracket we will
provide
three zeros
and after a
comma we would provide another three
zeros and after another
comma would provide another three
zeros and
now we have created those buttons but it
won't be displayed as if I just save it
and run it for you guys you could see
this window only there's no output as I
have not displayed anything so first we
will create a frame so frame is
a widget that can hold any image or any
label or any widget on it so we would be
creating a top frame that
is if I show you the output so this is
the top frame this blue color we will
create the top frame and on that frame
we would set the heading and and then
the button that is the restart game and
then these turn
widgets so for
that first we'll create the top
frame and we'll create a variable top
uncore
frame and use the frame
widget and inside the widget we would
pass the window as in the window we
would be creating this Frame so we pass
the window and we'll set the background
color
for this
Frame and that is the blue color and
we'll write the color in the hexa code
you could write in hexa code or you
could just write the name of the color
so I know the hexa code for this
5d6 D and it show green but uh 7 e yeah
this is the color that would be
displayed on the
frame and after the background color
comma after this background color we
would set the width and height of this
Frame width that would
be 1,000 only we want this Frame to be
of whole size to cover the whole window
in the top section and after that we
will set its height and that will set as
250
it is 250 and now we will place this
Frame this is the main thing that is
the geometry options which ker provides
so when we place this then it would be
displayed on the kter window so we would
place this top uncore
frame do
place and we would place it as x = 0 and
Y =
0 now we'll save this and run this so
you could see this is our CER window and
this is our top
frame and we will create a bottom frame
also but before that we will give it the
title that would be the game title as
tict tcto using python so for
that we will create a variable gamecore
title and inside
this we will create a
label and the label would be placed on
the top frame so we'll pass the top
frame first and then we would set the
background color and we would set the
same background
color as of the top frame only so
hash 5D
6070 5D
60
70 now we have set the background color
now we want the foreground
color so that indicates which color the
title should
be so we would set the color of the
title as foreground equal to White and
we could write the name of the color or
you can use the hexa code hexa code for
white color is # 6 * f and now text that
would be the heading so we would set the
text equal
to tick te to using
python okay now we would set the
font font for the
title so for that we would write
font equal to and in circular
brackets we would just use the default
font and then Place comma and the font
size that we have set it as
48 and
now we have set the game title but now
we have to place it so that it could be
displayed so for that you write the
command game and _
title dot place and inside we will pass
the x coordinate
X we will have would be 135 and Y = to
0 and it's showing a error as we have
not placed comma after
text yeah it's not showing it now we'll
save this and run it
so you can see guys that inside this
window we have a title that is Tic Tac
to using python now moving
on we will create another label and that
label would be for turns that we have
seen that below the restart game we have
the text that shows whose turn it is so
for that we'll create a label
and use the label widget inside the
label variable only and we'll pass to
frame because we want this label on the
top frame only and we'll set text equal
to
ler
plus turn it
is and now we will set the form
font and that would be equal to inside
the circular
braces we would name
the
font
areial and we have to place it in
inverted
Comas and now it set its font size that
is
30 and set the background color
and we'll set the background color as
same of the top frame that is
# uh 5D 6D
70 5D
6D
7e okay and now we'll set the forground
color okay uh this bracket was
of font we'll close it
here and remove this
bracket and after the background
color we will Define the foreground
color so for which
color those turns would be displayed
foreground color would be equal to
White and
now we will place this label so that it
could be
displayed label do
place and we'll place it at xal to
440 and Y = to 200
okay and it's showing a error so we'll
see what we have scripped we have not
placed a comma
here so we will save
this and run
it so you could see the X turn
here so we'll add a function in to
it so now we would be creating a reset
button now and for that we will create a
variable reset
underscore
button and use the button widget that is
button and that would be placed in the
top frame so we'll pass top underscore
frame
and the text we want to give to the
button that would be restart
game and now we would set the font for
which
font the button should have what fonts
the button should have so font equal to
in circular brackets we would
place areial
and set the font size that is
30 and then set background color equal
to that would be the same as of the top
frame that is 5D 60
70 and after the background color we set
the foreground color and we'll set it as
white only
and after the foreground color we would
place
this reset button but button has a
command
also so command is something which gives
the function to a button and we will
Define this
function and we'll name it as new game
so that it would re reset the whole game
we will Define this function that is the
new
game and inside the next line we will
place this
button that is reset uncore
button do
place and we will place it as X = to
360 and Y = 95
so we have placed
the reset button now we will create a
bottom frame so in that we would have
the structure of our game that is the
nine
boxes so we'll create a variable and
named as bottom frame and create a frame
widget and inside that frame we will
pass window as it would be creating on
the window and then set its background
color so
F would be capital for the frame and set
the background
color and we'll set the background color
for it as white
only now M set the
foreground color that is
white and set a command no um bottom
frame don't have anything
now so for bottom frame we would just
create a frame frame and we would pass
the window and we would set the
background color as white and we would
set width and height for
it width would be
400 and
height that would also be
400 we will create a square box for tic
TCT to
buttons and now we will place this
Frame so to place it I'm write bottom
underscore
frame dot
place and we pass X = to
265 and Y = to
300 so we would place
it and
now we'll save
it and I'll R it for you
guys so first it wants us to create
these functions after that only we
could execute this window or see the
output of the
window
so now we will move to create these
functions only
and we'll create
it just beneath
this and the first function we would
create would be the next
turn first I will write the function and
after that I will explain you its
functionality so we will pass row and
column
here and place the colon and here we
will
make a global variable and name it as
player and here we would use
if
buttons that is we would Place those
buttons that as a i will show
you so we'll place these
buttons as grid only so it would have
row and
column we won't place it we would set it
as grid so we would set it as row equal
to 0 and column equal to 0 row equal to
0 column equal to 1 row equal to0 column
equal to 2 so this is how we going to
set this
so if buttons row
column and in the
next the
text that is equal to
T
and we will create a function and name
it as check winner that is check
winner that
is
holds and
inside
if
player is equal to equal
to
player Z that is the initial
player
then
buttons that is row
column
and I think before creating this
function that is next turn first we
should declare all the cases in which a
person can win so for that also we will
create a
function and name it as check
winner that is we have declared here so
first we'll Define this function
only check uncore
winner and
inside first we will run a
loop for
Row in
range and that is
three and inside
if
buttons that is
row zero
and it's
text set is
text and that is equal to equal
to
buttons
Arrow
one and what text it
has and is equal to equal
to
buttons
row and inside text
and it's not equal to
Mt that is what we have done here is if
you see so we have stated that if row
zero
that is the first row row 0 and the
column 0 is equal to row 0 and the
column 1 and the row 0 and the column 2
and it's not equal to
Mt and if they all are
equal
then we would give it a green
color
buttons row
zero do
config and inside we'll pass
background equal to
Green so we
will give it a green GRE color and where
it goes yeah
here so we have seen the first row if
the first row and all the three elements
that is all the three columns have the
same that is X or0 so it would be turned
out as green all the three would be
turned as green so all the three buttons
would be set as green
buttons
Row 1 do
config and set its
background as
green not conf
F and set the
background as
green okay
and it would
return
true so we have seen one
possibility now you would see another
possibility that is a winner could be
this way or it could be the column way
or like we have run a loop that is four
range zero that is the for first row
then the row would be change to one then
this row then this row so all these rows
are completed now we will run a loop so
that we could check the
columns so for that we would run a loop
for
column and
range
three
and write a if statement that is
if
buttons that is zero and that is the
roow zero and check the column
so column would
be dynamic here and pass
text and that is equal to equal
to
buttons and the row
one
and the colum that would be
variable and inside we will pass
text equal to equal
to then
buttons and this row is second that is
the third row but index is third and set
the
column and
inside text
and that
is not equal
to
Mt
colon so these columns would also be
turned into
green so for that we'll write
buttons
0o
column do
config and
and configure with background color that
is equal to
Green
okay now I'll copy
this paste it here and paste it in the
next
line that is the next column and the
next column so it would be turned out to
be green
and after that it should return
true
so we have covered these possibilities
oh sorry these possibilities now we'll
come have the possibility of the
diagonals so for
that we
will create a
if statement only
if as we don't require any Loop here if
buttons that is 0
0
[Music]
inside
text that
is
buttons one one
and that is equal
to
buttons that is 22
and that is not equal to
Mt
colon then these
buttons that
is would turn
green 0
0 do conf figure and set the background
color as
green
okay and
return
true and if this is not the possibility
we will cover the second diagonal that
is
LF and
inside we'll just copy
this and
state the other diagonal that would be
0
2 1 1 and 2
0 so for
that we would write 0
2 and the next is 1
1 and the next one is 2
0 it's not equal to empty and it these
all three would also be configured as
green if they all are
equal 1
1 2
0 after that it should return
true
okay
now I will cover another possibility
that is L if
and for that I will
create a function that is empty
spaces
is
PS so first we will create the empty
spaces function only and after that we
will create the S
statement so
that we will
write Mt
underscore
spaces and inside we will Define that is
all the
spaces and that is equal to
9 and now we'll run a loop
it it's not closed now it's okay we'll
close it now we'll run a loop four
row in
range and
now
for
column and
range
thing and now we'll use if statement
that is if
buttons that is we would check every row
and
column text
here is note
empty
then we would subtract
from the
spaces
another if statement that is if spaces
turn out to be
zero then it should return
false else
return
true okay now we have defined the empty
spaces now we'll complete this Al if
statement that
is for
this if the empty spaces is
false that is if all has been covered if
space is equal to equal to zero there is
no space left and it has returned
false so what we will do
is first we'll create a loop P
row
and
range
three now for column
in
range three
so we will turn the whole box as
yellow so for that
buttons
[Music]
row
column use square
brackets row
column do conf
fig and we'll configure background color
equal
to
yellow and we will return
Tai that is if all the boxes are filled
and it doesn't
satisfy these if statements that is
there is no consistent X or zero in row
or column or in diagonals
then we would turn it as
ti so we'll return
it
return
Ty and we make the T capital
and now we will place the L
statement that
is
return
false okay now we have spit all the
posties and three
spaces now we'll complete our
function that
is the next turn and and we have to
create another function that is the new
game so in the new game function we will
decide who will have the first
turn so first we will Define this
function only that is new
game and
inside we will
set variable as global global
player
and player equal
to random
dot choice we have done this in Windows
also and we'll configure the label
here that we have created that is this
label we will configure
it and change its text label do
configure and change it text that is
equal
to
player that we have choosed from the
random module and use the choice
function so it would choose either X or
either
zero
clear plus and now whose turn it is
okay now we will run a for Loop four
row
in range
three and
four
column in
range
C would set
buttons row
column
dot conf
figure and would set the
text as
Mt for the new
game and background color
that is equal
to F0
F0
F0 I have used the ex code so I have to
use hash that is white or you could use
the hexa code for white as #
6f okay so we have
declares Define and
declar what okay three problems in this
uh we will resolve them so we have
declared the new game function and
moving on what we are left is next
turn so now we'll complete
that is we F statement and if player
equal to player zero that is the first
there so
buttons
colum and it's text what will
enter equal to
ler and
F check
vard is false
then
player equal to
player one the turn would be shifted to
another
player
okay now if check winner is false that
is if there is no player so player would
be shifted to player
one and
now we'll change the label that is this
this would be changed that is label.
config
and we would change it and change it
as first we would set a text
here that would be text equal
to the player turn would be changed for
that we'll
write test equal
to from the
players
good now the turn has changed
and another
case that is else if if the winner is
true
and if the winner is
true what we will do we will change the
label we will configure
it
and change the text equal
to
layers one
and it
wins and we will have
another
condition L
if check uncore winner
that is if it's equal to
Ty then we'll change the label we'll
configure
it and
set text equal to TI
okay so now we
have
no me
check okay uh this would be player one
it's true
to we player
zero if it wins now we'll have a else
condition that is in
else we would be having all the other
possibilities that we are left and here
we would start with the player
one and else if
buttons that
is row
column and the
text
enter is equal to player
means that it's equal to
player
then
if check
minor is
false if there is no Winer
currently
then player is equal to
player
zero and we would configure the label
that is label.
config and set
text equal
to and set
player
zero
and would set its
turn and
LF lse if that
is check winner
is
true
then label do
config that if he's the winner then
we'll change the text that is equal to
player
one and it wians
[Music]
test player one
bench
okay now we have
another LF statement
that is if check
winner is equal to
Ty then we'll configure this
label and set the text equal to
die so we have declared all the
functions
now what are the problems
fixing okay now we will set the
buttons in the
frame so that it should be
displayed for that we will run the
loops that is
for Row in
range
three now four
column and range
three and now we would set them
buttons
row
column that is equal to we'll declare
them as
button and
inside first will pass the bottom frame
as we want them to win the bottom
frame and and
then we Define
text as
Mt and set the
font
is
aial and set the font size as 40
now we'll set the width and
height that is
comma we set the width of 1 button = to
5
and height equal to
1 and set the
command that would be Lambda
row equal to
row
and
columnal
to
colum row equal to row column equal to
column and
and our function that
is next
turn and we'll
