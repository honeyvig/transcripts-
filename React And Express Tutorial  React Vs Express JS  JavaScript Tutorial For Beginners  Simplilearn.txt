button and press the Bell icon so you'll
never miss any update from Simply learn
so without further Ado let's begin and
see what's in it for you
first we'll get an idea about react and
expressjs after that we will see what is
reactjs then we'll see the features of
reactjs moving ahead we will be learning
about expressjs and its
features and in last we will see how to
connect Cent side to the server
site every application consists of front
end back end and the database together
therefore from Full stack and in this
video we will be talking about react and
express JS react was created by meta and
it is used to make web application
responsive expressjs is unopinionated
and it is used to make apis Express is
maintained by
nodejs let's see what is
reactjs react is a JavaScript library
which is used to build mobile and web
applications fast and inter interactive
it is an open- Source reusable
components based front-end library of
JavaScript basically with the help of
react we can create a client side
application or user
interface it is a combination of HTML
and JavaScript let's see the features of
reactjs first
jsx it is a syntax extension of
JavaScript with the help of reactjs we
can use the extension to see how the UI
should look
like virtual document object model Dom
it defines how document are accessed and
manipulated in the web page performance
there are several ways to speed up your
react application by using virtual
Dawn oneway data binding information
Flows In One Direction react receive
information through arguments and pass
it by returning
values react goes beyond simple UI and
has many extensions for complete
application support extended with flux
and Redux among
others debugging it is a small browser
extension to make debugging easier and
faster let's see what is
expressjs Express is a nodejs framework
designed to build apis web applications
CLA platform mobile apps quickly and
easily it is very high performance fast
lightweight and unopinionated expressjs
is used as a server side scripting
language let's see the features of
expressjs first fast service side
development with the features of nodejs
Express saves a lot of time metalware
metalware is a request Handler that has
access to the application request
response cycle
routing this refers to how an
application's endpoint URLs respond to
client
requests
templating it provides templating
engines to build Dynamic content on the
web pages by creating HTML templates on
the server debugging Express makes it
easier as it identifies the exact part
where bugs
are now we'll see how to connect client
side to the server site first we need to
create a folder I have created a folder
named react
Express let's see go to your C
file here I have created react Express
folder now we will be using a text
editor in this video I'll be using
visual studio code let's open
it then we will add all the npm packages
and create a react application called
client open Terminal New
terminal let's write some command
npx
get
react
have
Cent enter this will take some time
until then just wait
yes so it's
downloaded now as you can see the client
folder has been
created with all the npm files in this
client folder you'll see all the npm
files node
modules Json file
also yeah now we'll go to this folder CD
client
now to get this application running type
npm
start
enter this command will start and
compile this application now it has
opened a web page Local Host
3000 this is the first client side
application startup page this this will
be now working as a client now let's
create a backend application for that
first clean this
terminal let's open a new
terminal
type
npx
Express
then great
folder
name press enter
okay now this will take some time to
install press yes
y as you can see a API folder has been
created now we'll go to that API folder
CD API
enter now we are in the API
folder let's install all the packages
npm
install press
enter this will again download all the
packages so npm has installed all the
packages required to run this as you can
see in in the packages. Json file there
are all the repositories and files that
I used now let's terminate this
terminal
terminal now let's go to the client
folder
[Music]
CD
client press
enter now we are in the client
folder NP
M this command will start and compile
this
application now we'll see the standard
express application that has got
installed we'll again go to the
terminal delete this terminal create a
new terminal in this we'll go to the API
folder
npm
start it will start the
terminal press
enter
now we'll go to the
Chrome Local Host 3000 refresh
it you will see the standard express
application that has got
installed with this we have reached the
