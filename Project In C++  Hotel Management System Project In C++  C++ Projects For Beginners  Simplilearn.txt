hey everyone welcome back to another
tutorial by simply learn
in this session we'll make a project in
c plus this project will be a hotel
management project in which we will have
the information of the items or rooms
that we have in the hotel and what are
the food items ordered by the customer
also we have the information that how
many rooms are allotted to them
also this project will tell us about the
sales and the remaining food stocks we
have and the total collection of the day
we will make this project in three parts
firstly we will discuss the first part
in which we will declare some variables
and then initialize them
after that we will enter the quantities
of items that we have in the hotel
then we'll make a list of items or menu
of items and rooms that we have in the
hotel
so let's start
now we will switch to our code editor
that is dev c
so this is a code editor so here first
of all let's make a new file we'll click
on file and now we'll create a new file
so now let's start with the project so
first of all inside the main function we
have to declare some variables but
before that
we will
write the header files that is hash
include iostream
and then the namespace standard
all right so we have included the header
files now we'll start with the main
function
inside the main function
we will declare the variable
so first variable that will declare
would be quant which stands for quantity
and the second variable would be choice
now we will declare those variables
that store the quantity of food items or
rooms
so let's say
the variable which will store the
quantity of rooms would be q
rooms
and
we have to initialize it also
all right so similarly we have to do it
with the food items as well so let us
suppose uh one of our food item is pasta
so we'll write
q pasta that is quantity pasta
we'll initialize it with zero
similarly we'll do with the rest of the
food items
that is burger
noodles
and shake
and chicken
here chicken would be let's say chicken
roll
so these are
our food items so these variables will
hold the quantity of these food items
so now we will declare those variables
which will hold the value of the number
of food items that have been sold so for
example q pasta holds the value of
number of pastas we had in our hotel and
s pasta will hold the value of number of
pastas that have been sold
so let's start
similarly we'll write s
rooms that is sold rooms
we have to initialize it with zero as
well
and s pasta
similarly asperger
s noodles
as chicken
all right
now we will create some more variables
that will store the price of the total
price of each of these food items or
rooms
so let's do that let's say in total
underscore rooms this is the variable
name
it will store the total price of the
rooms
we will initialize it with zero
similarly
total
pasta
equals zero
total
burger
all right
so these variables holds the quantity of
food we have
these variables holds the quantity of
food we sold and these variables will
hold the price the total price of each
of the food items or rooms
so let's
comment it this holds quantity
so that it's easy for you guys
all right so here we have declared these
variables
now
now we will make a list kind of a
structure in which we will ask
the user
to enter the
number or quantities of food items or
rooms that we have in the hotel
so
all right now let's do this
first of all we have to display a
message
but before that we'll use slash n and
slash d
so slash n means the next line and slash
t will add a horizontal space in the
output
so we need
that horizontal space
so we'll write
quantity of food
let's say items only quantity of items
we have
we have in a hotel all right
now
we'll write rooms available
so we'll add slash in and
rooms
available
all right so after this
we will write c in and take the input of
quantity of rooms we have because here
we are asking to enter the number of
rooms we have
so we'll write c in q rooms because it
holds the quantity of rooms we have
we have initialized it with zero
similarly we'll do it for the rest like
quantity of pasta like this will do
inside the
slashing
now we'll write the quantity of pasta
see in
q pasta
all
right
now similarly
let's copy paste
and save some time
so this first was the pasta then
burger
and cube
then there was noodles
few noodles
similarly we'll do it for shake
and then
here chicken is the chicken roll
so quantity of chicken roll
q chicken
all right
so
one by one q room the quantity of rooms
we have to add q pasta the quantity
pasta we have to add then quantum burger
we have
all right now we have to create a menu
to select the pasta burger room all the
items we have to create a menu like that
and for that let's do this
we'll write c out again we'll use
slash n
slash and then
again slash d slash
t
because you want some horizontal space
in that
we'll display a message saying that
please select from the given menu
options
all right
so it's a message for the users
or the customers i would say
now again we'll use slash n
because i want to add some new lines
so i'll use two selection
now
first is rooms
secondly we'll use only one selection
and
here we are creating the
menu to select the food items or rooms
so now we will write
pasta
and similarly we'll copy paste
so pasta then there was burger
the noodles
and there was shake
then there was chicken
chicken roll
we also have to change the numbering
that this is one this is two
then this is three
we are doing the numbering because the
customer will press the number
and then he can order
five
six
and now again we'll
in seventh position we'll add the
details or information
regarding the collection and sales
so
[Music]
we'll write
press 7 if you want to see the
information
regarding
sales
and collection
this option would be used by the owner
of the hotel to check the total
collection for the day
all right now again
the eighth number
is for
if you want to exit
yeah
so this is done now
after that we'll display a message
saying that
please enter your choice
so we'll use slash and slashing and
right
please enter
your choice
now i will write c in choice we have
already declared this variable
now based on this choice your order is
selected like if you press
2 then this pasta would be selected like
let's say if you want to order noodles
then you have to select four and if you
want to
order chicken roll then you have to
select six and if you want to
check the total sales and connect
collection of today
that is
for a particular day then you have to
click 7 and 8 for the exit
so a first part is done now in the
second part we have to add the
functionality to the choice part that is
if a user enters the first number that
is number one then rooms is selected and
then he or she have to add the numbers
of rooms they want
similarly for the other food items as
well like if they want to take two
burgers or three burgers instead of one
and we only have one burger left
then also we have to display a message
saying that only so and so burgers are
left
so now let's start with it
so now we'll write switch case
statements so when
the user will select a particular number
so that particular case would be
executed
so now let's
do that
right switch
and
inside the switch statement
we'll write choice
now the choice can be one two three four
five six seven eight
all right so now we have to create eight
cases for that
so case one would be
we'll start with it
there's a space between case and one
all right so case one would be
first of all inside the case one
that is the case when rooms have to be
selected so first of all we'll display a
message saying that enter the number of
rooms you want
so let's do that
use slash n
now
enter the
number of rooms you want
all right
now after that
the user will enter the number of rooms
that is the quantity of rooms
so now we'll take the quantity
in the quantity variable that is quant
variable
so the user will enter the number of
rooms that is the quantity of rooms he
or she wants
now we'll use a if statement and if
statement inside this if statement now
inside this if statement will check do
we actually have that many rooms in our
hotel or do we actually have that many
pastas or burgers in our hotel
right now so for that we have to write
down a condition that is
q rooms
minus s rooms
is greater than
equal to
quant
that is
q rooms is the quantity of rooms that we
have and s rooms the number of rooms
that we have sold
so if
we minus both of these that is if we
subtract the quantity of room we have
minus the rooms we have sold will get
the remaining rooms now if the remaining
rooms it's greater than equal to the
quantity of rooms that have been ordered
by the customer then
we can give the room to them otherwise
we have to display a message saying that
we don't have that many rooms or
something like that
so let's do that so we'll write s rooms
that is the rooms that we have sold so
initially its value is zero so we have
to add the values of quantity that have
been
entered by the user so we'll add the
quant variable that is if the user have
entered two rooms he or she wants then
we'll
add the add those two values to this
sold rooms
all right after adding the quantity to
the sold rooms now
we will do the total price of the room
or rooms and for that we have the
variable
total
room
so we'll add
this quant
into the price of a one room
to this total room
so
we are simply adding
total room
plus
quantity
into the price of a single room that is
let's say 1200 is the price of a single
room
if a person orders two rooms then it
would be like quant that is two two into
1200 2400 will be added to this total
room this total room is the total price
of a room
all right
now we also have to display a message
saying that these many rooms have been
allotted to you so for that let's
display a message
first of all we'll use slash n like two
times now
we'll add some horizontal space as well
all right
now we'll display this quant variable
and write a message
that these many rooms
have been
allotted
to you
let me let's make it room or rooms
room or rooms have been allotted to you
so this message will be displayed
all right
now
this is the if block now we'll have to
make the else block that
if the
amount or quantity of room entered by
the user is more than the remaining
rooms then we'll display a message
saying that only so and so rooms are
left in the hotel
so we'll use slash n then again slash d
now
write
only
few rooms
minus s rooms that is here q rooms minus
s room is the remaining rooms are the
remaining rooms so
subtracting both of these
variables will give us the remaining
rooms
so
these were the remaining rooms
remaining
in
hotel
all right
and let's not add these as there's a
single statement
also we have to use break
so we'll use break statement now
similarly we have to create case 2. this
case was for the room
so whenever a user click on this one
then this case will be
executed so similarly we'll create a
case 2
so let's
we'll copy it now we'll paste it
so
[Music]
i will case to
so in this case enters the number of
rooms you want we can't we can't write
that
so we'll write past the quantity
so let's do that
we'll write
enter
pass the
quantity
all right so in this case
the cn would be same that is quantity
variable we have
so
now in this case the different thing
would be the queue rooms instead of
queue rooms we'll use the
q pasta that is the quantity of pasta
minus sold pastas
it must be greater than quantity of
pasta we have
then only if block will execute
otherwise similarly as that of this
block will display a message
so now
the s rooms instead of s rooms here
we'll use s pasta
which is initially zero
so we'll add the quantity of pasta to
this variable that is will add the
quantity of pasta that is ordered by the
custard to this variable
now
total pasta that is the total price of
the pasta
so the number of pastas ordered by the
customer into the price of a single
pasta let's say the price of a single
pasta is around 250.
so quantity into 250
now
rooms instead of rooms let's do here
pasta is the order
so quant
so quant will display the
quantity
so it will display like if you have
order two pastas will it will display
two
pasta
is the order
and
q roms here we have to display the
remaining so we'll do the q pasta minus
s pasta
and here we will do is pasta remaining
in hotel or stock
pasta remaining in hotel
so it will display the remaining pasta
remained in the hotel now so
else everything is fine now similarly
we'll do for the next
we'll copy it it will save some time
and paste it now this is case three the
case three is of burger
so
able to write
burger
quantity of burger minus
burgers
similarly s burger
now the total price of burger
so let's say the price of a burgle is
around 120
and so
the remaining burgers
q burger minus asperger
the fourth case now
that is the noodles case
so enter noodles quantity
now case 5
now case 5 is of shakes
so we'll write enter shakes quantity
now
case 6 we have to create
in the case 6 there is chicken roll
so let's do that
chicken
minus s chicken
also we have to change the price of each
meal like chicken roll
would be of around 150
and this shake would be
120
noodles
140 let's say
burger is okay then
pasta is also okay
so we have created six cases as of now
so our second part of the program is
done now we'll start with the third part
of the program
so the third part will contain the case
7 case 8 and the default case that is if
the user enters any other number which
is not in the list that will come under
default case
in case 7 we have to display the
information of sales and collection that
is how many
money we have collected for the day and
the remaining food items etc
so now let's start with the case seven
so when the user will enter
seven that is case seven
then he want to see the details of the
information of sales and collection
so we'll display a message saying that
details
of sales
and
collection
all right
so after this message let's add slash
slash t slash t
all right
so after this message
we have to display the number of rooms
we had the number of rooms we gave for
rent
and then the remaining rooms that is
minus the quantity of rooms minus the
sold rooms then the total rooms
collection for the day so similarly will
do for all the meals like pasta burger
noodles etc
so let's do it
so we'll start
display
first of all we'll add slash in
now
number of rooms
we had
we'll display q rooms that is the
quantitative rooms we had
now
similarly
number of rooms
we give
for rent
all right
so we'll write
s
runes
now we have to display a message
similarly we'll write slash and slashing
remaining
rooms
so
for that we have to simply subtract
queue rooms with s rooms that will give
us the remaining rooms
after that
the total price that the room has
collected what number of rooms have
collected
so we'll write
total
rooms
collection
for the day
now
it is stored at total rooms
this variable is storing the total
drives of rooms
this is the complete information of
rooms similarly we have to do it for the
burger noodle pasta etc
so we can copy we'll copy this part
and we'll do
copy and paste
and paste
again we'll paste
now number of rooms we had instead of
this we'll simply write number of pastas
we had
number of pastas
we have to change that
number of pastas we
sold
yeah that would be right
now remaining past us
there are few minor changes that we have
to do
total
pasta collection
also make sure to change the variables
total
pasta
then
q pasta
all right now
after pasta it was burger
burgers we have
number of burgers we sold
all right so
it will be q burger
and s burger
remaining burgers
total burger collection for the day
all right
now we'll do same for
noodles
all right now
shakes
number of shakes we had
number of shakes we gave
we sold
remaining shakes
now there is chicken roll
number of chicken rule we had
all right now the case 8 the case 8 we
have used for this was the case 7 and
the case 8 we have used for exit as you
can see here
this is the exit case
and for that
we'll simply
use the exit statement the exit
statement is used to terminate the
program to shift the control out of the
program or exit the program
so here we'll use that so k state would
be
exit and inside that will use 0 0 will
mean that 0 millisecond
and now after that we'll have to use the
default case that if the user enters any
other number that is not present in the
menu list then this default case will be
executed so in this
default case we'll display a message
saying that please select from the
numbers that are mentioned above
so we'll use slash n
please
select
the numbers
mentioned above
so this message will be printed
and also one more thing is there
we have to use a go to statement
and we'll have to label
a part with m
now i'll explain to you that why have we
used this jump statement that is go to
statement
so after making a choice we again want
to choose another option that is if i
have ordered two pastas then i also want
to order two
burgers as well
so
we will mark
or label
menu with m
so this is a menu please select from the
menu options so here we will label m
and
in the last we have used the go to
statements
so the go to statement here will
transfer the control to the menu after
making a choice
so again m is the label we have used for
the menu and we will use a go to
statement to transfer the control to the
menu after making the choice so that we
can make more choices
go to is a jump statement basically that
is used to jump from one part to another
part having a specified label
so we have labeled menu with m and this
go to jump statement will help us in
jumping to the menu after every choice
all right so our code is done we have
done all the things that we need
now we need to run it
and for that firstly we need to save it
all right so let's go to files and save
it
and now let's
select the destination folder
let's name it as management
management dot cpp
all right
so the program is saved
now let's try to
compile and run this program
so there are some errors i can see
okay so
we have used
the semicolon
now
this will take care of many errors now
let's try it again compile and run
let's check q noodles
all right i think uh
q noodles
so we have two backspaces now let's try
to
compile and run again
hope it works now
so quantity of items we have as we can
see
so rooms available let's say we have 10
rooms
and quantity of pasta
we have
25 pastas in our hotel
and around 50 burgers
and 30 noodles
and
36
chicken roll we have 40
so this is the menu please select from
the menu options as you can see
first rooms then pasta burger noodles
shake chicken roll information regarding
sales and collection and then it to exit
so first of all
let's say
i want to order two rooms so i'll click
one please enter your choice i have
clicked one and i'll press enter now
enter the number of rooms you want
and let us suppose i want two rooms
so as you can see
two room or rooms have been allotted to
you
now again the menu is displayed on the
screen now let's say i want
burgers so i'll click on three
and i want two burgers
and two burger is the order it is
displayed
now again i want a
pasta let's say
i want
six pastas
and six pasta the order
i want
to order now shakes
let's have something to drink i want to
order
nine shakes
nine shakes is the order
and let's say
so as we know that we have only 10 rooms
now let's try to enter 11
so first of all we'll enter one that is
rooms
now let's try to order
11 rooms
as you can see only 8
8 rooms available or remaining in hotel
so we forgot to add some space over this
part
but we can easily read it now as of now
so
it is displaying the message that only
eight rooms are available because
already we have ordered
two early it was ten then now only eight
rooms are available so this is showing
that if we order
more than the quantity then it will
display this message
now let's say i want to
check the information regarding sales
and collection of today's
rooms and as well as meals so i'll
simply click on seven
now as we can see it will simply display
all the
sales and collection
rooms and meals as you can see number of
rooms we had 10 number of rooms we gave
for rent two remaining rooms are eight
so total rooms collection for the race
2400 as one room is of 1200
so similarly number of pastas we had 25
number of pastas we sold 6 remaining
pastas we had 19 so the total pasta
collection is 1500 so and so the burger
and then noodles and then shakes and
chicken roll
so this is the total chicken roll
collection for the day
that that is we haven't ordered a single
chicken roll also we can do one more
thing we can simply
display the total result of all the
collections of rooms and meals
so let's do that
now so to display the total collection
of the day all we need to do is to add
all the totals of pastas burgers and
rooms
so for that we have to go to case seven
now we'll write slash and slash and
slash in three times
so here we'll write total collection for
the day
and after that
total rooms
plus
total
total burgers
total pasta
this total
burger
total
[Music]
chicken
all right after this we will use the
break statement
now let's run the program
so here it is rooms available
let's write 10.
quantity of pasta
30
quantity burger 50
quantity of noodles 30
shakes 30
chicken roll
40.
so first of all i'll book two rooms i'll
click on one and now two rooms
and again
if i'll click on
rooms
and then if i try to click
10 rooms because already we have two
sold we sold two rooms then it will
display that only eight rooms remaining
in hotel
now i'll
click on two to order pasta let's say i
have ordered five pastas and
five pasta is the order
now let's say if we click on nine
although we know that only one to eight
numbers are available but if we click on
nine
so it will display a message please
select the numbers mentioned above
all right now let's say i have i want to
order chicken roll
10 chicken rolls i want
so 10 chicken roll is the order now i
want to check information regarding
sales and connection for the day
so click on 7
and then here i can see
number of rooms we had number of rooms
we gave for rent remaining rooms and
total collection for the day
similarly for the pasta
similarly for the burger similarly for
noodles
shakes and
chicken roll as well
and this is the total collection for the
day 5150 exit
and if we click on it we can exit
so as we can see
this is our hotel management project
and this is how it's done
the code is bit long but it's worth it
you can also try this project on your
own
alright guys with that we have come to
the end of this video on project in c
