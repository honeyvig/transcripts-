yeah having us uh hope you're doing good
and uh this is dr srikanth from team mds
conquer so now i'm going to give a brief
glance of
the upcoming combination of subjects
that we are going to
handle that is nothing but arthur and
widow okay so
[Music]
coming to ortho ortho is definitely one
of the toughest subject
among the list of the clinicals what we
have in the part b in neet exam i hope
like neet
has part a and part b and part b will be
dental clinical subjects okay so out of
which i can definitely code that
ortho is going to be one of the toughest
subject in part b
why it is toughest
the reason is very simple because most
of the orthodontic treatments are not up
to a bds level means in a normal bds
level
we are not exposed to the clinical part
of ortho
we may do some background lab lab sort
of work that is your springs clasps and
everything okay so that is the main
reason so we are conceptually
more of an uh imagination part so we
don't treat we just imagine that it
would be treated like that so that is
the reason why it is more of an
imaginary part and it's going to be a
bit difficult
coming to pedo
has already discussed with you so many
times pedo is is is going to be a
combination of
all subjects
from a pediatric point of view means if
you take operation there will be few
differences to an adult to a pedophile
to a pediatric kid if you take surgery
there will be few differences pediatric
kid is different adult is different if
you take endo few differences will be
there so only you need to focus on the
differences because the major content of
oral surgery
of a pedo is going to be done in the
oral surgery part and endo will be done
in the indoor part and
cons will be done in the con
conservative part prostho will be done
in the prosthetic part okay
apart from that there are few other
things that you have to focus on the
first is child psychology so second one
is behavior management which includes
non-pharmacological and pharma
non-pharma and pharma out of the pharma
your conscious sedation is very
important that is your nitrous oxide
constant sedation which is a part of
your pharmacology that comes under
general anesthesia which is again a part
of your oral surgery and general surgery
so apart from this we need to focus on
stainless steel crowns different types
of crowns given in the pediatric kit and
apart from this the other minor
minor minor topics here and there okay
which i have included under pedo
concepts so pedo is going to be less
focused because it is a generalized
thing which is covered with most of the
dental subjects in the part b but coming
to the blueprint point of view
so if i talk about the blueprint so the
blueprint of neet is clearly telling
that
your pedo is going to carry 14 marks
okay
okay and for your ortho is going to
carry
14 score and apart from that community
okay your community has one more subject
added that is called as prevent to
prevent to along with community is going
to carry somewhere four to five so in
this in this particular few days in the
upcoming few days we are going to learn
pedo
ortho
and a preventive aspects okay that
that's
those topics are included in community
operative everywhere okay so this is
what the plan of action is
and definitely will be more inclined
towards ortho because ortho is going to
take time when compared to the pedo in
the upcoming few days right so this is
what the plan and this is how we are
going to proceed and coming to the
schedule which i have given is
august 22nd we are going to cover growth
and development and development of
dentition
and 23rd is ethiology of male occlusion
classifications of male occlusion so all
these topics are combination of ortho as
well as speedo common topics for
arthritis and 24th will be focusing on
cephalometrics 25th
model analysis and skeletal maturity
indicators
26th is preventive ortho
and 27 is interceptor orthodontics with
ortho study models all these dimensions
and everything
which is again a part of your pedo and
ortho preventive ortho interceptor is a
part of your pediatric dentistry also
then goes to the removal appliances you
are very familiar with all the removable
appliances because most of the practical
part of ortho in the final year will be
removable appliances then we will move
to the fixed appliances
then comes the pedo part that is the
behavior management which is being
divided into pharma and non-form of non
pharma is very very important
in examination point of view apart from
non-pharma most of the questions will
come from that area also so 30 first i
want you to cover the normal diseases
and syndromes of pediatric kid which are
a part of your oral path in oral
medicine
okay so
okay so so those things we are going to
cover
along with the behavior management
continuation so first september is
biomechanics of ortho diagnosis
treatment plans
followed by anchorage your familiar
habits different habits thumb sucking
tongue trusting all the habits and
followed by retention and relapses
theories and everything we are going to
cover on the second third i will be
discussing few pediatric concepts okay
so i told you right there a few
differences few minor minor aspects
which we are going to list out and i am
going to give you uh the content where
you need to prepare how you need to
prepare and everything
followed by fourth and fifth we are
going to cover maya functional
appliances and orthopedic appliances
sixth and seventh is child psychology
along with the pedo concepts
eighth and ninth i want you to pick the
revision tenth is going to be your
examination so this is a rough schedule
which i have planned
and
and and the conquer team has
worked so hard in the last couple of
days to provide you the best content in
the form of smart videos so smart videos
are available on the website for
95 to 98 percentage of the topics which
i have listed both from ortho as well as
speedo apart from this there are many
other ah many other topics which we have
listed in the smart videos but not
not i mean like not much discussed in
the schedule because they are going to
be part like stress strain graph uh the
concepts of stress strain graph which
are a part of your dental materials is
again here the few terminologies
soldering and welding part of your
part part of your ortho related to
dental materials there are other
orthodontic materials which are going to
come under dental materials uh and we
will try
to cover all those
things within this couple of days
so i hope you are very very clear uh
with the descriptive part and coming to
the tasks okay next i want to talk about
the tasks
so
so tasks is nothing but must do
okay so the must do the first must do is
is is the smart video content
smart video content available on the
website because we tried our best to
cover the major questions concepts the
tricky areas that you need to understand
everything in the smart videos which are
which are available on the website and
i mean there may be repeaters who were a
part of mds conquer last year there were
lots of updates in the smart videos
compared to last year to this year lots
of modifications are done and in this
couple of days in this two weeks we are
going to do so many other modifications
in the smart video so please try to have
a glance over the content
if you're already done with the
particular video then it's okay if not
please do update the things because
questions which were given in
ames
questions which are being picked the
topics which are being picked from
karabana
choice of choice of book for aims and
everything were
recently updated by usha mam or oshawa
in the smart video so smart videos are
must do contents the first important
thing is smart videos and the second
important aspect that i want to stress
on is smart notes
wherever it is stressed
whenever i stress something in the smart
notes because every day i am going to
give you an update what to be done how
to be done and how to approach for a
particular topic in the voice note in
the morning if i am stressing
this particular smart notes has to be
done thoroughly means you have to do it
so not all the smart notices are must do
if time permits you do all the smart
notices but
whenever i am stressing to do a
particular smart notes that has to be
done thoroughly
right so the next must do
when you're talking about the ortho and
pedo is
recent concepts recent
recent
our cues recent questions
questions along with the synopsis
content okay so recent questions along
with the synopsis content from 2015 to
2022 has to be done thoroughly okay
where are they present they are present
in your dental pulse so if you open your
dental pulse
you you turn all the pages of pedo you
turn all the pages of ortho so at the
last you are going to have all these
contents recent questions
they'll give you recent questions 2017
2018 2019 2020 21 22 recent questions
concepts has to be done
okay make sure whether you're going to
do
recent questions simultaneously with the
schedule or once you're done with the
entire syllabus if you want to do your
wish but this is must do this is must do
right so once you're done with this
regularly apart once you're done with
the smart video and associated smart
notes if i am stressing on a particular
day next important thing i want you to
solve dental pulse
mcqs
because solving mcqs is very very
important thing and the and the source
of solving mcqs is definitely dental
pulse
and
dentist okay so dentist clinical part i
hope like few of you got the dentist
clinical part if okay so first i want
you to finish the pulse first i want you
to finish the pulse before pulse
okay
i want you to finish the smart video so
the sequence of arrangement according to
me is one
if i'm stressing to do smart notes too
the third one is dental pulse
three
time permits
dentist for time permits only time
permits optional
repeaters as you have time you can do it
there is something called as sharon
jittender sharon orto mcq book okay you
will have huge number of mcqs that is
fifth again it's an optional
interns may not have time to do all
those things but repeaters kindly do
because at least pulse if you do that is
more than sufficient to crack a great
rank okay so don't dilute your subject
doing multiple books my suggestion is
either you can do dentist or dental
pulse according to your wish cheryl and
the second book is optional okay so if
you do dental pulse
dentist and sharon are options
okay if you're doing dentist your dental
pulse and sharon are options right so
this is this is the sequence of your day
and followed by the sixth sixth part of
your day is
daily
activity
daily activity on the whatsapp
so what's daily activity you will have
so please try to
focus on the daily activity on the
whatsapp because where i am going to
cover
uh major aspects like the important
concepts or the content content oriented
thing questions which are given in the
recent examinations that is our cues few
diagram based questions from the
textbook and all those things uh
integratedly will be covered in the
activity activity will be somewhere
around 30 to 40 minutes every day as you
know okay 30 to 40 minutes activity you
have on the whatsapp right so these are
mandatory things every day okay one is
smart videos followed by smart notes if
it is stressed either dental pulse or
dentist optional is sharon and try to
attend the daily activity so this is
what you need to do for this entire
orthopedic combination for the upcoming
few days
so followed by coming to the pro live
sessions
okay so
ortho you will have
three classes pro-life students will
have three classes and pedo you're going
to have two classes okay so totally
you're going to have
five classes of our torpedo each of two
hours so it's going to be at 10 hours of
prolife sessions so please be ready and
coming to the offline students
of hyderabad so you're going to have
two ortho classes
each of four end of hours so it's going
to be nine hours of ortho
and uh integratedly okay i'm planning to
cover pedo plus uh
endo and
and your operator part so pedo indoor
operative part so i'm planning to pick
somewhere around two two or three so
basing upon that we are planning the two
to three classes so it's going to be
around 10 plus hours of pedo and
followed by uh
i'm thinking to take more of an
interactive sessions like last week we
have taken pratisha mam has taken few
interactive sessions so interactive
sessions i'll be taking one or two and
each of
two hours
so it's going to hit somewhere around
four hours of interactive session so
this is uh what the descriptive part of
uh both the online students and the
offline students so i'm just going to
have a quick recap okay so coming to the
task to be done you need to start
everyday topic with the smart video and
if it is stressed please do add on your
smart notes okay and next i want you to
jump into dental pulse or dentist to
solve the mcqs repeaters please try to
focus on
sharon evening try to attend the
whatsapp activity okay and make sure
must do i want you to cover the rqs
and if time permits
you can do pp books
pp books now itself if not you can do in
the revision part because orthopedic
books are very well and
greatly organized but you can understand
the content only if you are done with
one proper round of ortho and pedo if
you are done with one round then you can
easily understand because that's
completely integrated ortho and pdo
memory based questions uh tables values
that you have to remember scientist
names lots of things of memory based
stuff related to the revision part of
ortho and pedo were included in the
power play books right so you can just
have a glance of orthopedic part of pp
book so that you will get to know what
are the contents that are present in
that so prolife we are going to have
five classes each of two hours and
offline uh we are going to have again
five classes each of four hours so it's
going to be somewhere around 20 hours of
session so august and september
we're going to finish this and 10th
you're going to be the examination part
so hope you're clear so rest everything
mind your things
secrets of arthur and pedo will be
discussed every day on your voice notes
and activities that going to happen on
your whatsapp so this is the aerial view
of our preparation let's start from
tomorrow in understanding each and every
step at a microscopic level all the best
take care signing off dr srikanth from
