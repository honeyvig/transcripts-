is a question for you all
how many of you like mathematics please
let us know in the comment section below
i'm sure not everyone loves mathematics
and that is completely okay when it
comes to learning cybersecurity
and our ninth reason is mathematics is
not a concern for learning cybersecurity
many of us find mathematics challenging
some have the aptitude for dealing with
numbers and some don't
and for those who don't they find it
difficult to proceed with a career that
has maths involved
however you can take your decision
without any worries when it comes to
cyber security as the domain of cyber
security does not involve mathematics
so if maths is not your strong point
then choosing to learn cybersecurity is
a great choice
this can definitely be a relief to many
instead you can get acquainted with
networking network security control and
coding to build a career in cyber
security
our eighth reason is that cyber security
is a profession that helps achieve the
greater good
cyber security consists of a set of
measures and approaches that help
companies and individuals data from
being compromised and stolen
cybersecurity professionals have
defended organizations from several
deadly cyber attacks that aimed at
jeopardizing an organization's
confidentiality integrity and
availability
cyber crimes are currently on the rise
with different types of cyber attacks
the threat to organizations and
individuals alike is only growing by the
day government agencies police forces
and cyber crime cells are tackling this
threat
however there is more requirement for
skilled cyber security professionals who
can protect data and work for the
greater good
therefore
if you want to bring about a positive
impact and a meaningful difference to
the society we live in
then learning cybersecurity is a great
choice
our seventh reason is that you get to
travel the world
who doesn't love to travel the globe
learning cyber security is a great
reason especially for those of you who
aspire to travel the world
with the lack of cyber security
professionals in the world there are
plenty of opportunities for skilled
experts to travel overseas to showcase
the cyber security skills which are in
high demand
the increased demand for cyber security
professionals is not just restricted to
one area but to the entire world
there are several employment
opportunities for cyber security
professionals across the globe so
learning cyber security can open new
doors for you overseas as well
our sixth reason is very interesting and
that is the fact that you get to work
with secret agencies and high profile
ones
like other professionals
cyber security professionals also have
the opportunity to work with several
prestigious multinational companies and
big giants like google dell accenture
and others however

with top government secret agencies like
mossad nsa nia fbi and so on so what are
you waiting for

showcase your skills to grab the chance
to work with these top agencies

you the liberty to begin late
and one such profession is cyber
security it is never too late to realize
that you want to become a cyber security
expert

professionals even after the retirement
if they have a good knowledge about it
you could also join cyber security
courses that train you irrespective of
your age
as long as you have good cyber security
skills there is no need to worry about
job security however late it is
our fourth reason is cybersecurity is an
evergreen industry

with the unprecedented rise in cyber

tackles these reasons to an extent
and that is why we have this reason at
number one
