regarding this
of examination and everything
yeah hope my screen is visible to you
okay right
so first of all uh
i know i know the mixed feeling that is
going inside you okay but i'm more
concerned about the external feeling
which is going to give you the outcome
okay
so
just a second
bye
yeah hi guys
so i need i need your response so let's
have a two-way communication okay so
we'll try to discuss very important
things that you have to focus on from
now to get a better rank okay so the
only thing is to get a better rank so
so let's talk about
right so let's talk about the date okay
so the date was out
so
it is jan 8
2023
okay so let's make it as
2020. it's just a tiny day to date okay
this is just annotative date
hope hope uh hope my screen is visible
to you
i'm audible to you
i need your response on the chat box
right okay thank you
okay right so
this date
this date what is january 8th
is just a temporary date okay it it
ah and now i'm not to give any random
statement that okay this will definitely
change or it's going to get postponed i
don't want to give any random statement
because i'm very happy with this because
this date
has
motivated so many students to take
things seriously do i agree for this or
not leave about postponing the exam we
will talk about whether it is going to
get postponed or not in the next session
with this date
most of you
are scared and most of you are worried
and most of you are reading at least
okay previously you are not reading at
the best but now you are reading okay so
this is according to me
according to me
this is good call
it's a good call
it's a good call like whenever you have
your patients and everything whenever
they have a caries lesion
they will wait they'll wait they will
wait their carey solution is there they
know that they have to get the feeling
treatment done but they will wait
but once they get pain they will
definitely come and get get the
treatment done okay so this pain
according to me
is the date of these is the things that
are
released by and be people that is okay
1082 calendar january 8th 2023 your
examination can be okay so by god's
grace i'm very happy that most of you
have seriously taken
the things and you are working hard good
it's a good sign it's a good call
okay
so first and foremost important aspects
that we need to stress on like for
everything there will be advantages and
there will be disadvantages pros and
cons so first i will be talking about
the positive side of this
first and foremost important thing all
the people who are in live the 200 250
plus who are in live or who are going to
hear this video in different platforms
okay hopefully you have started the
preparation
at least
at least 10 percent is
means you have started the preparation
and done with at least 10 percent to the
syllabus
or you are about to start because you
are already done with your dentistry for
four to five years you know ten percent
is a syllabus no need to worry you will
answer those questions do you accept
this or not most of you who are live
okay
you're done
is the screen visible here yeah so most
of you are done with at least
at least at least you know 10 percent to
the syllabus so you have started already
okay so if you see the other side of
this okay your seniors
who are done with exam that is you're
done with neet 2022
the counseling was not it started the
state counselling dates were not yet
announced for most of the states they
are still waiting
still waiting for the counseling to
start
so most of them have not started the
preparation they were just thinking to
start the preparation so the amount of
competition that they are going to keep
on you on you who are have already
started will be less or more you will
you only answer me will be less or more
is less or more the competition by the
seniors who has given the previous
examination okay is it less or more
okay
is it less or more a simple very simple
logic it is definitely less
definitely less okay so definitely it is
less it's a good sign for you
second aspect
second important aspect okay second
important aspect that we need to focus
on coming to you your batchmates
your batchmates
or your batchmates who can be repeaters
your batchmates who are interns
they have joined okay you know how far
how serious they are most of them are
thinking let's enjoy the internship okay
exam dates were still not at out exam
can be in april or march or february
that there's so many talks that are
going in the social media and most of
them are relaxed
relaxed most of them are relaxed not
taking things
seriously
okay
i feel like you are you are also relaxed
but at least the relaxation was at least
low or the seriousness was a bit more so
i feel most of you who are for hearing
this video okay who are who are watching
this video okay are definitely far
better than your batch mates who have
started the preparation
i want this answer to be yes or no
it may vary few people can say
no because they have not taken things
seriously okay but i i feel i strongly
believe that most of them can say yes
at least like more than 50 percenters
the third important thing i want to
stress is
whether this exam is january 8th
or whether it is february 8th
or whether it is march 8th
i don't know what you are expecting from
the postponement of exam okay let us
let's make it a six months exam
postponed for your happiness okay so
it's going to be april june july okay
july 8th any 8th any 8th or next year
not this year
you want to give next year exam 2024
okay nba people accept that also okay so
even if it is postponed by one year also
okay
what what what is going to happen to the
competition do you feel the competition
will increase our competition will
decrease you have started now or you
have started 10 months back okay now as
the date of examination is going to
prolong you have more time to read more
time to read the competition will
increase
do you feel do you feel people who have
already started the preparation already
have done at least one subject already
have done at least
some topics in some subjects do you feel
increasing in the time is an important
thing
for your
for your outcome or it's a disadvantage
guys i'm not here to tell you whether
you're going to complete the syllabus or
not
need examination criteria is not about
completing the syllabus
okay sir can i complete it no it's not
about completing the syllabus your main
goal of exam is completing the syllabus
or getting a rank getting a good rank
fourth one you want a good rank
good seat good callers or you want to
complete the syllabus
most of the people are worried about
completing the syllabus
no one can complete the syllabus i can
openly say i am teaching from past eight
years and i have prepared for three
times so it's almost like 11 years
preparation
okay from now okay
where i have started my internship in
2012 okay it's almost 11 years
preparation i have never completed i
have never completed okay so your task
is to get a good rank
a good department a good college
compared to your competitor this is a
comparative exam guys this is a
comparative exam
how well
compared to your batchmates you have
done well how well compared to your
college mates you have done well in this
exam how well compared to your state
people who have done who have done well
in this exam if you then you will be
state list in the state top 10 list
you'll get a gdc how well
in your in the entire country you have
comparatively done well this is a
comparative exam
so everyone has same time from now
in the same time how well how
comparatively you have given the best
score and trust me
as the number of days increases
as number of days increases
the competition will increase the
chances of good rank will drop down
do you accept this or not so everyone is
telling they want a good rank
it's not about completing the syllabus
it's about getting a good rank
pray that exam should be done as early
as possible
if you're done with one subject from now
pray god that exam should be done on
john 8 only
you're done with one subject you have 15
115 days you have 100 115 days you have
you're ready to work hard give
everything
it can be done from one one five days it
can be done for example this one one
five days is converted to double
exam is postponed by two to three months
definitely the chances of getting a good
rank for you will drop down because
again even if the exam is postponed by
three months or four months you will
read only seriously in the last three to
four months this is an open secret open
secret you have to accept it
for example now today one notification
has came out my exam will be in april
today you will not read
today you will not read you will take
that break that is the mind that is the
mindset of an a that this mindset of a
human being even i i try to relax myself
okay so trust me the good thing is after
seeing so many batches and analyzing so
many students talking
with each and every student possible way
my suggestion is pray pray seriously to
the god exam should be done by john yet
if you are already done with at least
one or two subjects
everything will be done don't worry
everything will be done
john 8 if your exam is done the chances
for you to get a good rank will be high
because
seniors have not started the preparation
more than 80 percentage of the seniors
are waiting for the counseling to be
done and to start the preparation second
important thing your batch mates
have not taken things seriously
till three days back now they're reading
now they're reading the story is
different now they're reading
but if you have done
10 percentages more edge than your
batchmate now you're already in the
competition
right so these are the good aspect and
third important aspect people who are
psychologically weak
every time
exam means even like for example you
take my mds third year exam i'm scared
i'm scared i did not sleep well
every every time whenever i keep a mock
exam i'm scared you write exam i am i'll
be scared because i have that phobia
towards the examination so how to
overcome this find a way to overcome
that so that if you find a way to
overcome such things you will stand best
among the competition first best among
your batch second best among your goal
is third best among your state fourth
national level so this is how step wise
you have to proceed towards the
preparation within the limitation time
look until the date that is being
announced any updated date that is being
announced by need
that need nbe i'll consider january 8th
as the final date let's work hard
where are their chances okay the fifth
important aspect
i was talking with you
okay the most important thing for every
one of you after january 8th date
announcement is
what is what is more important for you
now
which factor is more important
anyone can guess the factor
starts with letter t
time time yeah time
i told so many stories about time
whenever i take a motivation class so
time is the biggest thing in the
preparation
i told 100 times now at least you got to
know that the time is the biggest thing
in the preparation so if you can
save time
if you can
manage time if you can
preserve time your job is done it's
about time management saving time
preserving the time and using the time
properly in doing smart work
can be done i'll be there with you
i'll be there with you i i'll help you
out at my best next important thing that
you need to focus on is uh
interns how how how intense has to
manage their internship so i don't want
any intern to take a radical call now
quit the colleges take long breaks i
don't want anything to to be till then
till the original date is out what is
original date because most of you know
don't know because nbe people are going
to release a notification
they're going to release a notification
confirmation date of examination
confirmation dates of opening of
applications everything result date
everything they are going to release the
original notification confirmation
notification will be released very very
soon if they are planning to
drop your examination on january 8th
okay so then
then we'll decide
how many days you have to manage how to
manage how to handle the situation how
to do it okay so don't don't take any
sort of leaves any sort of breaks no if
you want to manage a particular subject
during the particular week or during two
weeks okay then you can take go back and
take one or two days break and try to
focus on the syllabus but don't take
lengthy offs like people last year i
have seen people uh taking off their
luggage from the college books and
everything moving to their hometown
preparing then suddenly postponement of
exam again they came back so i don't
want this to happen okay so as of now
you try to extract as much time as
possible and try to invest that on the
preparation okay right clear
i need your response on the chat box
next goes next important factor i want
to discuss with you is
okay how many hours
how many hours
you are preparing per day
please do answer answer this question
how many hours you are preparing every
day
please try to be in the mute here
so i i have a wide range of answers a
wide range of
numbers okay right so i'm happy with
your numbers so my suggestion if before
the date of announcement before the date
of announcement two days back
if your reading hours are
x hours per day okay x hour x hours per
day for example this x is ranging from
less than two to three hours if it is
less than two to three hours i want you
to increase it into 2x
means
people who are reading previously two to
three hours now you have to increase to
four to six hours
and next people who are moving around
somewhere around like four to eight
hours
per day
i want you to increase it to 1.5 x i
want you to move to somewhere around 8
to 10 hours
eight to ten hours per day okay right
people who are already doing more than
10 hours per day
i want you to increase it at least by
two to three hours that is i want you to
hit 12 to 13 hours per day no
don't compare like sir you're telling
them to read more okay my like basing
upon your situation for example this two
to three hours are probably
uh gdc interns
okay or interns with in colleges having
good op
or maybe mother
try to handling one or two kids or
clinicians who has their clinics
preparing for entrance to crack
mds or government job holders
okay so they need to balance their
government job and through the service
they want to enter into
uh enter into mds next year or people
who are who are different different
areas different different sources like
people who are preparing from usa they
need to take care of their masters and
followed by and or people who are
working in dubai and different we have
different categories of people so two to
three hours is i feel like such criteria
of people the second is 48 hours are
probably the repeaters who are a bit
relaxed and maybe interns with low
opening
and more than 10 hours are solidly the
repeaters okay right so this is what you
need to do
so what you are doing is for example a
student who is reading two to three
hours per day and now he is trying to
double it so the number of days are
doubled
so it is how much how many hours you are
reading per day is more important than
how many days are left over for example
okay so now try to increase the time
try to keep more time okay how you can
do this one
time management
everyone has this biggest question time
management how to time manage the time
is first thing is
social media
stay away from social media or keep only
a particular time
10 to 20 minutes for social media per
day
in rest everything
you have to go back open your phone
settings and keep internet off for
social media so there will be no
notifications because most of you
will get distracted by the notifications
from the social media
messages notifications all this stuff
right so first thing what you have to do
your internet access to the social media
is only for 10 to 20 minutes or else
completely stop it remove it
trust me if you remove social media from
your phone you will definitely save one
hour extra time every day do you accept
this yes do you say yes s for this how
many of you says for this if you remove
instagram if you remove facebook if you
remove all such things you will
definitely can save one hour more one
hour to the preparation time so this one
hour
into 115 days
is 115
hours of preparation will be saved for
example if you are reading only 5 hours
per day
5 hours per day
so by saving this one hour till the date
of examination till the date of
examination if you say this one hour you
can save 23 days you can add 23 days
more to the preparation to accept this
or not
just by keeping
by deleting your social media that is
instagram facebook and all these things
you can you can add 23 days more
preparation time
the second important things okay for
example
a student who is preparing from home
will not have much access to their
friends
or they may spend some quality of time
with the family but if i take interns
and i take repeaters who sit as a groups
and read
stop gossiping
gossiping will i can decrease one hour
of your time
definitely i can i can definitely bet on
this even if i meet my friends
even if you meet my friends occasionally
on the weekends we gossip more even we
also gossip more at this is we also
gossip more okay right gossiping will
decrease the stress mental stress that
is a different story okay but now
mental stress is being increased because
of lack of time so stop gossiping by
which you can say two hours
and decrease your sleep cycle
sacrifice your sleep cycle by half an
hour if you sacrifice your sleep cycle
by half an hour you can add 60 hours of
preparation time 60 hours of preparation
time where you can complete two subjects
you can give 30 hours for each subject
so in 60 hours just by decreasing your
sleep by 30 minutes per day previously
sleeping six to seven hours now you make
it as six and a half hours you can
finish two subjects till by the time of
exam these are very simple guys i'm
telling very simple logics you remove
social media
you can finish two to three subjects
you decrease the gross shipping you can
finish two to three subjects
and if you decrease your sleep cycle by
half an hour
you can finish one to two subjects
clear
clear
there are many students who has done
this it is proven it's it's not
something very tricky or hypothetical
okay you can do this
you need to try this okay right so next
important thing is smart
smart work okay so smart work
team work group work is important okay
make good friends in the preparation
make good friends in the preparation
because preparation is one of the
toughest phase if you have good friends
in the preparation phase they're going
to help you in the preparation and
probably these good friends in the
preparation phase will extend throughout
your life because i have many good
friends in my preparation face compared
to my college friends i have more
friends more trustworthy friends in the
preparation phase because it's the
toughest phase of your professional life
for sure
so i want you to do a team work like at
least keep some uh
30 minutes
plus 30 minutes if you're a repeater
okay studying in groups you can keep 30
minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes in the
morning 30 minutes in the afternoon a
group discussion make five of you
be a group so take some topic
start discussing some questions maybe
maybe some question papers maybe some
single liners or maybe some numbers
you do that and second one is smart work
okay so as dates are approaching i don't
want you to write heavy heavy notes
you have everything available on the
video
you can change the speed of the video
and you can monitor them okay no need to
do the repository content i see so many
students writing big big notes saving
them in big big folders so i have 30 gb
i have 40 gb what you will do with this
gb you will get a rank with this gb
you will get a rank you will get a seat
with this gb so most of the students are
i mean like i see students nowadays the
generation kids are more worried about
writing notes more worried about saving
each and every pick that is being posted
on your
uh on your whatsapp group or instagram
you're saving you're more worried about
that you are not worried about your
knowledge because your knowledge and
your hard work are going to give you
rank
whatever your right heavy note says
whatever you underline these are not
going to give you rank question will
come from these notes but to answer that
question you should have that common
sense in the brain so i want you to more
read more
i have seen students okay who write
notes and they got good ranks that's a
different story but on other hand i have
seen students who are never right they
never write notes they always try to
read the content they write they read
more content they try to understand more
content they try to solve more content
okay
is it clear
that that smartness should be there like
okay writing notes is not a bad call but
decide when to write like for example an
intern is having just two to three hours
per day to read
in that two to three hours will you
write notes for example repeater has 10
followers per day okay you write notes
12 hours is a very decent time intent
has just two to three hours or sometimes
i read only a half an hour sir
half an hour you have time per day read
that don't write that how how many pages
you can write in half an hour maximum we
can complete two sub topics in half an
hour while writing the notes so if you
at least read that you will complete
more syllabus that is going to give you
more confidence
clear can i go to the next point
the next important thing that i am more
worried about his positive
positive talks
whenever you talk with your batchmate
i want you to talk positive
if it is about preparation let's talk
positive
and when she's feeling low
or when you are feeling low
okay
first of all any person who is okay has
to talk positive hey this is very tough
exam date was out i am scared i cannot
finish it in one one five days i'm more
worried then you talk positive
you talk positive let's work together
sar is there sar will help us you will
talk with us
we will find some way and we will try to
solve this this year that positive talks
are important
whenever you speak negativity the
negativity spreads very fast whereas the
positivity spreads very slow but
positive minds positive talks positive
people will definitely end up with great
things in their life
first of all date of examination january
8
examination notification was out
immediately people start exiting the
group
is that positivity
do you feel after after examination
again they will rejoin the group sorry
i'm tensed so i exited okay again they
rejoin do you feel that's a positive
sign the positive sign is
you take things seriously read the thing
seriously focus on what you what are
your abilities not about your
disabilities okay and this is how this
is what required for the preparation
okay so we we require an ultra positive
mindset okay ultra positive mindset let
exam be postponed pre-pounded you do
your job and it's a comparative exam you
end up with great things
okay
right
next important thing that you have to
add to your preparation is a stop watch
a stopwatch which give you a buzz sign
every 30 minutes
whether you're an intern or a repeater
this should be with you every 30 minutes
it should give you the vibration if it's
on phone it should give you the
vibration it is on
on your uh on your hand like you have
your smart watches keep a stopwatch for
every 30 minutes it's going to give you
it's going to tell you every 30 minutes
time is running out and whatever the
task you are keeping for today
that can be a sub topic or can be a
topic or can be an mcqs or can be can be
an exams anything
my kind suggestion for every one of you
keep time for that
keep time
because we have started this class with
the most important aspect and the most
trouble troubleshooting aspect for you
the factor is time we have started with
the time the class has started with the
time
so for everything you need to add time
sir internship by this time it should be
done
my subject endor by this time it should
be done the topic in ender in this
minutes it has to be done mcqs and endo
everything has a time to accept this
how many are implementing this time for
everything
sir i want to get a good rank how many
years in how many years you want to get
a good rank this year or next year or
next to 10 years
you have a time limit right sir i want
to settle well in dentistry i want to
settle as a good and artist i want to
become a good oral surgeon my next
question is in how many years you are
planning this to happen
everyone will get married
but
when you are going to get married and
how many years you are going to get
married is a big question right
right similarly so every one of you keep
time time limit minutes seconds hours
days months okay now we came home from
our limitation of months to days okay so
i want everyone to keep a particular
time frame for everything
for that what you can do is you can
split your day
okay you can split your day okay this is
your monday
tuesday wednesday thursday friday
saturday and sunday
so this you can split the day
so you can split the day into four parts
okay part one part two part three for
example you're reading eight hours per
day
so it is two hours two hours two hours
two hours
and you're only done with
done with only four subjects or five
subjects or two subjects less than ten
subjects
you're done with less than 10 subjects
means you're done with less than half of
the syllabus
then my suggestion for for you guys is
you can keep you can keep two slots
okay you can split this so so this is
one hour one hour so you can keep
slot 1 slot 2 and half of the slot means
5 hours of your preparation time to
present subject which is running on the
group
as per the schedule
and rest
rest half slot plus two hour slot
i want you to keep for revision of
already done
this this half slot is for repeats
repeats repeats you start repeats from
2021
once you're done with 2021 go to 2020
2019 2018 2017 2016. so every day half
an hour repeats if your preparation time
is eight hours less than less than ten
subjects eight hours you give these
three two and two end of our slots to
the
present subject that is running you give
half a one two hour slot to the revision
which is already done
for example if a student is reading like
12 hours per day
12 hours per day so you can prepare
similarly you can prepare four slots
four slots
so three hours three hours you keep it
for the present subject
and next one is you can keep three hours
for revision
and you can keep two and one
two and one so here you can keep
revision of a non-clinical
here you can keep revision of a clinical
and here you can keep revision of the
repeats
for example a student who is done with
more than 15 subjects confident and done
with more than 15 subjects are confident
in more than 10 subjects
here you can split the day into four
parts
two parts you can give for the present
subject
or present tasks that are going on the
group and two parts you can keep one
part for non-clinical and one part for
the
clinical three hours per clinical three
hours per non clinical and you can keep
two hours or one hour for repeats so
this is how you need to split and divide
split
now because most of you are planning to
increase your preparation time by two
hours or three hours or four hours or
five hours you're ready for that right
so that is what the first commitment i
have taken from you that most of you are
planning to double the number of hours
you are reading at least from now so
once you double the time
then you will have more time it is two
two schedules you can run at the same
time so schedule one is something like
schedule one is something like which you
are already following
you are previously reading four hours
per day so four hours per day you are
able to complete the syllabus now you
are planning to increase three to four
hours extra time so this three to four
hours extra time is the scheduled time
too so the schedule time too has to
focus more on
revision of subjects which are already
done
and should focus more on repeats
questions which are frequently repeated
quick revision content questions which
are frequently repeated more mcq solving
and all these things i think this is
very very clear
right
right right right so i'm just going to
quick all the positive sides of our
preparation
okay
right so positive sides of the
preparation date was out date is good
everything what happens in our life is
good
may not be good now but it will be good
soon okay so this is how the positive
people they think whatever happens in
their life is for good you learn
something from that you try to move on
okay so
people who have started preparation
it's good your seniors are not it
started the preparation
counseling is still going that's a good
thing you are i feel like most of you
are far better than your batch mates in
the preparation point of view that's a
good sign
whatever may be the preparation time
if if the preparation if the exam is
being postponed
competition will increase and your
chances of getting a good rank will drop
down so i don't want
the exam to be postponed let's finish
the exam fast let's work and finish the
exam first okay so our target is not to
complete the syllabus or whether we can
do this or cannot do this okay most of
you have covered the syllabus
have covered the entire syllabus of a
particular subject in less than three to
four days and you have cleared the final
year
to accept this
most of our syllabus whether it's a
topper also they cover most of the
syllabus revision everything they have
done in three to four days before you
give your final exams let it be a topic
i am also topper at a uc level but i
read more i read throughout the year but
whatever i read in the last one month
covering all those eight subjects 18 to
3 24 the last one month preparation is
more intensified preparation throughout
my throughout my videos
first year last one month second year
last one month third year last one month
fourth year last one month and coming to
my entrance examination last one to two
months my preparation is something like
more than 15 16 hours i don't eat i
don't i keep on reading this is what we
do it is we have done it so many times
there is nothing new here so target is
not to finish the syllabus here theory
exam the target is to get a first class
or get a distinction or or pass the exam
different levels right and it's not
about completing the syllabus have you
completed the syllabus any subject top
to bottom from first line of the
textbook to the last another textbook
anyone
no come on let's talk let's talk
anyone anyone on the group first phrase
to last space
no one will do that okay so target is
not a complete the syllabus target is to
get a good rank better rank than your
batchmate than your statement then in
all india
time management saving preserving
managing the time within the college
within the clinic
within the study hour within the offline
center is very very important
right so how many hours you read you
need to improve your hours okay right so
next one is smart work teamwork is
important always talk positive to your
co-aspirant whenever you talk with
mentors try to talk positive you can cry
you can do all sorts of things with the
mentors everything is accepted but you
try to be as positive
as possible about your preparation
preparation is something like
the most precious thing the most divine
thing in the
in your internship okay so when you're
talking about preparation you should
talk positive about it because if you
talk negative the preparation will feel
bad
bad and it will go off
for example you take pharmacology first
day you open pharmacology starts holding
pharmacology hey this is an idiotic
subject dry subject
tough subject
i hate pharmacology
if you if you if you if you are openly
telling someone that you hate how the
person will behave with you
how the person will behave with you
you're openly telling your friend that i
hate you so much
how he behaves with you same that is how
the pharmacology will behave with you
that is how the preparation will behave
with you so you should be very positive
to the preparation
okay you try to talk positive to the
preparation
preparation may may not have a life or
pharmacology may not have a life
but pharmacology will be will be in this
universe carrying some some energy okay
some molecules some energy so if you are
speaking positive to pharma pharma will
stay with you if you are speaking
positive to preparation
preparation will stay you start open the
books start the preparation and say ah
this year hundred percentage i'm sure i
will not get a seat what is going to
happen
god will tell you
means yes you are right god will tell
yes you are right
you are you are very strong and hundred
percent you are telling that a
hundred percent is i will not get a seat
yes right you are right absolutely right
it should happen god will tell you it
should happen
so same thing if you tell strongly that
i'll work hard definitely this year at
any cost i have to enter into government
dental college i have to enter into mds
by next year this this time if i enter
into mds
okay i have to enter into mds there were
few students telling me that at any cost
i need to crack this year
god will tell you for that also yes it
will happen god is very good whatever
you says god is going to do if he
strongly says that i can it will happen
if he strongly says i cannot it will
never happen
okay so this is what yeah my plan is
split divide
make a proper schedule keep a time frame
for everything okay and plan your
revision try to focus more on repeats
from from now itself don't don't don't
take suggestions from multiple people
okay some some people will tell you that
you okay you can do repeats in the last
one last one month or last 15 days last
one month last 15 days your time framing
is going to be so difficult you will
have some unnecessary commitments that
is going to disturb your preparation and
if you sacrifice repeats repeats are
going to kill you in the final exam so
it's better you start doing repeats from
one side because we are also going to
come out with
many discussions many activities live
offline online will try to pull you your
day from all the aspects from different
different sources why to post a video on
an instagram
because
i'm seeing i'm more worried my students
are uh my students are like they're more
addicted to instagram so at least if i
post something instagram at least they
will see if by a mistake one question is
coming from instagram they'll answer
right so that is my main mode of posting
the content in instagram in whatsapp
status is everywhere
small hope one question will change your
life that one question can be from the
whatsapp statuses or instagram statuses
whatever you're checking so that is the
main
thing that is running in the mind of mds
conquer team okay right so
yeah keeping this aside
so keeping this aside is there anything
that you want me to talk about
we have pro-life today i think now it is
we are running short of time but anyway
let's have let's have some interactive
talk
we can we can continue the pro live
tomorrow that's not a big deal okay
you have anything to discuss with me any
questions
anything
you can you can drop me on the chat box
yes inicit preparation if you're
interested you can ping me so i'll give
you the schedule because already we have
opened so many folders for inicd
and you can start working on that so i
don't want to discuss about ironic
preparation already people were in a
panic situation so now not on this class
so you can personally ping me
so we'll we'll i'll show you the
schedule
anything apart from inicit
whatever that is running in your mind
open up
sir proper schedule for interns so that
nothing is left for lost
we have the we have the best proper
schedule in the entire country here
this that is the best proper schedule
everything is we are planning to cover
proper schedule is already given to you
and we are doing it it's our orthopedic
preparation
okay so whatever you posted are nothing
so important to discuss in this life
it's take lots of time for me to just to
do
the stuff given by mds conquer
yes
imran khan how many how many hours
you're reading per day
that's what backlogs now you split the
day how much you are increasing the time
you're increasing your preparation by
two to three hours keep it for backlogs
keep that for revision
don't disturb that again don't come and
include the same subject that's what i'm
telling
today your task is a particular subject
okay operator dentist a particular topic
you have to cover
you try to cover those
those things within a time
previously used to read only four hours
in that four hours you try to finish
this
operator and whatever extra two hours
you have increased you keep that for
backlogs you keep that for revision you
keep that for this is how i want you to
split the time okay anyway i'll i'll i
will drop some
pdfs with splitting the time okay so you
can you can take the printouts and you
can fill the blocks
so this particular two hours every day
one backlog subject you start read only
two hours per day
let it be 10 days turn into 20 hours or
30 15 into 30 hours by by 15th day you
are going to complete that backlog
syllabus by reading only two hours per
day
okay if you want to do revision you keep
that backlog plus revision every day two
hours or three hours whatever the time
you are increasing and keep half an hour
as of now for repeats and repeats also
you try to focus on repeats
from subjects which are already done or
from the subjects which are going now
for example operator
today your task should be operating
repeats
how to complete backlogs or subjects
split split spitting schedule is
important
preparation is good but not perfect
perfect requires revision perfect
requires exposure to more mcqs that's
what i'm telling you need to first of
all
we provide we provide a buffet okay we
provide a buffet sources of information
valid information things from all the
sources
so to attend a buffett
first of all your stomach should be
empty
you're already full you had a full meal
will you enter will you enter into your
buffet
guys
your stomach is full
so can you eat anything in the buffet no
you cannot eat anything first of all
time you have to you should have times
now if you don't have time with your
personal commitments or some xyz factors
without time i cannot help
only if you can sir i'll read some five
hours sir i'll read from six hours i'll
work hard i can help you sir half an
hour i'll read i want to get a seat i
cannot help that
from where we should solve repeats
from here we should solve repeats here
anyone can answer this
yes pulse has repeats
dental pulse has repeats after every
subject
from 2017 to 2021 repeats are there
first solve them
after finishing that do let me know i'll
tell you the exact don't keep on adding
the books we have limited time so
there's no point of adding the books
first finish the pulse first finish the
content what is what we provide
sir we have completed one subject
we should solve
repeat time sequence from now and where
you have the same question how to cope
up with
going to clinic
no now now there is not nothing like i
don't want anyone to go to clinic date
of examination is out if date of
examination is not out you can go to
clinic you can manage the clinics and
everything now the date of examination
is out it's only 100 days you have so
now
planning the clinic and everything is
going to be difficult so i strongly
recommend you if it is your own clinic
try to find an alternator
appoint some doctor and ask him to sit
over there okay you try to monitor if
anything
if your presence is required then go if
you are working under someone i want you
to quit immediately because we are
running short of time
so there is no point of going for clinic
three to four hours is a decent time
okay i want you to focus more
three to four hours if you read three to
four hours
okay and you're a slow raider you can
finish only 60 to 70 percentage of the
content of mds conquer and that is more
than sufficient to get a good rank it's
not mandatory that whatever i provide
you have to read to get a good rank
if the exam is on january 8th with
saranghan intensity eligible for all in
your absolutely eligible yeah absolutely
eligible i can i can write this on a
thousand rupees bond paper and i can i
can give you
absolutely eligible
minimum study time for intense daily
there is nothing minimum time whatever
maximum you can do is a minimum time for
example you are coming and telling me
sir
maximum i can study four to five hours
per day so that is a minimum that is the
minimum time for you
or someone someone who has more
responsibilities can come until only two
to three hours that is the minimum time
so i want you to stretch to your maximum
levels
what is best
sir more time for reading or more time
for mcqs once you have core concepts
then you can solve more mcqs
so there's nothing like a principle i
can never say randomly do more mcqs okay
so now if you are if your concepts are
strong you can solve more mcqs accuracy
of mcq is more more important if you
want to be accurate in mcqs your core
concept should be strong for example if
a student is coming and telling me okay
if i'm asking what is the ph of edta
sir ph of edd is 7.3 what is the
percentage of edt 17 is
this is two lines
but reading top to bottom about edta now
any question about edt you can answer
so there are many there are few students
like uh
this is this is called as a
sectional sectional way of preparation
like it's like something patches edta
you read one point here you read one
point at the tenth question you read one
point at there one point here no this is
not the mode of preparation edta
everything top to bottom tender 10 to 11
points if you're done
there are 95 to 98 percentage of chances
if a question comes on edta go right so
core concepts are important
understanding the concept is important
then you can your accuracy in the exam
will be more
sir if our internship is going to be
completed in the month of may
are we eligible for the exam yes you are
eligible
i told you right on the group what is
the last date for completion of
internship which is posted on the group

worry okay
no need to worry and break your heads
telangana there's someone who is
spreading the rumors i don't know who is
who is that okay but it's completely
fake you follow me
i have a decent experience here see from
past six years
90 percentage of telangana mds students
are from concur and i know them okay
don't worry about that would i for an oc
student to get a seat
how much should be the score which seat
government college seat or private
college seat or
deemed college seat such
department believe about that you try to
give your best that is my
now discussing about seats ranks good
colleges good departments
i think that's this is not a this is not
a time for that
first what you have to do guys
to get a good seat
to get a good department in the in the
in the counseling what you have to get
first
give a good exam for a good exam you
have to study now so focus more on
preparation
once your preparation is perfect
everything comes on your way
is this schedule will be enough covering
the syllabus to appear for example
absolutely
absolutely more than sufficient what
about pp books now we are doing dental
pulse and planning to do pp books during
the revision yes pb books can be pp
books will be like a curd rice purity
i hope i have south indians know the
value of curd rice
when you will eat curd rice
at the end right curd rice will be very
smooth easy to digest means easy to
understand and curd rice
will be cool and compost
no masala nothing easy to digest so it
will be simple don't worry pp books will
be done
we are doing pp books in the offline
center here two to three hours for each
subject we are able to finish it from my
set okay you can take double so it is
maximum going to be
if you want to finish pp books it's
hardly take a week to finish the entire
pp books
focus on preparation not on the not on
the disabilities
window a categories no this is not time
to discuss about endo a category
when you have when you have gdc ender
will you take ender a category
guys anyone you have two options gdc
endo and endo a category
which you want to take
then why do you discuss about indo-a
category now pointless
i i strongly believe that you will get a
gdc entire so don't talk about a
category
now don't talk about bce bca please
don't talk about anything let's crack an
open category
if we are not able to crack an open
category then we will try to use the
reservation if you are getting a good
seat in open category then why to use
the reservation
sometimes what happened is that if we
have covered a topic completely and when
come across a question out of now then
learn it
no it's not about confidence confidence
is about final exam
confidence is not about when you're
doing a case when you're doing a class
to amalgam registration
in your final year
is that that class to amalgam
registration is going to determine your
life and dentistry
is going to spoil your confidence in
dentistry
you are a learning phase so i want you
to learn
something coming new learn it
whatever that is coming to you new to
you learn it and move on learn
understand and murder more because you
are in a learning face in pz also you
have to learn
once you come out every day you have to
learn that's what i'm telling my hvad
ma'am
whenever she feels anything new she will
learn till the day she has an experience
of more than 25 years i think 20 to 22
or 23 years of experience as a
as a staff as a teacher
which is more than the a's of you most
of you
she has a more experience than your is
but every day she will find some way to
work and she will learn something new
and she will she will learn and then she
will make their students to learn
okay right so it's a process of learning
so don't judge your process of learning
to that
online not possible pp books we don't
have such times pp books separate
section we don't have something offline
we have chance we regularly go whenever
i go i talk with them motivate them so
i'll sit to one hour one and half hour
with them and we'll try to solve some
some stuff pp books does not have any
repeats
every subject every subject folder the
videos folder whatever you have on the
website in most of the subjects you have
first video
as must do or how to manage the subject
some five or ten minutes is it is it
there guys
every folder subject wise folder you
have videos in that video first video is
probably how to handle what to be done
where to be done how to be done what are
the important topics to be done yeah
first check that video you will get a
you will get a brief idea that what you
have to do in the particular video okay
anything more
check out the possibilities only focus
on possibilities
so this is very positive you need to you
need to check out the positive way of
thinking here
for example if you are finding fire if
you are if you are planning to get
married and if your parents are finding
some girl for you boys i am telling to
you okay
so what your parents are going to tell
about you to the girls family
what they are going to tell about you
your introduction basic introduction
offline center is only in hyderabad
you're always welcome to come hyderabad
at any time i'll be always available
answer my question here
what the girls what the father's parents
are going to tell
about the guy when he's planning to get
so they are going to talk about only the
positive positive aspects okay no one is
going to come and tell that okay my my
boy can drink six bees at a shot he can
he can smoke 10 cigars per day he's very
good in uh
he's very good in flirting the girls
this is not they're going to expose okay
they're going to expose only the
positive side good things okay so now
when you have preparation
for you the leftover days you try to
focus only on the good aspect of it
don't try to focus on the possibilities
don't try to decide what is going to
happen
exam is free pointed i cannot read i
will never get a seat don't don't come
to any conclusions so this is a phase
where you have
gtc for example you take gdc hyderabad
you have gdc hyderabad 24 seats or 24
seats are there 12 will go for all india
12 will go for state
the leftover will in the state will be
occupied by telangana people or any
other people in the world
you have 12 gdc seats in telangana for
state pool
okay you have 12 seats
for example you take maharashtra
maharashtra you'll have some 50 seats so
these 50 seats will be occupied by only
maharashtra people or any other people
yes these will be occupied by only
telangana whether you read whether you
don't read whether your juniors read
seniors read whether your exam is
pre-pounded postponed exam paper is
tough for easy or anything
these seats will be given only for you
only
you don't read also you'll get a seat
that's what i'm telling
okay you don't read you will get a seat
any of you will get a seat
if you read chances of getting a seat
will be more okay
anything guys anything more
you have any questions
yes in website we have already uploaded
inicit
2021 2020 2019 papers and need 2018 2019
2020 and 2021 papers are already
available on the website
so keep in touch touch with the team uh
talk with the team
if you have any difficulties or if you
have any problems like
some sort of disturbance or something
open up
talk with the talk with the mentors here
i'm open here 24 into seven from past
eight years i'm doing this
okay i'm i'm open here i'm the only
thing what i'm doing is i want to help
you
i want to help you
so
no now this is not time to discuss about
local aids and everything okay so i want
to help you so you come out and speak to
us if you really want to be successful
if you really want to achieve something
okay so first of all
you express what is there in your mind
talk with the mentors
work hard and try to achieve that
if i post the overall schedule you will
get panic
there is no need of clarity here okay
you have one one five days every subject
folder has
what topics to be done how it has to be
done on the website
right what topics to be done how much
time you have to do a particular topic
everything clearly blueprints topics
must to do topics were explained in
every video okay so there is no point of
giving a schedule now again if the exam
is postponed i come out with a different
schedule again pre-pointed i come out
with a different schedule once the dates
are fixed notification is out last two
month schedule along with number of mock
exams you are going to attempt however
the repeats you have to solve everything
the proper pdf schedule will come out
till that date it's all 1082 so that's
that that's the reason why i release
schedule for every 10 days
well planned and well organized why it
is well planned and well organized i
read along with you
today i have done
the operative part
so previously i have done an indoor so
most of the subjects i read along with
you i keep on i open and i read my pulse
i have my pulse so i read i add points i
see what are the new questions given so
i read along with you all the subjects
mostly so then i will know within how
much time you are going to finish the
syllabus for example today's today's
topic will hardly take two hours to
finish
there is nothing in today's topic
okay amalgam is amalgam i don't suggest
you to ignore the amalgam
but today's topic there is nothing hifi
to be done watch the smart videos of
smart materials and pity and future
sealants that is the biggest thing and
pitt and features you are very familiar
maybe you need to take some time to
understand
some some of the materials smart
materials will take some time to
understand
okay right
now i'm ready i'm giving motivation i'm
giving motivation in the form of voice
notes but i feel like few of you are not
following them it's okay how many years
back papers we have to solve whatever
that is available solve it
there is no limit for anything
okay so as of now in the market uh you
will have question papers available from
2010
if you have some old books like in your
offline center
the questions are available from
2001
2001. we have question papers from 2001
and previous question papers also we
have okay
so that resources may be now if you want
to buy you can have question papers from
either 2009 or 2010. so whatever you
have you try to finish it and rest
everything will try to cover in the
last phase of last two months or two end
of months we'll be focusing more on the
quick revision videos or we'll take live
sessions and everything will try to do
it
now we need to have someone to talk
positive during the preparation phase
and of course
the job is
i'll handle that job
i have to be positive first i have to be
positive to make you positive
so we will maintain this integrating
time management is going to vary from
individual to individual
now i cannot segregate interns repeaters
i cannot segregate good students bad
students i cannot do that like few
others are doing
so we have a common thing so time
management is going to be different for
you and different for a repeater
different for an intern
i'll i'll split and give
if you tell me i can split and give but
i cannot keep a common schedule of
splitting time as a time management on
the group because it's going to disturb
students who are not able to give their
100 percenters intents will get
disturbed i don't want that to happen
everyone should go with a positive note
anything more guys
you can drop your
schedule
of like
i mean the timetable for this
week what you have done you can drop it
and how many hours you are planning to
increase you can drop it and i'll give
you
just say anyone can split
split yes that's what i'm told i told
you in the in the video class i told you
that even if it is
even if it is six hours or seven hours
of your preparation time you can split
you can split okay morning session like
for example you posted an oral surgery
if you're able to read one hour that you
can keep as one session
afternoon you read one hour that you can
keep as one session post call is before
dinner keep one session after dinner
keep other session
this is how you can break you can split
and in that splitting part give more
importance to the present subject if you
are not done with that if you are
already done with that
give only 20 days of time because
already done subject will fall under
revision first time you're doing subject
will be falling under main subject if it
is main subject okay i want you to give
at least more than 50 percentage of time
50 days of time eight hours of your
preparation you give four hours for
example if the subject is already done
for example endo is done for a few of
the people which we have done in the
last week so in such cases you have to
keep only twenty percentage of that
means for it for example it is eight
hours preparation time for you you can
keep only two to three hours of indoor
so the rest of the time you can focus on
other things backlogs of particular
topic
particular number of topics in a subject
or a backlog of a subject can be done so
you have some backlogs of doing mcqs
because during that during that
particular subject you you had some
favor or you have some you have some
festival or you had some
family function or something so just
listed those backlogs and come out to
solve those backlogs in this time
when you're coming with a subject like
operate which is already done if you
feel if it is already done for you you
try to finish it fast you try to revise
that fast every day two to three hours
or three to four hours and rest the rest
of the time i want you to finish the
backlogs and focus more on mcq solving
part
anything more
shall we close
the session
