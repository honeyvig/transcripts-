where I come from a government job is
highly respected quitting it is almost
seen as
Madness but I wanted to try something
new thankfully my family supported me
after my time as a major in Indian army
I tried to join corporate
world but the companies did not
understand my skills so for a while I
was not able to crack any job
after completion of my cissp
certification through simply learn I was
able to crack a new job at Deo
USA hi my name is ritesh Kumar I live in
guro
India I was born and bought up in bhani
of harana state from the very early age
my father encouraged me to try various
Sports which included basketball
badminton
swimming after 10th I opted for medical
and non-medical
and uh I pursued both of the domains my
inclination towards engineering led me
to join itm goodgo for information
technology during final year of my
graduation I went for SSB interview and
joined Indian
army after retiring from Indian army it
was hard for the companies to align my
experience with their requirements so
that's why I decided to pursue some
certifications for the validation like
cissp and
cisn while searching through various
study platforms like corsera udmi I came
across simply learn platform which had
cissp certification program which
aligned to my goals so I contacted them
and I opted for the course my Learning
Journey with the simply learn was
absolutely fantastic the support from
Simply learn was excellent with their
structured approach they provided
excellent help and guidance in extension
various doubts were cleared and even the
mentors were excellent in providing the
basic understanding of information
security I gained a lot of knowledge in
various domains of information security
how they interrelate and how to align
them in corporate sector the
certification gave me Clarity and
perspective after going through the
cissp program from Simply learn not only
I cleared the examination in one go I
also landed a job in one of the big four
currently I'm working as senior solution
delivery lead in deloid USA my motto in
life is you can do it today you can do
it tomorrow but eventually it's you who
will have to do it nobody else is coming
and doing it for you it's about taking
responsibility not procrastinating don't
be demotivated by current trends and
influences don't think that your job is
insignificant just because someone
somewhere is earning more than you in a
trendy job every job has a Valu work
hard understand field of your job deeply
success will follow
