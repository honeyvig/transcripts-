hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel
in this session we will learn about
progress tracker in excel but before we
begin make sure that you have subscribed
to our youtube channel and don't forget
to hit that bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn
now let us imagine that you are the ceo
of an id company and you have taken up
multiple projects
let us imagine that you wish to keep
track of all the projects
so what if there was a tool which could
keep track of all the projects
in the form of a detailed visualization
with the percentage in the form of a
graph or a bar chart
interesting right that's exactly what we
are going to design today using
microsoft excel
so without further ado let's get started
with our one point agenda that is
progress tracker in excel now to design
a progress tracker in excel let us get
back to the practical mode where we
might have to use our microsoft excel
now we are on the microsoft excel and we
have taken some sample data to make
things look simple so here we are
considering a set of students and their
attendance percentage so we will be
using this particular data and design a
progress tracker
now let us try to increase the size of
the cells
now select all the cells in the
attendance column
now we have selected all the cells in
the attendance column and in the toolbar
select the home tab and inside the home
tab you have styles group inside the
styles group select conditional
formatting and inside the conditional
formatting option select new rule
so in the new rule we want to select the
first option that is format all cells
based on their values
now here you can see format style
since we are trying to create a database
we need to select the option of database
here
and under the data bar options we have
some more options on the drop down menu
so here in the type select number
and
the minimum number is zero it is
automatically stored here
and the maximum value is again a number
and let us provide it as one
now here you can select the color for
your pass
now since we have already chosen green
for all the column headers let's choose
blue
and
select ok
now here you can see that the
values are being indicated using
bar graphs right and you can also see
the percentage values
but we can make it look a little more
better by shifting them to the left side
and
text could be given as white
so that it's more
uh vibrant to look at and now we can
also apply some conditional formatting
onto these attendance columns
so let us try to highlight the students
having attendance less than 65 percent
so highlight sell heroes less than
65 percent attendance
with
red color select ok
and there you go
you have the progress tracker right on
your screen
and using the same principles you can
track the attendance for all the
students
and also you can apply some conditional
formatting onto all your cells and
highlight the ones which are not on the
track now this is how you can implement
progress trackers using excel with that
we have come to an end of this session
