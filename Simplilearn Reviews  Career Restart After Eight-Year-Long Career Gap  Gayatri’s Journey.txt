looking for jobs and things didn't work
out for me then I completed my PhD but
still I could not find a better job
meanwhile I started a weekend restaurant
in my own kitchen but I wanted to to get
back to the workforce since I knew that
mechanical engineering would not alone
do I decided to take up a course in
artificial intelligence as it was in
huge demand so I went to Simply learn
artificial intelligence engineer Masters

me I was considered to teach artificial
engineering along with mechanical
engineering by my Institute New Horizon

course helped me stand out from the
crowd they immediately appointed me as a
senior assistant

friendly and easily understandable and
it's more than enough to teach bch level
students I still refer this course to
teach my students so I recommend anyone
to take up this course who wanted to
start their career with AI it worked for
