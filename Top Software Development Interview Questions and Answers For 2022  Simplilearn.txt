asked questions in the job interview as
a software developer let's see what all
we are going to cover in this video we
will start this video with the basic
introduction to software development
and move ahead to know more about coding
questions with their expected answers
for an interview
we will check on the top ask java
interview questions
and top ask python interview questions
again with their expected answers
so before we begin consider subscribing

so let's begin
hey everyone i hope you're all doing
great welcome to simply learns youtube
channel and today we'll be discussing
about the coding interview questions
we will begin this video with some
conceptual questions about data
structures algorithms and then move on

interviews
these questions will help you summarize
every important programming concept and
serve as a perfect preparation resource
for coding interviews

common problems asked in interviews
so let's get started with an exciting
video on coding interview questions
before we begin please make sure to
subscribe to our youtube channel and hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn so i hope i was clear
with the agenda now let's begin with the
top 40 coding interview questions that
you should know
programming interview questions are an
integral part of an interview for the
developer's position no matter which
programming language you master it is
expected that you are familiar with the
fundamental concepts of the programming
coding skills are always the deciding
factor in any programming interview we
will discuss the top 40 coding interview
questions you should absolutely know how
to crack in interviews to get your dream
job so without further ado let's get
started so as discussed the first part
would be the conceptual interview
questions
and that the first question we have to
face is what is a data structure so the
answer for this question is a data
structure is a storage format that
defines the way the data is stored
organized and manipulated some popular
data structures are arrays trees and
graphs moving ahead we have our next
question that is what is an array
so basically all the items that an array
stores are of the same data type it
organizes data so that a related set of
values can be easily sorted or searched
now followed by an array the next
question we have is about the linked
list
so what is a linked list it is
completely similar to array but there
are some basic differences like an array
a linked list is a linear data structure
in which elements are not necessarily
stored in a continuous manner so linked
list is basically a sequence of nodes
where each node points to the next node
forming a chain like structure
so followed by the linked list we have
the next question which is based on
stacks so what exactly is a stack stack
is a linear data structure that performs
operations in a leaf order
so in a stack elements can only be
accessed starting from the top most to
the bottom element
so followed by stacks we have our next
question which is what is a lifo so
basically lifo stands for last in first
out
so it is a way of accessing storing and
retrieving data
the data that was stored at the last is
extracted at the first
the next one after lifo is a queue so
what exactly is a queue
q is a linear data structure that
performs operations in a fifo order
so basically fifo is first in first out
in a queue the least recently added
elements are removed first as opposite
to the stack
so up next we have the fifo so what
exactly is fifo fifo stands for first in
first out it is a way of accessing
storing and retrieving data
the data that was stored first is
extracted first
the next question is about the binary
trees so what exactly are binary trees a
binary tree is an extension of
linkedlist data structure where each
node has two children
binary tree has two nodes at all the
times a left node and a right node so
these left and right nodes for the top
node are known as children of the top
node
next we have as recursion so what is
recursion recursion refers to a function
calling itself based on a terminating
condition
it uses last and first start
functionality and therefore makes use of
the stacked data structure
followed by recursion we have the oops
so what is the oops concept
oops stands for object-oriented program
and system a paradigm that provides
concepts such as objects classes
inheritance polymorphism encapsulation
etc so what are the concepts introduced
in oops
so the following concepts are introduced
in oops they are object class
inheritance polymorphism abstraction and
encapsulation now we will discuss each
one of them in a bit more detail
so we will begin with object a real
world entity having a particular state
and a behavior is called as an object it
can be defined as an instant of a class
so next we have the class
a logical entity that defines the
blueprint from which an object can be
created or instantiated is called as a
class so basically class is a blueprint
which we use to create an object
so followed by classes and objects we
have the inheritance a concept that
refers to an object acquiring all the
properties and behaviors of a parent
object is called as inheritance so
basically inheritance provides code
reusability
so followed by inheritance the next
important concept we have is the
polymorphism
so polymorphism is a concept that allows
the task to be performed in different
ways
in java we use method overloading and
method overriding to achieve
polymorphism
followed by polymorphism we have the
abstraction
a concept that hides the internal
details of an application and shows only
the functionality is called as
abstraction in java we use abstract
classes and interface to achieve
abstraction
the last one is the encapsulation
encapsulation is a concept that refers
to wrapping of code and data together
into a single unit so basically every
code we have in the java will have data
members and data manipulating methods so
encapsulation is a basic concept that
brings them together and binds them as a
single unit
so followed by oops concepts the next
important question that we will be
facing is about the binary search tree
so explain binary search tree
a binary search tree stores data in such
a way that it can be retrieved very
efficiently
next the left sub tree contains nodes
both keys are less than that of the
node's key value
the right sub tree contains nodes those
keys are greater than or equal to the
node's key value
followed by that the next question we
have is the doubly linked list so what
exactly are doubly linked lists the
doubly linked lists are special type of
linked list in which traversal across
the data elements can be done in both
directions
this is made possible by having two
links in which one of the node will be
connected to the next upcoming node and
the other link is connected to the
previous node
so followed by the doubly linked list
the next important question we have is
the graph so what exactly is a graph a
graph is one type of data structure that
contains a set of ordered pairs
so these ordered pairs are also referred
as edges or arcs and arcs are used to
connect nodes where data can be stored
or retrieved so followed by this we have
our next question that is called as the
difference between
linear and non-linear data structures
so the first difference is the linear
data structure in which data elements
are adjacent to each other and the
non-linear data structure is a structure
in which each element can connect to two
adjacent data elements
followed by that the next difference is
examples of linear data structure are
the arrays linked list stacks and others
like queues and examples for non-linear
data structures are trees and graphs
followed by that the next question is of
what is a dq so dq is a double ended
queue and this is a structure in which
elements can be inserted or removed from
either end
followed by that we have our next
question which says the difference
between the stack and an array so stack
follows a lifo pattern it means that the
data axis follows a sequence in which
the last data to be stored is the first
element to be extracted
next we have the array arrays on the
other hand do not follow a particular
order and instead can be accessed by
referring the indexed element within the
array
followed by that the next question is
which sorting algorithm is the best
there are many types of sorting
algorithms like quicksort bubble sort
balloon sort radix sort merge sort etc
and no algorithm can be considered as
the best or the fastest because each is
designed for a specific type of data
structure where it performs the best
and our 19th question is how does
variable declaration affect memory
so the amount of memory can be allocated
or reserved depends on the data type
being stored in that variable
for example if a variable is declared to
be integer type then 32 bits of memory
storage will be reserved for that
variable so the 20th question is what
are dynamic data structures so dynamic
data structures are the data structures
that expand and contract as the program
runs
it provides a flexible means of
manipulating data because it can adjust
according to the size of the data
so these were the conceptual based
questions so far we discussed now
next we will move ahead into the
programming interview questions
so at first we have
how do you reverse a string in java so
you can see on my screen we have a code
segment that is capable of reversing a
string so basically you declare a string
then take the length of that string loop
through the characters of the string and
add these characters in the reverse
order then print the resultant string
next we have how do you determine if a
string is a palindrome or not
so for that particular question we have
a code segment which is capable to
reverse the string and check if it is a
palindrome or not and accordingly
provide the result so a string is a
palindrome when it stays the same on the
reversing order of characters in that
string it is achieved by reversing the
original string first and then checking
if the reverse string is equal to the
original string or not
followed by that we have the 23rd
question that says find the number of
occurrences of a string character in a
string so the following code segment is
capable to find that particular task and
to find the number of occurrences of
loop through the string and search for
that character in every iteration
whenever it is found then the count will
be updated
followed by that the 24th question is
find if the given two strings are
anagrams or not
two strings are considered as anagrams
if they contain similar group of
characters in varied sequence
so for finding out if two strings are
anagrams or not we have the code segment
on the right part of my screen right now
so basically you declare a boolean value
that tells the end of the two strings
are anagrams or not then first check the
length of the both strings if they are
same or not then
if they are not same then they are not
anagrams if they are same then they are
anagrams like they might be a chance of
being the two strings as anagrams and
followed by the next step is convert
both the strings to character arrays
then sort them out and finally check the
sorted arrays if they are equal or not
if they are equal then print their
anagrams and if they are not equal then
you should print not anagrams the next
25th question is how do you calculate
the number of wobbles and consonants in
a string so you can see on my screen i
have a code segment which will be
capable of counting bubbles and
consonants in a string so look through
the string so that's the first step
followed by that increase the vocal
variable by 1 whenever the character can
be found as a vowel using the if
condition otherwise increment the
consonant variable finally print the
values of both the vowels and consonants
count
the next important question we will be
facing in the coding interview is how do
you get matching elements in an integer
array so for that we have a code segment
on my screen right away now the steps
for that are declare an array nest a
couple of loops and compare the numbers
with the other numbers in the array and
finally print the matching elements
whenever found so next we have this 27th
question that says code bubbles out
algorithm you don't have to code the
entire bubble sort algorithm what you
can do is just write the code segment
which has a logic for it so that is
currently on my screen right now so what
you basically do is declare an array so
next what you do is nest a couple of
loops and compare the numbers in that
array and then the array will be sorted
in the ascending order by replacing the
elements if found in any other order
28th question is code the insertion sort
algorithm so this is completely similar
approach what we followed for the bubble
sort you just have to write the code
segment of logic so the steps will be
first the element in the array is
assumed to be sorted take the second
element and then store it separately in
key now the first two elements are like
sorted take the third element and then
compare it with the elements in the left
of it
the process goes on until the array is
sorted
so next we have the 29th question how do
you reverse an array so you can see on
my screen we have a code segment that
says how to reverse an array loop till
the half length of the array next we
have to replace the numbers
corresponding to the indexes from the
starting to the end
followed by that we have the 30th
question where we have to find a way to
swap two numbers without the third
variable so this type of interview
question will be asked most number of
times to the beginners most frequently
now the solution for that has been
written on my screen right away you can
check out that and the steps to be
followed are declare two variables and
initialize them with the values make b
the sum of both the numbers then
subtract the sum that is the b
from a so a is now swapped lastly
subtract a from the sum b
so b is now also swapped
next we have the 31st question which
says print a fibonacci series using
recursion so for that we have a code
segment which can print a fibonacci
series on my screen right now so the
code on my screen can be used to print
the fibonacci series so basically what
are fibonacci numbers so the fibonacci
numbers are the numbers in the following
integer sequence 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 and
so on they can be calculated using the
mathematical formula used in the
fibonacci recursive function
the next question you'll be facing is
how do you find the factorial of an
integer
so we have the code segment on my screen
which can perform the factorial of an
integer operation so the factorial is a
function that multiplies a number by
every number below it for example
factorial of 5 is 5 into 4 into 3 into 2
into 1 which is equal to 120. so
recursive function multiplies the number
until it reaches 1. the next one is how
do you reverse a linked list so for that
we have the code segment on my screen
right away you can please check it out
and try it so if you can find out if it
can reverse a linked list or not so the
steps to be done for that are declare a
linked list first then add elements to
that linked list apply the descending
iterator method to the linked list and
then they should reverse the order of
the elements in the linked list
the 34th question is how do you
implement the binary search
so for that we have the code segment
right on my screen you can check that
out and the steps to be followed are
mentioned in the code segment so the
binary search divides the array into
half in every iteration step until it
finds the element
it works on sorted array since it
compares the values of adjacent elements
and then calculates the middle number if
the value of low becomes greater than
high
at any point it means the element is not
present in the list so this is how the
binary search basically works followed
by that we have the 35th question which
says find the second largest number in
the array so you can see we have a code
segment on my screen to find it out so
the steps to be followed are loop
through the array if the value of i is
greater than the highest store the value
of i in the highest and store the value
of highest in the second highest
variable
so now let's move ahead to the 36th
question
how do you remove all occurrences of a
given character from the input string so
we have a simple small code segment on
my screen right away so that code
segment can be used to remove all the
occurrences of a given character from an
input string so what you can do is use
the built in string method that is
replace to replace a character with any
other character including symbols and
white spaces
so followed by that we have our 37th
question so that is showcase inheritance
with the help of a program so we have a
small course limit on my screen to
showcase the one of the major object
oriented programming method that is
inheritance
so the class cat inherits the property
color from class animal by extending the
parent class animal this way a class cat
can have more parent classes if it
wishes to inherit their properties as
well
so next question that is the 38th
question is explain overloading and
overriding with the help of a program
so this is a major question which is
asked many number of times most
frequently for the beginners and
sometimes even the experienced
candidates cannot escape this question
so first we'll discuss overloading when
a class has two or more methods with the
same name they are called as overloaded
methods so you can see a code segment on
the right side part of my screen right
away so this is an example for
overloading next we will discuss the
overriding
so next we will discuss the overriding
so when a super class method is also
implemented in the child class then it's
a clear case of overriding so on the
right side part of my screen you can see
a code segment where a child class is
extending the base class method which is
print name
now followed by that we have the 39th
question
that is check if the given number is
prime or not
so you can see a code segment on my
screen which determines if the given
number is a prime number or not
so the steps to be followed to find if a
given number is prime or not r use if
statements to check for each condition
separately if the number is 0 or 1 it
cannot be prime if the number is 2 it is
prime if the number is
and finally the third condition you need
to take care of is if the number is
indivisible by other numbers then it is
prime so basically prime numbers are
divisible by 1 or itself if any other
number is capable to divide the number
then it is not a prime number
now the last question in the list is how
do you sum all the elements in an array
so for that we have a code segment right
on my screen please check it and try to
run it and that's the best way to learn
so the steps to be followed are use the
loop to iterate through the array and
keep adding the elements in that array
and finally you'll get the sum of the
elements in the array and you can just
print this sum at the last so with that
as you prepare for your upcoming job
interview we hope these coding questions
have provided more insight into what
types of questions you are likely to be
asked
hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel
in terms of programming java is a very
vast subject
there are high chances that a beginner
couldn't always cover every topic for an
interview
but what if you can stay on the safer
side with the most frequently asked top
10 questions that could always back you
up
this video from simplylearn is about the
same
here we will discuss the top 10 tricky
and most frequently asked java interview
questions
so before we begin make sure that you
have subscribed to our youtube channel
and hit that bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started with the top 10 java interview
questions
so the top 10 question in our list for
today is what is multi-threading
so the answer for this question is
multi-threading is a procedure of
executing two or more threads
simultaneously to perform a certain
operation via utilizing the cpu
resources to the maximum
multiple threads do not need separate
memory allocation for each one of them
so by this way they also save time and
memory and run in parallel to each other
so followed by the 10 question let us
move on to the top ninth question
does java include pointers now this
question is most frequently asked
amongst many interviews for the
beginners
so basically java has java virtual
machine so in that instance we have some
advantages and we might not need point
is exactly there now let's look into the
answer
so java includes java virtual machine
which automatically takes care of memory
allocations so we do not find any use of
pointers in real-time programming in
java and also java has its own garbage
collector to free the unused memory as
well
moving on to the next question
what are jdk jvm and jre this is also
one of the commonly asked questions now
let us discuss the full forms of jdk jvm
and gre and also what are their
functionalities
so jdk stands for java development kit
so this is the package which you
download for your jvm and jre together
so when you download jdk from the
official oracle website you will be
getting the packages of jvm and jre
together and you need to download them
and later install them after installing
jdk you need to set the path for jvm and
jre together
more about that and how to install java
in your windows system and the link to
the video is added in the description
box below kindly check it now moving on
to the next one which is jbm so jvm
stands for java virtual machine so this
is the tool that is mainly responsible
to convert your program into bytecode so
basically when you run a java code the
compiler will not directly run your code
first it will convert the entire program
directly into the bytecode and that
particular bytecode is run by the
compiler this is the main reason why
java is being
platform independent
so moving on to the next one that is gre
jre stands for java runtime environment
so java runtime environment is the one
which is responsible to provide you all
the class libraries and resources for
the code execution
now moving on to the next question
what is the difference between
overloading and overriding so by now i
suppose most of you have been facing
this question in many interviews so the
fundamental difference between the
overloading and overriding is as follows
when you have two or more methods in the
same class with the same name but
different parameters parameters in the
sense the number of values you pass to
your function call for example let us
imagine that we have two functions by
the name add and the function that they
will be performing is addition so one
method will be having two variables for
example add in a into b so you are
sending two values to the function and
another function with the same name that
is add will have three values that is
add intex into y and set so here we have
different parameters but with the same
function call this type of scenario is
called as
overloading in java
now let us discuss about overriding in
java when the method signature has same
name and same number of parameters in
both super class and child class then it
is called as overriding
now let us imagine that we have the same
method that is add int a into b in both
super class and child class now super
class is something which has highest
priority let us imagine that we have to
call a method from child to class so
based on the priority of the function
call the jvm might call the method from
child class ignoring the super class
so this is where a method got overridden
by the priorities so this particular act
is called as function overriding or
method overriding in java now moving
forward we have our next question
what is package in java remember that
whenever you write a code in java you
need a package
so especially when you're working on a
high-end ide like eclipse you need to
define the package first
it is possible that for some minor
programs which you can run on command
prompt you don't need a package but it
is a good habit to use a package so here
the question is what exactly is a
package
a package in java is a namespace that
organizes a set of related classes and
interfaces
conceptually you can think of packages
as being a similar version of your
folders in your computer
now moving on to the next question
which is the base class of all the
exceptions in java or you can also
consider this question as which is the
library that is responsible for all the
exceptions in java
so the answer for this question is
the parent class or the base class for
all the exceptions in java as
java.lang library now the next question
if i import a package
will the jvm import all the sub packages
of the imported package
now let us imagine that you're working
on a package called x
and you needed something from a
different package let us imagine that
package is a
so that package has already imported few
more packages like pc and d so let us
imagine again you have a package that
you are currently working on that is x
and you needed something from a
different package that is a so a has
already imported package b packet c and
package t so if you now import package a
into package x then do you have the
possibilities that you also import
package b c d along with a
so the answer for this question is no
when you import a specific package then
the sub packages of this thing will not
be imported here in the scenario
if you wanted to include package a into
package x then you can do it but the
packages that a already included in
itself that is b c and d will not be
imported into x however the developer
can manually import the sub packages
when fines necessary so if the developer
needs the sub packages that is bc and d
he can manually import it into x
but they will not come automatically
when you import a into x
now moving ahead into our next question
does java has go to statement so goto is
something we can face in some
programming languages like c
now does java also support that
the answer for this question is
no java does not have goto statement but
it has something similar called labels
so labels are used to change the flow of
a program and gem to a specific
instruction and label is based on a
condition
now moving ahead into our next question
is it possible to have a class compiled
without main method
yes so the main method is always the
starting point for compiling for a
compiler or an interpreter but can you
compile a complete class without a main
method so this is one of the frequently
asked questions so in java it is
possible
you can execute a java program without a
main method by using static block static
block in java is a group of statements
that gets executed only once when the
class is loaded into the memory by java
class loader it is also known as static
initialization block
now the last question in our list
can a dead thread be restarted in java's
multi-threading so there are chances
that sometimes you need to kill a thread
so sometimes after you kill a thread you
feel that that thread might be important
for your program so is it kind of
possible to restart it again
the answer for this question is no
once a thread is terminated in java we
cannot restart it
hello and welcome to python interview
questions my name is richard kirchner
with the simply learn team that's
www.simplylearn.com get certified get
ahead certainly the questions we're
going to ask in here are very general
with a few specifics towards data
science since that's the main direction
that python's going in and you'd want to
expand your questions for your interview
depending on the domain that you're
using the python in specifically let's
dive in and get started with some python
interview questions number one what is
the difference between shallow copy and
deep copy and you can see with shallow
copy we have object one which has child
one child two child three and so on and
object two which has child one child two
child three a deep copy creates a
different object and populates it with
the child objects of the original object
therefore changes in the original object
is not reflected in the copy copy.deep
copy creates a deep copy shallow copy
creates a different object and populates
it with the references of the child
objects within the original object
therefore changes in the original object
is reflected in the copy copy.copy
creates a shallow copy and you can look
at this if we make a change to child one
it's only a pointer so if you make it in
object one and change to child one and
object one it will also make that change
in object two number two how is
multi-threading achieved in python oh
this is a good one with multi-processing
and multi-threading this question is
actually asking you do you know the
difference between multi-processing and
multi-threading and how multi-threading
works multi-threading usually implies
that multiple threads are executed
concurrently the python global
interpreter lock doesn't allow more than
one thread to hold the python
interpreter at that particular point of
time so multi-threading in python is
achieved through context switching it's
very different than multi-processing
which actually opens up multiple
processes across multiple threads so
multi-threading discuss the django
architecture so the django architecture
and the first thing to know is that the
django is a web service way to build
your web pages basically and so we look
at the architecture you can see here we
have a nice model drawn out where the
user initiates the jangle which
initiates the url which indicates the
view what they're going to view and you
have your model and your template so the
model of data whatever data model you're
pulling goes into the template and then
goes back up the pipeline to the user
and the important thing to note is
there's a template the front end of the
web page this is what they're going to
see there's a model the back end where
the data is stored so you can keep the
template and the looks and everything
looks the same but you can swap out the
underlying information that goes into
that template then you have your view
which interacts with the model and
template and maps it to the url and then
the django serves the page to the user
so your django grabs it and says okay
thank you for the url and here you go
user what advantage does numpy array
have over a nested list
so numpy's a module you import almost
always see numpy import numpy as np
numpy is written in c such that all his
complexities are backed into a simple to
use module lists on the other hand are
dynamically typed therefore python must
check the data type of each element
every time it uses it this make number
arrays much faster than lists i would
also add in that numpy has a lot of
additional functionality that you don't
have in lists there's a lot of things
you can automate in the numpy quick flip
over to our jupiter notebook any ide
will work if you're going to do a set of
interview questions taking a quick look
at code is always important we have our
import numpy as np we'll go ahead and
import time here's our list list sub for
iron range of 100 and what we're doing
is we're going to time it so we're going
to create a list then we're going to
create a numpy zeros array and you can
see here look how quick you can create
this numpy zeros array here we are
appending one zero at a time for a
regular python list and here we are with
numpy they're all zeros and they're all
of type integer i believe it's either
float or integer on this i'd have to
actually do a type on it and then so if
we take in and we create a tl1 time
equals time and then we do for i in
range of 100 for j and range of 100 l of
i j equals l of i j plus 5. so we're
just doing a simple calculation on our
array and subarrays this is an array of
rays and we'll do the same thing with
tl2 tl2 time dot time tl1 equal so here
we have our final time on that and then
we'll do this with an array array op and
this is what i really love a equals a
plus 10 and then you can just print it
right out so you can see right here with
the numpy array i'm doing the same thing
if i run this our time is significantly
different here we have 0.09 and 0.003 uh
so you can see that the time drops
significantly when you're running this
on a numpy array versus a list array
also important to note these times
aren't going to be they'll change each
time i run it depending on what i have
running in the background so there we go
number five what is pickling and
unpickling amazes me how many times i
pickle and unpickle something converting
a python object hierarchy to a bite
stream is called pickling pickling is
also referred to as serialization
unpickling converting a byte stream to a
python object hierarchy is also called
unpickling unpickling is also referred
to as
deserialization so if you just created a
neural network model you can now save
that model to your hard drive pickle it
and then you can unpickle it to bring it
back into another software program or to
use at a later time how is memory
managed in python number six python has
a private heap space where it stores all
the objects the python memory manager
manages various aspects of this heap
like sharing caching segmentation and
allocation the user has no control over
the heap only the python interpreter has
the access you have a nice little
diagram here here's your program there's
your interpreter we have our heap memory
management on the garbage collector
going off of there number seven are
arguments in python pass by value or by
reference arguments are passed in python
by reference this means that any change
made within a function is reflected on
the original object so you can see here
def function of l l of 0 equals 3 l
equals 1 2 3 4 function l print l and
you're going to get three two three four
because we passed l in there so it's a
pointer here we have def function l l
equals three two three four l equals one
two three four function of l print l
because in this function i have assigned
instead of operating on a piece of l the
list i've consigned a whole new value to
that list or l it then at that point
will create a new object so if i make
changes to the object it's going to
change it in the outside the definition
if i use a variable and i cited a
completely new value like l equals 3 2 3
4 that will not show up when you're
outside the function number eight how
would you generate random numbers in
python to generate random numbers in
python you must first import the random
module the random function generates a
random float value between 0 and 1. the
random range function generates a random
number within a given range and you can
see here one is the lower end tens the
upper end and step two so it would be
one three five and so on as far as the
options in the random generation number
nine what does the double forward slash
operator do in python the forward slash
operator performs division and returns
the quotient in float for example 5 over
2 returns 2.5 to do a double forward
slash operator on the other hand returns
the quotient an integer for example 5
double slash returns 2. 5 divided by 2
and you drop the 0.5 number 10 what does
the is operator do the is operator
compares the id of the two objects and
you can see in here where list one
equals brackets round one two three list
one equals list two equals true and you
have the double equals in python of
course and you can do list one is list
two where list two equals one two three
is false list two is not the brackets
one two three it equals it but it's not
the brackets and if we do list three
equals list one then list one is list
three equals true number 11 what is the
purpose of pass statement the pass
statement is used when there's a
syntactic but not an operational
requirement for example the program
below prints a string ignoring the
spaces and so here we have variable
equals simply learn we've added two
spaces in it for i and variable so it
goes through each eye if i equals space
do nothing else print i and then we'll
have the end equals bracket bracket and
they'll print out simply learn now of
course you would probably write this if
i does not equal blank space print but
this would be another way you could do
that if you need a placeholder for that
first logical set or that first area you
can also do a function like this you
could do function
whatever your def function name brackets
colon pass so it goes into the function
and does nothing but it's a placeholder
number 12 how will you check all the
characters in a string are alphanumeric
python has an inbuilt method is all
number which returns true if all
characters in the string are
alphanumeric and so you can see here a b
c d one two three is all number output
equals true and the second line a b c d
the at symbol one two three the pound
symbol is all nume output equals false
so really just want to know about is all
new all numerical alphanumerical number
12 how will you check if all characters
in a string are alphanumeric so here we
go
if you know is all number which returns
that the characters in the string are
alphanumeric one can also use regex
instead and so we have boolean re match
what's important about this is to note
your capital a dash to capital z a lower
codes to dash to z 0 to 9 means that
that array includes all of those the way
they have it written out plus a dollar
sign and then we have what we're
comparing it to the string we're
comparing to the abcd123
and so we can do an re.match and if it
matches if all these things if all the
different entities in that array matches
the first one we get an output true and
if not an output false number 13 how
will you merge elements in a sequence
sequence there are three types of
sequences in python there's lists tuples
and strings python across makes this
easy if we have a list one and list two
and list one is square brackets one
comma two comma three list two is four
five and six we can simply do list one
plus list two and our output is one two
three four five six if we have tuples
your tuple is the curved brackets
designates it and again just add them
together same thing with strings we have
simply learn s1 plus s2 equals simply
learn number 14 how will you remove all
leading white space in a string python
provides the inbuilt function l strip to
remove all leading access from a string
and you can see here spacebase base
python.l strip leading strip python and
you can also do strip which release
leading and ending of course there's
also the ending set number 15 how will
you replace all occurrences of a stub
string with a new string the replace
function can be used with strings for
replacing a substring with a given
string syntax string dot replace old
comma new come account replace returns a
new string without modifying the
original string hey john how are you
john question mark replace john with
capital j-o-h-n one and then you can see
right here hey john how are you and
since we designated with the one just
says we're only going to replace one of
these 16 what is the difference between
dell and remove brackets on lists dell
for delete dell removes all elements of
a list within a given range syntax dell
list start to end remove remove brackets
removes the first occurrence of a
particular character syntax list remove
element and we see a nice example over
here if we delete the list one to three
it will delete the first in this case b
one two it doesn't do three remember
that one two so we'll delete b and c and
you end up with a d where if we do
remove b from the list and we have an
abbd it's only gonna remove the first b
number 17 how to display the contents of
text file in reverse order open the file
using the open function store the
contents of the file into a list reverse
the contents of the list run a for loop
to iterate through the list number 18
differential between append and extend
append adds an element to the end of the
list you can see right here we have a
list one two three four and we append
four we end up with an output one two
three four and extend adds an element
from an interval to the end of the list
and we have here list equals one two
three list dot extend four five six
output is one two three four five six so
if you wanna append an array to the end
of another array you wanna use the
extend number nineteen what's the output
of the below code justify your answer
this is a great interview question
because these are the kind of things
that come up when you're proofing code
def add to list value and list so we
have value in and a list dent or list
equals an empty in this case an empty
list list data pin value return list
list one equals add to list one list two
equals add to list one two three empty
bracket list three equals add to list a
and then we want to print them list one
equals and you can see the formatting we
have our placeholder list one list two
and list three so when it prints list
one we get one comma a and what you want
to notice here is that list one and list
three are equal why are they equal well
when we passed the information to the
add to list we passed value without
passing the list equals brackets without
passing a second value what this means
is that list as we have it if you don't
have a list it'll start off with empty
list which we append the one to the
second one list two we appended a value
to an empty list so it's only going to
be one two three doesn't matter what the
list was before we've already assigned
an empty list and then list three here's
the tricky one we're adding a to the
list but because we didn't designate the
list list is a shared value in other
words it doesn't reset it and we end up
with list one equals list three one
comma a default this is created only
once during the function and not during
its call number 20 what is the
difference between a list and a tuple
lists are mutable while tuples are
immutable and you can see an example
down here where i have list equals one
two three square brackets denote it's a
list list of two equals four and i print
it out i now have one two four if i do
the same thing with the tuple i get an
error because you can't change the tuple
one two three into one two four you have
to completely reassign tuple to a new
value what is docs string in python docs
strings are used in providing
documentation to various python modules
classes functions and methods and so you
can see here we have def for a function
add a b and this is a doc string we have
the
triple brackets on there you can add
carriage return in that so that you can
go multiple lines and it says this
function adds two numbers and then sum a
b return sum and so we have down here
two different ways of accessing this
function output accessing docs string
method one this function adds two
numbers accessing docs string method two
help unfunction add in model main this
function adds two numbers and so you can
see the code down here has two very
different
in values the second one is basically a
help menu there's our help menu number
22 how to use print without the new line
the solution to this depends on the
python version you are using in python
version 2 you can do print hi and then
you add a comma afterwards print how are
you and you have hi how are you in
version three print hi comma end equals
and it'll add a space on the end there
you can put different characters in
there but you just want to put a space
to put a space on the end print how are
you and now we get hi how are you number
23 how do you use the split function in
python the split function splits a
string into a number of strings based on
a specific delimiter so we have string
split delimiter comma max the maximum
number of splits the character based on
which the string is to split by default
is space so here we have an example we
have a variable red blue green orange
and we want to split it by commas and we
only want to do the first two so if we
print the list now you'll find it has
red blue and only spread it split it the
first two times and it gets to the third
one and just groups them all together
green and orange if you leave the two
off you'll split the whole thing number
24 is python object oriented or
functional programming python follows
object oriented paradigm and you should
really know in depth what they mean by
object oriented paradigm if you're doing
any interview for scripting languages
python allows the creation of objects
and is manipulation through specific
methods it supports most of the features
of oops which has inheritance on a
polymorphism so you have an object and
you can inherit all the traits of that
object and then add new traits in or
alter some of those traits that's what
object oriented means python follows
functional programming paradigm
functions may be used as first class
object python supports lambda functions
which are characteristic of functional
paradigm so you can set a variable to a
function as opposed to setting it to an
object number 25 write a function
prototype that takes variable number of
arguments here we have def function name
list so we could have in this case
whatever the list is def function the
asterisk denotes so we're going to take
multiple arguments of a variable and we
can do for i and var print i so if you
send function of one you'll end up with
a one function one two five six they'll
actually print those out one at a time
the first one just prints out a one
because it only sent one variable the
second one will print one another line
25 and the line six number 26 what is
asterisks args and asterisks quarks
args used in function prototype to
accept varying number of arguments it's
an interval object def function arcs and
you can imagine it's just a basic list
so if i send add the numbers a comma b
or a comma b comma c it doesn't really
matter it'll have that number of objects
in it whatever i send to it and there's
other uses for it but that's very basic
korg's i can actually tell it what i
want to send so used in a function
prototype and to accept varying number
of keyword arguments it's in both are
interval objects so you can go through
them one at a time and the def function
chords you can now set like color equals
red units equal to so you'll see that
especially in machine learning there's a
lot of like they'll have inline equals
true that kind of thing number 27 in
python functions are first class objects
what do you understand from this
this means i could return a function
could be one from another function i
could create a function and treat it
just like an object i can assign it to a
variable i can pass them as arguments to
other functions number 28 what is the
output of print name underscore
underscore name and justify your answer
the double underscore name double
underscore is a special variable that
holds the name of the current module
program execution starts from main or a
code with zero indentation thus double
underscore name dumbbell underscore name
has a value double underscore main
double underscore in the above case if
the file is imported from another module
then double underscore name underscore
double underscore holds the name of this
module number 29 what is a numpy array
and we briefly touched numpy array
compared to a list early in processing
speed now let's go ahead and look at
some of the more specifics a numpy array
is a grid of values all of the same type
so if they're either all float all
integer all string and is indexed by a
tuple of non-negative integers the
number of dimensions is the rank of the
array and the shape of an array is a
tuple of integers giving the size of the
ray along each dimension number 30 what
is the difference between matrices and
arrays a matrix comes from linear
algebra and is a two-dimensional
representation of data it comes with a
powerful set of mathematical operations
that allow you to manipulate the data in
interesting ways now arrays an array is
a sequence of objects of similar data
type an array within another array forms
a matrix like we said here
two-dimensional so if you have an array
of three by four that would be a matrix
number 31 how to get indexes of n
maximum values in a numpy array of
course the first thing to do is to
import your numpy as np you don't
necessarily have to use mp but that is
the most standard use of numpy we create
our array equals an np.array of one two
three four five and then if we want to
get our indexes of n at maximum values
in a numpy array we can do one way to do
it is to take our array sort it then do
minus in colon that means we're going to
do once you've sorted it you can do
minus in n would equal then the number
of indices so it's not the actual letter
n colon and really this is about
understanding this notation that we can
sort it so it goes from lowest to
biggest and then we can get the top
values for n indexes and then we have
our final set of brackets with the minus
one on there number 32 how would you
obtain the resulting set from the train
set and the test set from below and
let's go ahead and look at the two
different variables we have train set
equals an array of one two three test
set equals a numpy of ray of arrays we
have zero one two one two three what's
important here is that one it's a numpy
so that leaves a out and then we're
stuck with three other options and i'm
going to say the d is out none of these
and let's look at
np.concatenate
versus
np.v stack concatenate would put one set
after the other so you would end up with
probably give you an error because one
set is one two three and then we're
going to concatenate array zero one two
and one array one two three the array of
arrays onto the end of that what we
really want to do is stack and by the
way you can actually switch there's
variables you can put into concatenate
obviously they can change this so you
could use the concatenate with a lot of
fudging around but really we're looking
for is v stack v stands for vertical
versus the h stack which is horizontal
and if we do a v stack we can simply do
train set comma test set and stack them
together and so we have c resulting set
equals np.v stack train stack test set
both option a and b would do horizontal
stacking but we would like to have the
vertical stacking option she does this
again you could add the axes in and use
the concatenate to stack it the correct
way number 33 how would you import a
decision tree classifier in sk learn we
have sklearn dot decision tree import
decision tree classifier from sklearn
ensemble import decision tree classifier
and we look at these they're all import
decision tree classifier that actually
last part happens to be correct and it's
really just a vocabulary knowing where
is the decision tree classifier stored
what module is that a part of and it is
of course part of the sklearn.tree
number c number 34. you have uploaded
the data set in csv format on google
spreadsheet and shared it publicly how
can you access this in python what's
important here is to know that we can
read stuff with pandas so we don't show
it here but you can there's actually a
number of ways to do this what's
important here is to know a couple
things one we have our link generated
from the google docs and spreadsheets
and then we can do a string io dot
string io request get link.content so
there's our source and then finally we
know that pandas can read a csv there's
obviously many ways to read a csv but
data equals pd.read underscore csv
source number 35 what is the difference
between the two data series given below
below we have df name and df location
colon comma brackets around asterisks
around name comma where and then we have
df equals pd data frame aabb xx uu comma
21 16 50 33 columns equal name and age
so let's take a look and see what
they're looking at we have just glancing
at the questions they want to know is it
the original data frame or is it the
copy of the data frame and you can see
here that one is view of the original
data frame and two is a copy of the
original data frame two is a view of the
original data frame and one is a copy of
the original data frame both are copies
both are views and if you're working
with pandas you know that unless you
specifically in certain things tell it
to do it in line and a lot of functions
don't allow you that you're always
taking a slice and it is always a copy
so c both are copies of the original
data frame number 36 you get the
following error while trying to read a
file temp dot csv using pandas which of
the following could correct it so here's
our error trace back most recent call
last file input line 1 and module
unicode in code error ascii codecs can't
encode character oh i hate it when that
one comes up and we have four different
entries we'll go ahead and just pretend
that d doesn't exist unless we really
can't fit it into one of the other
answers and the first one is pd read csv
has our file compression equals gzip
well g zip is just an unzipping and you
actually get a zip error on there the
second one is dialect equals string
again not an encoding or coding setup
and then we have encoding equals utf-8
well that would be the encoding error
switching it from the character code
there's utf-8 there is unicode that's
the most common tool that goes between
so really this is about understanding
the difference between a utf-8 coding
and a unicode and the error that comes
up quite regularly with that number c
encoding should be utf-8 number 37 how
to set a line width in a plot given
below so looking at this we have import
map plot library pi plot is plt and you
should know your way around this how to
do a plot in there
plt.plot1234 plot equals show so this is
a little bit of a vocabulary test the
vocabulary is it width equals three line
width equals three lw equals three or
something else and the vocabulary word
that we're looking for is lw equals
three which stands for line width in pi
plot library pi plot number 38 how would
you reset the index of a data frame to a
given list so this is a vocabulary
challenge and understanding what
re-indexing is re-indexing as we have
the different values here we have the
first one which is reset the index well
we're not really resetting the index
reindex number b means we are double
checking our indexes to the column and
to the main index and so the values
match correctly where re-index like now
brings in a new index outside of our
data frame to a given list so this is
coming from external and thus the
vocabulary word like is our keyword that
is external and we have a data friend to
a given list number 39 how can you copy
objects in python the functions used to
copy objects in python we have copy copy
for shallow copying and copy deep
copying for deep copy number 40 what is
the difference between range and x range
functions in python well this is a good
one we have matrixes and arrays with a
matrix the range returns a python list
object x range returns an x range object
and with arrays an x-ray returns an
x-range object x-range creates values as
you need them through yielding the key
here is that x-range returns the values
as you need them so it actually
processes it post like if you have for x
or for a variable in x range it is
processing them as you need them zero to
nine it doesn't create an array zero to
nine it just hands you zero then one two
three four one at a time number forty
one how can you check whether a pandas
data frame is empty or not the tribute
df.empty is used to check whether a
panda's data frame is empty or not and
so you can simply create a we have down
here import our pandas as pd we create
our pen as data frame equal to an empty
array and is df dot empty comes out as
true one of the catches you got to
remember with these vocabularies is with
empty along with some other pandas set
up whether you need the brackets or not
at the end number 42 write the code to
sort an array in numpy by the n minus
one column this can be achieved using
arg sort function let's take an array x
then to sort the n minus one column the
code will be x to
x to colon n minus two dot args sort so
let's see what that code looks like we
import numpy as np we'll create our
array um our numpy array which is uh one
two three zero five two two three four
so we have three different entities with
three different columns in there and we
go x of x and so we take x of
all the rows first entity well in this
case it's actually the second one
because it's 0 1 2 dot arg sort so that
would be the second entity or minus two
would also be the same you could also do
instead of one you could also do minus
two there instead of the one arg sort
and then we get an output of the array
one two three zero five two two three
four number 43 how to create a series
from a list numpy array and dictionary
so we'll go ahead and input import our
numpy our pandas and have my list and
you can see here we have my list equals
list of abcdefg all the way through so
my list now makes a list of that
for
array we have np.a range to 26 my
dictionary will create a dictionary with
a zip my list my arguments so i'll just
use the numpy array we just created with
my array to go into the dictionary and
the solution is simple with the
pd.series my list pd.series my array
pd.series my dictionary so it's all
about knowing the dot capital
s-e-r-i-e-s don't forget that
capitalization number 44 how to get the
items not common to both series a and
series b and you can see here we have
instead of series a and b we have series
one and two and we have one two three
four five four five six seven eight the
solution
is we take a panda series we have a
series u equals a panda series np union
one dimension series one series two so
we can now make a union of them we now
have series one panda series with an
intersection and then we can remove one
from the other series u is series u dot
is in series one so if the union is not
in the intersection then you know it's a
unique value a little bit of logic going
on there playing with three different
terms to get the answer we want 45 how
to keep only the top two most frequent
values as it is and replace everything
else as other in a series so again we're
working with pandas because we're
talking series and data frames that
means we're working with pandas so we're
going to import pandas as pd we'll go
ahead and create our panda series we're
going to do that by creating a numpy
random random state 100 so 100 in the
numpy one and then we have our panda
series you can see here we're random
integer numpy random random integer of
one comma five by 12. and so the
solution for this is we go ahead and
we've created a pd dot remember the
capital s series solution we're going to
print the top two frequencies and that
is our series dot value counts and then
we take series values count dot index of
up to two so we're going to take
everything up to two and then we'll do
the series is in so if it's not in the
first two then it's going to equal other
and this would be something you'd want
to write down on paper if you're if it
looks confusing take a moment pause the
video
write this down and see if you can
figure out how the logic came together
and try to throw yourself a couple other
little logic puzzles like this number 46
how to find the positions of numbers
that are multiples of three from a
series and in here we're actually going
to use a numpy to solve it the first
part series lets you know it's going to
be a panda series and if we come down
here we have
np.org where this is a vocabulary
question series with remember the
percentile three is a remainder so if
the remainder equals zero then we're
going to generate that string where the
object divided by three equals zero has
no remainder so then we know it's a
multiple of three number 47 how to
compute the euclidean distance between
two series and this one's really cool
because we have our panda series p and q
and what i like about this one is they
give us two solutions you can go with
and really you should kind of know both
the first one would be yes you know what
the euclidean distance is and that is we
can take the first series minus the
second series squared and then sum them
up and then we do the square root which
is the same as taking the power to 0.5
doing the power to 0.5 is
easier than doing the square root so a
lot of times you'll see that as a switch
but you could have also done the square
root and used the math in there so
there's solution one you should know
your euclidean distance and then
solution two is the numpy solution so we
have np dot lin-alg dot norm that's how
we're going to compute our euclidean
distance
p minus q very elegant and very
straightforward and easy to compute
number 48 how to reverse the rows of
data frame so here we have our data
frame we're going to create a numpy
array by 25 reshape it five minus one
and this creates a 25 by 25 data frame
and so our solution is to do the dfi
location and this is just understanding
how steps work the steps you have your
colon colon minus one so we're taking
all the rows all the columns minus one
so we're stepping minus one going the
reverse direction and then we're just
going to use across all the different
columns on there let me say that again
the first colon is going to be your row
starting row stopping row step minus one
that's all this is about is that step
minus one comma and then all the columns
49
if you split your data into train test
splits is it possible to over fit your
model and the answer is yes it's
definitely possible one common beginner
mistake is retuning a model or training
new models with different parameters
after seeing his performance on the test
set my favorite example of this is you
have your script put together and you
keep hitting the rerun button until you
get the answer you want not taking the
answer it first gave you or running it
over an array and recording all the
answers to see how they vary number 50
which python library is built on top of
matplot library and pandas to ease data
plotting the answer this is seaborn
seaborn is a data visualization library
in python that provides a high level
interface for drawing statistical
information and formative graphs
