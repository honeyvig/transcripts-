yeah hi Vanessa this is Dr srikanth from
Team MDS conquer uh now in this
particular session I'll be discussing
about the important aspects that you
have to do before you start your
preparation for neet 2025.
and I'll be discussing the important
aspects that every dentist has to know
before they are planning to move to the
next level in dentistry
and I am Dr srikanth the founder of MDS
conquer and you are going to be the 10th
batch of MDS conquer and as of now we
have addressed more than 12 000 students
throughout the globe in achieving their
goals in dentistry
so like most of us have started uh the
path in the Dentistry preferably
five years back right four or five years
back okay and we have done our best uh
in the process of this four or five
years
in achieving the first milestone
so I know that most of you have cleared
your
final year and entering into
internship
now okay so I feel like this is the
first Milestone or landmark in your life
in the field of Dentistry
the next important aspect is deciding
what to be done next
you should be very clear like what you
are planning to do next okay what what
you are planning to do in the industry
next so that's the most important thing
that I feel like I need to address in
this particular session
so as most of us okay we always have
this phobia like what to be done next
like at one point now we are moving from
one level to the next level finishing
your final year and of course internship
will be done in a couple of months so
now you are planning to move from one
level to the next level
so I see like students calling me now
and discussing me once they finally was
out or once they're into internship I
regularly see students calling me okay
sir I'm not a great student in at a
usual level
I just relax with my ug I was not up to
Market using okay so what what is My
Strong suggestion for these people
people with this mindset is your past
doesn't have any effect on your future
okay your past doesn't have any effect
on your future but whatever you're going
to do now
whatever you're going to do now
and then now whatever the present is
going to affect your future so this is
very very very very important for every
individual like okay so don't think
about past past is done you cannot
change the past but you can change your
future by acting in present so that is
the golden suggestion that I can give
you before you start towards any goal
after finishing your final year after
finishing your internship if you are
planning anything in dentistry the first
and foremost thing is leave about what
you have done in the past just try to
focus on the present let's work on the
present and plan something beautiful for
your future so this is the golden
suggestion I can give to each and every
one of you
next one I see like people uh before uh
they start their preparation
and I feel like even what are the what
are the things that you have to do uh
what are the options that you have to
you have after BDS the first and
foremost important aspect is what is
Dentistry is Dentistry good or not okay
so I see people like calling me after
finishing their final people will call
me and ask me sir is it in District wood
no you're already dentist you're already
in the industry you're already dentist
you have you're you're I mean like
minimum the people who are watching this
minimum you are four years in dentistry
okay
finishing your final year and entering
into internship or done with the
internship okay so now the question is
not Dentistry is good or bad okay now
the question is what to be done to be a
good dentist
you are in a country
where which is having the highest
population in the world so whenever you
have highest population you have highest
disorders also you are you will have
highest disabilities you'll have highest
diseases okay and of course teeth teeth
will have diseases right so like the
proportion to the population you will
have the disorders and disabilities and
who has to treat these disorders and
disabilities of the oral cavity or the
peripheral structures he's a dentist
is a dentist okay so now when you are in
growing country where where there is
lots of scope okay so Dentistry is
always having a beautiful scope but the
right way is important how to go to the
right way how to be a good dentist is my
question like Dentistry is doing good
dentist is awesome I'm seeing so many of
my students and so many of my friends
are really doing good extraordinate not
all that's what I want to tell you not
all okay but so many of them are doing
really good they're doing a good
practice they're good they're doing good
in dentistry
it's the next one I hope like most of
you are familiar with good doctor web
sales right okay so is Dentistry
saturated this is the biggest question
right I see like people talking like
Dentistry saturated sir there is no
scope for Dentistry so these are the
negative uh words I regularly hear from
most of the aspirants okay and I see
like I'm talking like few of my pgs are
telling this few of my senior lecturers
are telling this three of my staff are
telling this these are the very common
things I regularly hear okay yes yes my
answer is as Dentistry saturated but not
a good Dentistry okay we always require
good dentist like when I want to get my
root camera treatment done okay I'm an
endodontist I cannot do root canal
therapy for myself so when I want to get
my root canal treatment done I always
find a good dentist I don't find it and
I don't want a dentist I want a good
dentist I don't want an endodontist I
want a good ended artist
so if you can be a good dentist or a
good endodontist or a good periodontist
or a good prosthodontist in your journey
in your circuit
that is more than sufficient for a
population like
in India you see
the beautiful couple who are having
highest Instagram followers are giving
an ad for a brand in dentistry
okay and I can see most of my colleagues
I can see I stay in the city of
Hyderabad okay in Telangana I stay in
city of Hyderabad and I can see there
are more than n number of dentists who
are making huge amount from Dentistry
okay from Dentistry
so why what I feel is what I strongly
feel is okay people are doing good in
dentistry okay but here
who are doing good it's not all dentists
good dentists okay
so now now our goal is or my goal is or
your goal is properly I'm in I'm an
intern like a decade back
2012 2012 2013 I'm an intern now you are
Intense or maybe you are done with the
internship so I'm an intern uh
10 years more than 10 years back I was
an intern and if I just closed my eyes
and just imagine that I am an intern
like how I have started my journey
is is very beautiful like my primary
goal during my internship is very simple
that I want to enter into something
which is going to make me
more I mean like which is going to guide
me to be more perfection
my primary goal I'm not very sure what
is my primary goal but I'm not much
driven to make money or much driving to
do this or do that to make money but my
goal is I want to be perfect
I want to practice in a perfect way so
this is my goal probably 10 years back
and after observing thousands thousands
of students
and reaching so many colleges for
interactions done more than 150 to 160
interactions till the date
and addressing so many teachers
professors hodies Deans principals what
not okay so I strongly believe that we
require a good quality of Dentistry to
be a good dentist or to be a good
practitioner or to be a good academician
or to be a good teacher in the world of
Dentistry okay as of now I'm addressing
India or in the in the Dentistry of in
India
so now the core of every individual
is
to become perfect okay so to become
perfect
right a few days back I was seeing an
interview I don't remember exactly what
it is
but the interview the person who is
addressing the interview is clearly
telling that
at one point
in any field
okay at one point in any field you
should know little in everything
you should know little in everything
little little and everything like for
example Dentistry you have four years
you have somewhere around like 18 to 20
subjects okay now you're done with all
the subjects you're done with all
subjects as a dentist you should know
little in everything you should know
little in everything but once you know
little everything then you should know
in depth in something I hope it's very
very clear right once you know little
and everything little of anatomy little
of biochemistry little of physiology
little of all your second year subjects
little little of all your fine layer
eight subjects now you should be perfect
perfect ultra perfect in one thing that
is for example I'm an endodontist
oriented things in my Branch so this is
what the saying is I was really
impressed after hearing this this is
what the life is
you see uh Indians
okay the recent achievement by India
is Moon right okay so they they also
know little little in everything but
they know the depth or anything about
the rocket
okay similarly you want to become a good
dentist let's finish the little little
okay the high you are more than half a
way into the little little so you're
done okay now what you have to do you
have to do Masters in a particular thing
you have to master in a particular thing
okay okay for example there is a
periapical surgery in a city of
Hyderabad there is a periapical surgery
a typical periodical surgery has to be
done yes this fellow is a perfect
or a full mouth has to be done recently
today we are more worried we have a very
difficult case Okay in our Clinic okay
so difficult case where
the nerve okay in the third you know
impaction impact in maximum mandibular
third water impact impacted teeth okay
it was which was impacted and uh
pinching the inferior canal
so we we got an consultant who has 18
years of experience of 15 to 18 years at
experience exact number I don't know but
we are more worried
because any mishap is going to cause
some sort of complication and we are
successfully done
why we are successfully done is here in
this process we trust the experience we
are just finding who can do this best we
can do so we got some numbers we got
some names
and then after talking to a few more
individuals we got a perfect person
who has done it in minutes
so so there is a requirement
there is a requirement per for the
Perfection there is a requirement
for the experience or the commitment or
the passion that you have towards a
particular aspect in the Dentistry so
Dentistry is a multi aspect right so you
have so many procedures so many
protocols so many treatment plans in
dentistry so you should be perfect for
few of them then you can I mean I see I
see people like they want Perfection and
everything no no that's not going to be
possible
you if you are Perfection if you have
Perfection with everything then you are
not you are not the choice of mice you
are not the choice of many of the people
if you are perfect with few things your
100 is perfect with few things then you
have more opportunities in the market
so what I strongly believe is yes the
industry is saturated
you have more dental clinics you are
more dentists available in the market
okay but good Dentistry is never going
to get saturated in a country like India
which is always in the face of growing
Let It Be talk to the population yes it
is growing okay you talk with the
development yes it is growing you talk
with every aspects in India India is
always a country which is growing in all
the directions so here
dentist yes dentists are required good
dentists are required okay so what I can
tell you is people who move around you
tell all this nonsense and negativity
about Dentistry okay you can ask you can
ask them to shut their mouth because
they are not able to prove themselves
they're not able to do that is their
mistake if summer is not able to do that
is their mistake okay and if if you are
not able to do and you should not give a
review about about your profession okay
so even even for an intern or even for a
repeater even for a person who is
finding hope in their life or hope in
the Dentistry
you go and talk with the people who are
doing good why you are talking with the
people who are doing nonsense
while you're talking with the people who
are not happy with their profession But
continuing their profession I see Senior
lecturers I see few of the people in the
college outside the callers telling that
it's not good then why you are
if it is not good first you live asking
an intern or an asking a third year
giving a negative vibe to them asking
them to quit Dentistry asking them to
leave Dentistry I strongly recommend you
to First resign your job you refers to
close your clinic you stop doing
consultations don't give unnecessary
negative suggestions
to the Ang dentists because your your
job may be done in the next couple of
years who has to carry the pride of
dentistry in India who has to carry the
treatment protocols in our Zone it is
the young dentist it is the people who
are doing or in the process of BDS they
have to come out
they have to come out few days within
few days or within few years and they
are going to occupy you our space in the
future and they have to carry the pride
of the dentist in the next couple of
years so you should never disgrace an
angster
if you want you can get out okay I don't
mind we don't mind you can get out okay
but uh interns and people who want to
find some scope in dentistry talk with
the people who are doing good so they
are going to give you a bright and
beautiful suggestions that can make
yourself better and our profession
better because why we are not able to
reach the standards that other countries
are not able to reach for example you
take USA okay the second uh I mean
Dentistry if you if you stand out the uh
I mean professional qualification or if
you stand out the financial status by
the profession Dentistry stands second
second or third in most of the countries
because of the high level of
standardization high level of the
protocols what they do why we are not
able to do it is our mistake okay it is
basically our mistake we are not able to
address it but I feel like I can see the
few of them are doing and reaching the
high standards of
the European side of Dentistry or an
American style of Dentistry or let it be
you see people praising Australia people
praising UK people praising the European
zones people praising the USA Canada
Jones yes there are few people in India
who are doing the same sort or who are
having more skills than the people over
there okay so I don't want to blame
anyone I want to tell it is our mistake
that we are not able to carry to the
next level okay so what what we have to
do what the future of Dentistry the
people who are watching this video the
indent is what you have to do is you
have to do something to carry the
dentistry in India to the next level
okay right so that is what my uh basic
motto like before we start we go deep
into this particular session we should
be very very clear like what to want
what you want to be and what is the
scope of dentistry in India or what is
the scope of Dentistry outside India
there may be few people planning to move
uh to other other countries or other
places okay for XYZ regions okay but
this is this is what the scope the scope
is what you you create is a scope what
what all the dentists as of now creating
is the scope
and what is my personal opinion after
2019
I felt very bad when it was when the
covert was struck keeping the dentist in
mind because we are more affected by the
aerosols and more affected by the kobit
19 but what happened is most of our
dentists in 2019 2020 because they don't
have a great Opie in their clinics and
what they have done is they have started
content creation
and the impact of this content creating
on social media was extraordinary okay
if you check out like from
2019 to 2021 a postcode after the first
wave and second wave I strongly believe
uh keeping my clinic into consideration
or by observing my friends or my
colleague's clinic into consideration
what I strongly believe is there was an
improvement in the op
there was more than 20 to 30 percent as
an improvement in the op and conversion
of the patient to get their treatments
done by a dentist
and if we closely analyze what is the
main reason why this happens is because
of the social awareness that the people
have got from the dentist from the
dentist through the social media Let It
Be YouTube Let It Be Instagram let it be
the Facebook or let it be this WhatsApp
so people started doing some good
content okay telling the importance of a
dental health related to their General
Health and I mean like particularly you
see uh now more Ortho cases are being
done because people are more worried
about their Aesthetics and their
presentation
so who has done this
who has done this dentist why they have
not done previously because they are
they're busy they're busy in their lives
okay they're busy in their lives they're
busy in their profession they're busy
being teachers so they don't have time
for all this like why in the Corvette
games the good aspect of Dentistry is
what I feel like people started working
on this content creation and that has
improved op
where it has improved it has improved
for every individual it is not only for
own Clinic not only for their training
so whatever the content creators in
dentistry let it be a third year let it
be a final year let it be anyone who is
doing a Content creation uh to motivate
the patient is not only providing op for
a particular clinic or consultation for
a particular individual they are opening
the gates of entire dentistry in India
that's a beauty here right so who can
carry this you have to carry this
who can carry this now I am carrying I'm
doing something okay which is useful for
the entire Dentistry
whatever we do whatever good we do now
who has to carry this to the next level
in the next few years is it is the
people who are watching this you're the
young dentist you're the future of the
Dentistry so you have to carry this so
this is how we can grow
how we can grow the dentistry in India
to the to the level where we can compare
or where where we can competent the
dentists of India
to the rest of the world you see like
you see most of the dentists who are
working in UAE are Indian dentists most
of the dentists who are working
throughout the world if you just analyze
I see like whatever country it may be
Indian dentists are working they are
more skillful they have more
opportunities okay so the goal here is
to learn first then execute the things
next okay so I'm going very deep into
this I don't want to drag this uh
interaction tool and they okay but
people who are watching this on YouTube
please kindly keep it in uh either 1.5 x
preferably 1.5 x so that you want you
want to save some time uh in this video
okay right I'm jumping to the next part
uh so what I can tell you at the end of
the story is first track not dream big
you have a dream big aim high and start
working towards it okay and particularly
I don't anchor is and I don't want all
these people who spread negativity
around you okay and I hope like you are
matured enough and you are grown enough
and you're a doctor now okay after
finishing your final year you'll get a
doctor tag right you'll get a doctor tag
you're a doctor now you know what is
good and bad for you there is no one
there is we don't require someone coming
and telling you this is good for you
this is bad for you I know what is good
if I'm going for a restaurant during my
very Angus okay my mother used to order
for me my father used to order for me
now if I'm going with my mother and
father I know what I want I can order
myself I feel like most of you are grown
up most of you know what is good for you
okay so let's work on those things okay
don't don't believe the people around
you spreading some negativity around
your profession and dragging you uh and
making you compromised in your dreams
okay let's start dream big aim high work
hard and we'll let you know that is a
primary mode of MDS conquer and this
primary motive of this particular
session now you can ask me sir okay you
told me so many stories like the next
one is okay what should I do because I
don't know much about this this is the
first time uh I'm thinking of I'm
thinking to make things big so what
should I do so what should I do I follow
this golden principle yeah in my life
okay from from the day of internship or
let it be during my exams finally exams
or anything like I
there is there is a Formula called as
trust is directly proportional to
consistency and is inversely
proportional to time okay I'm going to
give a simple example for a finely
student so during your first phase or
final year
or during your
third year the first phase of third year
so most of you you you will start your
extractions okay you'll do your
extraction take zero on chain your own
surgery Department
so how much trust you are going to gain
for example every day constantly you're
doing three to four extractions
so that is called as consistence every
day you are doing three to four
extractions so this is a good
consistency of consistency of doing
three to four
consistency of doing three to four
extraction cases every day so you'll
you'll have more Trust on yourself
okay now the second one you never sleep
proportional time if you're doing
extraction
within less than five minutes or rather
than doing an extraction in one hour
there are few people in the ancient
phase we do extraction 30 minutes 40
minutes 50 minutes one hour but if you
are doing the same extraction
in just five minutes how much trust you
are going to gain so the formula here is
trust is directly proportional to
consistency and inversely proportional
to time and your preparation and the
next levels in dentistry will move
around this formula all the factors I'll
discuss some of the important factors
that are required for you to move to the
next part okay but all these factors
they move around only one important
golden aspect that is Trust
people will come and tell stories but I
am a really
I'm a really okay for this like
in good ranks I see people working hard
moving to other places doing something
great in dentistry doing something great
out of Dentistry okay they are doing but
how can I can I can I is nothing but a
trust on yourself okay so how you can
build trust on yourself is if you keep
some goal if you are working towards it
you should have utmost consistency
towards that
and you have to solve those consistents
you have to maintain the consistency
within a limited time so this is how you
can maintain the trust formula
and there are few aspects uh that I want
you to know before you go into
preparation Let It Be preparation or let
it be anything that you want to make
in the next few days let it be anything
anything so here what my uh my
prospective is there is something called
this rule of 21.
so what is this rule of 21 that is
telling us when you want to adapt a new
habit for example you regularly have a
habit of
getting it
getting up at eight o'clock
and running to Department by nine
o'clock this is what the regular
schedule even I follow the same okay I
rushed to the Departments before the
time course
but now keeping the preparation in mind
or keeping the next levels of dentistry
in mind so your Mentor May advise you to
get up at six o'clock or 5 30. so the
individual previously used to get up at
eight o'clock now is get upping it
wake up at six o'clock so this requires
the rule of 21. simple you cannot get up
you you cannot keep you cannot wake
yourself at six o'clock it's going to be
so difficult 5 30 5 o'clock difficult
but if you break this rule of 21 so it
means
for 21 days
you require a person or you require an
alarm to wake you up
but from 22nd day
your biological cycle your biological
cycle will be changed in such a way
there is no requirement of anyone or any
individual or any motivation that you
will get from your bed by six o'clock so
this is how you can implement the new
habits and those habits which are going
to change your prospective towards the
Dentistry or towards the preparation
so this is very very important because
why I want to mention rule of 21 before
I go deep into this video is I see
students judging themselves within 10
days they start preparation 10 days and
they'll call me they'll message me sir
I feel this is not a this is not a right
place for me this is not a right I can't
read I can't do that you understood
yourself
so we don't have any right without
breaking the rule of 21 means you can
decide yourself only after stretching
your things or stretching your legs or
stretching your time with the books for
the next 21 days and 22nd day you have
you have to come and get an analysis
done by your Mentor okay then the mentor
may tell you some modifications but I
see most of the people they quit before
21 days quitting before 21 days is never
encouraged for any sort of new habit
that you are trying to include in your
regular schedule after a very very long
lap you're grown right so it's very
difficult to include this as a routine
so first I want you to follow everyone
to follow rule of 21.
the next important area like whatever
the next project you are going to take
whether you want to read for neat and in
ICT to get into MDS
or whether you want to jump into the
different different aspects like if
you're planning to go to any other
country to Finish Masters in a different
different areas or whatever it is like
for everything you have an exam you have
a license exam okay you have an
interview based exams you have an McQ
business exam so everything moves around
the exams and you should read you should
read and you should work hard to stand
in the competition
to stay read and and stand in the
competition what I strongly believe is
you should have a proper study area or
study environment so this is very very
important particularly
for the interns who stay in the chorus
and decide yourself whether your room
which you are going to share with your
Bachelor or someone is comfortable to
read or not that is my first question
if it is comfortable
then okay you prepare your area in your
room if you feel it's not comfortable
then I strongly recommend you to move to
library because you have your libraries
right okay so Library go to library and
take a particular place and that is
going to be your study zone or study
area for the next one year don't change
okay don't change this place okay it's
fixed for me for the next one year
because you're an intern in most of the
colleges you're an intern and definitely
enter will have an upper hand among the
four or five years of students you have
to manage pieces if they are coming and
dominating you but you should not never
leave your place your place is yours for
the next one year and you're going to
sit at that area and you're going to
study because that is your study area
so your study area is important
your study position is important okay
and the surrounding should be so
pleasant cool I don't want you to keep
bulk of books in front of you bulk of
papers in front of you phones in front
of you make sure your study area is
clean study area is clear with less
objectives and less distractions I see
people keeping their mobile
four on one side okay and studying on
other side this is this is a destruction
okay so I don't want you to get easily
distracted so what I strongly believe is
like whenever you're working on mobiles
okay make sure you stop your
notifications okay you you keep in your
uh flight mode and if you feel like
there are a few things like you need to
work on apps you need to work on
websites for their content so whenever
you are in a study area and your study
Zone make sure you try to keep your
mobile the flight mode and you start
working towards it or when you're having
a book reading make sure you turn off
your mobile keep your mobile away from
yourself
so so that is that is very very
important
and the Zone should be very clean and
clear you should have a proper timetable
stick down to your areas you should have
some motivation stuff okay like for
example I see students in their study
area they write that okay the dream
College in the dream department so every
day whenever they sit they see the dream
College in the dream department and few
of them few of the students I have I've
seen personally that they are going to
keep these uh quotations or dream
Department uh with a written handwriting
on their phone works because they
regularly open the phone like whenever
they open the phone they see that okay
so they get that uh I mean like they get
that positive energy whenever they see
that Peak and they start working towards
it
so these are all important aspects that
you have to do in the initial phase of
preparation a proper study area is very
very important and study area should be
the same throughout the preparation
phase in most of the conditions and your
destructions which are going to disturb
should be very very limited or less in
the study area
next one I strongly feel is time
management okay because being an intern
okay for example you are a repeater who
is sitting your your full time on
Preparation the story is different but
if you're an intern
who has to manic Clinic who has to
manage the clinical hours patients on
one side departments on other side
and you need to handle your friends
because there'll be some party freaks
on the group right on your group on your
subgroup in your department who always
push you to
do something which is more entertaining
which has more fun
okay so you need to manage all these
individuals around you to make your
preparation more comfortable and
beautiful so in such situation it is
time management is very very important
so time management is going to be
different for different individuals for
an interns the story will be different
the same intern posted in different
department story will be different for
example you are posted in peripherals
like departments like oral pathology you
may not have so much work or you are
posted in community the work is going to
be different
maybe you have you have less
consideration of work compared to other
departments but you have posted in oral
surgery you're posted in oral medicine
Radiology you are posted in conservative
window your posted in prosto you will
have more work compared to departments
like orthopedop area and pedo
So within the same College the same
intern post it in different departments
the time management is going to be
different
so time management should always be
linked with a proper timetable and a
schedule so schedule anyway the
Conqueror is going to give you the
schedule to push you and time management
whenever you are not able to reach your
goals or your targets or your tasks make
sure you come back discuss with the
mentor so being a mentor as they get
exposed to more number of students in
the last 10 years so here the mentors
will have that extra Edge giving you
some extra tips and suggestions and
cheat codes which make your preparation
better
so one of the most busiest and important
aspect of your entire preparation if
you're an intern or a clinician or a
mother is time management the biggest
factor is going to be the time
management if you are a repeater who is
sitting 24 hours on Preparation without
any deviations or without any other
commitments time management is not a big
big issue for them but if you are an
intern
and particularly if you're an intern
from government Dental College like for
example Again The Story Goes different
right so if you are from a private
chorus
may be less but if you are from
Government College like let's take GDC
Mumbai
or you take GDC Hyderabad
okay so for an intern
to manage this High op and balancing the
preparation on on other side is not
going to be that easy and who is going
to help you in this story is sit with
the mentor sit with the mentor Mentor is
going to give you suggestions how to
manage the things how to read and how to
achieve it so time management is
definitely a biggest Factor
for interns
and for
clinicians people who work in clinics or
people who has their own clinics or
you're recently married
or now you are maybe carrying you are
pregnant you are having kids you're a
mother
you have some responsibilities at home
to take care of your parents so then the
story is going to be totally different
when compared to a normal individual so
these people time management is very
very important you start working towards
it and sit with the mentor discuss about
the time management Mentor is going to
give you suggestions
so this is how what I can tell you is
time management okay so most of us we
miss things by margin
so I see I see my students uh during the
counseling phase I see my students
telling their sir two more mcqs
the scene would be different now I got
beat up
I got Peter now two more mcqs I would
get end up
I got a private college now two more or
three more mcps I would have got dgdc
so you know the value of a Mark or value
of a particular time once everything is
done
you see 2019
welcome I hope you remember this Ms
dhoni was shot of Greece by a few inches
we lost the match we lost the hope we
lost the one from international cricket
so
the margin the margin this margin is so
important
and you will know value of this
particular margin only once you're done
with the match
so what I'm suggesting you is what I'm
strongly recommending you is be careful
most of us
who are in dentistry including me
okay I have taken Biology as a
background during my 11th standard
not to become a dentist I have a
different purpose here
I thought of entering into mbbs but I
was not able to and I was in BDS
and the difference between mbbs and BDS
at that time is hardly if I am serious
five more mcqs I would become an mbba
student and I hope this happens for most
of you who are watching this video
right right do you do you do you agree
for this so most of our teachers most of
us we have entered into biological
background to become an mbbs doctor not
a dental doctor
but now we are dentists that is a
different story but what I'm telling is
every one of us
will fall short by few things that will
make us to compromise in the life and I
don't want this to happen again in my
life
and I don't want this to happen again in
every one of you who are watching this
video
make sure you hit a like the video okay
thumbs up sign into the video that's a
positive vibe required
okay so so respect the time and and work
on it because if you respect the time
the time will respect you we always see
our elders
your time will come good time will come
now it is a bad time for us good time
will come what is the good time what is
the good time if you respect time time
will respect you that respecting given
the respect given by time is called as
good
so if you want your good times to come
as early as possible first you have to
give the damn respect to the time so
what I feel is time management
is the biggest thing so when you're able
to manage the time the next fellow Will
Come
who is the next Feller yeah right
absolutely right the next fella is
stressful so whenever you're able to
manage the time people who cannot manage
the time you will not have stress don't
worry you don't have stress people who
are not able to manage the time
now you are going to have a stress okay
so how to manage the stress okay it's a
big aspect that how to manage this is
because you have patience on one side
okay you have patience on one side
or or if you are if you don't have
patience you'll have parents on other
side you have your parents right okay if
you are not if you are not an intern who
are a repeater preparing for entrance
examination staying at home who is going
to be there parents will be there if you
are in college who is going to be there
patients will be there so parents and
patients on one side you have your
friends
good friends okay very good friends so
dangerous like toxic friends will be
there right
who always
make you you I mean who always try to
pull you from preparation fool you from
good aspects so friends
you need to manage the college I mean
the Departments
you need to manage your studying
you need to manage your personal so
there are lots of things to get managed
so in this managing so what we get we
get stressed out
so what is the Mantra what is the
treatment plan for stress is
you should spend quality of time with
your self
you should question yourself
why I am doing this
for what I am doing this why you are
doing this
for yourself
okay for yourself you're doing this so
when I'm doing anything for myself
I should do with a positive vibe I
should do it with the happiness
for example
I was going to shopping
I'm going to shopping to buy some
clothes okay so I should have the
happiness I should have the positive
vibe okay but I see most of my friends
okay I have beautiful friends I see most
of my friends so they they do shopping
they feel very happy during shopping but
whenever they give their credit card or
whenever they give the QR scan or
something they are not happy I see their
faces were
uh I mean you you you know the first
year general medicine General Anatomy
right General anonymous facial
expressions okay so I I see the facial
expression where all the facial models
are getting activated okay so what I
what what the rule of positivity or book
of secret is telling is whenever you
spend
wherever you spend whenever you spend
money okay you spend with positivity you
spend with love towards money okay the
secret book is having one chapter called
as uh love towards money okay so
whenever you have that love towards the
money whenever you're when you're
spending money you feel very happy in
spending the money like in loving the
money what money feels is
this fellow loves me so much
so I have to do something and get back
to this filler as fast as possible okay
so if you spend something with love okay
the money will also decide that okay
this fella is very good I need to go
back as early as possible back to him in
either in his to pocket or either in his
to bank account so money will move more
whatever you spend will come back
but if you add some difficulty or if
you're not happy when you're doing the
things
the outcome may not be great this
personally I have my experiences and
I've seen most of my students like few
people
when they're reading I see an offline
when they're reading okay they cry they
break their head like this okay they
have all sorts of depression uh that
that we carry in the movies right in
movies you will have every movie you
will have a particular scene where the
hero is going to be so depressed
demotivated so I see all those
activities in few of my students who
always feel preparation is a button to
them preparation is big
s to them okay so this is not going to
work out like whatever you do you do
good Dentistry do with happiness do with
smile okay when you're doing giving a
prosthetic complete denture most of you
has given it in your final year to your
patients okay right so when you are
giving a prosthetic denture to a old
patient give it with smile give it with
smile okay give it with positivity then
you will get lots of blessings that's
going to make your life more beautiful
uh you you're frustrated you're
frustrated for something and you scroll
your page parents and you scroll your
patients things will not work out so
that's what like the positivity is
required when you're doing something
good for you you do with positivity the
good will come to you
okay so don't stress yourself like
whenever I see students coming like
biochemistry's next subject uh
biochemistry very irritating
pharmacology very difficult no you are
telling yourself that it's going to be
difficult I see students coming and tell
me sir I'm not able to remember anything
so when you're speaking something not
able to remember anything
your your mouth is giving an information
to the ear and ear is giving an
information to the brain that brain it's
telling the brain that okay this fellow
is only telling don't remember sir I
can't remember everything sir
so brain is going to give an information
brain brain will get an information okay
he's he's completely fixed that I should
not remember anything so brain will get
a command okay I'll not remember it
whatever you speak is going to happen if
you speak good good is going to happen
if you speak bad
is going to happen so it is completely
your decision uh to decide what is good
and what is bad for you this is how you
can manage the stress so apart from this
particular technique like love I love to
whatever you do there will be no stress
now the other other ways of breaking the
stress is when you're over stressed when
you're depressed frustrated
 you should talk you should come out
and talk maybe you should talk with your
close friend you should talk with the
people who are good to you you should
talk with your mentors you should talk
with your parents or you should talk
with your loud individuals
and the other remedy that what I have
seen uh is a good music okay so I I
strongly recommend by myself I I when I
when I'm not when I'm out of globe or
stressed of any other reasons I keep
some good music on I see some good movie
uh I I go for a I go for a physical
activity I play cricket
or I'll go for a walk
all right I'll have a cup of coffee or a
tea with my close friends so this is how
I can make come out of my stress but
during my preparation
uh as I'm water stressed because of my
personal commitments towards my family
and XYZ so I regularly used to have a
habit of going to Temple and have a
meditation of just I mean it's not like
basically meditation I just go there
have that beautiful positive vibe sit
there for maybe 10 minutes or 15 minutes
by closing my eyes and I used to come
back have a cup of coffee and back to my
preparation so every day I use during my
preparation phase I used to go Temple to
have that uh
a particular calmness or a piece or a
positive vibe so this is this the the
most common Stress Management aspects
that the individuals will do okay
and yes of course the next one I was
stressing is about the positive apps so
you should have a positive individuals a
good good uh friend supporting your
preparation good Mentor who is always
trying their best to help you to lift
you up in the preparation or maybe uh
good parents okay I see the few I mean
like there are parents who are very
interested in supporting their kids and
pushing their kids to reach high goals
like very impressed of most of your
parents uh in the last nine years I'm so
impressed there were a few parents who
are really extraordinary they sit with
their kid they study they watch the
videos they used to call us and see a
motivated you've motivated it very well
your classes are very good so I I'm very
pleased okay it's it's if a student is
telling the story is different a parent
is coming and telling I have watched
your video that that hypersensitivity
video I have watched here your videos
are good your motivation is good like I
was very impressed so if you have good
people I mean it's not mandated that
every everyone should have this extra
edges but I strongly feel like if you
have such people around you that's going
to be an extra Edge for you in the
preparation so please try to maintain
that good vibe
if you feel like you don't get a good
vibe at least you try your best to give
a good vibe uh to to the people around
you to the people around you to the
Juniors around you to the to the
passionates around you you try to be a
source of good vibe rather than if
people are not able to give it back to
you okay so that is one of the important
aspects before uh we jump into this
these qualities are important whether
you want to go to International whether
you want to go to domestic so finally
the story ends here okay so if you want
to move to the next level in dentistry
after finishing your internship you have
two options in this flowchart the
flowchart one the option is staying in
India that is domestic and moving away
from India that is international
okay so in this video I'm not going to
talk about the international options we
will be having one more session on
International options because the video
is going to be too lengthy so I don't
want to make it too lengthy so I'll be
sticking to the domestic options in this
particular video
okay next factors to be considered okay
there are three important factors if you
want to stay in India or if you want to
move to domestic okay first three
important factors are very very
important the first and foremost
important factor is finance
okay so if you want to move to
International
there are expenses okay so how much you
are going to spend is very very
important aspect the second important
factor is time
how much time it is going to take none
of the international opportunities
will be within few days or few months
okay it's going to take years so how
much time it is going to take the second
important factor the third important
factor is parents who are financially
stable okay because
who has to give the factory number one
money pins who has to do the factor
number two parents in Indian culture
okay who has to give time and money for
you is paid so the third important
factor is
so these are the
primary factors to be considered before
you are going to uh the other options
apart from staying in India
so apart from this there is a one more
fourth option
you comes last that is you
you your capability your skill your
talkativeness your qualities your hard
work and everything comes the fourth
Factor so along with these three factors
once you get open towards these three
yes we are ready to spend money on you
yes we are ready to give time for you
and your parents are supportive to you
then the fourth factor to be considered
if you get all these three
am I eligible to do this can I do this
can I handle this can I survive there
that you have to question yourself
sitting with a proper counselor or a
proper Mentor so these are the factors
to be considered whether you want to go
to abroad okay so abroad I told you
right so
options after BDS are after MDS
uh in other countries the license exams
and everything will be discussed in the
next session okay so now as I said like
the factors to be considered is one is
the money second one is the time and
third one who is going to balance this
is
your parents the third Factor
okay
now when you are planning to take any
option Let It Be MDS
or let it be an abroad action okay so
make sure you try to be clear with
the positives and negatives of a
particular option okay so what are the
difficulties that you are going to face
what are the difficulties that you have
to overcome to get into this particular
option how you have to be it's not same
for every individual you may not be
financially strong so the difficult
aspect is to provide finances for you
and how you are going to repay your bank
loans how you are going to support your
family in the future your family is
already financially strong they don't
expect anything financially from you but
if your family is not financially very
strong or like for example if you're in
a middle class individual like me below
middle class individual like me so once
I'm done with my
BDS or once I'm done with my masters my
parents were expecting that I have to
support them I have to clear their
debits I have to clear their bank loans
I have to uh address their commitments
towards the family and everything so if
you have such responsibilities so then
how you can overcome you have to plan
accordingly so that's what my concern is
when you're particularly going for an
international program
or an international option
so you need to think about all these
aspects and you need to keep you keep
keep all the aspects in the mind and
accordingly you have to plan
so now finally the flowchart is so after
finishing your internship so you have
two options one is domestic option
second one is
you can go for international options
International options will be in the
next video that's video number two and
the domestic options
particularly the main important domestic
option I'll be discussing now okay this
is the flowchart that you have to
maintain preferably International
options will be
more uh preferred or more suitable for
people
who are financially fit
for financial effect
who are fine if their kids are
a few parents they encourage the kids to
go to International so if you haven't
such pool you can think about that
so now you can ask me why MDS
like for example you want to stay in
India
you have to do MDS and most of you have
approached me and most of you are
watching this video may be planning to
finish their masters in the next few
years in India
so if it is MDS 5 MDS starting I told
you what I'm saying
okay once you enter into BDS the first
step in dentistry is
know little about everything
no little about everything
Ortho yes I know little about Ortho pedo
I know a little about pedo perio I know
little about perio
oral surgery I know little about oral
surgery
so little about everything and the MDS
is
completely about something I know now I
know completely about pedo because I'm
doing Masters in beta or I know
completely about end up so you have to
be
completely you have to understand
competitive so that is what more
important like for example a BDS
graduate
how many days you are posted in a
particular Department of career maybe
third year final year internship
together
three months
in this three months
two Saturdays two Sundays every every
month okay for example you will have
three into four Sundays 12 days of
Sundays
three into fourth one days are Saturdays
again your leaves covid-19 is there in
between okay your favors and everything
there how many hours you spend how many
cases you heard of not more than until
unless you are from GDC the story may be
a little bit different but in a private
course I feel like not more than
100 100 cases of barrier you have done
okay for example what you have done at a
BDS level
scaling right apart from this any other
I don't I don't find in most of the
colleges BDS people in a career
Department are going to perform scaling
but what you regularly do in a
metropolitan cities after finishing
Masters Imperial
you do flaps
you do laser-based flaps
you do implants
so this is the reason why Masters is
required and I feel like apart from the
Masters and all these great stories
apart from learning learning enduring
MDS you're going to learn the maturity
in here
you'll get that wisdom of handling the
patients you'll get the wisdom or the
attitude of converting the patients Okay
so
MDS in a particular department is not
only to master the
clinical procedures in the department it
is it's going to help you to handle the
patients well enters the patient's well
you'll get maturity you'll get the
stability and all these things so that
is the reason why I strongly recommend
MDS is mandatory because MDS apart from
being a degree apart from making you to
learn the clinical skills
the MDS is going to give you that sort
of maturity or the start of
stuff that requires for you to handle
the patient or handle the clinic in the
future
whatever you do a procedure in the
college is different and whatever you do
your procedure in a clinic or outside
the college is different that as of now
most of the interns cannot understand
that
so that is the reason why it is good if
you do a masters
and second thing the world is growing
education wise awareness wise and
everything
like even if you take a semitone even
you take a semi town
when they are getting the treatment and
people are asking like
have it and Masters are you PG
which branch you have done
there is something called as a root
canal specialist I I searched in Google
the root canal specialist is very
specialized in ruling root cameras I
think he's called as endodontist
so is my treatment of root canal is
being done by endodontist or not okay as
I'm rendered on this year I'm telling
the patient I'm rendered on this how
many years experience you have
experience is also important right are
you fresher or if you have an experience
so this is what used to happen during my
PG life also
so it might be easy life we used to have
a chart of 18 pages and we used to
really mention that each PC has how many
cases they have done and everything on a
chart in a department that's a
department rule so I see few patients
when I'm sitting in the op and
addressing allocating the cases to the
uh to my to my seniors or my to my
juniors during my op day the patients
were very keen that I want to get
treatment done by this particular doctor
because he has done more number of cases
assuming that he's going to have more
experience
now to handle smart patients the doctor
should be smart and how you get that
smartness and awareness and attitude is
through the process of finishing your
Masters okay right
so
major reasons like the wisdom knowledge
clinical exposure and the real way of
learning the clinical skills is when
you're trained properly in a following a
particular curriculum
you can ask me like I will get trained
with these fellowships and never know
Fellowship praying is different
after finishing MDS if you want you can
do fellowships or if you want you can do
all these courses but a BDS level if you
know a particular aspect then these
courses may help you to work clinically
at a particular level but you cannot
Master them now what I told you a good
dentist is required a good doctor is
required good doctor is someone who can
Master those things so that is the
reason why I strongly recommend MDS is
required to survive in a country with a
huge population like in India
next how can you do MDS so I'm talking
about the national options so how can
you do MDS in India so you I mean like
previously a few years back if you if
you have money okay you can do MDS but
now even if you want to buy a seat in
NRI quota or management quota it is
mandatory that you have to clear the
need examination
so there are two exams to do MDS in
India one is need exam neet MDS
where more than
98 percentage of the seats will be
filled
the second one is
ini CET MDS exam
where two to three percentage of seats
will be filled
so need exam is conducted
once a year
and preferably it will be from January
to March
the date of exam varies from year to
year basing because of this covid-19
previously it is used to be in the same
month but now the prediction as of now
we cannot tell that it's preferably
March but January to March ini seat is
conducted
twice a year
one session will be in November the
second session will be in the mid
May around and November seats will be
less in ironizating i n i c e t includes
three colleges
for MDS one is aims
all the all the branches of aims okay
second one is PGA and third one is
okay these three colleges combine
together to keep an exam called as ini
CET so where two percentage of seats
will be filled and majority of seats
will be filled by need MDS examination
need MDS is Once in a year and it will
be preferable in January to March
inicity will be twice a year one round
will be in November and one round will
be in the May so these are the exams you
have to clear to enter into MDS in India
next so this MDS seats
MDS seats will be of different different
categories of seats will be there okay
so the first important seats is
government seats will be there they are
from government Dental College seats
okay the second one are private college
seeds will be there
the third one is deemed College seeds
will be there again in private college
you have different categories of seats
basing upon the state it will be varying
from state to state okay okay so it
varies from state to state uh in most of
the states you have a high you have low
end seed same seed for a low cost if you
get a good rank and same seat for a high
cost
if you get a bad Rank and the third
category is NRI quota or management
quota means you have to pay but you have
to qualify the exam
it's a private college three seats were
divided low low cost seats same seat
only low cost high cost seed very high
cost very high cost is nothing but
nricter management for any seat you want
to qualify for a low cost seat you
should get a good rack for a medium cost
seat you should get a better rank than
an anaris
like you see the top colleges in the
country are most of the deemed colleges
like Savita standing first manipal
standing second so all these are deemed
colleges deemed colleges fees will be
high
very high for example you take Savita it
is around like 70 lakhs per annum
70 lakhs most of the team colleges the
fees is going to be minimum of 10 to 17
lakhs per year
so into three years
private college fees were a bit less
like for example you check out the
private colleges the fees will be
ranging from 3 lakhs to 5 lakhs per year
in in most of the states
in few States it's more than five lakhs
per year okay right GDC is the advantage
of gdc's about keeping apart talking
about from op gdc's the fees will be
free
no need to pay anything to the chorus
one and second important aspect about
the government Dental College they are
going to pay a stipend fund every month
they are going to pay his life for most
of the colleges typhen was around 40K
to one point
2K
2 lakhs sorry
so in the government dental colleges
there are two types of government inter
College one is central government dental
colleges are there second one is state
government dental colleges certain and
if you check out the central government
dental colleges the style fund is more
they are colleges in India where they
are going to pay a stipend of more than
one lakh per month
which is going to turn around like
12 lakhs per year
turn around like 36 to 40 lakhs per
three years
without paying any fees
you will get a stipend of this range
state government colleges you'll have a
less life and comparison to government
colleges you take GDC Hyderabad
is around like 62 000 and you take
Maharashtra around like 50 55 000 okay
you take uh Gujarat government dental
colleges you have a stipend off around
like 70 000 okay but most of the central
government they pay high stiff so you
should get a better rank to get
compared to a state rank and you should
get a better rank to enter into state
government into colleges rather than
occupying a private college with low
fees you should get a better rank
to occupy a low low fees private college
compared to your high Feast favorite
course
so this is how the counseling is going
to happen
but we'll discuss about that that's what
like before you are planning anything
you should know what is there
and you can keep your goals accordingly
and you can start working towards it
next the question is
how many government dental colleges
seats government Dental College seats
are there in India in entire India you
have 900 seats are there
you know all the government dental
colleges okay if you calculate the
number of government Dental College
seats in the country you have 900 seats
900 GDC seats are there and luckily in
the last few years the number of seats
has been increased okay you take so many
colleges the number the departments were
added the seats were increased and it's
a good sign for an aspirants who are
preparing and Aiming High in their life
and if you take out there are more than
40 government dental colleges in India
40 government dental colleges 40 plus 40
plus 40 45 government dental colleges
are there and providing 900 government
Dental College seats
so it's a very very good sign
the next comes the how many GDC seats
are there per year in your particular
state so if time permits I'm going to
prepare a video on each and every state
and the number of gdcs are there in the
particular state but as of now uh I'll
talk about the outline of the counseling
what you are going to encounter in in a
couple of months after the preparation
is uh
so you have something called this 50
days of
50 percent is all India
so what is this 50 percentage of all
India I'm just going to give an example
for example you take a
GDC GDC Mumbai you take for example GDC
Mumbai
so GDC Mumbai cross the department
is having 10 seats I'm telling roughly
okay it's having 10 seats okay so what
is this 50 percentage of all India quota
is telling that in enter in all the all
India government Dental College seats in
every Department 50 percentage of seats
should be given to all India pool this
is called as 50 percentage or India pool
should be given to all India and five
seats will be kept for the State Board
so these five states of all India five
seats of all India anyone in the country
can take anyone who are Indians can take
these five states
of the State Pool only Maharashtra
people has to take
for example I am now I'm talking about
GDC Hyderabad
GDC Hyderabad indoor department is there
how many seats we have three seats we
have
three by two you cannot make it 1.5 so
what they do is one year they are going
to give two seats
the next year they are going to give one
seat
so this is how if you have an odd number
of seats one year they are going to give
an extra seat the next year they are
going to give one lesson so this is
going to happen when you have odd number
of seats when you have even number like
10 or 4 by 2.
so buy this by collecting 50 percentage
of seats
from every government Dental College
throughout the country they prepare a
pool called as or India pool
this is called as all India pool
so every one of you
you are from any state you are from any
corner of the country you are eligible
to all India pool because you are an
Indian
but if you want to go for a straight
pull seats for example five seats of GDC
Mumbai produce you should be from
Maharashtra you should have a domicile
from Maharashtra or you want to get this
one or two seats from GDC Hyderabad you
should be a student of Telangana to
occupy this particular City
so I hope you got the meaning of what is
all India pool so this is all India pool
so first of all the counseling that
starts is all India counseling so once
the all India counseling is done then
the state notifications will be released
so if you miss a GDC here then you are
going to take a GDC here
and if you are from a private college
if you are from a private college for
example uh you are from any of the
private college in Maharashtra or smbd
you're from SM Beach
okay whatever it's our acpm or you're
from any of the colleges in and around
zone of Karnataka
okay any any callers from from the
Karnataka or Oxford dental college or
any college from Andhra and Telangana or
any Zone College okay your private
college seats are going to come in state
school only they are not all India
counseling or India counseling is going
to be for the two categories one is for
government dental colleges who are in
all India pool fifty percent is all
indiable the second one is DMD colleges
only these two will be filled by all
India your state government colleges
will be filled by state counseling only
exam is common but counseling is
different or India counseling what are
the things which are filled by all India
50 days of government entry policies
and all the deemed College seats State
counseling 50 percent is leftover State
seats plus all private college seats
will be filled by state counseling so
this is a must important aspect that you
have to know before you start your
preparation because I feel very bad for
the students because they don't know
what is this until they approach the
counseling they were like
I mean I I felt very bad as years goes
because they don't know anything they
start the preparation they do they get a
rank
and once they get a rank at the end they
feel like sir I'm short of two months I
don't know this if I know this I would
have worked hard so that is a primary
motor I'm stretching this stressing this
you have to know about this
right so that is all about like
government dental colleges the number of
seats you have more than 900 government
dental colleges so 900 government Dental
College seats with more than 40 45
government Dental College colleges in
the country
okay so now what are the exams you are
going to address
if you are an intern now or who is about
to start the preparation if you are
already a repeater then you can think of
uh
May
inict 2024
okay if you are not if you are not a
repeat or if you are an intern then the
first exam mostly you are going to
address is inict November 2024. okay for
this inict November 2024 your internship
should be finished by
December 31st
2024. if your internship should be your
internship should be done by December
31st 2024 okay you get an eligibility
for November ini CET and your college is
going to start by January
your course okay your course your
counseling will be done your course will
be started okay so eligibility is
what is the eligibility December 31st
2024 internship should be finished
so the number of seats in this round are
going to be somewhere around 15 to 18 or
somewhere around 18 to 20 it varies from
year to year slightly basing upon the
number of uh mdscs they open in the
branches of Ames
the number of questions will be 200 time
generation is three hours
and the negative marking is minus one
third what is minus one third every
simple and making it simple every right
answer plus three marks every wrong
answer minus one
aims result will be out not in the form
of March it will be out in the form of
percentage
so what did this person tell the top or
first ranker is going to get hundred
percent tip
how many how much percentage of marks
you are getting out of topper is your
percentage for example my rank is 100
and 101.
and I got 81 percentage marks of the
first ranker so my percentage is 81
percent rough calculation
right so you have to answer 200
questions in 180 minutes so you have
less than 50 seconds to handle each and
every question
in this you will be having 25 to 30
diagram based questions I will be
discussing what are diagram based
questions and everything once we start
the preparation
normal regular questions will be 162 162
175 or 180 there is something called as
new pattern questions which were
recently added to the ini CET these new
pattern questions are nothing but the
questions which you have exposed in 11th
and 12th standard
uh those are your
assistant reason based questions arrange
the following in ascending order
descending order match the following
true or false multiple option diagram
based so these are all new pattern
questions but the number of new pattern
questions in inict will be very very
less compared to the regular pattern
questions what are these regular
questions you have you have a question
and you have four options okay so you
have four options you have to select the
best option among the four options that
is your regular pattern questions and
coming to the focus so most of your exam
will be moving 70 percentage of the
clinicals or 70 percentage on the
clinicals plus Basics focusing the
clinicals even a basic question basic
subject question will be integrated to a
clinical and they are going to give it
and most of your diagram based questions
will be unique from the clinical
subjects with few exceptions the
questions can come from physiology
microbiology
and Anatomy
and your dental materials diagram based
graphs and all these things they are
recently giving very frequently
the next comes is the golden exam as
already discussed once you're done with
the November ini CET the golden exam
that most of you are targeting in 98
percentage of seats will be filled by
March 2025 heat exam all your government
Dental College seats all the private
college seats all the themed College
seats even Army Dental Corps selection
and everything happens with
need examination score only
compared to ionic Dynasty which is for
200 mcqs need is for 240.
time duration is same negative marking
there it is minus one third here it is
minus one fourth so every right answer
you'll get plus 4 marks and every wrong
answer you'll get minus 1.
so your score will be 260 into 4 that is
out of 960 you will get a score imict
the result will be in the form of
percentile need the result will be in
the form of marks
so each and every question you have to
solve in 40 seconds so your speed and
accuracy should be more in need compared
to ionic diagram is questions will
roughly touch around like 30 to 40 and
you will have lengthy clinical based
questions we'll be discussing what are
these lengthy clinical based questions
as we go deep into the preparation so
let's start the preparation with a small
positive note then we'll go into the
depth oriented aspects
coming to need inict they have not given
a blueprint but rough blueprint will be
discussed in a very few days okay once
you start the preparation but neat NBA
people has officially given a blueprint
so in which they have splitted the paper
into part a
and Part B
hatia is going to carry 100 marks and
Part B is going to carry 140 so totally
it is going to be 240 questions
so Part B is completely Dentistry
Dentistry clinical subjects which are
going to carry 40 and the rough scores
that are given for each and every
subject also they have given a score so
most of the subjects are going to carry
14 marks 14 mcqs by the subject
to our exception general medicine and
general surgery are going to carry 15
marks each 15 questions each
so this is the last rough blueprint that
is given by nbe people
for need
so once you are done with
November ionic eating
that is in 2024
then you are going to finish
March need
2025 then if you have patience and
everything there is one more exam called
as
foreign
2025. so Maya inicity is going to have
more number of seats because regularly
November inict includes only aims
whereas my inicd includes PG and jpma
also
few seats from PJ a little number of
seeds from Jeff are also added
okay so that is the reason why the
number of seats in mayimic will be more
compared to the November ini seed
Maxim a timing same rest everything is
same
that's everything is same right
okay now the next important question is
how to start your preparation
okay so how to start your vibration as
already discussed the factors in the
first phase of the video that is about
breaking the rule of 21
taking the suggestions very frequently
from the mentor understanding what to be
done and what to be focused preparing a
proper environment for study that is
your study area and everything prepare
preparing proper positive people around
your preparation to increase your
preparation
and apart from handling all this you'll
have the stress issues so managing the
stress breaking the stress and making
yourself happy and adding love to
whatever you do
so these are the most important aspects
in the initial phases of the preparation
so what I strongly I see I see regularly
is if your preparation phase is being
divided into three phases
phase number one phase number two phase
number three so most of you as you are
energetic in the preparation not I'm not
talking about your race I'm talking
about it in the preparation you are
starting fresh so you'll be an adjective
so in the first one one month people
will do good very good
energetic
then they slightly make themselves for a
monotones boring they add a word called
as boring in the preparation so whenever
you add a word called as boring to the
preparation boring preparation
so you keep you slowly start neglecting
it and slowly start
enjoying it
enjoying your internship or enjoying
your vacancies
so once you start enjoying your
vacancies and breaking your vacancies
okay then your preparation will become
dull
so this is this transformation phase is
very very important who are going to
overcome this transaction phase
frequently talking with the mentors
approaching the tasks discussing with
the mentor attending the live sessions
attending the motivation stuff attending
the time management stuff you can break
this if you extend your preparation
very good or good to the next second
phase your job is done you are
successful because again in the third
phase that is your last two to three
months
because you're almost going to finish
your internship and you know what you
are going to do after internship okay so
people will start reading very very
hard in the last two months for this no
need of encouragement because they're
self-motivated to do that okay so the
problem here is the first one two months
will go good
last two to three months will go good
the problem is with the second phase if
you are able to handle the second piece
I'm telling now itself from the day when
I'm telling if you are able to handle
the second phase
you live in the top list very simple
second phase is the most difficult phase
first phase third phase everyone can
handle if you are able to stretch the
things in the second phase you are in
for the rank
okay so once you start reading the
biggest aspect that you have to focus on
is what you have done in the final year
and what you have done
in intention okay so that is a very very
big thing that we have to discuss as of
now
so what you have done in internship so
what you have done as a final year so
you have given so many exams till the
date okay right so
exams or everything so what is the mode
of uh approach difference is very very
important so I want you to get this
drift this drift is very very important
so what we do regularly for a finally a
TA exam or uh for any any sort of theory
exams that we conduct in the college
so first we try to collect most
important questions
most commonly asked
questions we are going to cut and we are
going to read them
here from an entrance point of view
while you're reading here you have to
focus on most
common areas the paperseters are going
to ask in a particular area here
questions will be repeated but hardly 20
out of 240 or 30 out of 240 but common
areas will be repeated here it is areas
but here it is questions
the second important aspect that I
closely monitored is
in a particular question are you showing
perfection
when you're fine when you're preparing
for finally a theory my answer is no
I just want to manage it okay if you
want to show Perfection Perfection is a
choice your wish if you want to be
perfect or not is your wish but here in
a particular area you should be perfect
for example I am telling an example okay
so in your oral pathology you have a
question
write about the classification of
orendogenic tumors and write about
amyloblastoma in detail along with its
histological features this is the
question
here no one is very much interested to
want to become a very perfect
enamelodastoma but when you focus on
entrance point of view if your most
common area is emeraldosta you should be
clear with each and every line what are
the different histological types most
common conversion of management what is
the treatment of unicystic aminal what
is the treatment of multi cystic
aminoblastoma what is definition of
abnormal blastoma how the histological
features will be the most common area is
scientist who has given this
what are the other names what is the
radiographical diagram what is
histological diagram what is the
clinical diagram what is the complete so
this is called as Perfection the
Perfection is not required for a theory
exam the Perfection is required for an
entrance based examination
the third important aspect that what I
have monitored is whatever may be your
presentation if your presentation is
okay you will be allocated more than 50
percentage of words for example what I
have mentioned is a nine marks question
for you
will be Keen or interested in evaluating
your paper and they'll give you five out
of nine very easily but here when you're
talking about scores
for example if it is
a question either it is going to give
plus 3 or either is going to give minus
one if it is right answer plus 3 if it
is wrong answer you have item 10 minus
one need plus 4 minus 1. so here the
calculations are different the
strategies are different
next one the fourth important aspect the
main important aspect when you're
writing an ml last number question in
your final year is your presentation
presentation how you present yourself
whereas here is perfection with a
revision so revision is more important
here
here you hear revision what is revision
here I just check out the outlines or
classification okay this orientation
okay so I'll check it out main headings
okay clinical features most common areas
okay then after uh my focus is on
histological features most common
headings one is closer diagram done shut
up check next one radiological features
okay done I have written done treatment
plans okay conservative what is
conservative treatment plan what is
surgical treatment plan next done what
is recurrence and progress it's done
check this is my checklist but here
Perfection with the revision is very
very important
right and now coming to the fifth one
fifth important aspect so finally your
period exams you have a limited number
of subjects and finally here you have
eight in third year you have three
in second year you have some three or
four okay but here you have less number
of subjects
and on a day of exam if it is an oral
pathology exam your focus is on overall
pathology only
general medicine your focus is on
general medicine only Ortho your focus
is on Ortho only on that particular day
or in that particular year your focus is
on three subjects or four subjects or
five or six subjects but here you have
to carry all subjects
next comes the sixth one what I find the
difference is here presentation is more
important no logics
Logics only come
if a question is coming out of your box
a completely new question is coming
which you have not read then you try to
apply your brain
think and come out with the answer but
in most of the questions in your theory
exam you just recollect what you have
done you have you are going to recreate
what you have prepared right means you
are going to Mark you are going to write
something you want to read something you
try to recollect and repeat the same in
a theory exam
with no logic logic will be applied for
a question which you don't know
you will apply more Logics in Viva
practical rather than in a theory
written exam
but whereas an McQ based exam
okay apart from recollecting most of the
questions will move around logics
they will test your logical they'll test
your analysis they will test your
treatment plan ability they'll trust
your diagnosis abilities and all these
things
and the next Golden thing here is that
is going to make your entrance exam more
easy when compared to the theory exam is
exam everything you have to write
writing drawing
scales everything should be very very
clear
whereas an entrance exam
is just selecting
best option
among the four if you select the best
option you know what is best among the
for your job is done
no need to write no one is asking you to
write about the
classification of warrantogenic system
classification of orendogenic tumors
here we ask you to write
here I'll ask you which of the following
is an honoredogenic tumor which are the
following among the four is an
inflammatory cyst which of the following
is a developmental
which of the following is an epithelial
cyst which of the following is I'm going
to give four options identify the best
among the fourth so this
two options the logic playing the logic
logical skills of you and selective
skills of you from the knowledge what
you have gained make entrance exam more
interesting like a treasury hunt it is
something like a scripted you have a
script and you have to follow the script
here it is more often a treasury hand
okay every question
sounds to be different and you have to
apply your brain you have to play your
skills you have to apply your work and
come out with the right answer so this
Sixth and second sixth and seventh
points the entrance exam makes the
preparation of entrance exam more
interesting and more lovable okay so you
can add more love okay right so so that
is the main difference uh
between the entrance exam and uh and
your theory exam this is how you have to
convert you have to drift from your old
generation Theory based exam to the new
generation an McQ based logical based
exam so this is very very important this
drift I try to help you in converting
your theory reading to a practical
reading
okay now what books to be done
uh
how to read and how many hours to read
okay so all these things are very very
important so what books to be done like
you have uh two or three uh good books
available in the market uh for for
entrance exam point of view uh so I'm
not inclined to a particular book so
whatever Source you have okay you can
keep one primary source
primary book I mean one primary book
and
the secondary book
so what you're going to do in the
primary book The primary book you are
not going to write any sort of things
from the primary book for example you
keep either dentist or dental pulse as
your primary book you are not going to
write anything from that it's already
written
so but when you do want to do an extra
book when you want to do an extra book
okay make sure you try to collect the
information from the extra book and add
to your notes this is how the notes has
to be done
for example I have done I'm giving an
example I'm not uh like I'm not pleased
or impressed with with any of the book
keeping it as a priority for example I
have done Dental pulse
Dental pulse for my subject endo
and I
in all the chapters I have to
some 500 mcquister and roughly telling
500 mcqs are there
so I have done it
so I'm done with Android
apples so now I have time I have still
more time so I want to solve more mcqs
so solving more mcqs is going to improve
your accuracy and speed so you have
website also to solve mcqs but if you if
you're keeping a second priority book
so now I am solving dentist of endo
so for example in dentist of indoor if
you have for example like 700 mcqs okay
so of this 700 mcqs okay so there will
be more than 60 to 70 percentage of mcqs
more than 70 percentage of mcqs which
will be same as in dentist because they
are given previous exam uh questions or
previously repeated questions both
dentists as well as dental pills they
will say they have same questions for
example
out of this 700 400 questions were
already there so my what I do is I try
to identify these 400 questions and I'll
strike it off because they're already
there in my primary book
my book first book of source because now
for this subject I have kept my first
book of choice I said Dental pulse so I
have already solved them so what I am
going to do the 700 minus 400 so my
choice of doing the reason why I'm doing
the dentist is an extra book is to
finish this extra 300 so I'm going to
mark this extra 300. so again I may not
have time to do all the 700 so I mark it
is extra 300 and I Mark the areas for
example uh
Apex locators were already covered in
Dental pulse okay and the same effects
locators were covered in dentists but
the Apex locator questions are more in
dentist
more in dentists so I solve the
questions I don't write the notes
because the notes is already there in
the dental pulse
if not okay now I got very new important
concept which is not there in the
dentist which is not there in the dental
pulse which is there in the dentist so I
prepare a short notes in my notebook
from the dentist
because your time is not sufficient to
come back to check all the books again
and again again and again
so I want you to be very very clear that
your primary book is the book of choice
for reading whether you want to keep
dentists or dental pulse it is
completely your wish but when you want
to go with second book keeping your
zones clear that you want to stretch
things more you want to work hard more
but you have to identify that extra
questions or the extra concepts by which
you can save time when you're going to
read the same book for second time
during the revision I hope this is very
very clear definitely in the first few
days I am going to sit with you I am
going to sit with you help you in in
identifying these extra 300 questions in
identifying the extra Concepts which
were given you know in in I'll be
helping you to write how to prepare a
notes also sit with you I'll prepare a
notes I'll send you by which I'm going
to guide you for the first one month so
this is going to help you out
right so that that is uh that is an
important aspect uh about that and
second one is uh how to start reading
how to start a reading okay so there are
few mentors uh telling that like when
you have time it's very good to get
Knowledge from the textbook and read
from the textbook but my question is
which textbook
in the textbook what you have done
during your final year uh or the
textbook what you have what is more
standardized you have more standardized
textbook for example you take Indo you
have standard textbooks like Grossman
you have standard textbook like Ingle
Kohan whatnot you have so many books so
it is not going to be possible
at all the time being an intern being a
housewife being a mother being with lots
of stress and commitments
so what the team MDS conquer has done
this this mode of reading I'll be
discussing in a separate video but what
the team of MDS conqueror has done we
have prepared 1500 videos from standard
textbooks
covering very important aspects covering
very important diagrams histological
Futures radiographic science questions
which are previously given in that
particular area particular chapter and
particular topic to make your foundation
very very strong so we always discussed
like the foundation is very important
for a building yes the foundation is
important so that is the reason why most
of the teachers they may suggest you to
read text books but in conquer you no
need to read textbooks because textbooks
were already done buying mentors here
and they have prepared Beautiful video
classes the Smart Video classes so you
can watch the smart video which was
taken from a textbook and you will know
the subject the subject is going to give
you the foundation
on which you are going to solve your
primary book secondary book or your
website mcqs and everything
this is how you have to read normal mode
of reading if you are not a student of
MDS conquer and watching this video you
have to read textbook then you have to
solve
the questions okay particularly for
basic subjects there is no other way
because General Anatomy biochemistry
physiology microbiology pathology have
done long back
okay so you cannot simply jump into mcqs
any kind of cannot solve mcqs okay but
when you're coming to clinicals maybe
clinicals you have done very recently
you may be strong in the clinicals so
you have done some sort of reading from
the next book that's okay so that is the
reason why we have developed 1500 smart
videos covering all the topics of all
the subjects so smart readers will guide
you to know the concepts to to build
your foundation upon which you can solve
uh the primary book and the secondary
book and uh I mean the sequence of
handling a particular subject is going
to be different for different subjects
okay so basic subject is going to be
different
and clinical subject is going to be
different and this itself if you want if
you want me to explain it's going to
take more than half an hour 40 minutes
so I'll be discussing in further classes
once you start your preparation how to
handle every subject will be discussed
before you start a particular subject in
the schedule of MDS conquer and what are
the checklists to be done and here you
have that extra Edge you don't need to
do any sort of textbook reading because
textbook reading is already done by the
mentor and Mentor is going to teach you
explain your everything from the
textbook in the video so watch the video
textbook is done then you can straight
away jump into McQ part so that is how
you have to start your reading with Team
MDS content how many hours you read
let's start okay it will be different
for different people basing upon the
commitment but I strongly recommend
intense to stretch even if you are from
GDC at least like three to four hours
even if you are from private college at
least five to six hours at least minimum
minimum private college people should
stretch four to six hours weekends more
more like Sundays more of the time gdc's
may not be possible you cannot read
within the college service so maybe
three to four or four to five uh in the
weekends you have to uh you have to
stretch more okay that is roughly about
how many hours you have to read in
detail we'll be discussing once you go
deep into the uh preparation
okay so that's what like for for the
basic subjects you have to give more
importance because they were done long
back in your in your schedule of BDS and
the clinical subjects yes recently done
so I strongly recommend like keep a
second to a book for a clinical subject
you can keep two books for the clinical
subjects
and only one book for the basic subject
in detail we'll discuss what to be done
and everything your website is filled
with lots lots of mcqs lots of things to
practice you have very good number of
videos uh in in understanding the
concepts in in finishing the schedule
and syllabus fast smart videos are going
to help you a lot
and coming to the checklist of things
that MDS Congress students regularly
carry it's not mandatory for all the
students so here in in MDS conquer we
are going to give a power playbooks
which are which are notices prepared by
the mentors over here that's going to
make your notes work minimal and then
you have I want you to follow either
dentists or dental pulse what is the
latest addition that is available in the
market you can buy it no need to wait
for the latest edition to be out I think
dentists any addition is fine 6th or 7th
or eighth the latest one is eighth
edition Dental pulse the latest
tradition is 16th Edition but anything
is fine 14 15 or 16 whatever that is
available it is fine
then comes all the questions till 2023
okay will be available on the website
subject wise in every subject itself we
are going to cover the subject by his
previous questions you have question
Banks you have latest videos so
everything so this is all like the
checklist that what we provide and what
the MDS Congress students has to carry
during their preparation phase
okay so I'm done with this particular
part uh the part one of the orientation
I I know that it's too lengthy but we
need to discuss like before we plan a
trip
the planet report we plan an event in
the college let's let's plan the
farewell of our seniors graduation day
of our seniors so the planning is very
very important so before we plan the
discussion is very very important so uh
I recommend you to watch this video
understand each and everything if you
have any doubts we'll be having one more
Live question answer session with all
the mentors preferably like
[Music]
the author of dentist who is a part of
MDS conquer has more than 26-27 years of
teaching experience started the first uh
coaching Center in the country in India
he's the one who has started the first
coaching Center in India he's the one
who has started who has written the
first book for MDS entrance preparation
what not okay so uh
the research person the most wise
individual related to the preparation is
with us so the question answer sessions
are will be available
is going to be available so we'll have a
question answer session preferably in
the next one week I'll let you know the
dates and times uh both on the social
media as well as on the

groups okay so we have a free group uh
group access okay where you will get all
the updates and the basic stuff related
to the preparation and all the next
levels so in the next part I'll be
discussing about the abroad options
particularly I'll be talking about DDS
inbd option I'll be focusing on uh three
or four important aspects which are most
frequently done by the students second
one I'll be talking about uh the options
of Canada how to clear the license exams
and what are the steps and how much
amount you need to spend the money and
everything the third important option uh
I'll be focusing on ore of UK LDS or
worry of UK UK to go to UK and the
fourth one I'll be focusing on is ADC
Australian Dental Council exam a little
bit of knowledge I'll be giving over
this UAE your country's license exams
so apart from this if you want to know
anything uh in detail okay so you can
you can drop your comments over here
I'll ask my team to check and if we can
address anything uh we'll try to help
you out in guiding you because uh I I
already told you the most important step
after clearing the final year exams is
to decide what to be done is to decide
what suits for you is very very
important so MDS conquer team here is
there to help you out in deciding what
you actually want with the resources and
with the knowledge what we have in this
particular subject okay what information
we have collected so I mean like I'll
try to get the people who are already
being a part if possible okay so I just
want uh your
suggestions where you what you want to
know and everything in the comment box
okay so next session uh within two or
three days we'll be uploading on the
YouTube and it will be on the four
options which I have discussed apart
from this how to stack preparation maybe
one more video we are planning uh
I mean like uh this is what like each
every book has a particular specific
extra things that you have to be done
that we will discuss slowly once we
start the preparation
it's not I mean like on the day one I
don't want to make things so clumsy uh I
just want to make things simple and
clear so first of all decide start and
proceed okay so I hope you love this
particular session
basically I thought of coming live
but uh due to some requests from the
from some of the colleges that they have
some graduation and farewells to their
seniors so I thought of coming out with
