restarting our career so we have got a
job and step by step we soled the
issues I needed to refresh and expand my
knowledge from where I left off 2 years
ago I decided to do CSM certification so
I have Google about it simply learn came
out on the top I reached to the
representative and they have given a
call back to me as well and they have
emailed me the information and they have
sent a followup email and also they have
sent some guidelines in the WhatsApp
throughout the process they have helped
me a
lot I can say like Danny the trainer
like he was very interactive and the
session went well for 2 days and the
question rise was answered neatly and
also the breakout rooms was very helpful
for us to collaborate with others even
the representative from Simply learn
were very helpful for
me so before doing this course I felt
very challenging in convincing the
people after doing this course I'm able
to convince the people very easily with
the methodologies and guidelines in CSM
and this is like Universal certification

Global

urge to learn and grow grow keep growing
