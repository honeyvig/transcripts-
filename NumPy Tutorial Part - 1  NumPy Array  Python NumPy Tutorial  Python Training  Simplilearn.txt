hello everyone and welcome to Python
numpy tutorial video by simply Learn
Python is a versatile programming
language that allows you to perform
multiple tasks efficiently and
accurately one of Python's major
utilities is in the field of data
science and analytics python is known
for its simple syntax and readability
which is a major benefit also the gentle
learning curve make it Stand Out Among
old programming languages with compiled
syntax similarly python has over 200
modules to help developer reduce tasks
and improve efficiency one such module
is the numpy module in Python which is
used almost efficiently by every data
professional out there be data scientist
or machine learning engineer or data
analyst it is very important for an
individual to familiarize themselves
with the capabilities of this module and
utilize them in a day-to-day task as a
data professional with that being said

check out the course Link in the
description box below now let's jump on
to understanding what numpy module is in
Python but before that make sure to
subscribe to our Channel and hit the
Bell icon for regular updates so let's
begin what's in it for you well today
we're going to do part one of numpy in a
two-part series and we're going to go
over what is numpy installing an
importing numpy numpy array numpy array
versus python list basics of numpy
finding size and shape of any array
range and arrange functions numpy string
functions and then in part two we'll
move on to cover axes array manipulation
and much more
so let's start with what is number numpy
is the core library for scientific and
numerical Computing in Python it
provides high performance
multi-dimensional array object and tools
for working with arrays and I'll go a
step further and say there are so many
other modules in Python built on numpy
so the fundamentals of numpy are so
important to latch onto for the python
so you can understand the other modules
and what they're doing numbers main
object is a multi-dimensional array it's
a table of elements usually numbers all
of the same type indexed by a tuple of
position integers in numpy dimensions
are called axes take a one-dimensional
array or we have remember dimensions are
also called axes you can say this is the
first axis 0 1 2 3 4 5 and you can see
down here it has a shape of six why
because there's six different elements
in it in the one dimensional array and
they usually denote that a six comma
with an empty node on there and then we
have a two dimensional array we can see
zero one two three four five six seven
and in here we have two axes or two
dimensions and the shape is two four so
if you were looking at this as a matrix
or another mathematical functions you
can see there's all kinds of importance
on shape we're not going to cover shape
today but we will cover that in part two
did you know that numpy's array class is
called ND array for numpy data array now
we're going to take a detour here
because we're working in Python and two
of my favorite Tools in Python is the
Jupiter notebook and then I like to use
that sitting on top of anaconda and if
you flip over to jupiter.org that's j u
p y t e r dot org you can go in here you
can install it off of here if you don't
want to use the Anaconda notebook but
this is the Jupiter setup the
documentation on the Jupiter Jupiter
opens up in your web browser that's what
makes it so nice is this portable the
files are saved on your computer they do
run in IPython or iron python and you
can create all kinds of different
environments in there which I'll show
you in just a minute I myself like to
use Anaconda that's
www.anaconda.com if you install Anaconda
it will install the jupyter notebook
with the Anaconda separate and you can
install Jupiter notebook and it'll run
completely separate from anaconda's
Jupiter notebook and you can see here
I've now opened up my anaconda Navigator
what I like about the Navigator this is
a fresh install on a new computer which
is always nice I can launch my jupyter
notebook from in here I can bring other
tools so the Anaconda does a lot more
and under environments I only have the
one environment and I can open up the
terminal specific to this environment
this one happens to have python 37 in it
the most current version as of this
tutorial and they open a terminal if
you're going to do your pip installs and
stuff like that for different modules
you can also create different
environments in here so maybe you need a
python 36 python35 you can see we're
having a nice framework like Anaconda
really helps so you have to track that
on your own in the Jupiter notebook and
your different Jupiter notebook setups
we'll go ahead and launch this jupyter
notebook and then I've set my browser
window for a deep fault of chrome so
it's going to open up in Chrome and you
can see here this opens up a folder on
my computer we have a couple different
options on here remember I set the
environment up as python 3.7 you would
install any additional modules that
aren't already installed in your python
on this and it keeps them separate so
you do have to for each environment
install the separate module so they
match the environment on there and in
here we have a couple things we can look
up what's running you have your
different clusters again this is I just
installed this on a new machine so I
just have the one a couple things in
here that were run on here recently and
when we go on here is we then have on
the upper right new and from the pull
down menu you'll see Python 3 and this
will open up a new window
and now we're in Jupiter python so this
is a python window and we'll just do a
print
and this of course is also hello world
and we'll run that and it prints out
hello world in the command line there's
a couple special things you have to know
we're not going to do today which is on
Graphics if you've never seen this
one of the things you can do is you can
also do a equals hello world and if you
just put the a in there now if you do a
bunch of these we have a equals hello
world b equals goodbye world and you put
a b a then return B it'll only run the
last one but you can see here if you put
the variable down here it will show you
what's in that variable
and that has to do with the Jupiter
notebook inline coding so that's not
basic python that's just Jupiter
notebook shorthand which you'll see in a
little bit so back to our numpy numpy
array versus python list python list
being the basic list in your python why
should we use numpy array when we have
python list well first it's fast the
numpy array has been optimized over
years and years by multiple programmers
and it's usually very quick compared to
the basic python list setup it's
convenient so it has a lot of
functionality in there that's not in the
basic python list and it also uses less
memory so it's optimized both for Speed
and memory use and let's go ahead and
jump into our Jupiter notebook since
we're coding best way to learn coding is
to code just like the best way to learn
how to write is right and the best way
to learn how to cook is cook so let's do
some coding here today and just like any
modules we have to import numpy we
almost always import it as NP that is
such a standard so you'll see that very
commonly we can just run that and now we
have access to our numpy module inside
our Python and then the most common
thing of course is to go and create a
numpy array
and in here we can send it a regular
list
and so we'll go ahead and send this a
regular array let's go one two three to
make it simple and then I'm just going
to type in a and we'll run this
as you can see down here the output is
an array of one two three and we could
also do
print just a reminder that this is an
inline command so that wouldn't work if
you're using a different editor you can
see that it's an array123 but we'll go
and leave it as a
kind of a nice feature so you can see
what you're doing really quick in the
jupyter notebook and just like all your
other standard arrays I can go a of zero
which is going to be a value of one of
course we do a of one you go all the way
through this
a of one has a value of 2 in it so
whether using the numpy array or the
basic python list that's going to be the
same that should all look pretty
familiar and be pretty straightforward
remember the first value is always zero
and when we set on there so let's take a
look why we're using numpy because we
went over the slide a little bit but
let's just take a look and see what that
actually looks like and what we want to
look at is the fact that it's fast
convenient and uses less memory so let's
take a glance at that in code and see
what that actually looks like when we're
writing it in Python and what the
differences are
and to do this I'm going to go ahead and
import a couple other modules we're
going to import the time module so we
can time it and we're going to import
the system module so that we can take a
look at how much memory it uses and
we'll go and just run those so those are
imported so we'll do b equals a range of
one yeah 1000 is fine
and so that's going to create a list of
one thousand zero to 999 remember it
starts at zero and it stops right at the
1000 without actually going to the 1000.
and let's go ahead and print
and we want system dot get size of
and we'll pick any integer because we
have you know zero to a thousand we'll
just throw one in there five it doesn't
matter because it's gonna whatever
integer we put in there is going to
generate the same value because we're
looking the size of how how much memory
it stores an integer in and then we want
to have the link of the B that's how
many integers are in there
and if we go ahead and execute this and
run this at a line we'll see Oops I did
that wrong comma if we multiply them
together
we'll see it generates 28 000. so that's
the size we're looking at is 28 000. I
believe that's bytes that sounds about
right
so let's go ahead and create this in
numpy and we'll go with C equals NP and
this is a range
so that's the numpy command to do the
same thing that we were just doing in a
list
and we'll also use the same value on
there the 1000
once we've created the C value of C for
NP dot a range let's go ahead and print
we can do that by doing C dot size
times C dot item size
well that's very similar we did before
we did get the size of so the C size is
the size of the array and each item size
just reversed so it's the size of an
integer five item size is going to be
the integers and C size and let's just
take a look and see what that generates
and wow okay we got 4 000 versus 28 000.
that's a significant difference in
memory how much memory we're using with
the array and then let's go and take a
look at uh speed let's do um oh let's do
size we trade this with lower values and
it would happen so fast that the npra
kept coming up with zero
because I just rounded it off so size
and let's create an L1
Bulls range of size
and we'll do an L2
I'll just set up to the same thing it's
also range
of size on there there we go
and then we can do on A1
equals NP dot a range size
and then let's do an A2 equals NP dot a
range we'll keep it the same size
and what we're going to do is we're
going to take these two different arrays
and we're going to perform some basic
functions on them but let's go ahead
actually just load these up now we'll go
ahead and run this so those are all set
in memory
except for the typo here
fix that
there we go so these are now all loaded
in here and let's do a start equals
time dot time
so it's just going to look at my clock
time and see what time it is and it will
do result equals and let's do oh let's
say we got an array and we're going to
say
let's do some addition here X Plus y
for X comma y
in and we'll zip it up here
two different arrays so here's our two
different arrays we're going to multiply
each of the individual things on here L1
L2
there we go so that should add up each
value so L1 plus L2 each value in each
array
then we want to go ahead and print
and let's say python list took
and then we'll do
time
dot time
we'll just subtract the start out of
there so time whoops I messed up on some
of the quotation marks on there
okay there we go it's time minus the
start
and we'll convert that to seconds so
we'll go uh just in milliseconds or
times one thousand
and let's hit the run on there this is
kind of fun because you also get a view
while we're doing this
of some ways to manipulate the script
as you can see also my bad typing there
we go okay so we'll go ahead and run
this
and we can see here that the python list
took 34
actually I have to go back and look at
the conversion on there but you can see
it takes roughly 0.34 of a second and we
go ahead and print the result in here
too
let's do that
and we'll run that just so you can see
what the what kind of data we're looking
at
and we have the zero two four six eight
so it's just adding them together it
looks pretty straightforward on there
and if we scroll down to the bottom of
the answer again we see python list took
46 a little different time on there
depending on what um core because I have
this is on an eight core computer so it
just depends on what course running on
what else is pulling on the computer at
the time and let's go back up here and
do our start time paste that into here
and this time we're going to do a result
equals and this is really cool notice
how elegant this is It's So
straightforward this is for a lot of
reason people started using numpy is
because it can add the two arrays
together by simply going A1 Plus A2
makes a lot of sense both looking at it
and it's just very
convenient remember this slide we're
looking at fast convenient and less
memory so look how convenient that is
real easy to read real easy to see and I
don't know if we don't need to print the
result again so let's just go ahead and
print the time on here and we'll borrow
this from the top part
because I really am a lazy typer
and this isn't the python list this is
the numpy list or numpy array
and let's go ahead and see how that
comes out and we get 2.99 so let's take
a look at these two numbers 46 versus
2.99 so we'll just round this up to 3.
that's a huge difference that's that's
like more than 10 times faster that's
like 15 times roughly at a quick glance
I'd have to go do the math to look at it
and it's going to vary a little bit
depending on what's running in the
background the computer obviously so
we've looked at this and if we go back
here we found out it's much faster yes
there's different going to be different
speeds depending on what you're doing
with the array very convenient easy to
read and it uses less memory so that's
the core of the numpy that's why a lot
of people base so many other modules on
numpy and why it's so widely used
so we did glance at a couple operations
when we were looking at speed and size
let's dive into a little bit more into
the basic operations
and these are always nice to see I mean
certainly you want to go get a cheat
sheet if you're using it for the first
time you know look things up Google is
your friend we did this where the most
basic numpy dot array or NP dot array
and we'll go ahead and create an array
let's do pairs one comma two
and then let's do a three comma four and
if we if we do that let's do five comma
six
there we go and if we go ahead and take
this and run this I can go ahead and do
our a down here so it's in line and I'll
print that out you can see it makes a
nice array for us so we have a and if
you look at that we have three different
objects each with two values in them and
hopefully you're starting to think well
how many dimensions or indexes is that
and you'll see three by two so let's go
ahead and take a look and let's go how
about a dot in Dimensions speaking of
which we'll run that and we have two
dimensions for each object
and then we can do the item size so a
DOT we saw this earlier we looked up how
many items it was up here where we
wanted to multiply item size times the
actual size of the object so the memory
is being used versus the item size
and we should see four there
memory is compressed down that's always
a good thing
and then the shape the shape is so
important when you're working with data
science and you're moving it from one
format to another
so we have our shape we just talked
about that we have three by two three
rows by two objects in each one
generally I don't look too much at the
size but the dimensions I'm always
looking up this is nice you can automate
it so you may be converting something
you might need to know how many
dimensions are going into the next
machine learning package so that you can
automatically just have it send that
information over
so we looked at a shape let's go and
create a slightly different array NP dot
array let's go ahead and just do as our
original
set up here
and one of the features we can do which
is really important is we can do D type
equals in this case let's do NP
float 64. and so what we've done is
converting all of these into a float and
we type in a
and now instead of having one two three
four five six you see they're all float
values 1.0 there's no actual zero in
there just shows the one dot or the one
period two three period four period five
period six period
and this again data science I don't know
how many times I've had to convert
something from an integer to a float so
it's going to work correctly in the
model I'm using so very common features
to be aware of and to be able to get
around and use
and we'll also do let's just curiosity
item size
we'll go ahead and run that
and we see that it doubled in size so
it's not a huge increase well doubling
is always a big increase in computers
but it's not a huge increase compared to
what it would be if you're running this
in the python list format
and then we did the shape earlier
without having it set to the float 64.
let's go ahead and do a shape with it
set to 64. and it should be the same
three comma two so it all matches so
we've gone through and remember if you
really if this is all brand new to you
according to the Cambridge study that
the cam the cam University
if you're learning a brand new word in a
foreign language the average person has
to repeat it 163 times before it's
memorized
so a lot of this you build off of it so
hopefully you don't have to repeat it
163 times but we did manage to repeat at
least twice here if not a little bit
more and let's go ahead and take this
we're going to go look at one more setup
on here and let me just take this last
statement here on the converting our
properties of our data and instead of
float 64
let's do complex let's just see what
that looks like and let's go ahead and
print that out and run it
so we now have a complex data set up and
you'll see it's denoted by the one dot
plus 0 dot j
and if we flip over here and do a basic
search for numpy data types better to go
to the original web page but pull up a
bunch of these you can see there's a
whole list of different numpy data types
shorthand complex we have complex
complex 64 complex 128 complex number
represented by 264-bit floats real and
imaginary components
one option on there float 16 float 32
float shorthand for float 64 most
commonly used and of course all the
different ones that you can possibly put
into your numpy array so we covered a
basic Edition up there we're comparing
how fast it runs but some very basic
components how to set up a numpy array
how many dimensions it has item size
data type item again we went to item
size and there's also the
shape probably one of the more used I
used a shape all the time very commonly
used
and then down here you can see where we
actually created a numpy complex data
type
so let's look at some other features in
numpy one of them is you could do numpy
Dot
zeros
and we're going to do three comma four
there we go and we'll go ahead and run
this and you can see if I do NP dot
zeros I create an empty array of zeros
this is really important I was building
my own neural network and I needed to
create an array where I initialized the
weights and I want them all to be the
same weight in this case I want them to
start off as zero for the particular
project I was working on and there's
other options that you can do p1s
and we'll do the same thing three comma
four we'll run that
and you can see I've created a an array
of numpy ones in this case it comes out
as a float array
and this is an interesting to note
because we have let's go back to our
Python and do L Range Five
and we'll print the L so there's our
list and if I run that
it doesn't create the range and tell
after the fact until you actually
execute it that's an upgrade in python
python 27 actually created the array
zero one two three four this one
actually creates the script and then
once it's used it then actually
generates the array and if we do that in
numpy a Range remember that from before
and if we do a numpy a range 5
and let's do uh
L's
or we can just leave it as numpy that's
right there we go just run that
you can see there we actually get an
array 0 1 2 3 4 for the value of the
numpy arrange a range five generates the
actual array
and for part one we're going to do just
one more section on basic setup
and we're going to concatenation
concatenation example
there we go we're gonna do strings let's
take a look at strings what's going on
with there and let's do
oh let's see print
Let's do an NP character something new
here and we're going to add and then
here's our brackets for what we're going
to add
all and let's say
um let's do
hello
comma High
and in the brackets on there let's
create another one
and this one's going to be
ABC and we'll do
x y z so we're just creating some
randomly making sum up on here and then
we'll go ahead and just print this
if we run that and come down here and of
course make sure all your brackets are
open and closed correctly and then you
can see in here when we concatenate the
example in numpy it takes the two
different arrays that we set up in there
and it combined the hello with the ABC
and the high with x y z
and if we can also do something like
print oh let's do NP character dot
multiply
so there's a lot of different functions
in here again you can look these up it's
probably good to look them all up and
see what they are but it's good to also
just see them in action let's do hello
space comma three
and we'll run this one
and run that without the error and
you'll see it does hello hello hello so
we multiplied it by three and we can
also let's just take this whole thing
here instead of retyping it
and we can do character Center so
instead of multiply this to Center
and over here keep our hello going
space out of there and let's do Center
at 20.
and fill character
equals we'll fill it with dashes
so if we run this
you can see it prints out the hello with
dashes on each side and we keep going
with that we can also in addition to
doing the fill function we can play with
capitalize we can title we can do
lowercase we can do uppercase we can
split split line strip join these are
all the most common ones and let's go
ahead and just look at those and see
what those look like each one of them
so we're going to do the hello world
all-time favorite of mine I always like
to say Hello Universe and you can see
here we do Capital H with the world but
so we want to capitalize so capitalize
is the first one in the array so we get
Hello World on there and we can also
take this and instead of capitalizing
another feature in here is title and
let's just change this to how are we
doing
how are you doing instead are we able to
do you and let's run that
and you can see here because we created
it as a title that capitalizes the first
letter in each word
and in this one we're going to do
character lower
two different examples here we have an
array we have Hello World all
capitalized and we have just hello and
you can see that one is an array and one
is just a string if we run that you get
a an array with Hello World lowercase
and hello lowercase and if we're going
to do it that way we can also do it the
opposite way there's also upper
and let's paste those in there and you
can see here we have character Dot Upper
opposite there
python.data and we'll do python is easy
hopefully you're starting to get the
picture that most of the Python and the
scripting is very simple is when you put
the bigger picture together and starts
building these puzzles and somebody asks
you hey I need the first letter
capitalized unless it's the title and
then we have you start realizing that
this can get really complicated so numpy
just makes it simple and we like that
and so in this case we did python data
it's all uppercase python is easy like
shouting in your messenger python is
easy and then if you're ever processing
text and tokenizing it a lot of times
the first thing you do is we just split
the text and we're just going to run
this in P dot character.split are you
coming to the party if we do that it
returns an array of each of the
individual words are you coming to the
party splitting it by the spaces
and then if you're going to split it by
spaces we also need to know how to split
it by lines
and just like we have the basic split
command we also have split lines hello
and you'll see here the scoop in for our
new line and when we run that if you're
following the split part with the words
you should see hello how are you doing
the two different lines are now split
apart
and let's just review three more before
we wrap this up commonly used string
variable manipulations we have strip and
in this case we have Nina admin Anita
and we're going to strip a off of there
let's see what that looks like and then
you end up with nin dominate it
basically takes up all leading and
trailing letters in this case we're
looking for a more common would be a
space in there but it might also be
punctuation or anything like that that
you need to remove from your letters and
words and if we're going to strip and
clean data we also need to be able to
reformat it or join it together so you
see here we have a character joined
we'll go ahead and run this
and it has on the first one it splits
these the letters up by the colon and
the second one by the dash and you can
see how this is really useful if you're
processing in this case a date we have
day month year year month date very
common things to have to always switch
around and manipulate depending on what
they're going into and what you're
working with
and finally let's look at one last
character string we're going to do
replace if you're doing misinformation
this is good pulling news articles
replacing is and what in this case we're
just doing he is a good dancer and we're
going to replace is with was
and you can see here he was a good
dancer hopefully that's not because he
had a bad fall he just was from like you
know 1920s and it's gotten old
so there we go we've covered a lot of
the basics in numpy as far as creating
an array very important stuff here when
you're feeding it in how do we know the
shape of it the size of it what happens
when we convert it from a regular
integer into a float value as far as how
much space it takes we saw that that
doubled it item size you have your in
dimensions and probably the most used is
shape I will cover more on shape in part
two so make sure you join us on part two
because there's a lot of important
things on shaping in there and setting
them up we also saw that you can create
a zeros based array you can create one
with ones if we do a range you can see
how it is a lot easier to use to create
its own range or a range as it is in
numpy you saw how easy it was to add two
arrays we saw that earlier just plus
sign then we got into doing strings and
working with strings and how to
concatenate so if you have two different
arrays of strings you can bring them
together we also saw how you can fill so
you can add a nice headline dash dash
dash we saw about capitalize the first
letter we saw about turning it into a
title so all the first letters are
capitalized doing lowercase on all the
letters upper for all the letters just
lower and upper nice abbreviation we
also covered how to split the character
set how to strip it so if you want to
strip all the A's out from leading A's
and ending A's or spaces you can do that
very easily also how to join the data
sets so here's a character join option
for your strings and finally we did the
character replace we covered a lot in
part one python numpy so last time we
covered part one where we went over the
difference between the python array and
the numpy array and why it's both easier
to use uses less memory and resources
and is also faster than the python list
we also went over a number of the basic
features in there like looking up the
Min the max the median how you can go
ahead and create some very basic arrays
fill them all with 0 rows fill them all
with ones look up the size the shape so
we covered a lot we covered a range
which is equivalent of python well sort
of the equivalent of python list range
and then we looked a lot into characters
working with the NP character and how to
capitalize Center it change it to a
title lowercase uppercase splitting
stripping joining and replacing
characters so what's in it for you today
we're going to go over array
manipulation we're going to go over
numpy arithmetic operations slicing
arrays iterating over arrays array
concatenation splitting arrays numpy
histogram using matplot library and a
few other useful functions in the numpy
and then we'll do a practice examples at
the end and hopefully you've already got
your Jupiter notebook I like to use it
through Anaconda but certainly you can
just use a direct jupyter notebook now
let's go ahead and dive in there since
we're going right into part two which is
getting some coding going under our belt
and here in our jupyter notebook we're
we can go under new and create a new
folder python3 I think I forgot to do
this last time but we could just do the
control plus plus which in any browser
enlarges a page makes it a lot easier to
see always a nice feature another
beautiful benefit of using jupyter
notebook and let me go ahead and show
you a neat thing we can do in Jupiter
this is nice if you're working with
people and you're doing this as a demo
on a large screen I'm going to do the
hashtag or pound symbol array
manipulation kind of a title that we're
working on and then I'm going to call
this cell cell type markdown as opposed
to code and you'll see it highlights it
here and then if I run it it just turns
it into array manipulation and then
we're specifically going to be working
on array manipulation changing shape to
start with and we'll go ahead and Mark
this cell also a markdown so has a nice
little look there and then it comes up
and you can see it just like I said it
just highlights it it makes it very bold
print just making it easier to read not
a python thing but a Jupiter thing
that's good to know about especially if
you're working with the shareholders
since they're investing money in you of
course the first thing you want to do is
import we're going to import numpy
as in p and that should be standard by
now by now you you start a Python
program you're doing some data science
numpy is just something you bring in
there and let's go ahead and create our
array and we're going to do that as the
NP dot a range remember that's a zero
well we're going to do 0 to 9.
and then we'll go print
a little title on the original array
we'll just print that array a remember
from the first lesson so we have our
array which is zero one two three four
five six seven eight and let's add a
print space in between
let's create a second array B but we
want this to reshape array a and what
does that mean
and the command is simply reshape and
then we have nine items in here and this
is so important right now so be very
aware if I did some weird numbers in
here it's not going to work
and we want multiples of nine we know
that three times three is nine so we're
going to reshape our a array by three by
three and then we're going to print
let's give it a title oops add too many
brackets in there modified array and
then let's go ahead and print
our B and let's see what that looks like
as we come down here you can see we've
taken this and it's gone from 0 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 to an array of arrays and we
have 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. and so we split
this into three by three and you can
guess that if I try to reshape this
let's just do a five by three which is
15.
it's going to give me an error so it's
not going to work you're not going to
reshape something unless the shape all
the the data in there matches correctly
so we can take this nine this flat 9 and
we call it a flax it's just a single
array and we can reshape it into a three
by three array and first you might think
matrixes which this is used for that
definitely I use it a lot in graphing
because it'll come in that I have an
array that's X Y comma X Y one white one
comma X2 Y2 and so the shape of it might
be 2 by the length of the number of
points and I need to separate that into
X flat array and a y flat array and you
can see this can be very easy to reshape
the array doing that and we can of
course go back we can do B do a print
and we'll do B dot platin remember I
said it's called a flatten array and if
we run that you'll see it just goes back
to the original one it takes this zero
one two three four five six seven eight
and flattens it back to a single array
and then one other feature to be aware
of is if we flatten it one of the
commands we can put in there is order
let me just go ahead and do that order
equals
F strangely enough F stands for Fortran
they hold fourtran days I remember
actually studying Fortran programming
language in this case you'll see that it
uses the first like it's zero three six
is the order so instead of flattening it
like we had before zero one two three
four five six seven eight it now does
zero three six one four seven two five
eight and if you go to the numpy array
page you can see here that they have the
flatten and you just open up the numpy
and D array flatten setup to look it up
and they have three different options
they have c f and a and it's whether to
flatten in C which was based on how the
C code works for flattening originally
worked which is row major the Fortran
which is column major or preserve the
column Fortran ordering from a so
whatever it was in the default is the C
version so the default that you saw you
could put orders equals c and it'd have
the same effect as we saw there before
you could even do order equals a that
would also have the same effect because
that's the default so really the only
other thing you really should change on
here is to change it to C if you need it
and you can see right here or F I mean
not C the only thing you really want to
change it to is to your f for the
Fortran order which then does it by
column versus by row and let's look at
here we go reshape so let's create a
range of 12
and let's reshape it
I will do 4 comma 3 for this one and
remember this is numpy I forgot the NP
there
NP dot arrange
we can type in just a for print or you
can do full print a and of course a
Jupiter notebook you even have a little
extra print at the beginning we run this
we'll see we create a nice array of 0 1
2 it's reshaped it so we have four rows
and three columns or you could call that
three columns and four rows zero one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven
but this one is so important we'll do NP
transpose
a let's go ahead and run that
and it helps if I get all the s's in
there and don't leave an S out and
you'll see here we've taken our array if
you remember correctly we had 0 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and we've swapped it so
we've gone from a three by four or a
four by three to a three by four
and this really helps if you're looking
at like a huge number of rows and the
data all comes in like let's say this is
your features in row one your features
in row two and this is x y z well when
you go to plot it you send it all of X
in one array all of Y and I'm one array
and all Z in another array and so it's
really important that we can transpose
this rather quickly
this is kind of a fun thing I can
highlight it and do brackets around it
if you remember correctly
because we're in Jupiter it doesn't
matter where we do the print or not
it'll automatically print it for us and
you see if I hit the Run button it comes
up at the same exact thing and let's
play with the reshape and you don't want
to zoom this up a little bit here
make it even bigger so you can really
see what's going on and let's play with
the reshape just a little bit more we'll
do b equals
NP dot a range let's do eight
reshape
we'll do two comma four
let's go ahead and print B
and then run that
and you'll see we have now the two rows
this is a bit more like so we have four
maybe two rows of four things so this
might be all of our X components and our
y components so we can switch it back
and forth real easy important to note
here whether we do two comma four or in
the case of four comma three this has 12
elements and so however you split it up
it's got to equal 12. so 4 times 3
equals 12 that's pretty straightforward
same thing down here two times four
equals eight if I change this and let's
say I do two comma three let's just run
that in and you'll find we get an error
because you can't split 8 up into two
rows by three
we have to pick something that it can
split up and arrange it in so let's go
ahead and run that and just for fun
let's go um
reshaper B again if I can type
reshape RB again and what else goes into
eight well we could do two by two by two
so we can take this out to three
different dimensions
and then of course if we um because this
is going to come out you as a variable
we can just go ahead and run it
and it'll print it we can also do a
print statement on there just like we
did before and you'll see we have two
different groups of two variables of two
different dimensions so two by two by
two and let's go ahead and sign this to
a variable C equals B reshaped and let's
do something a little different let's
roll the axes roll
axes
and we'll take our C do two comma one
and if we go ahead and run this it's
going to print that out whoops hit a
wrong button there let's do that one
again and you roll the axis and you can
see that we now have a set of zero one
two three four five six seven we now
have the zero two one three four six
five seven
so what's going on here we're taking and
we're rolling the numbers around and
let's just simplify this we'll just do
it with C comma one and run that and so
if we roll a single axis you get 0 1
and then it rolled the four five up and
then we have two three six seven and if
we do two let me see what happens there
and this is one of those things you
really have to play with and start
filling what it's doing
we've now taken zero two four six one
three five seven so you can see we've
now rolled by two digits instead of
rolling the one setup we now rolled two
digits up there and so if we go back and
we do the one
so we've rolled it up zero one four five
and then we're going to take the two in
there and we've rolled the 0 1 2 3 4 5
and 6 7. so we start rolling these
things around on here there's a lot of
different things you can do on this
what's another way to manipulate the
numbers on your uh numpy
and finally let's go ahead and swap
axes we'll do c
just go ahead and run that it's going to
just get an error on there
that's because it requires a multiple
arguments lift up the arguments so now
we can swap them we get the zero two one
three four six five seven so you can see
everything's been swapped around
so next thing we want to go over is we
want to go over numpy arithmetic
operations
how can we take these and use these let
me just go ahead and put this cell as a
markdown there we go we'll run that so
it has a nice thing all right nice title
on there that's always helpful
and let's start by creating two arrays
we'll do a as an EP NP
range a range nine and let's reshape
this
three by three so by now you should be
saying this reshape stuff and this
should all look pretty familiar we have
our zero one two three four five six
seven eight on there and let's create a
second one B okay this time instead of
doing a range let's do NP array we'll
just create a straight up array
but we'll do an array of three objects
so it's going to be three by one and if
we go ahead and print a b out let me run
that this is actually pretty common to
have something like this where you have
a three by whatever it is and a three by
by three array when you're doing your
math you kind of have that kind of setup
on there and what we can do is we can go
um MP dot add
a b don't forget we can always put a
print statement on there so if we add it
you'll see that it just comes in there
and it goes okay we're adding 10 to
everything and we could actually do
something more I'll make it more
interesting 11 10 11 12. so it's chains
B's now 10 11 12 and let's run that
and you can see that we have 10 and then
you had one plus 11 is 12. 2 plus 12 is
14 13 so 10 plus 3 is 13 11 plus 4 is 15
and 12 plus 5 is 17 and so on we'll put
this back since that's how the original
setup was let's do 10 by 10 by 10 and
run that and run that and get the
original answer and if you're going to
add them together we need to go ahead
and subtract
a b
and we'd run that
we get minus 10 minus 9 minus 8 just
like you would expect so we have our
subtraction 0 minus 10 is minus 10 and
so on and if you're going to add and
subtract you can guess what the next one
is we're going to multiply
and we'll multiply
a b
and this should be pretty
straightforward you should expect this
if we multiply 10 times 0 we got 0 10
times 10 is 10 and so on
and finally if you're going to multiply
what's the last one we got is divide
what happens when you do divide a by B
and we run this
we're going to get 0 and this is 0
divided by 10 is 0 1 divided by 10 is
0.1 2 divided by 10 is 0.2 and so on and
so on so the math is pretty
straightforward it just makes it very
easy to do the whole setup and again if
we went this and let's say let's change
this up up here instead of 10 we do a
hundred
and make this a thousand there we go if
we run that and then we do the add you
can see we got 10 plus 100 plus a
thousand same thing with the subtract
same thing with the multiply
and then you can also see the same thing
here with the Divide so a lot of control
there with your array and your math
again let's set this back to 10. oops
it's right up here wrong section
there we go 10 and we'll just go ahead
and run these and get back to where we
were
and this brings us to our next section
which is slicing and let's put in our
just be cell cell type markdown and you
run that of course it gives us a nice
looking slicing there and slicing means
we're just going to take sections of the
array so let's create an array in p a
range
let's just do 20.
and if you remember if we do a we have a
0 to 19.
and then we can do a and remember we can
always print these this can always be
put in a print but because I'm in
Jupiter if you're doing a demo in
Jupiter that is it's just so great that
you have all these controls on here so
we could slice four on and this should
look familiar because this is the same
as a python and a lot of other different
scripting languages if we do four we go
0 1 2 3 it's the first four in the thing
and a skip summon starts with this one
the first four I skipped and then from
there on you can also do the opposite
and go till the fourth one if we run
that we get 0 1 2 3 quite the opposite
on there we can do a single item so we
can pick object number five on the list
run that and five happens to be five
because that's the order they're in and
then this one's interesting because I
can do s equals slice
and let's create a slice here and let's
do two comma nine comma
yeah let's leave it two on there so
we'll create an S Slice on here and then
if we take our array and we do array of
s we're taking our slice in there and
let's go ahead and run that and let's
take a look and see what it generated
here first off we started with two so we
have two at the beginning we're going to
end at 9 which happens to be eight so it
stops before the 9. remember when we're
doing arrays in Python and then we step
two so two four six eight we could do
this as three let me run that and you
can see how that changes two five eight
and we could do this as let's leave this
at three and if we change this to 10
oops that's
12. there we go and we run that we have
2 5 8 11. so that's pretty
straightforward it's a very nice feature
to have on here where you can slice it
and take different parts of the series
right out of the middle so now that
we've accessed the different pieces of
our array let's get into iterating
iteration and this is interesting
because my sister who runs a college
data science division
first question she asks is how do you go
through data and she's asking can you do
you know how to iterate through data do
you know how to do a basic for Loop do
you know how to go through each piece of
the data and in numpy they have some
cool controls for that this has a
markdown there we go and run it and it's
called the nditter
I'm sure what the ND stands for but ND
it or for iterator
so before we do that though let's create
an array or something we can actually
iterate through we'll call it a equals
NPA range let's do something a little
funny here or funky
and we'll do 0 45 5. I'm not sure why
the guys in the back pick this
particular one was kind of a fun one and
if I run that we do this you can see we
get 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40. that's
what this array looks like
and this is from our slice you could
this is just a slice that's all that is
as we create a slice of 0 45 0 to 45
step five so we can do with this we can
also do a equals V shape let's go ahead
and take and reshape this and since
there's nine variables in there we'll do
a reshape at three by three so if we run
that oops missed something there that is
the a that really helps so if we do the
a reshape and we'll go ahead and print
that out we get 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35
40. and then we simply do 4X in
our numpy in the enter of a
colon and we'll just go ahead and print
X
and let's see what happens here when we
run through this and we print each one
of those
it goes all the way through the whole
array so it's the same thing we just saw
before we got 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40.
so it prints out each object in the
array so you can go through and view
each one of these
and certainly if you remember you could
also flatten the array and just do for a
in that also and get the same result
there's a lot of ways to do this but
this is the proper way with the ND
iterator because it'll minimize the
amount of resources needed to go through
each of the different objects in the
numpy array
and hopefully you asked this question
when I just did that
and the question is how can I change
this instead of doing each object so
first of all let's go ahead and take my
cell type and Mark that down run it and
so we're going to work on iteration
order C style and F style remember C
because it came from the C programming
and F because it came from the old
Fortran programming so let's give us a
reminder I will do a print a and I'll do
four x n n p iterate a but we also want
to do this in a specific order and you
know what I'm a really lazy typer so
let's go back up here
this is the ND iterator I know I'm
missing the ND part of a let's do order
equals
C we'll print X on there and let's do
that again and this time order
equals
f
let me go order equals F and let's go
ahead and run this
and see what happens here and the first
thing you're going to notice our
original array 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40.
when we do order C that's the default 0
5 10 15 20 and so on and then when you
come down here
you'll see F order f is 0 15 30. so it
takes the first digit of each of the sub
arrays or the second dimension and then
it goes into the second one 520 35 10 25
40. so slightly different order for
iterating through it if you need to do
that so we've covered reshaping we
covered math we've covered iteration
we've covered a number of things the
next section we want to go ahead and go
over
it's going to be joining arrays so we
need to bring them together let me go
ahead and take the cell and make it a
markdown
self-type markdown there we go and run
that so let's work on joining arrays so
we can bring them together and what
different options we have
and let's do we'll do an MP array one
two comma three four
we'll go ahead and print let's do oops
first
these Rays aren't that big so let's just
go ahead and keep it all on one line a
so if we run this first array one two
three four whoops I forgot it
automatically wraps it when you do it
this way so we'll go ahead and keep it
separate
and print a a there we go and let's go
ahead and do a b
and we'll do five six seven eight and
notice I'm keeping the same shape on
these two arrays depending on what
you're doing those shapes have to match
and let's go ahead and print
second array
print
B I want to run that up
I've missed something up there let me
fix that real quick
and I was reformatting it to go on
separate lines I messed that up there we
go run all right so we have first array
one two three four secondary five six
seven eight and we'll put a carried
return on there
and the keyword we use is um concatenate
if you're familiar with Linux it usually
means you're adding it to the end on
there and we're going to do what they
call a long axis zero so we have
concatenate a b along axis zero let's go
ahead and run that and see what that
looks like
so we have one two three four five six
seven eight so now we have an array that
is four by two has a nice shape of four
by two one here
and if we're going to do it along the
axis 0
you should guess what the next one is
we're going to do it along the one axes
and let's see how those differ from each
other let's just go ahead and run that
and again all we're doing is adding in
the axes equals one so we have our
concatenate we have a b and then axis
one remember a couple things one these
are the same shape so we have a two by
two same dimensions going in there
you're going to get an error if you're
concatenating and they're not if you
have something that instead of one two
is one two three four five six with the
five six seven eight they'll give you an
error on there in fact let's take a look
and see what happens when we do that let
me just take this
one two three three four five and let's
run that and if we come down here up we
got there it says all the input array
Dimensions except for the concatenation
axes M must match exactly so it'll let
you know if you mess up that's always a
good thing let's go ahead and take this
back here and let's go ahead and run
that
and so we have our zero axes which is
one two three four five six seven eight
and we bring them together and you'll
see a very different setup here when we
do it along the axis one we end up with
instead of four by two we end up with a
two by four one two five six three four
seven eight and this is changing which
axes we're going to go ahead and
concatenate on what I find is when
you're talking about the concatenate or
the joining arrays you really got to
play with these for a while to make sure
you understand what you mean by the axes
it looks very intuitive when you're
looking at it actually zero one two
three four five six seven eight axes one
is then splitting in a different way one
two five six three four seven eight
when you're actually using real data you
start to really get a feel for what this
means and what this does
so if we're going to do that let's go
ahead and look at splitting the array
and do that under markdown and run it
there we go so you have a nice little
title there
and we'll go ahead and create an array
of nine let's do NP split
we'll do a and we're going to split it
by three
let's just see what that looks like so
if we split it we get into raise 0 1 2 3
4 5. we get three separate arrays on
here now remember we're looking at let
me just print a up here
so we're looking at zero one two three
four five six seven eight and then we
can split it into three separate arrays
and let's take this we're going to do
this right down here I'm just going to
move the a split down here instead of
the three let's do four comma five put
that in Brackets
and so we do it this way we have 0 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 and that's kind of interesting
I wasn't sure what to expect on that but
we get when you split an a by four comma
five you get a totally different setup
on here as far as the way to split the
array
and to understand how this works I'm
going to change the five to a 7. and
this will visually make this a little
bit more clear
so we had four and five I went zero one
two three four five six seven eight and
you see the markers four and five when
we do four and seven I get zero one two
three four five six seven eight and so
what you're looking at here is the first
markers this is going to go to four
so there's our first split at the four
the marker of four and then the second
split is going to be at position seven
and this is the same thing here a four
position five that's why we're splitting
it in those two sections we could also
do it seven let's just see what that
looks like run and you can see I now
have zero one two three four five six
seven eight
so we can split in all kinds of
different ways and create a different
set of multiple arrays on here and split
it all kinds of different ways
and before we get into the graphs and
other
miscellaneous stuff
let's go ahead and look at resizing the
array I'm going to take the cell and set
the cells a markdown and run it
give us a nice title there and we'll do
an array an imperial of one two three
and four five six here I'm just going to
just print
let's go print a DOT shape then we'll go
ahead and run that whoops hit a wrong
button there
hit the comma instead of the dot so we
have a shape of two comma 3 here and
this is important to note as we start
resizing it it's going to mess with
different aspects of the shape
and so I'm going to do a print
scoop in for a blank line there we go
let's do b equals
NP dot resize
we're going to resize a
and let's resize it with three by two
and then we'll just go ahead and
print
B
and print the period shape not a comma
I'll run that
oops forgot the quotation marks around
the end we'll go ahead and run that and
let's just see what that looks like so
we have one two three four five six
original array with the shape of two
three
and then we want to go ahead and resize
it by three two and we end up with one
two three four five six and we end up
with the shape of three two that
shouldn't be too much of a surprise you
know we got six elements in there we can
resize it by two three was the original
one and then we're actually just
reshaping is how that kind of comes out
as when you resize it like that
but what happens if we do something a
little different
and let's go ahead and just take this
whole thing and copy it down here so we
can see what that looks like
and instead of doing three two remember
last time I did the to reshape it I
messed with the numbers and it gave me
an error but when you resize it you
don't have to match the numbers they
don't have to be the same dimensions so
we can instead of going from a 2 3 to a
3 2 we can resize it to a 3 3. so let's
take a look and see how it handles that
and we come down here to 3 3 we end up
with one two three four five six and it
repeats one two three so it actually
takes the data and just adds a whole
other Block in there based on the
original data repeating it
all right now at this point you know
we've been looking at tons of numbers
and moving stuff around we want to go
ahead and do is get a little visual here
because it um
certainly you can picture all the
different numbers on there but let's
look at the histogram let's put this
into a histogram let me go ahead and run
that
and to do that we're going to use the
matte plot Library so from matplot
library we're going to import pipelot as
PLT that's usually the notation you see
for pi plot so if you ever see PLT in a
code it's probably Pi plot in the
matplot library
and then the guys in the back did a nice
job and gals too guys and gals back
there our team over here simply learn
put together a nice array for me at 2087
4 40 53 with a bunch of numbers that way
we had something to play with and what
we want to do is we want to do uh plot
the histogram I remember a histogram
says how many times different numbers
come in and then we're going to put them
in bins and have been 0 to 20 to 40 to
60 to 80 to 100.
you might in here with the matplot
library they call them bins you might
hear the term buckets or they put them
in buckets as a really common term then
we want to give it a title so the way it
works is you do your PLT to hist for
histogram your PLT title and your PLT
show and we're doing just a single array
in here in the numpy array of a and
let's go ahead and run this piece of
code
taking a moment to come out there's his
finger size so it's generating the graph
and you can see we have and let's just
take a look at this and go down a size
there we go okay so now we can see we're
taking a look at here so between 0 and
20 we have three values so we have a 20
here we have a four and a 11 and a
fifteen zero one two three it's actually
Four values but they start at zeros
remember we always count from zero up
and from 20 to 40 we got 20 this is 142.
2 3 4
5 6.
and so you can see in the histogram it
shows that the most common numbers
coming up is going to be between the 40
and 60 range least common between the 80
and 100 this looks like an age
demographics is what this looks like to
me and you can see where they would have
put it in the buckets of different age
groups which would be a nice way of
looking at this histograms are so
important and so powerful when you're
doing demos and explaining your data so
being able to quickly put a histogram up
that shows what's common and how it's
trending is really important and using
that with a numpy is really easy and you
know what let's take the same data and I
want to show you why we do bins or why
we have buckets of data I'm used to
calling it buckets why we have bins
let's do it instead of by 20 let's do it
by tens and see what happens
and what happens when you do it by tens
is you miss out on the you can see a
nice curve here on the first one and on
the second one it looks like a ladder
going up and a plummet a letter going up
and a plummet and a ladder going down so
the first would be more indicative of an
age group and the second one would be
what she would get if you divide it
incorrectly you wouldn't see the natural
trend
I don't know what this would be maybe
how much food they eat hopefully not
because I'm in 50 so I'm right in the
middle there that which means I get a
ton of food compared to everybody else
but it's some kind of democrat maybe
it's mental maybe it's knowledge because
we we hit a certain point and we start
losing our marbles start leaking out or
something so you start off knowing
something and then as you get older you
grow more but you can see here we lose
that you lose that continuity in the
thing if you split the histogram into
too many bins or too many buckets
and if you actually plotted this by the
individual numbers it would just be a
bunch of dots on
that wouldn't mean a whole lot
and reflected graphs there turns out
there are a ton of useful functions in
numpy
I'm sure there's even new ones that are
aren't going to be in here but let's
just cover some important ones you
really need to know about if you're
using the numpy framework
one of them is Lane space function this
is generating data so you have a line
space we have one three ten and when we
do that we end up with 10 numbers so if
you count them there's 10 numbers
they're between 1 and 3 and they're
evenly spaced we get 1 1.222 but these
are all there's a total of 10 here and
it's right between the one and three
range
that could be there's a lot of uses for
that but they're probably more obscure
than a lot of the other common numpy
array setup
a real common one is to do summation so
we'll do summation where you do in this
case we create an empty array of one of
two different arrays One Two Three or
two different dimensions one two three
three four five and we're going to sum
them up under axes zero which is your
columns and if you remember correctly
columns is the one plus three two plus
four three plus five so we have three
columns and if we change this we'll just
flip this to one
we get two numbers so we get one two
three all added together which equals
six and three plus four plus five which
equals twelve we'll set this back to
zero
there we go since it says it was just
looking at zero
and these probably could have been some
of these could be used in our math
section square root and standard
deviation two very important tools we
use throughout the machine learning
process and data science and simply we
take the NP array we have again the one
two three four five six three four five
I don't know I need to keep recreating
it I probably could have just kept it
but we can take the square root of a so
it goes through and it takes a square
root of all the different terms in a and
we can also take the standard deviation
how much they deviate in value on there
and there's a gravel function we can run
that
and NP array is X we're going to do x
equals a we change it from a to x x
equals Ravel and this sets it up as
columns so we have one two three four
five this is all columns on here very
similar to the flattened function
so they kind of look almost identical
but we also have the option of doing a
ravel by column and then another one is
log so you can do mathematical log on
your array in this case we have one two
three and we'll find the log base 10 for
each of those three numbers there's a
couple of them they don't you can't just
do any number here after log but there
is also log base 2. log base 10 is
pretty commonly used on here run that
there we go
before we go let's have a little fun
let's do a little practice session here
on some more challenging questions so
you start to think how this stuff fits
together right now we just looked at all
the basics and all the basic tools you
have so let's do some numpy practice
examples and let's start by figuring out
how do you plot say a sine wave in numpy
what would that look like and so in this
project we wouldn't have to do this
because I've already run these but we'd
want to go ahead and import our numpy as
NP and import our matplot library
pipelot as PLT so we get our tools going
here and then we'll break it into two
sections because we need our x Y
coordinates in here so first off let's
create our x coordinates and our x
coordinates we're going to set to an a
range
and we want this error a range since
we're doing sine and cosine it's going
to be between 0 and 0.1
and then we use our NP and we actually
can look up numpy stores Pi so you have
the option of just pulling Pi in there
directly from numpy it has a few other
variables that it stores in there that
you can pull from there but we have
numpy pi and we generate a nice range
here and let's go ahead and run this and
just out of curiosity let's see what x
looks like I always like to do that so
we have
0.1.2.3.4 so we're going zero to in this
case 9.4 3 times numpy pi remember that
Pi is like three point something
something something that makes sense it
should be about nine and we're doing
intervals of 0.1 so we create a nice
range of data and then we need to create
our y variable and so Y is going to
Simply equal NP or numpy dot sine of X
and then once we have our X and Y and if
we print let's go and just print y see
all that we'll do this let's do this so
it looks print
X print y
so we basically have two arrays of data
so we have like our X axes and our y
axes going on there
and this is simply a plt.plot because
we're going to plot the points and we'll
do X comma Y and then we want to
actually see the graph so we'll do plot
dot show and we'll go ahead and run that
and you see we get a nice sine wave and
here's our number 0 through 9 and here's
our sine value which oscillates between
-1 and 1 like we expected to
then for the next challenge let's create
a six by six two dimensional array and
let one and zero be placed alternatively
across the diagonals
well that's a little confusing so let's
think about that we're going to create a
six by six two dimensional so the shape
is six by six two dimensional array and
let one and zero be placed alternatively
across the diagonals
now if you remember from lesson one we
can fill a whole numpy array with zeros
or ones or whatever so we're going to do
NP create a numpy zeros and we're going
to do a six by six and we'll go ahead
and make sure it knows it's an integer
even though it's usually the default and
just real quick let's take a look and
see what that looks like so if I run
this you can see I get six by six grid
so six by six zero zero zero zero zero
now if I understand this correctly when
they say ones and zero placed
alternatively across the diagonals they
want the center diagonal maybe that's
going to stay zero all the way down
and then the next diagonal will be ones
all the way across diagonally and then
the next one zeros the next one ones and
the next one zeros and so on hopefully
you can see my mouse lit up there and
highlighting it so let's take a little
piece of code here
and we'll do Z One colon colon two comma
colon colon two equals one and well
that's a mouthful right there so let's
go ahead and run this and see what
that's doing and so what we're doing is
we're saying hey let's look at in this
case Row one there's one and then we're
going to go every other row two so we're
going to skip a row so skip here skip
here skip here so we're going down
this way and we're going every other row
going this way it's hard to highlight
columns so you can see right here where
the that we're not touching each row is
like this row right here is not being
touched okay so we're going to start
with Row one and then we're going to
skip a row and another one and so we're
going every two rows and then in every
two rows we're looking at every two
starting with the beginning that's what
this thing blank means so we're going to
start with the beginning and we're going
to look at all of them but we're going
to skip every two so starting with Row
one
we look at all the rows but we do we do
it by two steps so we go one Skip One
you know one Skip One One skip one one
if you lift this out and do every one
this is just be once in fact let's see
what this looks like if I go like this
and run it you can see that I guess get
once
so this notation allows us to go down
each row row by row and we're going to
do every other row set up on there and
so if we're going to start with Row one
we also
control Z
try that there we go we'll start with
row zero again we're going to go each
row step two so we'll start with row
zero and we'll go every other row and
this time we'll start with one column
one and again we go every other one
going down
step that's what that step two is
skipping every other one we're going to
set that equal to one so let's see what
that looks like and you can see here we
get our answer we get zero one one zero
zero but it has the ones going in
diagonals on every other diagonal and
zero on every other one
a little bit of a brain teaser that one
trying to get that one to work out so
you can see how you can arrange your
rows and here's your step in your
different axis on there
and then the next one is find the total
number and locations of missing values
in the array the first challenge is to
create some missing numbers so let's
create our array Z we're going to do
numpy dot random dot Rand 10 comma ten
and before we do the second part let me
just take the second part out
and let's just see what that looks like
so let's run that and there we go so we
have a 10 by 10 random array it randomly
is picking out numbers
and next we want to go ahead and take
our random integer size equals 5. and
then we're going to do a random random
10 size equals 5. so in the Z we're
going to select a number of random
spaces here and set them equal to null
value
now let's go ahead and run that so you
can see what that looks like and if we
look at the array
we've created one two
three four this should be a fifth one in
here my eyes may be filling me so we've
created a series of oh because zero zero
to five zero one two three four so we
have five there are different null
values in here and
this is kind of a neat notation to
notice that we can generate
random integers size equals five so this
generates five by five miniature grid
inside of this to tell it where to put
the nands at so that's kind of a cool
little thing you can do
and we want to look up and see how many
null values are in there
and this is simply just NP is Nan of Z
simple so if it is nand then we want to
sum it up so we're going to sum up all
of the different null values on there
now let's do one one more feature in
here which is really cool
let's go ahead and print the indexes so
NP argue where NP is
Nan of Z so we're going to create our
own another NP array and let's run this
and we'll see here that comes up with
the four indexes so we did Count four of
them up there
it tells you where they are one nine two
zero four six five four
and then let's go ahead and run this
again run run there we go this time I
got five let's get for random numbers
another fun one that I always like to do
it's very similar because we have NP is
nand z dot sum so we're summing the
number of nands and we can get the
indexes and you can reshape the indexes
which you can also just do we'll do an
inds where NP is Nan of Z
and let's just print let's print that
print inds let's see what that looks
like
and it's very similar we have we have
zero one three zero six three eight six
nine three but I've split it into two
different arrays
so we have our X and our y kind of
coordinates going there and what I can
now do is I can now do z i n d s
equals and at this point you can also
instead of getting the sum you can get
the means or the well the numbers and
that kind of thing you have or the
average as it is so be one thing you
could do and you could pick up the
average that's very common in data
science to get the average and just use
that for a value
but we'll go and just set it to zero and
then let's go ahead and print our Z and
run that and you can see we come down
here we have wherever there was a null
value it is now zero and you could set
this whatever you want this is another
way to replace data or help clean data
depending on what it is you're doing
so wow we covered a lot of stuff so
quick rehash going over everything we
went into there we looked at array
manipulation changing the shape
how to switch that around we even had
the flatten down there which remember we
have another command lower that's
similar we could change the order by F
remember F stands for Fortran very
strange connotation but there's C and F
C is the standard and F switches it to a
different order
to be honest I usually have to look it
up because I almost never use f but when
you need it you're like oh my gosh it
was the other order just do a quick
Google so we talked about reshape making
sure that the dimensions are the same
you don't want to have like something
that has 12 objects in it and reshape it
to
11 and 5 because it doesn't work it
doesn't divide into 12. we can transpose
we can switch them so we can go from a
four by three to a three by four Oops I
did that the other way around
three by four to four by three
we covered reshaping the array we did
the roll the axes you can do some weird
things with swapping and rolling axes
and transposing the numbers
we dug a little bit into the arithmetic
so we talked about adding we talked
about subtracting multiplying dividing
and you know at this point it's so
important we just look up the numpy
mathematics and you can see here they
have just about everything your
trigonometry
uh your hyperbolic functions rounding
sums products differences there are so
many all these different miscellaneous
mathematical connotations so you know
Google it go to the main numpy page and
look at the different setups you can do
on there so we covered that and we did
slicing I just break it apart we did
iterating over the array we covered
joining arrays and how to concatenate
remember concatenate just means add on
to it so in this case how are you adding
B onto a is how you'd read that from
Linux you should catch the concatenate
because that's used regularly there
splitting the array we talked about how
to split the array in different ways so
you can split it in an array of arrays
all kinds of different ways to split the
array up how to resize it and remember
resize does not have to have the same
shape but if you resize it it will take
the data and begin at the beginning and
add new rows on if the size is bigger if
it's smaller it truncates it it just
cuts the end off
we looked at how to do a histogram and
how to plot that
we mentioned bind buckets or bins as
they call them in pi plot and then we
covered a lot of other useful functions
in numpy we talked about the line space
setup for doing
um numbers in a series how to sum the
axes up again that's part of the
mathematical formulas there that we
looked at there's a sum there's also
means and median all of those you can
compute in numpy and you can also do the
square root and standard deviation
the Ravel function very similar to the
flat
to be honest I almost always just use
the flat but you know the Revel has its
own kind of functionality that it does
and then we went into some numpy
practice examples and we challenge you
to create a sine wave in numpy and how
to do that we're kind of looking for
that a range remember how we do the a
range and you can
have your beginning value your in value
which they did is three times pot number
pi and we're going to do intervals of
0.1 and then y just equals the numpy
sine of x there's our math from the math
page we were just looking at remember
that's right at the top
and finally we went down here we had
this kind of a little brain teaser how
to do diagonal zeros and Ones playing
with the different connotations of Z of
the numpy array
and then we did a random size and we
played a little bit with how to with the
null values playing with null values
if you're doing any data science you
know null values are like a headache
what do you do with them big sets of
data you get rid of them small sets of
data you have to factor something in
there like figure out the average or the
median there and then replace it with
that so with that we want to go ahead
and wrap this up and I want to thank you
