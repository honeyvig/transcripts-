my name is richard kirschner with the

what's in it for you and we're going to
go over what is numpy installing and
importing numpy numpy array numpy array
versus python list basics of numpy
finding size and shape of any array
range and arrange functions numpy string
functions and then in part two we'll
move on to cover axes array manipulation
and much more
so let's start with what is numpy numpy
is the core library for scientific and
numerical computing in python it
provides high performance
multi-dimensional array object and tools
for working with arrays and i'll go a
step further and say there are so many
other modules in python built on numpy
so the fundamentals of numpy are so
important to latch onto for the python
so you can understand the other modules
and what they're doing number's main
object is a multi-dimensional array it's
a table of elements usually numbers all
of the same type indexed by a tuple of
position integers in numpy dimensions
are called axes
take a one-dimensional array or we have
remember dimensions are also called axes
you can say this is the first axis
zero one two three four five and you can
see down here it has a shape of six why
because there's six different elements
in it in the one dimension array and
they usually denote that as six comma
with an empty node on there and then we
have a two dimensional array where you
can see zero one two three four five six
seven and in here we have two axes or
two dimensions and the shape is two four
so if you were looking at this as a
matrix or in other mathematical
functions you can see there's all kinds
of importance on shape we're not going
to cover shape today but we will cover
that in part two did you know that
numpy's array class is called nd array
for numpy data array now we're going to
take a detour here because we're working
in python and two of my favorite tools
in python is the jupiter notebook and
then i like to use that sitting on top
of anaconda and if you flip over to
jupiter.org that's j-u-p-y-t-e-r.o
you can go in here you can install it
off of here if you don't want to use the
anaconda notebook but this is the
jupiter setup the documentation on the
jupiter jupiter opens up in your web
browser that's what makes it so nice is
it's portable the files are saved on
your computer they do run in ipython or
iron python and you can create all kinds
of different environments in there which
i'll show you in just a minute i myself
like to use anaconda that's
www.anaconda.com
if you install anaconda it will install
the jupyter notebook with the anaconda
separate and you can install jupyter
notebook and it'll run completely
separate from anaconda's jupiter
notebook and you can see here i've now
opened up my anaconda navigator what i
like about the navigator and this is a
fresh install on a new computer which is
always nice i can launch my jupyter
notebook from in here i can bring other
tools so the anaconda does a lot more
and under environments i only have the
one environment and i can open up the
terminal specific to this environment
this one happens to have python37 in it
the most current version as of this
tutorial and then you open a terminal if
you're going to do your pip installs and
stuff like that for different modules
you can also create different
environments in here so maybe you need a
python36 python35 you can see we're
having a nice framework like anaconda
really helps so you don't have to check
track that on your own in the jupyter
notebook in your different jupiter
notebook setups we'll go ahead and
launch this jupyter notebook and then
i've set my browser window for a deep
fault of chrome so it's going to open up
in chrome and you can see here this
opens up a folder on my computer we have
a couple different options on here
remember i set the environment up as
python 3.7 you would install any
additional modules that aren't already
installed in your python on this and it
keeps them separate so you do have to
for each environment install the
separate modules so they match the
environment on there and in here we have
a couple things we can look up what's
running
you have your different clusters again
this is i just installed this on a new
machine so i just have the one a couple
things in here that were run on here
recently and what we go on here is we
then have on the upper right new and
from the pull down menu you'll see
python3
and this will open up a new window
and now we're in jupiter python so this
is a python window and we'll just do a
print
and this of course is so hello world
and we'll run that and it prints out
hello world in the command line there's
a couple special things you have to know
we're not going to do today which is on
graphics if you've never seen this
one of the things you can do you can
also do a equals hello world and if you
just put the a in there now if you do a
bunch of these where you have a equals
hello world b equals goodbye world and
you put a b a and return b it'll only
run the last one but you can see here if
you put the variable down here it will
show you what's in that variable
and that has to do with the jupiter
notebook inline coding so that's not
basic python that's just jupiter
notebook shorthand which you'll see in a
little bit
so back to our numpy numpy array versus
python list python list being the basic
list in your python why should we use
numpy array when we have python list
well first it's fast the numpy array has
been optimized over years and years by
multiple programmers and it's usually
very quick compared to the basic python
list setup it's convenient so it has a
lot of functionality in there there's
not in the basic python list and it also
uses less memory so it's optimized both
for speed and memory use
and let's go ahead and jump into our
jupiter notebook since we're coding best
way to learn coding is to code just like
the best way to learn how to write is
right and the best way to learn how to
cook is cook so let's do some coding
here today
and just like any modules we have to
import numpy we almost always import it
as np that is such a standard so you'll
see that very commonly we can just run
that and now we have access to our numpy
module inside our python and then the
most common thing of course is to go and
create a number array
and in here we can send it a regular
list
and so we'll go ahead and send this a
regular array let's do one two three to
make it simple and then i'm just going
to type in a and we'll run this
and so you can see down here the output
is an array of one two three
and we could also do
print
just a reminder that this is an inline
command so that wouldn't work if you're
using a different editor
you can see that it's an array one two
three but we'll go and leave it as a
kind of a nice feature so you can see
what you're doing really quick in the
jupyter notebook
and just like all your other standard
arrays i can go
a of 0. which is going to be a value of
1.
of course we do a of 1. you go all the
way through this
a of 1 has a value of 2 in it
so whether you're using the numpy array
or the basic python list that's going to
be the same that should all look pretty
familiar and it'd be pretty
straightforward remember the first value
is always zero
and when we set on there so let's take a
look why we're using numpy because we
went over the slide a little bit but
let's just take a look and see what that
actually looks like and what we want to
look at is the fact that it's fast
convenient and uses less memory so let's
take a glance at that in code and see
what that actually looks like when we're
writing it in python and what the
differences are
and to do this i'm going to go ahead and
import a couple other modules we're
going to import the time module so we
can time it and we're going to import
the system module so that we can take a
look at how much memory it uses and
we'll go and just run those so those are
imported
so we'll do b equals oh range of one
yeah one thousand is fine
and so that's going to create a list of
one thousand zero to nine hundred ninety
nine remember it starts at zero and it
stops right at the one thousand without
actually going to the one 1000
and let's go ahead and print
and we want system dot get size of
and we'll pick any integer because we
have you know zero to
a thousand we'll just throw one in there
five it doesn't matter because it's
gonna whatever integer we put in there
is going to generate the same value
because we're looking the size of how
how much memory it stores an integer in
and then we want to have the length of
the b that's how many integers are in
there
and if we go ahead and execute this and
run this in a line we'll see oops i did
that wrong comma
if we multiply them together
we'll see it generates 28 000 so that's
the size we're looking at is 28 000 i
believe that's bytes that sounds about
right
so let's go ahead and create this in
numpy
and we'll go with c equals np
and this is a range
so that's the numpy command to do the
same thing that we were just doing in a
list
and we'll also use the same value on
there the 1000
and then once we've created the
c
value of c for np dot a range let's go
ahead and print
and we can do that by doing c dot size
times
c dot
item size
that's very similar we did before we did
get the size of so the c size is the
size of the array and each item size
just reversed
so it's the size of an integer five item
size it's going to be the integers and c
size and let's just take a look and see
what that generates
and wow okay we got four thousand versus
twenty eight thousand
that's a significant difference in
memory how much memory we're using with
the array and then let's go ahead and
take a look at speed let's do um oh
let's do size
we tried this with lower values and it
would happen so fast that the npra kept
coming up with zero
because it just rounded it off so size
and let's create an l1
moles
range of size
and we'll do an l2
i'll just set up to the same thing it's
also range
of size on there there we go
and then we can do on a1
equals
np dot
a range size
and then let's do an a
two equals np dot
a range
we'll keep it the same size
and what we're going to do is we're
going to take these two different arrays
and we're going to perform some basic
functions on them
but let's go ahead and just load these
up now we'll go ahead and run this so
those are all set in memory
except for the typo here
quickly fix that
there we go so these are now all loaded
in here and let's do a start
equals
time dot time
so it's just going to look at my clock
time and see what time it is
and it will do result equals and let's
do
oh let's say we got
an array and we're going to say
let's do some addition here x
plus y
for x comma y in
and we'll zip it up here
two different arrays so here's our two
different arrays we're gonna multiply
each of the individual things on here l1
l2
there we go so that should add up each
value so l1 plus l2 each value in each
array
then we want to go ahead and print
and let's say
python list took
and then we'll do
time dot time
we'll just subtract the start out of
there so time whoops i messed up on some
of the quotation marks on there
okay there we go
time minus the start
and we'll convert that to second so
we'll go to this in milliseconds or
times one thousand
and let's hit the run on there it's kind
of fun because you also get a view while
we're doing this
of some ways to manipulate the script
and as you can see also my bed typing
there we go okay so we'll go ahead and
run this
and we can see here that the python list
took 34
actually i have to go back and look at
the conversion on there but you can see
it takes roughly 0.34 of a second and we
go ahead and print the result in here
too
let's do that
we'll run that just so you can see what
the what kind of data we're looking at
and we have the 0 two four six eight so
it's just adding them together it looks
pretty straightforward on there and if
we scroll down to the bottom of the
answer again we see python list took 46
a little different time on there
depending on what
core because i have this is on an eight
core computer so it just depends on what
core it's running on what else is
pulling on the computer at the time
and let's go back up here and do our
start time
paste that into here
and this time we're gonna do a result
equals and this is really cool notice
how
elegant this is so straightforward this
is a lot of reason people started using
numpy is because i can add the two
arrays together by simply going a1 plus
a2
it makes a lot of sense both looking at
it and it's just very
convenient remember that slide we're
looking at fast convenient and less
memory
so look how convenient that is
really easy to read real easy to see
and i don't know if we don't need to
print the result again so let's just go
ahead and print
the time on here and we'll borrow this
from the top part
because i really am a lazy typer
and this isn't the python list this is
the numpy list or number array
and let's go ahead and see how that
comes out
and uh we get 2.99
so let's take a look at these two
numbers 46 versus 2.99 so we'll just
round this up to 3. that's a huge
difference that's that's like
more than 10 times faster that's like 15
times roughly at a quick glance i'd have
to go do the math to look at it and it's
going to vary a little bit depending on
what's running in the background the
computer obviously so we've looked at
this and if we go back here we found out
it's much faster
yes there's different going to be
different speeds depending on what
you're doing with the array very
convenient easy to read and it uses less
memory so that's the core of the numpy
that's why a lot of people base so many
other modules on numpy and why it's so
widely used
so we did glance at a couple operations
when we were looking at speed and size
let's dive into
a little bit more into the basic
operations
and these are always nice to see i mean
certainly you want to go get a cheat
sheet if you're using it for the first
time you know look things up google is
your friend
we did this we're the most basic numpy
dot array or np dot array
and we'll go ahead and create an array
let's do
pairs one comma two
and then let's do three comma four and
if we're gonna do that let's do five
comma six
there we go and if we go ahead and take
this
and run this and go ahead and do our a
down here so it's in line and i'll print
that out
you can see it makes a nice array for us
so we have a and if you look at that we
have three different objects each with
two values in them and hopefully you're
starting to think well how many
dimensions or indexes is that and you'll
see three by two so let's go ahead and
take a look and let's go how about a dot
in dimensions speaking of which
we'll run that and we have two
dimensions for each object
and then we can do the item size so a
dot
we saw this earlier we looked up how
many items it was up here where we
wanted to multiply item size times the
actual size of the object so the memory
is being used versus the item size
and we should see
four there
memory is compressed down that's always
a good thing
and then the shape the shape is so
important when you're working with data
science and you're moving it from one
format to another
so we have our shape we just talked
about that we have three by two three
rows by two objects in each one
generally i don't look too much at the
size but the dimensions i'm always
looking up this is nice you can automate
it so you might be converting something
you might need to know how many
dimensions are going into the
next machine learning package so that
you can automatically just have it send
that information over
so we looked at a shape
let's go and create a slightly different
array np dot array let's go ahead and
just do as our original
setup here
and one of the features we can do which
is really important is we can do d type
equals in this case let's do
np
float
64. and so what we've done is converting
all of these into a float and we type in
a
and now instead of having one two three
four five six you see they're all float
values one dot zero there's no actual
zero in there just so it's a one dot or
the one period two three period four
period five period six period
and this again data science i don't know
how many times i've had to convert
something from an integer to a float so
that's going to work correctly in the
model i'm using
so very common features to be aware of
and to be able to get around and use and
we'll also do let's just curiosity
item size
we'll go and run that
and we see that it doubled in size so
it's not a huge increase well doubling
is always a big increase in computers
but it's not a huge increase compared to
what it would be if you're running this
in the python list format
and then we did the shape earlier
without having it set to the float 64.
let's go ahead and do a shape with it
set to 64. and it should be the same
three comma two so it all matches
so we've gone through and remember if
you really if this is all brand new to
you
according to the cambridge study at the
cambridge university if you're learning
a brand new word in a foreign language
the average person has to repeat it
163 times before it's memorized
so a lot of this you build off of it so
hopefully you don't have to repeat it
163 times but we did manage to repeat it
at least twice here if not a little bit
more
and let's go ahead and take this we're
going to look at one more setup on here
and let me just take this last statement
here on the converting our properties of
our data and instead of float 64
let's do complex let's just see what
that looks like and let's go and print
that out
and run it
and so we now have a complex data set up
and you'll see it's denoted by the one
dot plus zero dot j
and if we flip over here and do a basic
search for numpy data types
better to go to the original web page
but pull up a bunch of these you can see
there's a whole list of different numpy
data types
shorthand complex we have complex
complex 64 complex 128
complex number represented by 264-bit
floats real and imaginary components
one option on there float16 float32
float shorthand for float64 most
commonly used and of course all the
different ones that you can possibly put
into your numpy array so we covered a
basic addition up there we're comparing
how fast it runs but some very basic
components how to set up a numpy array
how many dimensions it has item size
data type item again we went to item
size and there's also
the
shape probably one of the more used i
use a shape all the time very commonly
used
and then down here you can see where we
actually created a numpy complex data
type
so let's look at some other features in
numpy one of them is you could do numpy
dot
zeros
and we're gonna do three comma four
there we go and we'll go ahead and run
this and you can see if i do np dot
zeros i create a numpy array of zeros
this is really important i was building
my own neural network and i needed to
create an array where i initialized the
weights and i want them all to be the
same weight in this case i wanted him to
start off as zero for the particular
project i was working on and there's
other options like you can do numpy ones
and we'll do the same thing three comma
four we'll run that
and you can see i've created an array of
numpy ones in this case it comes out as
a float array
and this is an interesting to note
because we have let's go back to our
python and do lrange five
and we'll print the l so there's our
list
and if i run that
it doesn't create the range until after
the fact until you actually execute it
that's an upgrade in python python27
actually created the array zero one two
three four this one actually creates the
script and then once it's used it then
actually generates the array
and if we do that in numpy a range
remember that from before
and if we do numpy a range five
and let's do uh l equals
or we can just leave it as numpy that's
fine there we go just run that
you can see there we actually get an
array 0 1 2 3 4 for the value the numpy
arrange a range 5 generates the actual
array
and for part one we're going to do just
one more section on basic
setup
and we're going to concatenation
do a concatenation out example
there we go we're gonna do strings let's
take a look at uh strings what's going
on with there
and let's do
oh let's see print
let's do an np
character something new here
and we're going to add
and then here's our brackets for what
we're going to add
oh and let's say
let's do
hello
comma hi
and
in the brackets on there let's create
another one
and this one's going to be
a b c
and we'll do
x y z so we're just creating some
randomly making some up on here and then
we'll go ahead and just print this
if we run that and come down here
and of course make sure all your
brackets are open and closed correctly
and then
you can see in here when we concatenate
the example in numpy
it takes the two different arrays that
we set up in there and it combines the
hello with the abc and the hi with xyz
and if we can also do something like
print
oh let's do
np character dot
multiply
so there's a lot of different functions
in here again you can look these up it's
probably good to look them all up and
see what they are but it's good to also
just see them in action let's do hello
space comma three
and we'll run this one
and run that without the error you'll
see it does hello hello hello so we
multiplied it by 3. and we can also
let's just take this whole thing here
instead of retyping it
and we can do character
center so instead of multiply let's do
center
and over here
keep our hello going
take the space out of there
and let's do center at 20
and fill
character
equals and we'll fill it with dashes
so if we run this
you can see it prints out the hello with
dashes on each side
and we keep going
with that we can also in addition to
doing the fill function we can play with
capitalize we can title we can do
lowercase we can do uppercase we can
split split line strip join these are
all the most common ones and let's go
ahead and just look at those and see
what those look like each one of them
here we're going to do the hello world
all-time favorite of mine i would like
to say hello universe and you can see
here we did a capital h with the world
but so we want to capitalize so
capitalize is the first one in the array
so we get hello world on there and we
can also take this
and instead of capitalizing
another feature in here is title and
let's just change this to how are we
doing
how
are you doing instead of
do you
let's run that
and you can see here because we created
as a title it capitalizes the first
letter in each word
and in this one we're going to do
character lower
two different examples here we have an
array we have hello world all
capitalized and we have just hello and
you can see that one is an array and one
is just a string if we run that
you get a an array with hello world
lowercase and hello lowercase
and if we're going to do it that way we
can also do it the opposite way there's
also
upper and let's paste those in there and
you can see here we have character.upper
opposite there python.data and that will
do python is easy
hopefully you're starting to get the
picture that most of the python and the
scripting is very simple
it's when you put the bigger picture
together and starts building these
puzzles and somebody asks you hey i need
the first letter capitalized unless it's
the title and then we have you start
realizing that this can get really
complicated so numpy just makes it
simple and we like that
and so in this case we did python data
it's all uppercase python is easy like
shouting in your messenger python is
easy and then if you're ever processing
text and tokenizing it
a lot of times the first thing you do is
we just split the text and we're just
going to run this in p dot character dot
split are you coming to the party if we
do that returns an array of each of the
individual words are you coming to the
party splitting it by the spaces
and then if we're going to split it by
spaces we also need to know how to split
it by lines
and just like we have the basic split
command we also have split lines
hello and you'll see here the scoop in
for our new line
and when we run that if you're following
the split part with the words you should
see hello how are you doing the two
different lines are now split apart
and let's just review three more before
we wrap this up commonly used string
variable manipulations we have strip and
in this case we have
nina admin anita and we're going to
strip a off of there let's see what that
looks like
and then you end up with nin diminished
it basically takes up all leading and
trailing letters in this case we're
looking for a
more common would be a space in there
but it might also be punctuation or
anything like that that you need to
remove from your letters and words
and if we're going to strip and clean
data we also need to be able to reformat
it or join it together so you see here
we have a character join we'll go ahead
and run this
and it has on the first one it splits
these letters up by the colon and the
second one by the dash and you can see
how this is really useful if you're
processing in this case a date we have
day month year year month date very
common things to have to always switch
around and manipulate depending on what
they're going into what you're working
with
and finally let's look at one last
character string we're going to do
replace
if you're doing misinformation this is
good pulling news articles replacing
is and what in this case we're just
doing here's a good dancer and we're
gonna replace is with was
and you can see here he was a good
dancer hopefully that's not because he
had a bad fall he just was from like you
know 1920s and has gotten old
so there we go we covered a lot of the
basics in numpy as far as creating an
array very important stuff here when
you're feeding it in how do we know the
shape of it the size of it what happens
when we convert it from a regular
integer into a float value as far as how
much space it takes we saw that that
doubled it item size you have your in
dimensions and probably the most used is
shape and we'll cover more on shape in
part two so make sure you join us on
part two there's a lot of important
things on shaping in there and setting
them up we also saw that you can create
a
zeros based array you can create one
with ones if we do a range you can see
how it is a lot easier to use to create
its own range or a range as it is in
numpy
you saw how easy it was to add two
arrays we saw that earlier just plus
sign then we got into
doing strings and working with strings
and how to concatenate so if you have
two different arrays of strings you can
bring them together we also saw how you
can fill so you can add a nice headline
dash dash dash
we saw about capitalize the first letter
we saw about turning it into a title so
all the first letters are capitalized
doing lowercase on all the letters upper
for all the letters just lower and upper
nice abbreviation we also covered how to
split the character set how to strip it
so if you want to strip all the a's out
from leading ai a's and ending a's or
spaces you can do that very easily also
how to join the data sets so here's a
character join option for your strings
and finally we did the character replace
now let's go ahead and dive in there
since we're going right into part two
which is getting some coding going under
our belt
and here in our jupiter notebook we can
go under new and create a new folder
python3
i think i forgot to do this last time we
could just do the
control plus plus which in any browser
enlarges the page makes it a lot easier
to see always a nice feature another
beautiful benefit of using jupiter
notebook
and let me go ahead and show you a neat
thing we can do in jupiter this is nice
if you're working with people and you're
doing this as a demo on a large screen
i'm going to do the hashtag or pound
symbol array manipulation kind of a
title that we're working on and then i'm
going to call this cell cell type
markdown as opposed to code and you'll
see it highlights it here and then if i
run it it just turns it into array
manipulation and then we're specifically
going to be working on array
manipulation changing shape to start
with
and we'll go ahead and mark this cell
also a markdown so has a nice little
look there and then it comes up and you
can see it just like i said it just
highlights it and makes it very in bold
print just making it easier to read not
a python thing but a jupiter thing
that's good to know about especially if
you're working with the shareholders
since they're investing money in you
of course the first thing you want to do
is import we're going to import numpy
as in p that should be standard by now
by now you you start a python program
you're doing some data science numpy is
just something you bring in there and
let's go ahead and create our array and
we're going to do that as the np
dot a range remember that's a 0 what
we're going to do 0 to 9
and then
print
a little title on the original array
we'll just print that array a remember
from the first lesson so we have our
array which is 0 1 2 3 4 five six seven
eight
and let's add a print space in between
let's create a second array b but we
want this to reshape array a
and what does that mean
and the command is simply reshape and
then we have nine items in here and this
is so important right now so be very
aware if i did some weird numbers in
here it's not going to work
and we want multiples of 9 we know that
3 times 3 is 9.
so we're going to reshape
our a array by 3x3 and then we're going
to print well let's give it a title
oops i have too many brackets in there
modified array and then let's go ahead
and print
our b and let's see what that looks like
and as we come down here you can see
we've taken this and it's gone from
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 to an array
of arrays and we have 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.
and so we split this into three by three
and you can guess that if i tried to
reshape this let's just do a five by
three which is fifteen
that's going to give me an error so it's
not going to work you're not gonna be
able to reshape something unless the
shape all the the data in there matches
correctly
so we can take this nine this flat nine
and they call it flex it's just a single
array and we can reshape it into a three
by three array and first you might think
matrixes which this is used for that
definitely i use it a lot in graphing
because they'll come in that i have an
array that's x y comma x y 1 y 1 comma x
2 y 2 and so the shape of it might be 2
by the length of the number of points
and i need to separate that into a x
flat array and a y flat array you can
see this can be very easy to reshape the
array doing that and we can of course go
back we can do b
do a print and we'll do b dot
latin remember i said it's called a
flatten array
and if we run that you'll see it just
goes back to the original one it takes
this 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and flattens it
back to a single array
and then one other feature to be aware
of is if we flatten it one of the
commands we can put in there is order
let me just go ahead and do that order
equals
f
strangely enough f stands for fortran
the whole fortran days i remember
actually studying fortran programming
language
in this case you'll see that it uses the
first like 036
as the order so instead of flattening it
like we had before zero one two three
four five six seven eight it now does
zero three six one four seven two five
eight
and if you go to the numpy array page
you can see here that they have the
flatten i just open up the numpy and d
array flattened setup to look it up and
they have three different options they
have c
f and a
and it's whether to flatten in c which
was based on how the c code works for
flattening originally worked which is
row major
fortran which is column major or
preserve the column fortran ordering
from a so whatever it was in the default
is the
c version so the default that you saw
you could put orders equal c and you'd
have the same effect as we saw there
before you could even do order equals a
that would also have the same effect
because that's the default so really the
only other thing you really need to
change on here is to change it to c if
you need it
and you can see right here or f i mean
not c the only thing you really want to
change it to is to your f for the
fortron order which then does it by
column versus by row and let's look at
here we go
reshape
so let's create a range of 12
and let's reshape it
i will do 4 comma 3 for this one and
remember this is numpy i forgot the np
there
in p dot arrange
and we can type in just a for print or
you can do full print a and of course
the jupiter notebook even have a little
extra print at the beginning we run this
we'll see we create a nice array of zero
one two it's reshaped it so we have
four rows and three columns or you can
call that three columns and four rows
zero one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven
but this one is so important we'll do np
transpose
a let's go ahead and run that
and it helps if i get all the s's in
there don't leave an s out and you'll
see here we've taken our array if you
remember correctly we had 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11
and we've swapped it so we've gone from
a three by four or a four by three to a
three by four
and this really helps if you're looking
at like a huge number of rows and the
data all comes in like let's say this is
your features in row one your features
in row two
and this is x y z well when you go to
plot it you send it all of x in one
array all the y and not one array and
all z in another array
and so it's really important that we can
transpose this rather quickly
this is kind of a fun thing i can
highlight it
and do brackets around it and if you
remember correctly
because we're in jupiter it doesn't
matter where we do the print or not
it'll automatically print it for us and
you see if i hit the run button it comes
up with the same exact thing
and let's play with the reshape and you
know let's zoom this up a little bit
here
make that even bigger so you can really
see what's going on and let's play with
the reshape just a little bit more we'll
do b equals
np dot a range let's do 8
and reshape
we'll do 2 comma 4.
let's go ahead and print
b and then run that
and you'll see we have now the two rows
this is a bit more like so we have four
maybe two rows of four things so this
might be all of our x components and our
y components so we can switch it back
and forth real easy
important to know here whether we do 2
comma 4 or in the case of 4 comma 3
this has 12 elements and so however you
split it up it's got to equal 12.
so 4 times 3 equals 12 that's pretty
straightforward same thing down here
2 times 4 equals 8.
if i change this and let's say i do 2
comma 3 let's just run that in and
you'll find we get an error because
you can't split 8 up into two rows by
three
you have to pick something that it can
split up and arrange it in so let's go
ahead and run that and just for fun
let's go
reshape our b again if i can type
reshape our b again and what else goes
into eight well we could do two by two
by two
so we can take this out to three
different dimensions
and then of course if we um because this
is going to come out you you as a
variable we can just go ahead and run it
and it'll print it we can also do a
print statement on there just like we
did before and you'll see we have two
different groups of two variables of two
different dimensions
so two by two by two
and let's go ahead and assign this to a
variable c equals b reshape
and let's do something a little
different
let's roll the axes roll
axes
and we'll take our c
and do 2 comma one
and if we go ahead and run this it's
going to print that out oops
hit a wrong button there let's do that
one again and you roll the axis and you
can see that we now have a set of zero
one two three four five six seven we now
have the zero two one three four six
five seven
so what's going on here we're taking and
we're rolling the numbers around and
let's just simplify this we'll just do
it with c comma one and run that and so
if we roll a single axes you got 0 1
and then it rolled the 4 5
up and then we have 2 3 6 7 and if we do
2
let me see what happens there this is
one of those things you really have to
play with and start filling what it's
doing we've now taken 0 2 4 6 1 3 5 7 so
you can see we've now rolled by two
digits instead of rolling the one set up
we now rolled two digits up there and so
if we go back and we do the one
so we've rolled it up zero one four five
and then we're gonna take the two in
there and we've rolled the zero one two
three four five and six seven
so we start rolling these things around
on here there's a lot of different
things you can do on this
but it's another way to manipulate the
numbers on your numpy
and finally let's go ahead and swap
axes
we'll do c
and let's just go ahead and run that
it's going to give me an error on there
that's because it requires multiple
arguments left out the arguments so now
we can swap and we get the zero two one
three four six five seven so you can see
everything's been swapped around
so next thing we want to go over is we
want to go over numpy
arithmetic operations
how can we take these and use these let
me just go ahead and put this cell as a
markdown there we go
we'll run that so it has a nice thing
all right nice title on there that's
always helpful
and let's start by creating two arrays
we'll do uh a as an ep np
range a range nine and let's reshape
this
three by three so by now you should be
saying this reshape stuff this should
all look pretty familiar we have our
zero one two three four five six seven
eight on there and let's create a second
one b
and this time instead of doing a range
let's do np array we'll just create a
straight up array
and we'll do an array of three objects
so it's going to be
three by one and if we go ahead and
print a b out let me run that this is
actually pretty common to have something
like this where you have a
three by whatever it is in a three
by three array when you're doing your
math you kind of have that kind of set
up on there
and what we can do is we can go um
np dot add
a b
don't forget we can always put a print
statement on there
so if we add it you'll see that it just
comes in there and it goes okay we're
adding 10 to everything and we could
actually do something more
i'll make it more interesting 11 10 11
12. so let's change b's now 10 11 12 and
let's run that
and you can see that we have
10 and then you had 1 plus 11 is 12
2 plus 12 is 14
13 so 10 plus 3 is 13 11 plus 4 is 15
and 12 plus 5 is 17 and so on
we'll put this back since that's how the
original setup was let's do 10 by 10 by
10
and run that and run that and get the
original answer and if you're going to
add them together we need to go ahead
and subtract
a b
and we run that
we get minus 10 minus 9 minus 8 just
like you would expect
so we have our subtraction 0 minus 10 is
minus 10 and so on and if you're going
to add and subtract you can guess what
the next one is we're going to multiply
and we'll multiply
a b
and this should be pretty
straightforward you should expect this
if we multiply 10 times 0 we got 0 10
times 10 is 10 and so on
and finally if you're going to multiply
what's the last one we got is divide
what happens we do divide a by b
and we run this
and we're going to get 0 and this is
0 divided by 10 is 0. 1 divided by 10 is
0.1 2 divided by 10 is 0.2 and so on and
so on
so the math is pretty straightforward it
just makes it very easy to do the whole
set up and again if we went this and
let's say i'll just change this up up
here instead of 10
we do a
hundred and
make this a thousand there we go
if we run that and then we do the add
you can see we got ten
plus a hundred plus a thousand
same thing with the subtract
same thing with the multiply
then you can also see the same thing
here with the divide so a lot of control
there with your array and your math
again let's set this back to 10. oops
it's right up here wrong section
there we go 10. we'll just go ahead and
run these
and get back to where we were
and this brings us to our next section
which is slicing and let's put in our
just make this a cell
cell type markdown and when we run that
of course it gives us a nice looking
slicing there and slicing means we're
just going to take sections of the array
so let's create an array in p a range
let's just do
20. and if you remember if we do a
we have a 0 to 19.
and then we can do a and remember you
can always print these this can always
be put in a print but because i'm in
jupiter if you're doing a demo in
jupiter that is it's just so great that
you have all these controls on here so
we can slice four
on and this should look familiar because
this is the same as a python and a lot
of other different scripting languages
if we do four go zero one two three it's
the first four in the thing and the skip
sum and starts with this one the first
four skip then from there on
you can also do the opposite
and go till the fourth one if we run
that we get zero one 3 quite the
opposite on there we can do a single
item so we can pick object number 5 on
the list run that and 5 happens to be 5
because that's the order they're in and
then this one's interesting so i can do
s equals slice
and let's create a slice here
and let's do 2 comma 9 comma
let's leave a 2 on there so we'll create
an s slice on here and then if we take
our array and we do array of s we're
taking our slice in there and let's go
ahead and run that
and let's take a look and see what it
generated here first off we started with
two so we have two at the beginning
we're going to end at nine which happens
to be eight so it stops before the nine
remember when we're doing arrays in
python and then we step two so two four
six eight we could do this as three let
me run that and you can see how the
changes to five eight
and we could do this as let's leave this
at 3 and if we change this to 10
oops let's make it 12. there we go
when we run that we have 2 5 8 11. so
that's pretty straightforward it's a
very nice feature to have on here we can
slice it and take different parts of the
series right out of the middle so now
that we've accessed the different pieces
of our array
let's get into iterating iteration and
this is interesting because
my sister who runs a college data
science
division the first question she asks
is
how do you go through data and she's
asking can you do you know how to
iterate through data do you know how to
do a basic for loop you know how to go
through each piece of the data and in
numpy they have some cool controls for
that this thing is a mark down there we
go and run it
and it's called the nd iter i'm not sure
what the nd stands for but ndeiter for
iterator
so before we do that though let's create
an array or something we can actually
iterate through
we'll call it a equals np
a range
let's do something a little funny here
or funky
and we'll do 0 45
5. i'm not sure
why the guys in the back picked this
particular one it's kind of a fun one
and if i run that we do this you can see
we get 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40. that's
what this array looks like
and that's just from our slice you could
this is just a slice that's all that is
is we created a slice of 0 45 0 to 45
step 5. and so we can do with this we
can also do a equals the shape let's go
ahead and take and reshape this
and since there's nine variables in
there we'll do a reshape it three by
three so if we run that
whoops missed something there that is
the a
that really helps
so if we do the a reshape
and we'll go ahead and print that out we
get 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40.
and then we simply do four x in
our numpy and d enter of a
colon and we'll just go ahead and print
x
and let's see what happens here when we
run through this and we print each one
of those
it goes all the way through the whole
array so it's the same thing we just saw
before we got 0 5 10
15 20 25 30 35 40. so it prints out each
object in the array so you can go
through and view each one of these
and certainly if you remember you could
also flatten the array and just do for
a and that also and get the same result
there's a lot of ways to do this but
this is the proper way with the nd
iterator because it'll
minimize the amount of resources needed
to go through each of the different
objects in the numpy array
and hopefully you asked this question i
just did that
and the question is how can i change
this instead of doing each object
so first of all let's go ahead and take
my cell type and we mark that down run
it and so we're going to work on
iteration order c style and f style
remember c because it came from the c
programming and f because it came from
the old fortran programming so let's
give us a reminder i will do a print
a and we'll do 4 x in
np iterate
a
but we also want to do this in a
specific order and you know what i'm a
really lazy typer so let's go back up
here
this is the in d iterator i knew i was
missing the nd part of a
let's do order
equals
c
we'll print x on there and let's do that
again and this time order
order equals
f
there we go order equals f let's go
ahead and run this
and see what happens here and the first
thing you're going to notice our
original array 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40.
when we do order c that's the default
0 5 10 15 20 and so on and then when you
come down here
you'll see f order f is 0 15 30. so it
takes the first digit of each
on the sub arrays or the second
dimension and then it goes into the
second one 5 20 35 10 25 40. so slightly
different order for iterating through it
if you need to do that so we've covered
reshaping we've covered math we've
covered iteration
we've covered a number of things the
next section we want to go ahead and go
over
it's going to be joining arrays so we
need to bring them together let me go
ahead and take the cell and make it a
markdown
cell type markdown there we go and run
that so let's work on joining arrays so
we can bring them together and what
different options we have
and let's do uh we'll do an np array one
two
comma three four
we'll go ahead and print
let's do
oops
first
these rays aren't that big so let's just
go ahead and keep it all on one line a
so if we run this first array one two
three four oops i forgot that it
automatically wraps it when you do it
this way so we'll go ahead and keep it
separate
and print
a there we go
and let's go ahead and do a b
and we'll do 5 6 7 8 and notice i'm
keeping the same shape on these two
arrays
depending on what you're doing those
shapes have to match
let's go ahead and print
second array
do a print
b
we'll go ahead and run that oops
missed something up there let me fix
that real quick
when i was reformatting it to go on
separate lines i messed that up there we
go run all right so we have first array
one two three four second array five six
seven eight
and we'll put a carriage return on there
and the keyword we use is concatenate
and if you're familiar with linux it
usually means you're adding it to the
end on there and we're going to do what
they call a long axis zero
so we have concatenate a b along axis
zero let's go ahead and run that and see
what that looks like so we have one two
three four five six seven eight so now
we have an array that is four by two has
a nice shape of four by two one here
and if we're going to do it along the
axis zero
you should guess what the next one is
we're going to do it along the one axis
and let's see how those differ from each
other let's just go ahead and run that
and again all we're doing is adding in
the axis equals 1. so we have our
concatenate we have a b and then axes
one remember a couple things one these
are the same shape so we have a two by
two
same dimensions going in there you're
going to get an error if you're
concatenating and they're not if you
have something that instead of one two
is one two three four five six with a
five six seven eight they'll give you an
error on there in fact let's take a look
and see what happens when we do that let
me just take this
one two three
three four five let's run that and if we
come down here oh we got there it says
all the input ray dimensions except for
the concatenation axes m must match
exactly
so it'll let you know if you mess up
that's always a good thing let's go
ahead and take this back here and let's
go ahead and run that
and so we have our zero axes which is
one two three four five six seven eight
we bring them together
and you'll see a very different set up
here when we do it along the axis one we
end up with instead of
four by two we end up with a two by four
one two five six three four seven eight
and that's just changing which axes
we're going to go ahead and concatenate
on what i find is when you're talking
about the concatenate or the
joining arrays you really got to play
with these for a while to make sure you
understand what you mean by the axes
it looks very intuitive when you're
looking at it actually 0
1 2 three four five six seven eight axes
one is then splitting in a different way
one two five six three four seven eight
when you're actually using real data you
start to really get a feel for what this
means and what this does
so if we're gonna do that let's go ahead
and look at splitting the array
and do that on the markdown and run it
there we go so we have a nice little
title there
and we'll go ahead and create an array
of nine
let's do np split
we'll do a and we're going to split it
by three
let's just see what that looks like so
if we split it we get an array zero one
two three four five we get three
separate arrays on here and remember
we're looking at let me just print a up
here
so we're looking at zero one two three
four five six seven eight and then we
can split it into three separate arrays
and let's take this we're gonna do this
right down here just move the a split
down here
instead of the three let's do four comma
five and put that in brackets
and so we do it this way we have zero
one two three
four five six seven eight and that's
kind of interesting i wasn't sure what
to expect on that but we get when you
split it a by four comma five you get a
totally different setup on here as far
as the way it splits the array
and to understand how this works i'm
going to change the five to a seven
and this will visually make this a
little bit more clear
so we had four and five it went zero one
two three four five six seven eight and
you see the markers four and five when
we do four and seven i get zero one two
three four five six
seven eight
and so what you're looking at here is
the first markers this is going to go to
four
so there's our first split at the four
the marker of four and then the second
split is going to be at position seven
and this is the same thing here
four position five that's why we're
splitting it in those two sections we
could also do it
let's just see what that looks like run
and you can see i now have zero one two
three four five six seven eight
so we can split in all kinds of
different ways and create a different
set of
multiple arrays on here and split it all
kinds of different ways and before we
get into the graphs and other
miscellaneous stuff
let's go ahead and look at
resizing the array i'm going to take the
cell and set the cells a mark down and
run it
give us a nice title there and we'll do
an array uh an input array of one two
three and four five six here i'm just
gonna just print
let's go print
a dot shape and we'll go ahead and run
that whoops hit a wrong button there
hit the comma instead of the dot so we
have a shape of 2 comma 3 here
and this is important to note because we
start resizing it it's going to mess
with different aspects of the shape
and so we'll go ahead and do a print
scoop in for a blank line there we go
let's do b equals
np dot resize
we're going to resize a
and let's resize it with
3x2
and then we'll just go ahead and
print
b
and print
b period shape not a comma
i'll run that
oops forgot the quotation marks around
the end we'll go ahead and run that and
let's just see what that looks like so
we have
one two three four five six our original
array with a shape of two three
and then we want to go ahead and resize
it by three two and we end up with one
two three four five six and we end up
with the shape of 3 2. that shouldn't be
too much of a surprise
you know we got 6 elements in there we
can resize it by 2 3 was the original
one and then we're actually just
reshaping is how that kind of comes out
as when you resize it like that
but what happens if we do something a
little different
and let's go ahead and just take this
whole thing and copy it down here so we
can see what that looks like
and instead of doing 3 2 remember last
time i did the to reshape it
i messed with the numbers and it gave me
an error when you resize it you don't
have to match the numbers they don't
have to be the same dimensions so we can
instead of going from a 2 3 to a 3 2 we
can resize it to a 3 3. so let's take a
look and see how it handles that and we
come down here to 3 3 we end up with 1 2
3 4 5 6 and it repeats 1 2 3.
so it actually takes the data and just
adds a whole other block in there based
on the original data and repeating it
all right now at this point you know
we've been looking at tons of numbers
and moving stuff around
we want to go ahead and do is get a
little visual here because that
certainly you can picture all the
different
numbers on there but let's look at
histogram let's put this into a
histogram let me go ahead and run that
and to do that we're going to use the
matte plot library so from map plot
library we're going to import pi plot as
plt
and that's usually the notation you see
for pi plot
so if you ever see plt in a code it's
probably pi plot in the matplot library
and then the guys in the back did a nice
job and gals too guys and gals back
there
our team over at simply learn put
together a nice array for me 20 87 4 40
53 with a bunch of numbers that way we
had something to play with
and what we want to do is we wanted to
plot
the histogram now remember a histogram
says how many times
different numbers come in and then we're
going to put them in bins and we have
been 0 to 20 to 40 to 60 to 80 to 100.
you might in here with the matplot
library they call them bins you might
heard the term buckets or they put them
in buckets that's a really common term
and then we want to give it a title so
the way it works is you do your plt.hist
for histogram your plt title and your
plt show and we're doing just a single
array in here in the lumpy array of a
and let's go ahead and run this piece of
code
taking a moment to come out there says
figure size so it's generating the graph
and you can see we have and let's just
take a look at this and go down a size
there we go okay so now we can see we're
taking a look at here
so between 0 and 20
we have three values so we have a 20
here we have a 4
and a 11 and a 15
one two three it's actually four values
but they start at zeros remember we
always count from zero up
and from twenty to forty we got twenty
this is one forty two
three
four
five six
and so you can see in the histogram it
shows that the most common numbers
coming up
is going to be between the 40 and 60
range least common between the 80 and
100 this looks like a age demographics
is what this looks like to me and you
can see where they would have put it in
the buckets of different age groups
which would be a nice way of looking at
this
histograms are so important so powerful
when you're doing
demos and explaining your data so being
able to quickly put a histogram up that
shows
what's common and how it's trending is
really important
and using that with a numpy
is really easy
and you know what let's take the same
data and i want to show you why we do
bins or why we have buckets of data i'm
used to calling it buckets why we have
bins let's do it instead of by 20 let's
do it by tens and see what happens
and what happens when you do it by tens
is you miss out on the you can see a
nice curve here on the first one
and on the second one it looks like a
ladder going up and a plummet a ladder
going up and a plummet and a ladder
going down
so the first would be more indicative of
an age group and the second one would be
what you would get if you divide it
incorrectly you wouldn't see the natural
trend of
i don't know what this would be maybe
how much food they eat hopefully not
because i'm in 50 so i'm right in the
middle there that which means i get a
ton of food compared to everybody else
but it's some kind of democrat maybe
it's mental maybe it's knowledge because
we we hit a certain point and we start
losing our marbles start leaking out or
something so you start off knowing
something and then as you get older you
grow more but you can see here we lose
that you lose that continuity in the
thing if you split the histogram into
too many bins or too many buckets
and if you actually plotted this by the
individual numbers it would just be a
bunch of dots
on the graph it wouldn't mean a whole
lot
and we've looked at graphs there are
terms that are a ton of useful functions
in numpy
i'm sure there's even new ones that are
going to be in here but let's just cover
some important ones you really need to
know about if you're using the numpy
framework
one of them is line space function this
is generating data so we have a line
space we have 1 3 10 and when we do that
we end up with
ten numbers so if you count them there's
ten numbers they're between one and
three and they're evenly spaced we get
one one point two two two but these are
all there's a total of ten here and it's
right between the one and three range
that can be there's a lot of uses for
that but they're probably more obscure
than a lot of the other common numpy
arrays set up
a real common one is to do summation so
we'll do summation
where you do in this case we create a
numpy array of one of
two different arrays one two three or
two different dimensions one two three
three four five
and we're going to sum them up under
axes zero which is your columns
and if you remember correctly columns is
the one plus three two plus four three
plus five so we have three columns
and if we change this we'll just flip
this to one
we get two numbers so we get one two
three all added together which equals
six and three plus four plus 5 which
equals 12. we'll set this back to 0.
there we go since this is we're looking
to actually zero
and these probably could have been some
of these compared with our math section
square root and standard deviation two
very important
tools we use throughout the machine
learning process
in data science
and simply we take the np array we have
again the one two three four five six
three four five i don't know why i need
to keep recreating it probably could
just kept it but we can take the square
root of a so it goes through and it
takes the square root of all the
different terms in a
and we can also take the standard
deviation how much they deviate in value
on there and there's a rabble function
we can run that
and in p array is x we're going to do x
equals hey we changed it from a to x
x equals
ravel and this sets it up as columns so
we have one two three four five this is
all columns on here very similar to the
flattened function
so they kind of look almost identical
but we also have the option of doing a
ravel by column
and then another one is log so you can
do mathematical log on your array in
this case we have 1 2 3
and we'll find the
log base 10 for each of those three
numbers
there's a couple of them they don't you
can't just do any number here after log
but there is also log base 2.
log base 10 is pretty commonly used on
here
run that there we go
before we go let's have a little fun
let's do a little practice session here
on some more challenging questions so
you start to think how this stuff fits
together right now we just looked at all
the basics and all the basic tools you
have
so let's do some numpy practice examples
and let's start by figuring out how do
you plot say a sine wave in numpy how
what would that look like and so in this
project we wouldn't have to do this
because i've already run these but we
want to go ahead and import our numpy as
np and import our matplot library
pipeline as plt so we get our tools
going here and then we'll break it into
two sections because we need our x y
coordinates in here
so first off let's create our x
coordinates
and our x coordinates we're going to set
to an a range
and we want this error a range since
we're doing sine and cosine it's going
to be between 0 and 0.1
and then we use our np and we actually
can look up numpy stores pi so you have
the option just pulling pi in there
directly from numpy it has a few other
variables that it stores in there that
you can pull from there but we have
numpy pi and we generate a nice range
here and let's go ahead and run this
and just out of curiosity let's see what
x looks like
i always like to do that so we have
point two point three point four so
we're going uh zero to
in this case nine point four three times
numpy pi
pi is like three point something
something something that makes sense it
should be about nine and we're doing
intervals of 0.1 so we create a nice
range of data and then we need to create
our y variable and so y
is going to simply equal np our
numpy.sine
of x
and then once we have our x and y
and if we print let's go and just print
y
see how that will do this let's do this
so it looks print
x print y
so we basically have two arrays of data
so we have like our x-axis and our
y-axis going on there
and this is simply a plt dot plot
because we're going to plot the points
and we'll do x comma y
and then we want to actually see the
graph so we'll do plot dot show
and we'll go ahead and run that
and you see we get a nice sine wave and
here's our number zero through nine
and here's our sine value which
oscillates between minus one and one
like we'd expect it to
then for the next challenge
let's create a six by six two
dimensional array and let one and zero
be placed alternatively across the
diagonals
oh that's a little confusing so let's
think about that we're going to create a
six by six
two dimensional so the shape is six by
six two dimensional array
and let one and zero be placed
alternatively across the diagonals
now if you remember from lesson one we
can fill a whole numpy array with zeros
or ones or whatever so we're going to do
np or create a numpy zeros and we're
gonna do a six by six and we'll go ahead
and make sure it knows it's an integer
even though it's usually the default and
just real quick let's take a look and
see what that looks like so if i run
this you can see i get
six by six grid so six by six zero zero
zero zero zero
now if i understand this correctly when
they say ones and zero placed
alternatively across the diagonals
they want the center diagonal maybe
that's going to stay zero all the way
down and then the next diagonal will be
ones
all the way across diagonally and then
the next one zeros the next one ones the
next one zeros and so on hopefully you
can see my mouse lit up there and
highlighting it
so let's take a little piece of code
here
and we'll do z
one colon colon two comma colon colon
two
equals one and wow that's a mouthful
right there so let's go ahead and run
this and see what that's doing and so
what we're doing is we're saying hey
let's look at in this case row one
there's one and then we're going to go
every other row two so we're going to
skip a row so skip here skip here skip
here so we're going down
this way and we're going every other row
going this way it's hard to highlight
columns
so you can see right here where the that
we're not touching each row like this
row right here is not being touched okay
so we're going to start with row one and
then we're going to skip a row and
another one and so we're going every two
rows and then in every two rows we're
looking at every two
starting with the beginning that's what
this thing blank means so we're going to
start with the beginning and we're going
to look at all of them but we're going
to skip every two
so starting with row one
we look at all the rows but we do we do
it by two steps so we go one skip one
you know one skip one one skip one one
if you left this out it'd do every one
this would just be once in fact let's
see what this looks like if i go like
this
and run it
you can see that i guess get ones
so
this notation allows us to go down
each row row by row and we're going to
do every other row
set up on there and so if we're going to
start with row one we also
ctrl z
try that there we go we'll start with
row zero again we're going to go each
row step two so we'll start with row
zero
and we'll go every other row
and this time we'll start with one
column one
and again we go every other one going
down
step that's what that step two is and
skipping every other one we're gonna set
that equal to one so let's see what that
looks like
and you can see here we get our answer
we get zero one zero zero but it has the
ones going in diagonals
on every other diagonal and zero on
every other one
a little bit of a brain teaser that one
trying to get that one to work out so
you can see how you can arrange your
rows and here's your step in your
different access on there
and then the next one is
find the total number and locations of
missing values in the array the first
challenge is to create some missing
numbers
so let's create our raise z we're going
to do uh numpy.random.rand
10 comma 10. and before we do the second
part let me just take the second part
out
and let's just see what that looks like
so let's run that
and there we go so we have a 10 by 10
random array it randomly is picking out
numbers
and
next we want to go ahead and take our
random integer size equals five
and then we're going to do a random
random 10 size equals five so in the z
we're going to select
a number of random spaces here and set
them equal to
null value
and let's go ahead and run that so you
can see what that looks like and if we
look at the array
we've created one two
three
four
there should be a fifth one in here my
eyes may be filling me so we've created
a series of oh because zero zero to five
zero one two three four so we got five
there are different null values on here
and
this is kind of a neat notation to
notice that we can generate
random integers size equals five so this
generates
five by five miniature grid inside of
this to tell it where to put the nands
at so that's kind of a cool little thing
you can do
and then we want to look up and see how
many null values are in there
and this is simply just
np is none of z
simple
so if it is none then we want to sum it
up so we're going to sum up all of the
different null values on there now let's
do one more feature in here which is
really cool
let's go ahead and print the indexes so
np arguer np is
nan of z so we're going to create our
own another np array and let's run this
and we'll see here that comes up with
the four indexes
so we did count four of them up there
it tells you where they are one nine two
zero four six five four
and then let's go ahead and run this
again run run there we go this time i
got five that's what good for random
numbers another fun one
that i always like to do it's very
similar because we have np is not z dot
sums we're summing the number of
nands and we can get the indexes and you
can reshape the indexes but you can also
just do we'll do an inds where np is
none of z
and let's just print let's print that
print
inds let's see what that looks like
and it's very similar we have we have
zero one three zero six three eight six
nine three
but i've split it into two different
arrays
so we have our x and our y kind of
coordinates going there and what i can
now do is i can now do z
inds
equals and at this point you can also
instead of getting the sum you can get
the means or the all the numbers and
that kind of thing or the average as it
is
so that'd be one thing you could do and
you could pick up the average that's
very common in data science to get the
average and just use that for a value
we'll go and just set it to zero and
then let's go ahead and print our z
and run that
and you can see we come down here
we have wherever there was a null value
it is now
zero
and you can set this whatever you want
this is another way to replace data or
help clean data
depending on what it is you're doing
so wow we covered a lot of stuff so
quick rehash going over everything we
went into there we looked at array
manipulation changing the shape
how to switch that around we even had
the flattened down there which remember
we have another command lower that's
similar we could change the order by f
remember f stands for fortran very
strange connotation but there's c and f
c is the standard
and f switches it to a different order
to be honest i usually have to look it
up because i almost never use f but when
you need it you're like oh my gosh it
was the other order just do a quick
google so we talked about reshape making
sure that the dimensions are the same
you don't want to have like something
that has 12 objects in it and reshape it
to
see 11 and 5 because it doesn't work it
doesn't divide into 12. we can transpose
so we can switch them so we can go from
a 4 by 3 to a 3 by 4. oops i did that
the other way around three by four to
four by three
we covered reshaping the array we did
the roll the axes you can do some weird
things with swapping and rolling axes
and transposing the numbers
we dug a little bit into the arithmetic
so we talked about
adding we talked about subtracting
multiplying dividing
and you know at this point it's so
important we just look up the
numpy mathematics and you can see here
they have just about everything your
trigonometry
uh your hyperbolic functions roundings
sums products differences
there are so many all these different
miscellaneous mathematical connotations
so you know google it go to the main
numpy page and look at the different
setups you can do on there
so we covered that
and we did slicing how to break it apart
we did iterating over the array
we covered
joining arrays and how to concatenate
remember concatenate just means add on
to it so in this case how are you adding
b onto a is how you read that from linux
you should catch the concatenate
because that's used regularly there
splitting the array we talked about how
to split the array in different ways so
you can split it in
array of arrays all kinds of different
ways to split the array up how to resize
it and remember resize does not have to
have the same shape
but if you resize it
it will take the data and begin at the
beginning and add new rows on if the
size is bigger if it's smaller it
truncates it it just cuts the end off
we looked at how to do a histogram and
how to plot that
we mentioned by buckets or bins as they
call them in pi plot and then we covered
a lot of other useful functions in numpy
talked about the line space setup for
doing
numbers in a series how to sum the axes
up again that's part of the mathematical
formulas there that we looked at there's
a sum there's also means and median
all of those you can compute in num b
and you can also do the square root and
standard deviation
the ravel function very similar to the
flat
to be honest i almost always just use
the flat but you know the revel has its
own kind of functionality that it does
and then we went into some numpy
practice examples we challenged you to
create a sine wave in numpy and how to
do that we're kind of looking for that a
range remember how we do the a range and
you can
have your beginning value your n value
which they did is three times pi and not
be pi
and we're going to do intervals of 0.1
and then y just equals the numpy sign of
x there's our math from the math page we
were just looking at remember that it's
right at the top
and
finally we went down here we had this
kind of a little brain teaser how to do
diagonal zeros and ones
playing with the different connotations
of z of the uh numpy array
and then we did a random size and we
played a little bit with how to with the
null values playing with null values
if you're doing any data science you
know null values are like a headache
what do you do with them big sets of
data you get rid of them small debt sets
of data you have to factor something in
there like figure out the average or the
median there and then replace it with
that
pandas really is a core python module
you need for doing data science and data
processing there's so many other modules
that come off of it there it actually
sits kind of on numpy so if you've
already had our numpy array hopefully
you've already gone through the numpy
tutorial one and two so today we're
going to cover what is pandas we'll
discuss series we'll discuss basic
operations on series and then we'll get
into a data frame itself basic
operations on the data frame file
related operations on a data frame
visualization and then some practice
examples roll up our sleeves and get
some coding underneath there and let's
start with just some real general what
is pandas pandas is a tool for data
processing which helps in data analysis
it provides functions and methods to
efficiently manipulate large data sets
now this is a step down from say using
spark or hadoop in big data so we're not
talking about big data here but we are
talking about pandas when there is some
connections there's like an interface
going on with that so there is
availability but you really should know
your pandas because if you're working in
big data you'll know there's data frames
well pandas is a data frame primarily it
has a couple different pieces we'll look
at here and if you've never worked with
data frames before a data frame is
basically like an excel spreadsheet you
have rows and columns you can access
your data either by the row or the
column and you have an index and
different that kind of set up and we'll
dig more into that as we get deeper into
pandas but think of it as a giant excel
spreadsheet that's optimized to run on
larger data on your computer
and then i said it that it's a data
frame so the data structures in pandas
are series one dimensional arrays and
then we have data frame two dimensional
array and it really centers around the
data frame the series just happens to be
part of that data frame and here's a
closer look at a pandas series series is
a one dimensional array with labels it
can contain any data type including
integers strings floats python objects
and more so it's very diverse if you
remember from numpy we studied they had
to be all uniform not in pandas and
pandas we can do a lot more and pandas
actually kind of sits on numpy so you
really need to know both of those if you
haven't done the numpy tutorials and you
can see here we have our index one two
three four five and then our data a b c
d and e very straightforward it's just
two columns and we have a nice index
label and a column label for the data
and then a data frame is a
two-dimensional data structure with
labels we can use labels to locate data
and you can see here we had if we go
back one we had our index one two three
four five so in each one of these series
they would share the same index over
there the row index so you have your row
index df dot index and then you have a
column index df.columns and this should
look like i said this would be really
familiar if you've done any work with
spreadsheets excel so it kind of
resembles that this does make it a lot
easier to manipulate data and add
columns delete columns move them around
same thing with the rows so you have a
lot of control over all of this
now we're of course going to do this in
our jupyter notebook you can use any of
your python editors but i highly suggest
if you haven't installed jupyter and
haven't worked with it it is probably
one of the best ways for easily
displaying a project you're working on i
skip between a lot of different user
interfaces or ides for editing my python
and it's just simply jupiter.org
j-u-p-y-t-e-r.org
and then i always let mine sit on
anaconda anaconda.com
and just real quick we'll open that up
for you oops offline mode don't show me
that again but you can see here that i
have different tools that i can actually
install in my anaconda including the
jupyter notebook which comes by default
and then i have access to the
environments
and again that's
anaconda.com named after the very large
one of the largest world's largest
snakes and then jupiter notebook in this
case jupiter.org and when we're in our
i'm going to go in here to our jupiter
notebook and we're going to go ahead and
just do new and a python 3
and this will open up a python 3
untitled folder
so diving right in let's go ahead and
give this a title pandas tutorial and
we'll go up to cell and we'll change the
cell type to markdown so it doesn't
execute it as actual code
one of those wonderful tools when you
have jupyter notebook so you can do
demos with this and let's go ahead and
import
pandas
and usually people just call it pd that
has become such a standard in the
industry so we'll go ahead and run that
now we have our pandas has been imported
into our jupyter notebook
and then oh we can go ahead and let me
do the control plus since it's internet
explorer i can enlarge it very easily so
you have a nice pretty view oops too big
there we go and whenever you're working
with a new module it's good to check
your version of the module in pandas you
just use the in this case pd dot
underscore underscore version underscore
underscore that's actually pretty common
in most of our python modules there's
different ways to look up the version
but that's one of the more common ones
and we'll go ahead and run that we get
0.23.4
and if we go to the pandas site we see
0.23.4 as the latest release and of
course a reminder that if you're going
to environment you need to install it so
you'll need to pip install pandas if
you're using the pip installer we'll
close out of that
and the first thing you want to do is
we're going to work with series a lot of
stuff you do in series you can then do
on the whole data set we need to do what
create one we need to manipulate it
take pieces of it so query it query it
delete so you can delete different parts
of it so we want to do all those things
with the series and we'll start with the
series and then almost all the code in
fact all the code does transfer
right into
the actual data table so we go from a
series of a single list of one column
and then we'll take that we'll transfer
that over to the whole table and we'll
start by creating let's put up there we
go
creating a series from
list
and let's just call this arr equals
and we'll do 0 1 2 3 4. if you remember
from our last one we could easily do
r equals
range of 5 which would be 0 to 4. but
we'll do r equals zero to four and we'll
call this s1 and we'll go pd
and
series is capitalized this one always
throws me is which letters do you
capitalize on these modules they're
getting more and more uniform but you
gotta watch that with python and we're
just going to go ahead and do arr
so we're just going to take this python
list and we're going to turn it into a
series
and then because we're in jupiter we
don't have to put the print statement we
can just put s1 and it'll print out this
series for us
now let's go ahead and run that and take
a look
and you'll see we have two rows of
numbers so the first one is the index
now it automatically creates the index
starting with zero unless you tell it to
do differently so we get 0 index row 0
is 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4. and because it's a
series it doesn't need a title for the
column there's only one column so why
title it
and this also lets you know that it's a
data type of integer 64. so we print
this out this is our series our basic
series we've just created
and let's do a second series
pd and we'll use the same
data list and let's go ahead and do
order we'll give it an order
equals oh let's do it this way
let's go
index
equals order
and it helps if we actually give it an
order so we'll do order
equals and let's do one two three four
five so instead of starting with zero
we're going to give it an order starting
with one we're going to run that and
we'll go ahead and print it out down
here
s2 and we'll see that we now have an
index of one two three four five and
that represents zero one two three four
in the series and we're still data type
integer 64. and very common as you're
missing with numpy arrays is we can
import our numpy as np remember that
from our numpy tutorials we can go ahead
and create a numpy out of random with
the random numbers of five
and let's just see what that end looks
like so we can see what our number looks
like so we have some nice random float
values here 2.33 so on and that's from
our last tutorial the numpy tutorial 1
and 2. and instead of calling it order
let's call it index
and we're going to set our index equal
to a b c d and e
i want to show you that the index
doesn't have to be an integer so it can
be something very different here and
then let's go ahead and create our we'll
just use s2 again and here's our np for
numpy
series capital s
and n is our
np for numpy
pd for pandas there we go switching my
anachronisms so we have pd.series of n
and we want to do our index
equals our index we just created
and then let's go ahead and see what
that looks like s2 is a print it and
let's run that
and we can see here we have a nice
series going on a b c d and e for our
indexes so instead of being 0 1 2 3 or 4
we can make this index whatever we want
and you can see the numbers here going
down that we randomly generated from the
number array so we use numpy to create
our panda series right here
and so continuing on with creating our
series this one i use so often
we create a series from a dictionary so
we have our dictionary in this case we
went ahead and did a of 1 b is 2 c of 3
d4 ef5 so each one of those is a key and
then a value and then we're going to use
oh let's use s3 equals pd for pandas
series
and then we want to go ahead and just do
d in here
print out s3 here and let's go ahead and
run this and you can see we got a is 1 b
is two c is three d is four e is five
and it's still of integer 64 because the
actual data is one two three four five
and it's all integer 64 type 64. and the
last thing we want to do in the creating
section of our series
is to go ahead and modify the index
because we're going to start modifying
all this data so let's start with
modifying the index of the series and if
you remember let's do a print this time
s1
i'll go ahead and run this and the
reason i did print is because it only
prints out the last variable so if i put
s1 up here and we're going to do another
variable back down lower it won't print
the first one just the last one and
we're going to go ahead and take s1
the index and we're just going to set it
equal to a new index and obviously
the number of objects in our index has
to equal the number of objects in our
data and then because it's the last
variable we can go ahead and just do an
s1 and let's run that and you can see
how we went from zero to zero zero one
two three four as our index we've now
altered it to a b c d and e
so this would be much more readable or
might be representational of a larger
database you're working with
so cool tools we've covered creating
database based on
our basic array python array we've
showed you how to
reset the index
then we showed you how to use a numpy
array
so you can put a numpy array in there
it's all the same you know pd.series a
numpy array and then we can set the
index on there and the same thing with
the dictionary so it's very versatile
how it pulls in data and you can pull in
data from different sources and
different setups and create a new series
very easily in
the pandas and then we looked on
changing your index so now we have a new
index on here
and then we want to go ahead and do some
selection let's do some
basic slicing most common thing you'll
probably do on here and we'll just do s1
this notation should start to look
really familiar again this is going to
put an output so i'd usually it doesn't
change s1 this just selects it so we
might do a equals s1 and then print a
and you'll see that it just looks at the
first three zero one two and we can do
the same thing by not having the a in
there i'll go ahead and take that out
but just a reminder that it's not
actually changing s1 it's just viewing
s1 so simple slicing on here and we can
likewise do an append so before we do a
pen let's just do a quick kind of fun
one we'll do two minus one and you'll
see it covers everything but the e of
course you can do minus two on this side
so one another way to select it is to go
how far from the end and likewise we can
do a two here
cde to the end so it starts at the
second one and another way we can do
this is we can do a minus two over here
and that looks at just the last two in
the slice so you can see how easy it is
to slice the data and of course
there's no reason to do this but you
could select all of them
if you wanted to view all of them on
there up 32 there's not 32 so it's just
going to show the first three there we
go and then we can also append so i can
take and oh let's create another series
and append one to it and if you remember
we had s3 there's our s3 and we have our
s1 we'll go ahead and do s1
and let's go ahead and do
oh let's call it s4
equals s1
a pin
s3 so we're just going to combine those
two into s4
and if we go ahead and print s4 on here
you'll now see that we have a b c d e a
b c d e zero one two three four one two
three four five because we started the
data at one it's very easy to append one
series to the next
and if we're going to append one series
to the next we need to go ahead and drop
or delete one and drop is a key word for
that and let's just do e or index e and
so if i run this
you'll see that it'll print it out and
a b c d there's no e
and remember all these changes if i type
in s4 again
you'll see that s4 still has e in it so
this change does not affect the series
unless you tell it to so i'd have to do
like x s4 equals s4 dot drop e and
there's another way to do that which
we'll show you later on let me just cut
this one out
there we go
all right so we've covered all kinds of
cool tools here we have appending we
have slicing we did all the creating
stuff earlier as you can see here on the
setup how easy it is to manipulate the
series
so next what we want to get into is we
want to get into
operations that happen on the series let
me go ahead and change this cell to
markdown there we go and run that so
series operations what can we do with
the series and let's start by creating a
couple arrays we'll call it array one
and we'll do zero through seven and
array two six through six seven eight
nine five i don't know why we threw the
five on the end let's go ahead and run
those so those load up into jupiter
and we'll do this a little backwards
we're going to do s5 equals a panda
series of array two so i'm doing this in
reverse and then when we do s5 you'll
see that we have zero to four it
automatically assigned the index
67895
for our series
and let's go ahead and do the same and
we'll call this s6 and we'll set this
equal to pd series for
our first array
and if we do an s6 down here to print it
out
we'll see something similar i got zero
through six
zero one two three four five seven for
the data so those are two series we just
created series six five and six
and one of the first things we can do is
we can add one series to the next so i
can do s5 dot add s6 and let's see what
that generates and just a quick thing if
you never use pandas what do you think
is going to happen with the fact that
this only has five different values in
it and this one has seven values
so let's see what that does
and we end up with 6 8 10 12 9 and it
goes oh i can't add this there's nothing
there so it gives us a null return very
different than the numpy that would have
given you an error this instead tells
you there's no value here because we
couldn't generate one so we can easily
add s5 dot add s6 and likewise we can do
s5 dot
sub for subtract s6
and we'll run that and on the add the
subtract and you guessed it we're going
to do multiply and divide next again you
can see there's null values where it
can't subtract the two because there's
no values there to subtract we can also
do s5 multiply mul they're all three
letters on these that's one of the ways
to remember how they figured out the
code for this so remember these are all
three letters mole we'll go ahead and
run this
and you can you can see how they're
multiplied together and then we can also
do the s5 div three letters again
s6
and run that
and you'll see here this goes to
infinity because we have zero in the
wrong position so it actually gives you
a whole different answer here that's
important to notice and then in the null
values because there's no data and it
can't actually produce an answer off of
an old off of missing data and since
we're in data science let's do s6
median so let's look at the median data
which is simply median sorry for those
who are following the three letters
because median is not three letters and
you can see an s6 is 3.0 and let's do a
print here and we'll do median
or average
s6
and let's print max
comma s6
and just like median there's max value
and if we're going to have a max value
we should also have a minimum value so
let's pop in minimum
we'll go ahead and run this and you're
starting to see something that would be
generated like say an r where you're
starting to get your different
statistics we have a medium value of 3
max value of 7 and a minimum value of 0.
and what it does when it hits these null
values if there is no values in there
because we could still do that we could
actually you know what let's go up here
and do
let's pick this one we multiplied let's
go s7
equals
i'll go and print the s7 just so i keep
it nice and uniform so i still have my
s7 down there and run it and then i want
to take the s7
because s7 now has
null values and an infinity value and
let's see what happens
this is going to be interesting because
i want to see what it does with infinity
and we end up with a median of 6 maximum
of 27 and minimum of 0. which is correct
it drops those values so when it gets to
there and it had doesn't know what to do
with them it just drops those values and
then it computes it on the remaining
data on there so it's important to know
when you're making these computations
you're looking at min and max and median
you're not going to know that there's no
values unless you double check your data
for the null values it's a very
important thing to note on there so just
a real quick
review on there we've done our created
our pd series and we've gone ahead and
done addition subtraction multiplication
division all those are three letters so
sub min div add
and then we looked at median maximum and
minimum so we're going to go ahead and
jump into the next big topic which is to
create a data frame so now we're going
to go from series and we're going to
create a number of series and bundle
them together to make a data frame
there we go cell type markdown let me go
ahead and run that so we have a nice
title on there it's always good to have
a good title all right so our first data
frame we'll jump in with some stuff that
looks a little complicated we'll break
it down first i'm going to create some
dates and you know what let's just go
ahead and do this i want you to see what
that looks like what i'm creating here
i've created a series of dates pd date
range and we're going to use these for
the index okay so when you look at this
you'll see that it's just basically it
comes out kind of like a basic python
list or a number array however you want
to look at it with our different dates
going down and we've generated six of
them and it's going to have whatever
time it is right now on your on the
thing for the date for the time that's
that time stamp right there and then
you'll see we have 11 19 2008 11 20 11
19 and looking into the future there so
that's all this is is generating a
series of dates that we're going to use
as our index and this is a pandas
command so we have a date range which is
nice it's one of the tools hidden in
there in the pandas that you can use
and next we're going to use numpy to go
ahead and generate some random numbers
in this case we'll do the
np.random.random
in 6 comma 4. you can look at this as
rows and columns as we move it into the
pandas and of course you could reshape
this if you had those backwards on your
data but we want the six to match the
rows and we have six periods so our
indexes should match along with the rows
on there and then you know before we do
the next one let's go ahead and just
print out our numpy array so you can see
what that looks like here we have it one
two three four by one two three four
five six four by six
so it's a nice little setup on there and
since working with data frames can be
very visual let's give our columns we
have four columns and we're going to
give them names a b c and d so now we
have columns on there also and then
let's put this all together in a data
frame and we can actually you know what
let's do this since i did it with
everything else let's go ahead and do
columns and you can see there's our
columns on there
and we'll go ahead and do df1 equals
pandas dot
data frame and note that the d and the f
are capitalized series it was just the s
and i always highlight this because you
don't know how many times these things
get retyped when you forget what's
capitalized on there it's a minor thing
you'll pick it up right away if you do a
lot of it and the first thing we want to
do is we want to go ahead and take our
numpy array because that's what we're
going to create our data frame off of is
the numpy array and then we want our
index
equal to our dates so there's our index
in there and then we also have columns
equals
columns
and then finally let's see what that
looks like now remember we had all the
different data that just looked like a
jumble of data we have our column names
and everything else our numpy array kind
of just a jumble array over there four
by six you could sort of read it but
look how nice this looks i mean this is
you come into a board meeting you're
working with your
shareholders
this is pretty readable this is you know
this is our date this is our a b c d
whatever it is maybe it's one of these
dates has your leads
closures lost leads total dollar made
you know whatever it is if it's in a
business maybe it's measurements on some
scientific equipment whether searching
material you know where this is like
higher the temperature low of the day
humidity of the date whatever it is so
you can see that we can really create a
nice clear chart and it looks just like
a spreadsheet you know we have our rows
and we have our columns and we have our
data in there now this one i use all the
time if we're going to create we can
create it like you saw here with our
numpy array very easy to do that and
reshape it you can also create it with a
dictionary array so here we have some
data let me just go down a notch so you
can see all the data on there we have an
animal in this case cat cat snake dog
dog cat snake cat dog we have the age so
we have an array of ages we have the
number of visits and the priority was it
a high priority yes
no
and then we're going to take that we're
going to create some labels we have a b
c d e f g h i and what i want you to
notice on this is we have a title animal
and then we have basically a python list
and these lists they don't necessarily
have to be equal because we can have
non-data you know np.nand numpy array
null value but we want to go ahead and
create labels that are equal to the
number in the list so a
the first cat b the second cat c the
snake d the dog and so on so we'll go
ahead and create our labels which we're
going to use as an index
and we'll call this df let's do it this
way we'll call this
df2 equals pd for panda's
data frame
and then we have our data just like we
did before and we have our index equals
labels
and if we're going to go from there
let's go ahead and print it out so we
can see what that looks like df2 so
let's go ahead and run that another
again you have a nice very clean chart
to look at we've gone from this mess of
data here to what looks like a very
organized spreadsheet very visual and
easy to read animal age visits priority
and then a through j cats and all your
different animals so on and so on and
then when you do programming a lot of
times it's important to know what the
data types are so we can simply do df2
d types
and if we run that we can see that our
animal
is an object because it's just a string
but it comes in as an object age is a
float64 integer 64 and then priority
again is just an object and exploring
this this one's very popular let's go
df2
[Music]
head
and if we print that out the df2 head
returns the first five and we can change
this you don't have to do five you might
want to just look at the top two maybe
you want to look at
let's see let's do six so maybe we'll
look at just the top six in the database
in your data frame
and you can actually this creates
another data frame so i could have a df3
equal to df2 and this now takes the df2
and just the first six values
so if we do df3
run get the same answer
and if we do it the head of the data we
can also do the tail it's the same thing
df tail you can look at the last we'll
just do the tell which by default does
five the last five and of course you can
just look at the last three of those
real quick just to see what's at the end
of the data and this is
to tell i love doing the tail of one
because i'll have like the index or
something like that and it will just
show me the last whatever the last entry
was looking at stock values and i might
want to look at just the last five days
of the stock values i can do that with
the data frame tail
and some other key things to look up
are the index so we can do df2.index
and i want you to notice that this isn't
a call function so if i put the brackets
on the end it'll give me an error
because index is not callable it's just
an object in there
so we do
df2.index there's also
columns so we can go ahead and let's do
a let's print this
remember the first one is not going to
show unless i print it and then df2
column so now we can see we have our
indexes
and we have our columns listed here
df2.columns animal age visits priority
it tells you what kind of object it is
or what kind of data type it is and
they're both object
and then finally df2 dot
values and again there's no brackets on
the end of df2.values
because this is an actual object it's
not a callable function so we'll go
ahead and run that and it creates just
displays a nice array a very easy way to
convert this back to a numpy array
basically so before i go into the next
section let's just take a quick look at
what we covered so far with the data
frame we came up here we created our
data frame we did it from a numpy array
first
setting the columns and the index the
index is setting it up is the same as
when we set up the series so that should
look very familiar so is the whole
format the numpy array the index dates
and the columns columns and remember in
our numpy array we're looking at row
comma column so six rows four columns is
how that reads in the data frame
and we went ahead and also did that from
a dictionary in this case animal was the
column name with all the date data
underneath that column and then age with
that data visits that data priority that
data and then of course we added our
labels in there for our index so there's
no difference in there but it
automatically pulled the column names
important to know when you're dealing
with a data frame and importing a data
frame this way
and then we did looking up d type we
looked at head and tail looking at your
data really quick
we also did index and columns and values
and note these don't have the brackets
on the end
so the next thing we want to do is go
ahead since we're dealing with data
science is we want to go and describe
the data so we have
df2.described to do that and we're going
to manipulate it in just a minute but
let's just see what this generates
and you can see right here we have age
and visits
so looking at our data from up above let
me just go all the way up here
animal age visits priority
and it does a nice job generating your
age versus visits which has all the data
you have your account your means your
standard deviation your minimum value
25 or in this group 50 75 and your
maximum value so this should look
familiar as a data science setup with
your describe for a quick look at your
data frame data so let's start
manipulating this data frame moving
stuff around and we'll start with
transposing and it is simply capital t
for transpose
and when we run that it flips the
columns and the indexes so now the
indexes are all column names and the
columns are all indexes animal age
visits priority
so if we had come in here with our data
shaped wrong up above where we had a by
six we can quickly just swap it if we
had it backwards not a big deal and we
can also sort our data uh something that
you can't do which is more difficult to
do with a lot of other packages in the
data frame it's really easy to do take
our data frame df2 and we're going to
sort underscore values
by equals age and so when we run this
you'll see the default is ascending so
we have 0.52 2.53 and everything else is
organized so if you look at your indexes
they've been moved around because each
index it moves a whole row not just the
one piece of data is not being sorted so
very quick way to sort by age are
different data in the data frame and in
addition to sorting it we can also slice
the data frame so i could do df2 and
this should look familiar from earlier
we'll just do one
to three so we're going to pull out oops
it does help if i use the df instead of
just d and we're going to pull up just
between 1 and 3 so we have no 0 which is
a we have b which is 2 or b which is 1
and c which is 2. so 1 2 and then it
does not include 3 which is the standard
in python
and we can even do something like this
we can combine them which is always fun
because remember this returns a data
frame so if i take df2 dot
sort
values and we'll do by
equals age
this is just kind of fun and then i'm
going to slice it
there we go double check my typing and
run it
and now you should see fa because fa are
now 1 and 2 on there so you can very
quickly create a whole string on here
which narrows it you know that you can
sort it then slice it and do all kinds
of fun things with your data frame we'll
just go back to the original one run
there we go and if we can slice it by
row we can also query the data frame so
we can do df2 and this is a little
different because i'm going to create an
array within an array and in this case
we're going to look at oh let's do
age comma
visits
so look at the different format in here
we have one to three so we've done this
by
slicing by an integer value and then on
here i've done df2 age comma visits in
an array and when i run this
you can see that we get just these two
columns on here we get age and visits so
it's a quick way to select just two
columns or select number of columns
you're working with
and if you stop there we did the slicing
almost identical to slice is i location
which uses the integer location one
comma three
there's a push in pandas to move to this
particular setup instead of doing just a
regular slice
and that's because this can be confusing
when we slice one to three and then we
select agent visits
so there is a push to go ahead and move
to an eye location which does the same
thing you can see here bc it's the same
as up above there's also copy command so
we can do df3 equals df2 copy we're just
going to create a straight copy of it
and of course if we do df3
it'll be the same as a df2 on there so
df3 equals df2.copy
and then let's do df3 dot is null so
we're looking for null values
and this will return a nice map and
you'll see that everything is false
except when you go up here under the cat
or h they had a null there and so if we
go do i have a couple up here also
underneath of let's see the dog okay
there's a bunch of nulls in here there's
d up here so let's look at d down here
and you'll see false true there it is
there's our null value so we can create
a quick chart of null values you can use
this to do other things we can leverage
that null value to maybe take an average
or something and fill those null spaces
with data and we can also modify the
location so here's our df3 location
and notice this is location not i
location ilocation has i for integer
location uses the
in this case the variables on the left
and what we can do on here and we'll go
and just set this equal to
one
five and then let's um i'll pick a spot
let's go back up here where we had let's
do f
a just let's see what are we looking at
oh here we go let's do f and h
and up here f is set to age of 2.0 and
we find out that that's incorrect data
so we go ahead and switch to df3
equal and then we're going to print out
our df3
and if we go to f and age it is now 1.5
so we're just changing the value in the
df3 and this is changing the actual data
frame remember a lot of our stuff we do
a slice
and like it returns another data frame
this changes the actual data frame and
that value in the data frame
so we've covered uh location and i
location is null making a copy here's
our i location which is equivalent of a
slice and also selecting columns
so now we want to dive just take a
little detour here and let's look at df3
means
and this is kind of nice because you can
do this you can either do this by as you
can select a single column here by the
way you can just add the column
selection right here like we did before
so we could have age
look up the mean that just creates a
series if i run that there's our age
but if i take that out instead of
selecting it we can do the whole setup
and it has age and visits so why doesn't
it have priority or animal
well those are not integers so it's
really hard
they're non-numerical values so what is
the average i guess you could do a
histogram which probably will look at
that later on but the only two things we
can really look at is agent visits and
we have
the average or the mean on the age is
3.375
and the mean on visits is 1.9
and let's do df3
visits we'll go ahead and steal the
visits again
and remember all those different
functions we looked at for a series well
we can do those here we can do the sum
so if we run that we'll see that these
sum up to 19. we could also look up
minimum if you remember that from before
the minimum is one
max
so all that functionality is here
i'll just go back to summing it up and
adding it all together so real quick
we've shown you how to take the series
operations and put them into the data
frame and then we can actually this is
interesting one we can just do df3 sum
run and you'll see the different
summations on there
it just combines them i like the way it
just combines the strings on there for
priority and animal we've looked at is
null we've also looked at copying along
with the different slices which we
talked about earlier so let's talk about
strings let's dive into the string setup
on there and let's go ahead and create a
string series string equals pd series
and we just put it right in there we
have a c d a a b a c a popped in a null
value cow and owl i don't know why they
picked cal and al in the background
someone must like those animals and of
course we can just do string if we run
that you'll see
leave the r out we'll get an error but
if we put it in there you'll see that we
have a simple series 0 a 1c 2d and it
automatically indexes it 0 to 8.
and then we can go string dot lower so
when we're talking about our data frame
in this case our data series string in
this case we use the string
function str and we're going to make it
lower and if we go ahead and put the
brackets on there and you'll see that
we've gone from capital a capital c so
on to abc and baca cba cow al they were
all lower case already and of course if
you want to go lower you can also do
upper we'll go ahead and run that and
you can see we now have acd aaa baca
everything is capitalized except for the
null value which is still null all right
so we looked at a few basic string you
can see that string functions upper and
lower
we're going to jump into a very
important topic i'm even going to give
it its own
header on here because it's such an
important topic what do you do with
missing values
panda has some great tools for that so
we'll dive into those
we'll call we'll work with df4 and if
you remember the df copy from above
we're just going to make a copy of df3
and let's just take a quick look at the
data we're working with oops df3 forgot
the three on there there we go
so here we have our cats snakes and dogs
hopefully not all in the same container
because that would be just probably mean
to all of them so we made a copy we're
going to be working with df4 and the
reason we made a copy is we want to go
ahead and fill the data and we just
simply do fill in a and then we're going
to give it the value we want to put in
there we'll give it the value 4. so i
can run in here and you'll see now that
df4
now has where the n a was is filled with
the value of four same thing down here
a lot of times we'll compute the mean
first so i might do a mean
age
equals df4 and then we want to go ahead
and do age
and dot mean
and then i'll do something like this df4
i only want to select the age and i want
to fill that
with the mean
age
i run in there and you'll see that our
df4h now has the means in there just a
quick way of showing you how you can
combine these let me go back to our
original one there we go and run that
and keeping with good practices df5
equals df three dot copy
and we'll print our df5 which should be
the original one
and then on the df5 we can now drop our
missing data
i'm going to simply drop in a and we're
going to use how equals any so i'm going
to drop any row that has missing data in
it and you'll see we had d here with
missing data and h
and then let's go ahead and see what df5
looks like when we do that
there we go and there it is d is gone
and so is h so we create a new data
frame off of this missing those values
now if you have a lot of data dropping
values is a good way to take care of it
because you don't miss some data if you
have not a whole lot of data you're
working with like the iris data set or
something like that or something small
you want to start trying to find a way
to fill that data in so you don't lose
your computational power the data you
got
so just a quick look at processing null
values
or missing values you can fill them
usually with the means some people use
medium or the mode there's different
ways you can fill it one way is means
and we can also just drop those rows
those are the two main things we do with
missing data
here we go uh we're going to cover next
this is i so love data frames for this
file operations
it saved me so much time because they
have so many different tools for
bringing data in and saving data so
we're looking at the data frame file
operations it's really streamlined i
don't know how many times they'll go on
to different data downloads and they'll
have panda download standard on there
just because it's so widely used so
let's start with the most common file is
a csv so we have df3 to csv or animal
and let me just show you what the
folders going into
right now i have some untitled a few
things in here but nothing labeled
animal so we go ahead and run this
and this has now saved the animal to
my hard drive and you can now see the
animal folder up here and if i let's do
edit with a notepad oh let's open up
with just a regular notepad there we go
or word pad if i open that up you can
see it's comma separated our titles they
don't have an index on the categories on
the top and the index comma then all the
different data is separated by commas
standard csv file on there and if we're
going to send it to csv and notice the
format is dot 2 underscore csv
and it's just the name of the file we're
sending it to you can also put the
complete path by default it's going to
go whatever the active directory this
program is running on that's why those
other folders are in there so we have
our df3 to csv and then if we're going
to put it in there we want to also get
it back out and we'll call this one df
underscore animal equals pd read
underscore csv
i always have to remember is two
underscore csv and read underscore csv i
always want to do like a capital in
there and not the underscore we're going
in here again it's the active directory
so if i now do print out my df
animal and let's just do the ahead we
only want to look at the first three
lines so if we go ahead and run this
we'll see the first three lines and they
should match up here what we saved to
our csv
so very easy to save and import from our
csv files on here
and it turns out
df3 also has a two excel they actually
have a lot of different formats but you
know old school
excel was real popular for so long still
is we can go ahead and save it as
animal.xlsx we're going to call the
sheet named sheet1
and then i can also do df we'll call it
animal2
animal2 and this one's going to come
from and the same format on here there
we go so we still have our animal xlsx
the sheet one that's where it's coming
from index columns equals none so we're
not gonna we're gonna suppress the
indexing on the columns any values and
it'll just assign that zero on up on
your indexes so if it says index columns
equals none that's what it does and then
we've added null values because there's
no values in here and we want to just
make sure that they're marked as n a
and we'll go ahead and just print out
the animal animal 2 there we go and
let's run that let's make this let's
just do the whole thing so we'll go
ahead and run that and it probably
doesn't help that i completely forgot
the read so animal 2 equals pd.read
excel there we go excel so now we go
ahead and run it
and what we expect is happening here we
have the same data frame on here and if
i flick back to my folder you can now
see that we have the animal one of these
is in excel and one of these is a csv on
here and so there's our two file types
on there and they have other formats
these are just the two most common ones
used and i don't know how many times
i've had stuff from excel i need to pull
out if you've ever played with excel
it's a nightmare in the back end because
of the way they do the indexing
so this just makes it quick and easy to
pull in an excel spreadsheet so we
looked at two different ways to bring
data in and save it to files we've
looked at all kinds of different ways of
manipulating our data set and slicing it
and creating it for our data frame let's
get in there put your visualization
always a big thing at the end because
one it lets you check to see what you
did make sure it looks right and then
also if you're going to show somebody
else it makes it very clear what's going
on if they see something visual so this
is where really important part of data
science is so let's go ahead and bring
in our tools we're going to do import
numpy as np we want to make sure we have
our ambersign matplot library in line
this just lets jupyter know that we're
going to print it on this page if you're
using a different ide you don't really
necessarily need that but this does help
it displays correctly in jupiter
notebook and if you remember for earlier
we could create a uh we're gonna call it
ts we're gonna create a pandas which are
cute cuddly creatures versus a pandem
short for pandemonium no so we have ts
equals pd series and we're just going to
create a random
setup of 50. we'll do an index we'll set
it equal to the panda's date range today
periods equals 50. so the 50 should
match and i want you to notice something
here i did not import the matplot
library why because it's already in
there pandas already has its built-in
connection and interface with matplot
library so you don't have to import it
and we'll go ahead and do ts equals ts
dot
cumulative sum we're going to do the
cumulative sum
so a little reformatting there and we'll
go ahead and plot it and let's take a
look at what that looks like
so we have a nice graph here we have the
dates on the bottom we set this up so we
have a nice range between in this case
minus four to looks like about two maybe
or one minus four and one so what we've
done here we plotted a basic series just
a single row of data and we've set
indexes on there but we can also do the
whole data frame on there and let's see
what that looks like
so first let's go ahead and create the
data frame we have here random numbers
we're going to do 50 by 4 and then we'll
go ahead and create columns a b x and y
just because we can index is the
ts.index on there so we're gonna use the
same index as before
just to keep it nice and uniform we've
already generated the dates to go with
it and then we can do just like we did
with the series
we can also do with the data frame
df equals df cumulative sum
so we're going to sum the whole data
frame and then we'll do simply df plot
and let's put that in and let's go ahead
and run this and look how easy and quick
that was to generate a nice graph with
all the different data on there so we
have our shared index we have the shared
columns and then we have the different
data from each one that we can easily
look at and compare so very quick way of
displaying data you can imagine if you
were working in oh i think i mentioned
stock earlier because i've been doing
some analysis of stock lately so you'd
have your date down here and then you
would have stock a stock b stock x y
whatever it is and you can put them all
on one chart and see how they
what they look like next to each other
and this isn't too far off from what
some of those graphs look like and this
is just randomly generated so stock has
a lot of randomness in it which is one
of the reasons i actually play with it
for doing some of my models on for
testing them out
now there are a lot of features in
pandas so we're going to show you one
more thing on here there are some of the
things like i didn't go too deep we
looked at the top two for importing data
from a csv and from an excel spreadsheet
showed you how to quickly plot the data
there's more settings in there you can
do
we're going to do one more thing down
here and this is kind of a fun one
change this to a markdown and run that
so how would you remove repeated data
using pandas
and this is where you have a data set
that comes in and maybe it's feeding
from one location and instead of noting
that it's repeated the date like oh
let's go back to stocks that's a good
visual we have the stocks from the 23rd
and it adds another row and it's the
same row it's importing the 23rd again
and again so now you have that data
repeated three times and you need to go
back and figure out how to get rid of it
how do you track that down
so let's start by creating a quick
database our data frame not a database i
keep saying databases a data frame and
we'll just make this data frame has
using our dictionary going in this data
frame only has one data series in it
which is fine so if we do df to print it
out you'll see a
one two two two two four five four five
six seven so on so how would you remove
that well there is a neat feature in
data frames called shift
along with another feature that lets us
select just certain date information and
we'll go with
the location function put that in
brackets remember that from above
location and then in the location let me
just spread this out a little bit so
it's really easy to read in fact i'm
going to go upscale on that since we're
doing some a little bit more complicated
here
what you can see on this on the location
is i have
dfa.shift
so this is going to shift up one by
default you can actually change this to
two or three you can even do a minus one
and it shifts the other way but it's
going to shift up by one by default
that's going to say if that does not
equal df of a
then we want that if you look down here
we had one two two two two two when we
run this logic on here and we do the
shift
it now gets rid of all the duplicates so
we went from one two two two two four
four five whatever it was here it is one
two two two four four four five five
five six six six two one two four five
six seven eight
and you'll see on the index it just
deletes them out of there so the index
stays the same obviously you don't want
the dates to change if you're working
with an index dated setup so it just
deletes those duplicates out of there
this is just a quick way to introduce
you to
one the fact that you can add logic
gates into here and two the eye location
allows you to use shift so there's the
shift function and then the eye location
selects that based on true or false
wow so we've actually covered a lot
today in pandas we've really covered
into the basics of selecting your
different series out of your column out
of your data frame how to index rows how
to slice how to plot
hopefully you'll take this beyond that
and start combining these different
things and you can create long strings
and really explore your data generate
some nice graphs if you're in jupiter
notebook it's a great demo to show
others
and i didn't know this about jupiter
notebook you can do this in jupiter
notebook and then you can download and i
always i never really look too closely
at all the downloads
which you download as an html and post
it to your blog so it's got a neat
feature in there but any of this is
really powerful tool all of this is
really powerful tools for doing your
data science
