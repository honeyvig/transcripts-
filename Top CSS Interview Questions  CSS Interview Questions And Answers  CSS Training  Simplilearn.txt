hello everyone and welcome you all so
today is very exciting day because today
we're gonna talk about something
very interesting which is related to
your css interview questions
as we know it very well today in a
current scenario
you being as a front-end developer
css is playing a very very important
role so in interview what kind of
questions are asked and what kind of
answers we have to give let's talk about
those
okay so let's get started with those
questions and answers
okay
now
here
we'll talk about basic css interview
questions
now name some css frameworks as we know
it very well today in css environment
there's so many frameworks are available
okay like
we talk about css these are basically
necessary libraries which offers you
some very popular ready-made components
which you can utilize into your
existing project and without writing
much code you can really create some
awesome effects so
some of the very very popular libraries
are like in foundation
bootstrap
gumby
ukit symantec ui
and many more which are available here
okay
now what do you understand by the
universal selector see universal
selector as you know it very well in css
normally we talk about specific
selectors like in talk about class
selectors id selectors
they select specific set of elements or
specific element
when we talk about universal selectors
universe selector is matches any element
types like instead of selecting elements
of a particular type so you talk about
like an asterisk where the all elements
irrespective of what name and what
category they have it all will be
selected
next
tell us about rule set see typically
rule set is
for the identification for selector
which can be attached with other
selectors so there are normally two rule
sets are available
when we talk about declaration block and
we talk about selector so declaration
block contains one or more semicolons
separated by declarations set of styles
which we say and the selector is means
or which particular
element this css style will be
intended for
next
what are the elements of css box model
okay so we know it very well the c6 box
model is all about offering you the
layout which is a part of the design
element so in css we can see this
elements are like in images you talk
about text okay you talk about padding
which is so called
area around the content you talk about
border talk about margin
okay so you talk about this c6 box model
next
difference between css3 and css2 we know
it very well css has changed a lot and
css3 has brought so many new features
so we talk about a difference so in css2
so c6 splits up the different sections
of code into the modules so in css3 both
css and html were put into the single
file
in css3 there were no new way of writing
the css rules
there are new rules are available
in writing a css rules
normally in css3 it is a backward
compatibility maintained by the with a
css3
but in css2 we do not have any backward
compatibility maintained by the css2
here
now how can css be
integrated into the html page
like in order to utilize this we always
use the style sheet we use style tag
okay so multiple options are available
when we talk about using the style tag
in a head section
else we talk about inline styling with
an element itself or third we talk about
external style sheet which you can link
it with your current html page which
anyways enforce reusability
coming back what is the rgb stream
so rgb stands for red green and blue so
it represents a color in css so they are
basically uh starting with the color
number 0 goes till 256.
next what is the purpose of developing a
css
okay the main purpose of developing a
css to basically offer the visual
appearance to give the better look and
feel to your code so that your html will
offer only the skeleton part but when it
comes to the beautification
you talk about organization and
everything you talk about the css
okay so css offers the styling part of
your web page which looks more
attractive
so what is the difference between class
and id see these are two different type
of selectors are available in css
class selectors and id selectors
so class is the way of using these html
elements
so they are not unique and have multiple
elements
where the id is unique and it can be
assigned to a single element
so with css different documents can be
controlled using the single style so
style can be grouped in a complex
situation
to offer the consistent
look for the multiple html pages
so that is what the advantage is you
have it
so you can group multiple styles
together and that you can reuse
over the different pages to offer the
consistent styling
okay
now we talk about some intermediate css
interview questions
so here in the intermediate level you
will see
like the first question is like what
define a z index see zen index is
specify the stack order of the elements
that overlap each other
okay so its default value is zero and
can take both negative and positive
values
okay
the higher the z index value is stacked
above the lower index element so it
normally takes the following value
talk about like an auto number initial
and inherit
next
you talk about what are the benefits of
css sprite see the main benefit of css
sprite is
like loading a multiple image is not
an issue
okay
blinking is not seen there's some
advantages are available like when you
talk about like
at one single or small small images
it really takes a lot of time to
download it individually so css sprites
loading multiple image is not an issue
blinking is not seen
because normally what happens blinking
happens when the image is getting loaded
so advanced downloading of asset doesn't
make a place off
until needed that's the benefit of
having the css sprites
next how can you target the h3 and h2
with the same styling so you can do the
comma separated so you can see multiple
elements can be targeted with using
comma separated so you use comma
separated values to give the consistent
style to both the elements
so name and media types allowed by css
so media types are basically a part of
your responsiveness
different media types are allowed like
in speech audio visual
tactile media
continuous or paged media grip media or
bitmap or interactive media
these are all type of medias
are allowed in css
so how can you use css to control image
reputation so we talk about no repeat
so background repeat properties which is
available so you can see
background repeat none so that it would
not be repeated again and again within
your background
okay so we're talking about the next
questions like
about the image scrolling control how
you can control the image scrolling so
that you want the image to be remain
fixed
and rest of the part gets scrolled
so here it is a part of your background
attachment property so here you say the
background repeat no repeat and you see
background attachment fixed so that when
you scroll down your image is not going
to be scrolled
so that is the benefit of this image
control scrolling
now
name some font related css attributes
we have some options available like you
talk about font style weight
variance size
family these are the
font related css attributes
define contextual selector
so normally in css the context
contextual selectors allows developer to
specify style
of a different part of the document
okay so style which you utilize it can
be aligned directly to the static html
pages
to create independent classes okay
that's called contextual selector
so responsive web design responsive web
design is a web design which you want to
remain consistent
across multiple device screens or the
different type of screen sizes
and you want to offer the better layout
which doesn't looks bloated over the
different websites
so that's the benefit which you see when
you talk about like responsive web
design
ceases
nomenclature
css nomenclature means the styling
commands are written in a value on a
property fashion
okay so normally css includes a system
terminator semicolon the entire style is
wrapped in a curly braces and attached
to the dedicated selector
okay so this actually creates a style
sheet that can be applied to an html
page so this is the standard
nomenclature
okay
now coming back to the next point
advanced css interviews
i will tell you about few questions
which are normally asked as the part of
advanced css
okay
now when do you use translate instead of
absolute positioning okay so the
translate in a css
okay transform value on changing
you can talk about opacity
or transform
okay so the browser reflow or repaint is
not triggered
when we talk about this translate
okay so the transform requires a browser
to create a gpu layer for
elements
okay but using the cpu changes
absolute positioning property so
translate is more efficient and result
in
shorter paint times
next name different ways to position
same aspects in css
okay
so you talk about positioning properties
okay
so there are five different positions
values are number one you talk about
fixed we talk about static
you have absolute you have got relative
and never got sticky so five different
positioning elements are available in
css
what are mixins mixes is a similar to
the function block of code returning a
single value it is a kind of function
which we say
okay
so traditionally it is used in a sas or
okay which is typically called
statically awesome style sheet so
that code that directly compiles into
the css styles
so how can you optimize the web page for
the prints
so
you actually identify a control okay
so-called contents areas of a website a
general website has a footer header
sidebar or nav bar
or
content area
so
normally we say conquer the print pedia
without changing the website's integrity
by using the page breaks
so creating styles for print
size
your page for print and avoid
unnecessary html table so using this you
can optimize the print of your web pages
so what is the meant by css working
under the hood so when you browser
display a document it actually combine
the style
okay which presents information and
document content so the document is
actually processed in two stages number
one
conversation
okay or
conversion of html and css into the
document object model so called dom and
dom display contents of browser
different between the use of id selector
and class selector we have already seen
that but this is a simple demo of how
the id selector in class selectors are
used the difference is all about using
so here you have a call id which you use
dot sorry this hash and there you use
dot
so tell us about css float property so
normally css float properties
of positioning an image to the right or
left as needed so it typically including
text wrapping around it so all
properties of elements used before it
remain unchanged that is known as called
float
so what do you understand with the
pseudo elements so pseudo elements are
special effects to your selectors so
normally css finds
okay using applying styles in a html
markup so if additional markup or style
is not visible for a document then
pseudo elements help by allowing extra
markup without
interfering with the original
document
difference between logical and physical
tag so normally logical tags focus on
the content
okay
and are older as compared to the
physical ones
logical ones do not find much usage in
presentation
in terms of
utilization at the same time physical
ones find application in presentations
so how media type works in css type so
we have discussed already about a media
type
so we normally say four different type
of media properties are available i can
print speech and screens
okay like you talk about
print media screen so we use always add
the rate media print you talk about h2
so this changes according to what option
you're offering it
so guys here we have multiple css
question and frequently our css
interview questions are offered like
tell
something about css3
okay so we say css is divided into the
modules and is supported by almost every
single browser
okay it is an advanced version of css 2
and offering you lot many other advanced
level features which typically in css2
we do not have that
okay
now
we talk about how css selectors used
so with the css selectors we can choose
you know any element of your html
okay so
you talk about element attribute you
talk about n child selector you can
basically select it
so what are css image scripts
so the group of image placed into the
one single image is in a css image
script it can reduce the load time
because individual images certainly take
more time so this takes more time
comparatively
so we have a god explain css
a specificity
so the css specificity is a rank or
score that decides style declarations to
be used to an element
id selectors have high specificity while
universal selector has low specificity
that's how the specificity is all about
so the four css categories that
authorize the selector's specificity
levels are ids inline element pseudo and
class and style attributes so these are
the different type of conditions based
on that the specificity is considered
defined gradients in css we know the
gradient
are
again a css3 property that allows
displaying the smooth transformation
from one type of color to another color
okay so that's really awesome technique
through which you can talk about linear
gradient or else you talk about radian
gradients more two different type of
gradients are
used and supported
so what are the properties of flexbox so
we know it flexbox are basically
designed for the alignment purpose
so typical the flexboxes are flex
direction you talk about wrap flow
content align items and the contents
like that it is once again the property
of alignment
so tell us about the usage of css box
model so normally blocks box model is a
box binding in html elements that
includes padding border margin and the
actual content for the more better
alignment
so normally the box model you get an
authority to add a border all around the
elements and define space between the
elements
so what are the position states in css
so we normally talk about four positions
in css so called relative statics
absolute and fixed
the default position is status always
static
so different between absolute and
relative in css
so normally relative is useful for some
tags in css if we write like 20 pixels
then padding shift 20 pixels in the
right but when we talk about absolute
so it is
absolute is relevant relative to the
non-static pattern that means if i'm
talking about if we say right 20 pixels
the result will be 20 pixels far from
the right edge of the parent element
that's how the relative and absolute
position is
so what is the common between class and
id see both class are id used in html
okay for the css purpose the id is used
as an element where the class is used as
a block
okay so friends thank you these are the
quick interview questions and i'm sure
this will help you
to
get some more ideas about how to face
those questions in an interview okay
thank you and all the best
