devops course now let's jump into the
video but before moving ahead let's
first understand what is devops now
devops is a set of activities and
approaches aimed at enhancing the
effectiveness and Excellence of software
development delivery and deployment it
brings together the Realms of software
development depth and information
technology operations Ops the main goal
of devops is to encourage seamless
collaboration between development and
operations team through the entire
software development life cycle it
achieves this through the utilization of
automation continuous integration
delivery and deployment thereby
accelerating the process and minimizing
errors in software development now let's
explore who is a devops engineer now
devops engineer is an expert in
developing deploying and maintaining
software systems using devops practices
they work closely with it operations
developers and stakeholders to ensure
efficient software delivery the
responsibilities include implementing
automation continuous integration and
continuous delivery or deployment
practices as well as resolving issues
throughout the development process
devops Engineers are proficient in
various tools and Technologies such as
source code Management Systems build and
deployment tools virtualization and
container Technologies but how exactly
to become a devops engineer now
depending on the business and the
individual function different criteria
for becoming a devops engineer may exist
however some specific fundamental skills
and certifications are frequently needed
or recommended first is an excellent
technical background now devops
Engineers should be well versed in it
operations system administration and
soft software development second is
experience with devops tools and
methodologies now devops Engineers
should have experience with various
devops Technologies and processes
including Version Control Systems build
and deployment automation
containerization cloud computing and
monitoring and logging tools third is
scripting and automation skills now
devops Engineers should have strong
scripting skills and be proficient in
using tools such as Buzz python or
Powershell to automate tasks and
processes for this cloud computing
experience now devops Engineers should
have experience working with Cloud
platforms such as Amazon web services
Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud platform
and in the end certification some
organizations may require devops
Engineers to hold relevant
certifications such as certified devops
engineer CDE or certified kubernetes
administrator CK a or AWS certified
devops engineer professional well now
let us begin with some really important
devops interview questions and answers
as we have already covered the road map
of how to become a devops engineer so
the first question that we are coming up
with is how is devops different from
agile methodology well devops is a
culture that allows the development and
operation team to work together this
results in continuous development
testing integration deployment and
monitoring of software throughout the
life cycle whereas agile is a software
development methodology that focuses on
iterative incremental small and Rapid
Release of software along with customer
feedback basically IT addresses gaps and
conflicts between the customer and
developers devops addresses gaps and
conflicts between the developers and it
operations now the second question is
which are some of the most popular
devops tools well some of the most
popular devops tools include selenium
puppet Chef get Jenkins anible and
Docker which are considered really
important in today's world if you want
to become a successful devops engineer
the third question is what is the
difference between continuous delivery
and continuous deployment now we will
address this one by one so continuous
delivery ensures that you can safely
deploy onto production but continuous
deployment ensures that every change
that passes through automation testing
is deployed to production automatically
instead of
manually continuous delivery ensures
business applications are delivered as
they were expected now continuous
deployment makes sure that software
development and other processes like
release are smooth and
faster continuously we also make changes
to a production life environment through
rigorous automated testing but when it
comes to continuous deployment there is
no explicit approval for a developer to
require a developed culture question
four is what is the role of
configuration Management in devops now
configuration management enables
management of and changes to multiple
systems also it standardizes resource
configuration which in turn manage its
infrastructure also it helps with the
administration and management of
multiple servers and maintains the
Integrity of the entire
infrastructure next is what is the role
of AWS in devops well AWS has the
following role in devops first is
flexible services this provides ready to
use flexible services without the need
to install or set up the software second
is build for scale you can manage a
single instance or scale to thousands
using AWS Services third is automation
AWS lets you automate tasks and
processes giving you more time to
innovate than come secure using AWS
identity and access management you can
set user permissions and policies in
your organization and then comes large
partner ecosystem AWS supports a large
ecosystem of partners that integrate
with an extended AWS
Services now if we talk about the sixth
question that is name three important
devops kpis now the three very important
kpis are as follows meantime to fill
failure recovery this is the average
time taken to recover from a failure
deployment frequency the frequency in
which the deployment occurs percentage
of fail deployments the number of times
the deployment
fails now the seventh question is what
are the benefits of using Version
Control here are some of the benefits of
using Version Control well all team
members are free to work on any file at
any time with the Virgin control system
later on VCS will allow the team to
integrate all of the modifications into
a single version the VCS asked to
provide a summary of what was changed
every time we save a new version of the
project we also get to examine exactly
what was modified in the content of the
file as a result we will be able to see
who made what changes to the projects
now inside the VCS all the previous
variants and versions are properly
stored we will be able to request any
version at any moment and we will be
able to retrieve a snapshot of the
entire project at our fingertips a VCS
that is distributed such as get lets all
the team members retrieve a complete
history of the project this allows
developers or other stakeholders to use
the local git repositories of any of the
teammates even if the main server goes
down at any point in time so the next
question is what is the blue green
deployment pattern now this is a method
of continuous deployment that is
commonly used to reduce downtime this is
where traffic is transformed from one
instance to another in order to include
a fresh version of the code we must
replace the code with the new code
version the new version exists in a
green environment and the old version
exists in a blue environment now after
making changes to the previous version
we need a new instance from the old one
to execute a newer version of the
instance so this was the right answer
next is what is continuous testing
continuous testing constitutes running
of automated tests as part of the
software delivery pipeline to provide
instant feedback on the business risk
present in the most recent release in
order to prevent problems in Step
switching in software delivery life
cycle and to allow development teams to
receive immediate feedback every build
is continually tested in this manner now
this results in a significant increase
in speed in a developer's productivity
as it eliminates the requirement of re
running all the tests after each update
and project rebuilding now let's move to
the next question that is what is
automation testing now test automation
or manual test automation is the process
of automating a manual procedure in
order to test an application or system
automation testing entails the use of
independent testing tools that allow you
to develop test scripts that can be run
repeatedly without the need for human
interaction the next question is how to
automate testing in devops life cycle
now developers are obliged to commit all
the source code changes to a shared
devops repository every time A change is
made in the code Jenkins like continuous
integration tools will grab it from this
common repository and deploy it for
continuous testing which is done by
tools like selenium so why is continuous
testing important for devops any
modification to the code may be tested
immediately with continuous testing
this prevents concerns like quality
issues and release delays that might
occur whenever big Bank testing is
delayed until the end of the
cycle in this way continuous testing
allows for high quality and more
frequent releases so the next question
is how do you push a file from your
local system to the GitHub repository
using git now first connect the local
repository to your remote repository now
get remote add origin and then you can
see the code and the Second Step that
you need to do is push your file to the
remote repository next question is what
is the process for reverting a commit
that has already been pushed and made
public now there are two ways that you
can revert a commit remove or fix the
bad file in a new commit and push it to
the remote repository then commit it to
the remote repository using this command
and second is create a new commit that
undoes all the changes that were made in
the bad commit you can use this command
for it next is explain the difference
between get fetch and get pull now get
fetch only downloads new data from a
report repository whereas git pull
updates current head Branch with the
latest changes from the remote server
the second difference is git fetch does
not integrate any new data into working
files whereas git pull downloads new
data and integrates it with the current
working
files get fetch used users can run a git
fetch at any time to update the remote
tracking branches whereas git Poole
tries to merge remote changes with your
local ones now coming to the next
question explain the concept of
branching in git suppose you are working
on an application and you want to add a
new feature to the app you can create a
new branch and build a new feature on
that Branch by default you always work
on the master branch and the circles on
the branch represent various cont
comments made on the branch so after
you're done with all the changes you can
merge it with the master Branch next
question is explain the Master Slave
architecture of Jenkins now Jenkins
Master pulls the code from the remote
GitHub repository every time there is a
code commit it distributes the workload
to all the Jenkins layers and when
requested from the Jenkins Master the
slaves carry out build test and produce
test reports the next question is which
file is used to Define dependency in
Maven bill. XML pom.xml
dependency XML or version. XML the
correct answer is perm. XML next
question that we are going to cover is
explain the two types of pipelines in
Jenkins along with their syntax now
Jenkins provides two ways of developing
a pipeline code scripted and declarative
now scripted pipeline is based on group
groovy script as their domain specific
language one or more node blocks do the
core work throughout the entire pipeline
now the syntax is execute the pipeline
or any of its stages on any available
agent Define the build stage perform
steps related to building stage Define
the test stage perform steps related to
this test stage Define the deploy stage
and perform steps related to the deploy
stage now declarative pipeline provides
a simple and friendly syntax to define a
pipeline here the pipeline block defines
the work done throughout the pipeline so
the syntax that follows is first execute
the pipeline or any of its stage on any
available agent Define the build stage
perform steps related to building stage
then Define the test stage perform steps
related to the test stage Define the
deploy stage and perform steps related
to the deploy stage again this was the
code for declarative pipeline and the
last question for this video is explain
how you can set up a Jenkins job to
create a Jenkins job we go to the top
page of Jenkins choose the new job
option and then select build a freestyle
software project now the elements of
this freestyle job are optional triggers
for controlling when Jenkins builds
optional steps for Gathering data from
the build like collecting Javad do
testing results and or archiving
artifacts a build script that actually
does the work or the optional source
code management system like subversion
or
