hello everyone this is Dr Amia from Team
MDS conquer in this video we are going
to discuss 32 important points from the
subject
microbiology Point number one stfo Cal
scal Dead Skin Syndrome is caused by
epidermolytic toxin Point number two
this epidermolytic toxin is also called
as exfoliative toxin number three stfy
cus orus is implicated in the cation of
bom micosis number four styo cocal foot
poisoning is caused by OT toxin number
five C carbohydrate in streptococus is
important for lanfield
classification number six strepto coal
toxic shock syndrome is due to pyogenic
exotoxin factor number seven pyogenic

guys hope you all revised this points
well thank you
