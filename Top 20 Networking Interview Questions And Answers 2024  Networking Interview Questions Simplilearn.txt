technical Knowledge Questions of
networking so the question number one is
what is the difference between a hub
switch and a router so starting with Hub
so Hub connects multiple ethernet
devices into a single Network segment
acting as a central point so how it
works it receives a packet of data from
one device connected to it and broadcast
it to all other devices in the network
regardless of which device it is
intended for and the key point is
because it sends data to all devices it
can lead to collisions and is generally
less efficient and less secure now
moving to switch so the basic function
of switch is a switch also connects
devices in a network but is more
intelligent than a hub so let's see how
it works it can store the addresses of
the devices connected to it in a table
when it receives data it knows exactly
which part to send it to based solely on
the devic's address thus only sending
data to the destination device and the
key point is this makes switches more
efficient than hubs because they reduce
unnecessary traffic and are more secure
now moving to router so the basic
function of a router is it connects
multiple networks together guiding data
from one network to another based on
their IP addresses so let's see how it
works it examines the data it receiv
Lees to determine which network or
device it should send to allowing not
just connection within a single network
but between different networks like your
home network and the internet and the
key point is routers are crucial for
larger Network setups and for accessing
the internet as the direct traffic and
can also offer security features like
Fireballs so let's consider some
examples so the example for Hub would be
that is suitable for very small simple
networks where security and speed are
not critical for switch it is used in
home networks and businesses when
Network traffic needs to be managed
efficiently to avoid performance issues
and about the router it is essential in
any network that needs to connect to the
Internet or between different internal
networks providing Pathways and security
measures so this breakdown explains the
basic roles and functions of each device
in a way that's accessible for buers
providing a clear understanding of when
and why each device is used so now that
you have understand the difference
between a hub a switch and a router and
the roles in a network let's delve into
how data travels across these devices
using different networking models so
this brings us to the TCP IP and OSI
models which are Frameworks for
understanding and designing Network
systems so let's move to question number
two that is can you explain how the
tcpip model layers correspond to the OSI
model layers so let's start with tcpip
models so the tcpip model is a four
layer protoc suit designed for the
internet it is more straightforward and
has been the foundation for internet
protocols development so let's see the
layers that is link layer that is first
layer this corresponds to the OSI models
physical and data link layers it handles
the physical and data link protocols
like ethernet and Wi-Fi then comes the
internet layer it matches the OSI
Network layer it deals with packets and
routing them across different networks
IP protocol then comes transport lay
this is same as OSI transport layer this
layer ensures data is transferred
reliably and error free that is TCP and
UDP protocols then comes application
layer it encompasses OSI session
presentation and application layers it
provides protocols and applications used
to communicate over a network like HTTP
and FTP so now let's come to the OSI
model so the OSI model that is open
systems interconnection model has seven
layers and provides a more detailed
framework for understanding Network AR
iture so let's see the physical layers
or the layers starting with physical
layer so that deals with the hardware
setup for data transfer that is cables
bits on The Wire then comes data link
layer it manages data transfer between
adjacent Network nodes then comes
Network layer it handles the routing of
data packets then comes transport layer
it ensures complete data transfer then
comes session layer it manages sessions
between applications and then comes
presentation layer it translates data
between the application and the network
and then comes the application layer it
supports application and end user
processes now we see the correspondence
between these models that is TCP IP and
the physical and data link layers of OSI
so let's see the link layer of TCP IP
integrates the physical and data link
layers of OSI then comes internet layer
of TCP I that corresponds to the network
layer of OSI then comes transport layer
that is consistent across both models
focusing on data flow control then comes
application layer of tcpip that broadly
covers osi's top three layers
streamlining session management data
representation and application Services
into a single layer that interacts
directly with the end users application
so understanding these models is crucial
for networking professionals because it
helps in diagnosing issues setting up
networks and ensuring efficient data
flow across the internet and other
networks so with this foundation in
networking models we can move on to
discuss specific Network protocols and
their roles in in ensuring efficient
network communication so with that we
will move to the third question that is
what is the purpose of ARP in a network
so let's start with the definition so
ARP is the address resolution protocol
so the address resolution protocol is a
network protocol used to map an Internet
Protocol address that is IP address to a
physical machine address that is
recognized in the local network and the
Machine address that is also known as
media access control or the MAC address
is a unique identifier assign to network
interfaces for communication at the data
link layer so let's see the purpose of
ARP in a network so the first purpose is
IP to MAC address mapping so when a
device wants to communicate with another
device on the same local network and
knows the IP address but not the MAC
address ARP is used to discover the Mac
addresses now comes the second one that
is ARP request and response mechanism so
the ARP request that is the device
broadcast and ARP request packet to all
devices on the local network
asking who owns a specific IP address
and then comes ARP response so the
device with the matching IP address
sends back and ARP reply which includes
his Mac address and then comes caching
ARP entries once a device receives a MAC
address it stores this information in
its ARP caching caching PRS the need for
repeated ARP request for the same IP
address thus reducing Network traffic
and speeding up the communication
process so the example of ARP action is
let's consider a scenario for this
imagine you are sending an email from
one computer to another within the same
office Network your computer knows the
IP address of the destination computer
but not its Mac address so the process
is your computer will use ARP to ask who
has this IP address the destination
computer will reply with its Mac address
your computer then sends the email
directly to that Mac address or the
local network so this is the example now
let's see the significance of ARP number
one is efficiency and connectivity so
ARP is essential for ipv4 networks to
function efficiently ensuring that data
packets find their way to the correct
devices within a local network segment
and then comes security considerations
while ARP is crucial it's also
suspectable to certain types of security
attacks like ARP spoofing where a
malicious actor can answer the ARP
request with its Mac address redirecting
the data to the attacker machine so
understanding ARP helps and grasp how
devices communicate over a network and
the importance of Mag addresses in local
network environments this knowledge is
foundational for troubleshooting network
issues and securing networks against
common vulnerabilities so absolutely
continuing from the explanation of arp's
role in network communications let's
dive deeper into one of the dynamic
routing protocols that is widely used in
large scale networks OPF or open
shortest path first this protocol is
crucial for efficient Network routing
especially in complex Network topologies
so now we are coming to Advanced
Technologies and moving to the fourth
question that is discuss the different
types of OPF areas and their functions
so let's start with OPF so OPF is a
dynamic routing protocol for Internet
Protocol that is IP networks it uses a
link state routing that is LSR algorithm
and falls into the group of interior
Gateway protocols igps operating within
a single autonomous system it is
designed to scale efficient to support
larger networks with multiple routers so
let's see types of OPF areas and their
functions so starting with OPF divides
an autonomous systems as into
hierarchical areas to optimize traffic
and reduce routing table size which
improves Network performance and reduces
overhead so let's see the types the
number one is backbone area so this is
the core of an OPF Network all other
areas connect to the backbone area
either directly or through virtual links
it is responsible for Distributing
routing information between non backbone
areas so the importance of this is the
backbone area is crucial because it
simplifies the routing process by
reducing the number of routes that need
to be processed by each router now
moving to the next type that is normal
area so a normal area does not carry
external routing information routers in
normal areas only know about the
networks within their area and the way
to reach other areas by the backboard so
about this characteristics all types of
OPF messages are allowed in normal areas
including router Network summary and
external link advertisements now moving
to the next type that is stub area so
stub area function is that it is
designed to prevent external routes that
is routes outside the OPF as from being
flooded into the area and its
characteristic is no external routes are
allowed into a stub area only intra area
and Inter area routes are advertised
default routes are used to reach
networks outside the area now coming to
the next one that is totally stubby area
so its function is it is an enhanced
version of a stub area it blocks
external routes and also blocks summary
Network advertisements from other areas
and its characteristic is it only
default routes and intra area routes are
advertised within a totally stubby area
minimizing the size of the routing table
even further now coming to the next that
is notes so stubby area and SSA so its
function is it is a type of stub area
that can improve as external routes and
send them to the backbone area but it
does not receive external routes from
other areas and its characteristic is it
allows for limited distribution or the
redistribution of external routes into
the area while still benefiting from the
reduced overhead of a stub area so
transitioning from the detailed
explanation of OPF areas let's explore
another crucial as of modern networking
that is MLS multi-protocol label
switching so MLS is a flexible high
performance routing technique that is
widely used in service provider networks
and large Enterprise environments
understanding how MLS works and its
advantages over traditional IP routing
can provide significant insights into
Network efficiency and performance
enhancements so let's start with the
question number five that is how does
MLS work and what are its benefits or
traditional IP routing so MLS is a data
carrying technique that directs data
from one network node to the next based
on short path labels rather than long
Network addresses avoiding complex
lookups in a routing table now coming to
layer operation so that is often
referred to as a layer 2.5 protocol MLS
operates between the data link layer
that is Layer Two and the network layer
layer three of the OSI model so how does
MLS work so there's a label assignment
when data enters the m Network a label
Edge router that is L assigns it a label
this label is simple fixed length
identifier that dictates the data's path
through the network then comes label
switching the packets are then directed
through the network using label switch
routers these routers switch the labels
to direct the packets along
predetermined paths which are set up
based on the networks traffic and Jing
policies then comes label spping as the
packet traverses the network each router
swipes the packets incoming label with a
new label before forwarding it to the
next router this process is repeated
until the packet reaches its destination
then comes label removal once the packet
arrives at the final router the label is
removed and the packet is delivered
based on its original IP address now we
see the benefits of MLS over traditional
IP routing so the number one benefit is
faster packet forwarding by using labels
MLS reduces the time needed for a packet
to Traverse the network as each dter
does not need to perform a network
address lookup to decide the packet's
next hope the next is increased
reliability and performance MLS allows
for setting up predetermined paths for
Network traffic which can be optimized
for specific types of service
requirements such as bandwidth and
latency this ensures higher performance
and more reliable network service then
comes enhanced traffic management so
Network operators can direct and control
the flow of traffic B B on predefined
policies efficiently utilizing available
Network paths and reducing congestion
then comes quality of service that is
qos npls supports qos for managing
different types of data strings this is
crucial for applications requiring
priority handling such as VIP voice over
IP or real-time video streaming then
comes scalability mpls is highly
scalable making it suitable for large
Enterprises and service provider
networks that handle millions of data
packets per second then comes VPN
support npls is effective for deploying
VPN Services providing the ability to
manage and isolate traffic for different
users of the same physical
infrastructure so let's see an example
of mls in action let's consider a
scenario consider a service provider
that needs to ensure high quality video
conferencing services for a corporate
client while also handling regular
internet traffic NLS can be used to
separate and prioritize the video
conference traffic from less sensitive
data ensuring smooth uninterrupted
service so the significance of MLS is
MLS provides Network engineers and
operators with powerful tools for
traffic management enhancing the
efficiency and performance of networks
understanding MLS is essential for those
involved in the planning deployment and
management of modern telecommunication
networks this overview of MLS not only
highlights its functional mechanism but
also underscores its advantages or
traditional routing marking its critical
role in contemporary Network management
and optimization so after discussing how
mpls improves Network efficiently let's
dive into another critical aspect of
networking that is encryption
Technologies particularly the difference
between symmetric and asymmetric
encryption and their roles in ensuring
network security so moving to question
number six that is explain the
differences between symmetric and
asymmetric encryption between the
context of network security so let's
start with what is encryption encryption
is the process of encoding information
to prevent unauthorized access it
transforms readable data that is PL text
into scrambled format that is cipher
text that can only be read and processed
after it has been decrypted now move to
the symmetric encryption so symmetric
encryption uses the same key for both
encrypting and decrypting data this type
of encryption is faster and is often
used for encrypting large volumes of
data so let's see how symmetric
encryption works both the sender and the
recipient share the same secret key and
the sender uses this key to encrypt the
P text and send it over the network the
recipent uses the same key to decrypt
the cipher text and retrieve the
original information and now we'll see
the example of symmetric encryption
algorithms that is Advanced encryption
standard AES and the next is data
encryption standard Dees and then comes
triple Dees so these are the examples of
symmetric encryption algorithms so now
we'll talk about the pros of symmetric
encryption it is faster than asymmetric
encryption due to less computational
complexity and is ideal for application
with data needs to be encrypted and
decrypted quickly and talking about
conses so key distribution is a
challenge security exchanging the key
between parties can be risky and
impractical or insecure channels and
scalability can be an issue between each
pair of users that needs a unique key
now coming to asymmetric encryption so
asymmetric encryption also known as
public key cryptography uses two
different Keys a public key and a
private key the public key is shared
with everyone but the private key is
kept secret by its owner so let's see
how a symmetric encryption works so the
sender uses the recipent public key to
encrypt the message the message can only
be decrypted by the reant private key
which is not shared and remains
confidential let's see the examples of
asymmetric encryption algorithm the
example are RSA that is D set Shamir at
lman ECC elliptic curve cryptography
then comes digital signature algorithm
DSA now talking about Pros so it solves
the key distribution problem public keys
can be freely distributed and posted in
public directories without compromising
security and it enables digital
signatures which not only protect
against tempering but also verify the
identity of the sender then comes cones
it is slower than symmetric encryption
due to the complexity of the
mathematical operations in mod and it
requires more computational resources
which can be a constraint in resource
limited environments and it is used in
network security both symmetric and
asymmetric encryption are used often
complementarily and symmetric encryption
is used for the bulk encryption of data
because of its efficiency and asymmetric
encryption is used for securely
exchanging the keys necessary for
symmetric encryption and for
authentication processes now coming to
practical implementation questions and
moving to the question number seven and
the question is how would you configure
a VLAN on a Cisco switch so let's start
with the VLAN so a vlen that is virtual
local area network is a logically
segmented Network within a switch by
dividing a network into V lens you can
group devices even if they are not
connected to the same network switch and
control traffic patterns and network
segmentation now we see the steps to
configure a vand on a Cisco switch so
the number one step is access the switch
connect to the Cisco switch via console
cable or through SSH or tnet to remote
access this provides a command line
interface for configuration the next
step is enter Global configuration mode
and after logging into the switch enter
the global configuration mode by typing
that is enable configure terminal so
this mode allows you to make changes
that affect the entire switch now mve to
the next step that is create the VLAN so
vlans are identified by unique numbers
that is VLAN IDs for example to create
VL 10 we can use the command V 10 and
you can also assign a name to this V for
easier identification and management so
we are naming it as marketing so the
next step is assign ports to the VLAN
assign switch ports to the newly created
VLAN to include devices into the segment
for instance to assign Port fast
ethernet 0/1 to V 10 execute the code
that I'm showing you that is interface
fast ethernet 0/1 switch Port mode
access switch Port access VL 10 so
repeat this process for any other ports
you want to add to VL 10 after that
verify the VLAN configuration after
configuration it's good practice to
verify that the vline is set up
correctly so you will use the command
show vline brief so this command
displays all V lens on the switch and
the port assigned to each VL and then
save the configuration to ensure the
configuration is not on reboot save it
using right memory and then
alternatively you can use
copy running config startup config so
let's see a practical example imagine
you are setting up a network in an
office with different departments like
marketing and HR by configuring vlans
you can ensure the devices in the
marketing department do not see traffic
from HR enhancing security and traffic
management and now we'll see the
significance of VLAN so VLAN play a
critical role in managing a large
Network by segregating traffic enhancing
performance and increasing security for
Network administrators mastering VL
configuration on Cisco switches is
fundamental ensuring efficient and
secure network operations so
understanding how to configure V lens is
not just about technical knowhow it's
about creating a network environment
that is optimized secure and tailored to
the specific needs of an organization so
now moving on from configuring V lens on
a Cisco switch and let's tackle a common
Network issue that is troubleshooting
slow connectivity slow Network
performance can frustrate users and
hinder business operations making
efficient trouble shooting essential so
let's move to next question that is
question number eight that is describe
the steps to troubleshoot a network
where users are experiencing slow
connectivity and the steps to do that is
that is number one step connectivity in
a network and identify the scope of the
problem determine if the problem is
affecting one user a group of users or
the entire network this helps isolate
whether the issue is local to a specific
device switch or widespread through the
network then check physical connection
verify that all cables including
ethernet and power cables are securely
connected and not damaged check for
loose connections or signs of Veer and
tier that could affect data transmission
and then you can move to assess Network
utilization use network monitoring tools
to check current traffic flows and
utilization levels on network devices
High utilization might indicate
excessive bandwidth consumption or a
potential denial of service that is do
attack then review Hardware performance
inspect the status of routers switch and
other network devices for any signs of
Hardware failure or performance
degradation check system logs for any
error message or Warnings then test the
network speed conduct speed test to
measure the actual data transfer rates
across the network compare these rates
with expected performance levels to
determine if they are within acceptable
limits then analyze the quality of
service Q settings if your network uses
qos policies to prioritize traffic
ensure these settings are configured
correctly and misconfigured qos can lead
to non priority traffic consuming too
much bandwidth then inspect DNS and DHCP
configurations slow or faulty DNS
responses can cause delays ensure the
DNS servers are operating correctly
check the DHCP Scopes and Lease time to
ensure IP addresses are being assigned
effectively then evaluate the network
design consider the possibility of
design flows contributing to Bott legs
this could include inadequate switch
capacity improper routing configuration
or lack of sufficient redundancy and
then check for external issues if your
network relies on external services such
as Cloud platforms or external DNS
verify that these services are not
contributing to the latency then check
the service status pages and network
announcements for any ongoing issues and
then we have update firmware and
software ensure that all network devices
are running the latest firmware and
software versions outdated softwares can
lead to Performance issues and
vulnerabilities and then the step is
consult system logs and SNMP data review
logs for any signs of anomalies or
recing patterns that could indicate the
root cause of the problem SNMP data can
provide insights into the performance of
network devices over time and then comes
the step isolate and test Network
segments if possible isolate parts of
the network to see if performance
improves this can help pinpoint the
location of the fold then comes the step
seek user feedback communicate with
users to determine if changes or
specific activities correlate with the
Slowdown user reports can provide clues
that help in diagnosing the issue so
conclusion and follow after identifying
and addressing the issue monitor the
network to ensure that performance has
returned to acceptable levels keep users
informed of the resolution and any steps
they can take to avoid or report similar
issues in the future so this was all
about question number eight now we move
to question number nine that is write a
python script to pass a log file and
find all the field SSH login attempts so
start with that is scanning through a
systems SSH log files to detect any
report any fade login attempts so this
can help in auditing security and
identifying potential unauthorized
access attempts so if a interviewer ask
you this question you could follow the
steps that would be the first step is
set up your environment Ure you have
python installed on your system you can
use any text editor or any ID like pyam
or vs code to write your script so let's
move the python script so we have a
python script here so this is the python
script to find out the failed SSH login
attempts so the line one here is import
re so this Line Imports Python's
built-in re module which provides
support for regular expressions and
regular expressions are powerful tools
for matching text patterns this module
isn't actually used in the simple
version of the script but is often
necessary for more complex pattern
matching which might be needed for
different log file formats on more
specific search criteria and then coming
to line three and four so this defines a
function named findor Fiore SSH that
login takes one parameter that is log
file uncore path this parameter is
expected to be a string representing the
path to the log file that the function
will read and analyze now coming to line
five and six so this Line opens the file
located at log file unor path in read
mode that is r and this with open as
statement is used for handling the file
object this approach ensures that the
file is properly closed after its suit
finishes even if error occurs during the
process then comes line seven and 8 this
is for Loop that iterates over each line
in the file and line represents the
current line in the file for each
iteration of the loop now coming to line
9 and 10 so inside the loop this line
checks if the substring that is failed
password is found in the current Line
This substring is commonly present in
Unix like systems that is log files then
there is a failed SSH login attempt
making it a good indic to search for now
coming to line 11 that is if the
substring failed password is found in
line so this line of code executes
printing the line to the console this
output could be redirected to another
file or processed further but in the
simple script it is directly displayed
to the user now coming to line 13 and 14
so this sets the variable logor file
path to the string that is pathore 2/
authorization. log which should be
replaced with the actual path to to the
log file you want to analyze so this
path is commonly that is where SL log
authorization. log on lenux systems for
the authentication logs which include
SSH login attempts now coming to line 16
so this line calls the findor fieldcore
sshor logins function that pass in log
file path as the argument this initiates
the execution of the function with the
specified log file path and the script
starts processing the log file according
to the defined logic so this script
provides a straightforward approach to
scanning log files for specific entries
and a common task in network security
monitoring and auditing so now moving to
question number 10 that is how would you
use a script to automatically back up
network configuration from multiple
devices so first we'll find the
essential components that is python for
writing the script paramiko that is a
python library for handling SSH version
two connections then Crone a Time based
job scheduler in Unix like computer
operating systems to schedule scripts at
regular intervals now we see the steps
to create the script so the number one
step is set up python environment that
is install Python and ensure it's
configured correctly on your system then
install paramiko using pip bash that is
PIP install paramiko then we'll write
the script to backup configuration so
here's the script so first we importing
paramiko and then we are importing OS
and from date time we are importing date
time so we have a function here that is
backup _ device config so this function
takes in the device host name username
password and optionally a command that
is defaulted to show running config
which is common in Cisco devices it logs
into the device via SSH runs the command
to get the current configuration and
saves it to a file named with the host
name and the current time stamp then
comes SSH client setup use paramiko to
handle the SSH connection execute the
command and write the output to a file
then we're using the loop over devices
so this script provides a list of
devices each represented as a dictionary
with necessary login credentials and it
Loops over this list to back up each
device and then we have automate script
execution so to automate the script
schedule it using Crone on a Linux
system that is edit the Chrome tab with
con tab minus C and add a line like this
to run the script daily at 1:00 a.m.
I'll show you how you can write that
that is 01
star
slash SL Ben SL
python slash path slash2 slash here you
will run your script so this is how you
can run your script so now if we see the
benefits of automation that is
reliability it ensures that backups are
taken consistently without human
intervention the next is timeliness
backups can be scheduled to ensure that
they are always up to date and the next
is scalability easy easy to add more
devices into the backup processes by
updating the device list so using a
script like this simplifies the
management of network configurations and
enhances the operational reliability by
ensuring that up-to-date backups are
always available for Disaster Recovery
purposes so let's move to question
number 11 and your question is create a
function in Python that calculates the
subnet mask given a c notation so there
will be steps to provide this and you
can answer the interviewer that we can
start with the c notation that is
understanding cidr notation so you can
see that that c notation specifies the
number of bits set to one in the subnet
mask for example SL 24 means the first
24 bits of the subnet mask are set to
one then comes the converting cidr to
subnet mask so you have to create a
32-bit binary number with the first n
Bits set to one where n is the number
from the cide notation so let's move to
the code and see how we can proceed with
C annotations so as you can see that the
first line that is defining a function
so this line defines a function named C
_ 2or sub netore mask that takes one
argument cidr which is expected to be a
string representing a network address in
C notation example 1
192.168 do10 Dot and then we come across
extracting prefix length so here we'll
be extracting the prefix length so here
we have cidr do split slash one that
splits the C string at the Slash and
takes the second part that is index one
which is the prefix length and that is
number of bits in the subnet mask then
we have int that has an argument cidr do
split that converts this prefix length
from a string to an integer and this
operation is wrapped in a tri block to
handle cases with a conversion might
fail and if a value error is C the
function returns an error message
prompting the user to provide the cidr
in the correct format then we'll create
the binary mask and with this code
snippet we will create the binary mask
that creates a string of 1 s that is as
long as the prefix length for example if
prefix length is 24 this results in 24
consecutive 1 s then comes o this
creates a string of zeros for the
remaining bits in a standard 32-bit
address for a prefix length of 24 this
result in 8 O and these two strings are
concatenated to form a complete 32bit
binary mask representing the subnet mask
now we'll start with converting binary
to decimal so the loop iterates or the
binary mask string in step of 8 Bits and
the binary underscore mask extracts each
octet from the binary mask and int o
comma 2 converts the binary string octet
to a decimal string and here you can see
that subnet do mask subnet ma to append
this has the argument and this converts
the decimal integer to a string which
which is then appended to the subnet
unor mask list and then we are forming
subnet mask so this joins all the
elements in the subnet mask list into a
single string separated by dots forming
the final subnet mask in doted decimal
notation and then we have the example
usage so this snippet demonstrates how
to use the function it provides a c an
notation calls the function to convert
it into a subnet mask and prints the
result so in summary this function
efficiently converts C notation into a
subnet mask handling potential input
errors and Performing binary to decimal
conversion to produce a standard subnet
mask format this is a practical tool for
network configuration and Analysis task
so now moving to question number 12 so
the question number 12 is design a
network topology for a company that has
three branches and a central data center
so you can answer this question by
explaining an example that imagine you
are in charge of setting up the network
for a company with three branch offices
and a Cal data center so there's a
simple way to think about it first we
will set up the components of the
network that is Central Data Center and
what it is is it's the main Hub where
all critical components applications
databases and services are hosted and
the key parts that is high performance
servers storage systems core switches
which connect all devices there are
firewalls and multiple internet
connections for reliability then comes
the branch offices so what they are they
are offices that need to to connect to
the central Data Center and provide
network access for employees and the key
parts are access switches that are
connect devices within the office
routers that connect the branch to the
central Network then comes fireballs and
possibly local servers and then comes
connecting everything so there are ban
links these are the dedicated
connections between each branch and the
central data center uring secure and
reliable Communications then there comes
the backup links redundant connections
to keep things running smoothly if the
main link fails then comes the security
in which we have Fireballs that protect
the network by controlling incoming and
outgoing traffic and preventing
unauthorized access and then we have VPN
virtual private networks that secure the
communication between branches and the
data center over the internet and after
that we have IP addressing that has
subnets different subnets for each
branch and the data center help organize
and manage IP addresses preventing
conflicts now we'll see the simple
diagram for the network and we'll think
of the network like this this so here's
our Central Data Center branch one
branch 2 and Branch 3 so let's see the
benefits of the network topology the
number one benefit is scalability it is
easy to add more branches or expand
existing ones without major changes then
comes rund dency and shows continuous
operation even if one connection fails
then comes the security that protects
data with fireballs and VPN and then we
have the efficiency that optimizes how
data flows across the network so this
design helps keep all branches connect
Ed to the central data center securely
and efficiently ensuring smooth
operations and secure data access for
the entire company now that you have an
idea of how to design a network topology
for a company with multiple branches and
a central data center let's explore
another important aspect that is
ensuring data redundency this is
especially crucial for Industries like
Financial Services the data integrity
and availability are Paramount so the
next question is that is question number
13 so how would you ensure data redund
dency in a network designed for a
financial service provider so ensuring
data redundency means having multiple
copies of data so that if one copy is
lost or corrupted the other can be used
for a financial service provider this is
critical to maintain trust and
continuous operations so now we'll see
the key strategies for data redundancy
and you can also tell the interviewer
the same strategies so starting with
number one that is data backups so
regular backups that is schedule
frequent backups of all critical data
this could be daily hourly or even real
time depending on the importance of the
data then we have offsite backups stored
backups in a different physical location
to protect against sight specific
disasters like fires or floods then
comes the raid that is redundant array
of independent disk so there are raid
levels so use Raid configurations like
raid 1 raid five or RAID 10 on storage
devices to duplicate data across
multiple dis this ures data availability
even if one dis fails then comes Network
redundancy and there are multiple paths
design the network with multiple
Pathways for data to travel if one path
fails data can take another route use
redundant network connections example
multiple isps to ensure continuous
connectivity now moving to the next
strategy that is load balancers use load
balancers to distribute Network traffic
across multiple servers or paths
preventing any single point of failure
then comes data replication in this we
have real time replication use realtime
data replication to create a live copy
of data on another server or data center
this ensures that data is immediately
available in case of a primary server
failure then we have asynchronous
replication for Less critical data a
synchronous replication can be used
where data is coped at regular intervals
and after that we have cloud services so
utilize cloud storage services for
backup and redundency many Cloud
providers offers robust redundency
options with geographically dispersed
data centers and we also have hybrid
Cloud that can combine on premises and
cloud storage to create a hybrid
solution that benefits from the
flexibility and rency of the cloud while
maintaining control over critical data
on premises so let's see the design for
data dcy and this is the design here we
have primary data centers that are
houses critical applications of data
then we have secondary data center that
act as a fail over sight replicating
data from the primary Center in real
time and then we have Storage Solutions
in which we have raid arrays that
Implement raid configurations for all
criticals storage devices and then we
have regular backups that schedule
backups to both local storage and
offsite locations and you can see the
network configurations there are
redundant connections that use multiple
internet connections and network paths
to ensure continuous connectivity and
you can see the load balancers here so
they distribute traffic across multiple
servers to avoid overloading any single
server and then we do the data
replication and in this we have realtime
replication that Implement real-time
data replication between the primary and
secondary data centers so now now let's
discuss the benefits of this design the
number one is high availability multiple
copies of data ensure that it's always
available even if one copy is lost
number two is disaster recovery offsite
and Cloud backups provide a safety net
in case of a disaster at the primary
location then comes continuous
operations redundant Network paths and
real-time data replication help maintain
operations without interruptions this
design ensures that a financial service
providers data remains safe available
and intact even in the face of Hardware
failures network issues or site specific
disasters and after understanding how to
ensure data redundancy for critical
operations let's switch our Focus to
designing wireless networks especially
for office spaces effective wireless
network designs ensures that all users
have reliable and fast connectivity
essential for productivity and
collaboration so your next question is
what wireless network design
considerations would you suggest for a
large open Office Space so you can start
answering this question that designing a
wireless network for a large open Office
space requires careful planning to
ensure robust coverage high performance
and security so we'll consider some key
considerations and the considerations
are number one coverage and capacity so
that includes site survey where we
conduct a thoro site survey to
understand the layout potential sources
of interference and areas with high user
density use tools to map signal strength
and identify dead zones and then we have
access point placement strategically
place APS to ensure complete coverage in
a large open Office APS should be placed
at regular intervals to provide
overlapping coverage areas and prevent
dead Sports and then we have
interference Management in that we have
Channel planning that use non
overlapping channels to reduce
interference between APS in the 2.4 GHz
band use Channel 1 6 and 11 for the 5
GHz band more channels are available
allowing for better separation and then
we have the avoid physical obstructions
that positions APS to avoid
interferences from bowls furniture and
other obstructions that can beaken the
signals and then we have another
consideration that is Network
performance and inside that we have
bandwidth requirement so estimate the
bandwidth requirement based on the
number of users and the types of
applications they will use and then plan
for Peak usage times and after that we
have AP density and show a sufficient
number of APs to handle the expected
number of simultaneous connections high
density environments may require more
APS to maintain performance and the next
consideration is Security in security we
have the encryption that use strong
encryption methods like wpa3 to protect
the wireless network from unauthorized
access and after that we have
authentication that Implement robust
authentication mechanisms such as
802.1x with radius to ensure only
authorized users can access the network
and then we have the guest Network that
provide a separate guest network with
limited access to protect the main
network from potential security threats
and after that the next consideration is
scalability that focuses on future
growth in that we have the design for
the network to accommodate future growth
in the number of users and devices
ensure that the infrastructure can be
easily expanded and the modular design
use a modular approach where additional
APS and network resources can be added
without significant redesign and then we
have the quality of service in that we
have prioritization Implement Qs
policies to prioritize critical
applications like viip and video
conferencing and ensuring they have the
necessary bandwidth and low latency and
then we have load balancing use load
balancing to distribute clients evenly
across APS preventing any single AP from
becoming overloaded so here is the
diagram of a wireless network layout and
you could see the AP Channel 1 AP
Channel 2 AP Channel 11 AP Channel 6 and
the AP Channel 1 so the benefits of this
design is comprehensive coverage that
ensures that the entire office space has
strong and reliable Wi-Fi coverage the
next is high performance adequate AP
placement and channel planning prevent
interferences and congestion ensuring
High Network performance so with that
we'll move to the next question that is
question number 15 and your question is
write a python script that list all
devices on the same network so let's
move to the visual studio code and have
a look on our code snippet so here first
we will import the SC Library so this
Line Imports all functions and classes
from the scap Library which is a
powerful python Library used for Network
packet manipulation and analy
then we are defining a function that is
scan so this line defines a function
with one parameter that is IP which
prevents the IP address or range to scan
then we're creating the ARP request so
this line that is ARP request equal to
SCP so this creates an ARP request
packet the pdst parameter specifies the
target IP address or range to scan ARP
is used to map IP addresses to magc
addresses then we'll create the ethernet
frame so this line creates ethernet
frame with the broadcast destination
that is the MAC address and this address
ensures that the packet is sent to all
devices in the network segment after
that we are combining the frames and
sending and receiving the packets and
then we have the initialization of
Client List and after that we will Loop
through responses so we'll extract IP
and Mac addresses and for each response
this line that is client _ dict this
line extracts The Source IP addresses
that is psrc and The Source Hardware Mac
addresses from the ARP response it
stores these values in a dictionary with
key IP and mac and then we'll add the
client to the list so this will append
the dictionary containing the IP and Mac
addresses of the discovered device to
The Client List after that we'll return
The Client List after processing all
responses this will return the list of
discovered devices each represented by a
dictionary containing its IP and Mac
address and then we have the function
definition this line defines a function
named displore result that takes one
parameter that is result _ list which is
a list of dictionaries containing the IP
and Mac address of discover devices and
after that we'll print the header and
that will print for the output
indicating the columns for IP addresses
and Mac addresses separated by tabs so
in summary this script uses SCP to
perform an ARP scan of a specified IP
range identifying devices on the network
by their IP and Mac addresses it sends a
broadcast ARP request collects responses
and prints the list of discovered
devices in a readable format now moving
to the next question that is question
number 16 and your question is create a
simple pocket server in Python that can
accept connections and send responses to
clients now moving back to visual studio
code we'll see the code snippet for that
so first we are importing the socket
module so this is the python buil-in
socket module which provides access to
the BSD socket interface and this module
is essential for Network programming and
allows for the creation of socket based
communication and this this line creates
the socket object so this specifies the
address family for the socket and aore
in refers to the IP V4 protocol and then
we specify the socket type that is soore
stream that indicates the socket will be
a TCP socket which is connection
oriented and reliable then we'll use a
variable that is silvercore Socket that
holds the socket object that will be
used to listen for incoming connections
and then we'll bind the socket to
address and P
so this tle specifies the address and
port on which the server will listen and
after that we will listen for incoming
connections so this specifies the
maximum number of cued connections that
is five if more than five connection
attempts are made before any are
accepted the exess connection attempts
may be refused and after that we'll
print the server status so this will
print a message to the console
indicating that the server is up and
running and ready to accept connections
so in summary this script creates a
simple TCP server that listens for
connections on Local Host that is
127.0.0.1 at port9 when a client
connects the server accepts the
connection prints the client's address
sends a welcome message to the client
and then closes the connection the
server continues to run indefinitely
handling each new connection in turn so
with that we have come to the next
question that is question number 17 and
your question is write a function in
Python to Ping a specified host and
return true if it is a up and Falls if
it is down so let's break down and we'll
move to vs code and have a code snippet
for that so first we are importing the
OS module that provides a way to
interact with the operating system and
in this script the OS do system function
will be used to execute system commands
then we'll Define the function and name
it as isore hostor up that takes one
parameter that is IP which is a string
representing the IP address of the host
to be pinged after that we'll execute
the Ping command with this line so this
function executes the specified command
that is in this case a ping command in
the operating systems command line
interface is applied after that we'll
return the response and if the response
is equal to equal to zero this checks if
the response has exit status and this
will return true if the response is zero
that is the host is up and false
otherwise the host is down so let's see
the example IP address so we have an IP
address here and after that will check
the whole status and then we print the
whole status whether it is up or down so
in summary this script defines a
function that checks if a given IP
address is reachable by sending a single
ping request to it and the function
returns true if the host response to the
Ping and Fs otherwise so the script then
uses this function to check the status
of the IP address and prints the result
to the console so with that we will move
to the next question that is question
number 18 and your question is what is
the denial of service attack and how can
it be prevented so you can start
answering this question with the
definition of dose attack so a denial of
service that is dose attack is a common
type of cyber threat that aims to make a
website or network service unavailable
to its intendent users the goal is to
overwhelm the target with a flood of
useless traffic or request which can
cause the system to slow down
significantly or crash denying service
to legitimate users so how do attack
Works let's let imagine a small shop
with only one cashier if a Bus full of
people arrives and everyone gets in line
the cashier will be overwhelmed and
service will slow down now imagine if
most of those people didn't intend to
buy anything but just stood there
legitimate customers can't get through
the line because of the crowd that's
similar to what happens during a dose
attack so let's move to the types of
dose attacks the number one is volume
based attacks these include UDP floods
ICM floods and other SPO packet floods
the attacks goal is to saturate the
bandwidth of the attacked side then we
have protocol attacks so these include
SN floods fragmented packet attacks and
ping of death and are aimed at
exploiting server resources and at
number three we have application layered
attacks so these include low and slow
attacks that have get and post floods
and more targeting the web application
lay so understanding and preventing dose
attacks involve both technical measures
like upgrading hardware and using
firewall configuration and strategic
measures like planning for redundancy
and using external Doos protection
services so by preparing and protecting
your network you can ensure that it
remains reliable and available to
legitimate users even under attack so
with that we'll move to the next
question that is question number 19 and
your question is how do quality of
service that is qos parameters affect
Network traffic management so you can
start with the definition of qos that is
it's a technology used in networks to
ensure that certain types of traffic get
priority for others ensuring Optimal
Performance for critical applications
especially when the network is congested
so now we see the key ways that Qs
affects Network traffic Management
number one is traffic prioritization so
Qs allows Network administrators to
priortize traffic for example voice and
video traffic can be prioritized over
email or file downloads this ensures
that applications requiring realtime
data like VIP calls or live video
streams receive higher priority and
maintain quality or during high traffic
periods then comes bandwidth allocation
so Qs can control how much bandwidth is
allocated to different types of traffic
critical applications can be granted a
certain amount of bandwidth ensuring
they always perform well then we have
traffic shaping this involves regulating
the network data transfer to ensure a
smooth flow of traffic rather than burst
of data that can lead to congestion
traffic shaping can help manage the data
load and improve overall Network
performance then comes congestion
management and aidance so so Qs
mechanisms help manage Network
congestion by determining which traffic
is dropped or delayed in a congested
Network this helps prevent overall
network degradation and maintains the
performance of Priority Services after
that we have minimizing latency and
Jitter by prioritizing time sensitive
data packets Qs reduces latency and
Jitter that is variance And Delay which
is crucial for applications like
interactive video games or
teleconferencing so let's consider an
example consider a corporate network
with both data heav applications and
real-time communication platforms are
used by implementing qos the network
Administration ensures that the video
conferences calls get priy or large file
downloads this means that during a team
video call even if someone start
downloading a large file the quality of
the video call won't suffer because the
network is configured to prioritize it
so with that we will move to the next
question that is question number 20 so
your question is can you explain the
role of a routing protocol in a converge
Network so you can start answering that
routing protocols play a vital role in
any network including converg networks
which integrate voice video data and
even Wireless Services into a single
Network infrastructure and these
protocols help in directing data packets
between Network nodes by determining the
best paths for data transmission now
we'll see the key roles of routing
protocols in a Converse Network the
number one role is path determination so
routing protocols analyze various paths
through the network and choose the best
path for data packets to travel this is
crucial in a converged network with
different types of traffic may have
different priority and bandwidth needs
then we have efficiency and optimization
in converged networks routing protocols
optimize the use of network paths which
is essential for maintaining high
performance across various types of
services example ensuring video streams
are smooth while simultaneously handling
highspeed data transfers then comes the
scalability as Network demands grow
routing protocols adapt to changes they
can handle increased traffic and
dynamically adjust routes as the network
expands or as new devices and services
are added then we have resilience and
full tolerance routing protocols enhance
Network resilience and for tolerance by
quickly rerouting traffic in the event
of a link or a node failure this is
particularly important in convers
networks with downtime can significantly
impact various integrated Services then
we have Qs service support some Advanced
routing protocols can recognize
different types of traffic and treat
them according to their Qs requirements
for instance they can prioritize voice
over IP traffic or standard data packets
to reduce latency and improve call
Quality let's say an example in a
converged Network within a large
Enterprise routing protocols manage the
flow of data voice and video between
Corporate Offices data centers and
external cloud services for example if a
primary link used for video conferencing
data fails the routing protocol can
automatically redirect this traffic to a
secondary path without interrupting the
ongoing conference so in conclusion we
have routing protocols these are The
Navigators of a convers network and
intelligently directing traffic to
ensure efficient reliable And Timely
delivery of various types of data their
ability to dynamically adjust to the
network conditions and priorties makes
them indispensable in today's complex
and multi-service network requirements
