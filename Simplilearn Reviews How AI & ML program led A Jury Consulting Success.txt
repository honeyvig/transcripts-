hi my name is Sam Holmes and I'm a
social psychologist and jury consultant
based in Memphis Tennessee if you ever
seen that television show on CVS or i on
television with that guy who used to
play on NCIS that's kind of what I do as
to fun in my life I love spending time
with the people I love my pets traveling
especially to catch a great show on
Broadway with my family and to help my
dad cheer on his beloved New York Yanke
and I also love riding awesome roller
coasters but my work is also fun and I
really enjoy what I do part of my job
that I love is helping my clients who
are mostly corporate attorneys learn how
to listen to understand and talk to
juries who are made up of everyday
people like you and me in a way that's
respectful and persuasive but another
part of my job which I also love is
developing statistical models that can
help my clients accurately identify
during jury selection the kinds of
jurors who are likely to be favorable to
their clients as well as those who are
likely not to be as favorable I always
had an interest in learning about
cuttingedge Technologies but a chance
encounter with one of my favorite
clients motivated me to take action and
start gaining practical knowledge about
artificial intelligence and machine
learning one day my client asked me how
can AI be used in Jury Research
I told her honestly I don't know but I'm
going to find
out Ai and machine learning are becoming
an integral part of legal practice and
as a premier legal strategy consulting
firm I knew it was important for me and
my firm to learn how Ai and ml can be
part of our Consulting practice as well
so that we can continue to be on The
Cutting Edge of strategic Innovation for
our clients but I needed to find the
right program that could help me learn
about Ai and ml that's where simply
learn came in simply learn helped me to
grow from being merely curious about AI
to gaining certification in applied Ai
and data science from an Ivy League
institution in a matter of weeks I admit
I was a little nervous about going back
to school it's been a while since I
completed my doctorate but simply learn
made learning well simple and easy to
fit into my busy work schedule
simply learn helped me not only satisfy
an intellectual curiosity but also an
even more importantly gave me the skills
tools and confidence to help our clients
use modern technology to be more
persuasive communicators it also helped
me contribute to the growth of our firm
in a novel and impactful way and for
that I am very grateful the world is
changing rapidly so it's important to
stay current simply learn can help you
move your skills to the next level
