hello everybody and welcome once again
we all are back with some very
interesting feature of mongodb and that
is called connecting your mongodb with
some application
so
today we have decided whatever in our
previous demonstrations i have shown you
we will help you to connect your mongodb
with the front end that is called python
as we know it very well about the
popularity of python in last recent
years it is growing like anything so we
thought why not to offer you
this connectivity where you can have
the mongodb
not in a local environment but in a
cloud environment so here we will tell
you how to create the mongodb
complete environment
of cluster in your cloud
and we can have
this connectivity with our python which
is running local to my system so i show
you what few important things
one by one
so
why python mongodb
we understand mongodb is one of the most
important
database which is so called document
based database available in market and
it is fantastic phenomenal in terms of
speed and the reliability
it is purely called nosql database
okay and helps you to go schema less
now python is one of the most commonly
user-friendly programming language for
creating a complete web-based framework
so it offers you huge amount of
libraries with flexibility of connecting
wide variety of applications
so we would like to give you the idea of
like how python and mongodb works
together okay
so you can
use both the
products together to develop
different varieties of
applications which can suits
to different type of ideas now here we
have one of the very very popular tool
available name called pi
so pi is actually the python
library which is a kind of a driver
through which you will be able to
connect with your mongodb and perform
basic operations whichever you expect
okay so let's go ahead and start working
on those demos okay
so we will start with
creating a mongodb environment
with cluster in one of the very very
popular tool that is known is called
mongodb atlas so we'll be opening our
website
and go here and talk about call
mongodb
atlas
i search for mongodb atlas that is
basically the mongodb
where i called database as a service
i'll be selecting the first option
and go to the start free because it's
going to offer you by default some 500
db of free space
i say sign up with google
going ahead and selecting this
okay i say accept
and say
submit
okay so it's starting up now
it'll ask you about a few things
i would rather say to select skip
and continue
well it will ask you about which
environment you would like to take so
i like to take this shared cluster i say
create cluster
now here it will take a while to get
yourself ready for we can see it is
offering the sandbox of having five
columbia free space
and this mongodb
no backup that is the by default cluster
name you can give the name of the
cluster if you want but let it be y d
for cluster zero i'm saying create
cluster
so my cluster is being ready so it will
take a while to get your cluster set up
so just wait till the timer cluster is
getting ready so i tell you what this
cluster is going to give you
by default two child and one parent so
called a one master and two
child nodes where your cluster will get
ready
so
you really don't need to set up any kind
of cluster in your local environment and
that is the best environment i would
suggest for
most of your development where your time
reduce
there will be no software requirement
because sometimes version 2 version
changes
and you can get all the benefits of
clusters
so we're just waiting till the time the
cluster is getting
ready so once the cluster is ready you
will be seeing some options
where
will help you to create the clusters in
your upcoming demos
so friends your cluster is now ready
you can see now in this cluster you have
got this
environment so in this environment you
will see there are some options they
have given you one by one
build up your cluster create a first
database user
add an ip address multiple options they
are telling you now so how to set up so
the first build of the cluster which we
have anyways done next is called create
your first database user select this
so it will highlight this area now you
can say like database access
and
i'm going to create a first new database
user and new database user given there
is a name for admin
let's keep very simple username and
password admin
one two three so admin admin one two
three
yeah same
and same add user
now i can see
the user is
created now let's go back to the next
option
it's telling me the network access now
go here
and say
sorry
now say add ip
address and
i'll say allow access from anywhere
so that i can take it from anywhere
i say confirm
now it is telling me about the progress
i select this
now tell me about which type of
collections you want
okay so i select this
and inside this i'll be selecting this
called collections
okay
and uh it's getting
ready
so it is giving me some options
well two options that will give you load
sample data set add my own data i'll say
add my own data give the database name
sl demo
give the collection name emp or employee
remember
database name sl demo or i can better
give the name called srdb
sldb and employ i say create
that is getting ready
okay so my database table is ready
that's it
so i think
we are all set
with this environment
okay
well once it is ready your collection is
also ready i'll go back and click on my
project zero
and here
yeah so once it is there then i'll be
clicking on this option called
connect
now it'll give me the multiple options
how to connect
so it will say correct for the
shell or it will say connect with your
application correct using compass
i'll select
the python
python version
3.11 or later so certainly i'll be using
those version only
okay and uh
in this i'm having this
if i will be using this to connect with
my back end
so that's how exactly you have
the setup of mongodb cluster
everyone so we are all ready now with
our
setup
cluster we have already created earlier
you remember about we have taken python
3.11 or later
so here if i just go back and check
i have a god
3.8.5 which is python 3 version which is
available
so you can select based on
whichever we have it let's say 3.11 or
later we can say 3.6
or later so there'll be no much
difference if i just see
even if i just talk about 3.4 there's
some change but here 3.6 or later
it is same so i have a 3.8.5
okay so
i can use the same option
so here in my
vs core editor i am using for my
development so here is a simple demo dot
pi i have used welcome to check if it is
working fine so yes it is working fine
i'll start working with my first program
with mongodb so i just go back and say
demo
py or i can say
[Music]
py
demo
dot py
okay
and here if i want to go back and start
working on the development remember one
thing we need
first dependency called pi
okay what i need pi
 and for this we have already
installed this dependency here
sometime back this is how you need to
install
okay so we have this statement name
called what pip installed by mongol
that is the first dependency which you
need to download in order to work with
this
okay
so
that's what we have taken this is
installed by so if you just see
you can go back and start
developing this statement
okay so let's go back and start working
on this
step number one you need to always say
import
number one the one dependence which
you've installed is called pi
so
as you can just say p by m o n g o
that is the dependency we have recently
imported
from
okay let me go back and search from next
point so import pi
from
here we are saying pi
okay pi
and we're also saying import
 client
that's the first thing you need to
remember
okay after that we would like to go back
and use the cluster
so we say cluster
equal to
 client and here i'll be passing
the complete values the one which we
have taken
so this complete line
i just take it
go back
and here
i'm pasting it
now here
i have to basically replace this
password with admin 123
okay and we are all set
okay
now
once it is ready
we can go ahead and define db
equal to
cluster
and provide which database you're
talking about
okay so you remember about we had a
database which was available to us that
is known as call
sltb so i can just use the same sltp
there
and accordingly i can use
which collection i'm connecting it to so
accordingly i can go back and insert a
record okay everybody so i can see i
have got this
file with me going forward i have to
tell so this is what exactly the
connection url you have received now if
you define which database you are
working on
let me say tp equal to
cluster and we have to provide in
double quotes the database name called
sltp if you remember we have used this
after that we have to mention which
collection it was so
collection
equal to
db and here we just give the name call
employee
that was our collection name
so once it is ready then i have to
basically perform some insert operation
so i just say post
okay it's just a name equal to
and here
we just provide the properties
like i would say name
so
you know to the json-based database so i
can just use the name
i say
amer
and once again you can just say
email
and
say
comment
email.com
that's it so this is just the data which
i have now i want to insert so i can
certainly say
collection dot because i want to insert
only one record you can see i have open
functions coming up collections dot
insert one and pass
post
isn't parameter now we are all done
let's try to run this
so i'll be running this with python
three
p by modem dot py
hit enter
now it's done let's confirm
here into my code i will just go back
and check
here inside my
applications i can just go back to my
collections
and in employee
yeah there we go we have got some
records coming up here
okay so these records are nothing but
the one which we have recently inserted
in our application
okay
so fantastic so first example is working
perfectly fine how we can have the
records coming from the python and
insert it there
like that i can have as my number of
records i can
add it
so how we can basically add if i want to
add more than one records
let's see this now here in case if i
want to add more than one records so i
can just use call post one
i copy this url
and paste it below
and i say pause to
i say
i'm saying
email
i'm on one two at the rightmail.com and
rather than saying insert one
i can use
insert many and inside this i'll be
using this square brackets
and pass
post
post one corner
post two
that's it
okay so let's change the little name
because it's already there
let's insert
yep records are inserted let me verify
once again
by refreshing it
well now we have a total number of three
records are available
yeah there we go so records are added
perfect so like this you can have
as my number of records you can
basically add it in a similar one the
way we have basically used this i can
also perform
the search part too
okay so in case if you want to perform
the search part we have a very simple
statement available with us what
i'll go here
the way we have added this so
in this i'll just
these records which are added inside my
application i would not execute this
rather
i would like to go back and say
now they are basically commented now
and
in fact i would like to use this also
okay i will go here
and
find results
results equal to
same collection
dot
find if i want to find a name we can
just use
curly braces
name
colon
[Music]
okay
so let me say print
and terms
results
okay let's run this
okay so it'll print what
the results for me
okay so
it is just printing what the cursor
object for me saying hey this is what a
record is available to me we can also
change in case if we do not think the
correct result is coming up we can also
go back
and
we can use some alternative option that
is called foil
okay so what we can do let's take a look
here
we can use for
with this for i can say result
okay in
results
and
print this result
that could be one option through which
you can get the details with you
okay so what you can do you can run this
code again
i forgot to put this
semicolon here
or
we need to check
well that was my
requirement was so i'm having this
let's try to run this
well i got my result and this is what
the detail which i have available to me
so
very simple how you can basically find a
record and how you can basically
retrieve the records at the same time if
you want to have the specific field
rather than all the fields so here in my
code in this result
okay you can just put the square bracket
and tell which field you really want it
now suppose if you just want id or else
if you want name
you can basically pick that up
okay so if i just want that
id
only id is printed that's it
everyone so you have seen like in my
previous code how we were basically
trying to fetch all the records we were
using this find
now in a similar line you can also have
the option available because see when we
used to talk about confine it gets me
lot many records
fine and because of that we were using
this loop
but in case if you want to fetch the
individual records
i'll be clear so in such cases you
really do not want to use fine
you can just
use find one
so what you can do is rather than using
find
i can also use one more option called
fine one and for which
i can come back
just remove this all
yeah so here in this case rather than
using this file i can use find
underscore you can see this option
called find one
here we talk about
which are the properties you want to
skip and which of the properties you
want
so i can just use this option called
underscore
idle
okay colon
zero okay i just remove this
undersquared zero and here
just print what
results
that's it let's run
so that will try to fetch some of the
records for you because if you do not
have that id which you overwritten it
will certainly not found it depends on
what you would like to take
so if i just say
is having some issues but no problem but
you know it very well how it basically
takes
now in a similar line we would like to
also perform one more activity
to talk about delete
so for which what i will do is this i
just want to uncomment it
okay and i would like to insert some
records here
so here i want to add the id by my own
with name
so we already have this name
email
i have it i would like to use underscore
id
okay
so
we have this property underscore id
colon
101
okay
comma like this
copy the same
using it here
and this time i'm using
one zero two
name and everything
it'll be taken let me say
user1
here we try to say
user
two
okay so collections dot many result file
one i'm just deleting it all
and uh let's try to
execute it first
okay so it's executed going back
okay so i have some records with ide one
zero and one zero two
now here
i just delete this
and perform some actions here
here we say
results
equal to collection
dot
delete
see the options are available delete one
and delete money it totally depends on
what you really want
okay so if i just talk about call delete
one it will be only deleting one record
delete my enemies where are the matching
records are available to delete it
fine so i'm just using this option
called delete many
okay wherever the property names are
matched cos quite possible name
sometimes match or whatever it is just
then delete many so the option is up to
you now for you want so the selected
name you have to offer it
whether you want to match it with the
name or whether you want to match it
with the email or whatever it is
so that will be offering it but there's
also one option available where you
would like to delete everything
are we clear so if you're planning to
delete everything what you can do you
can just leave it as a blank and try to
run this
so collection
dot delete
underscore remaining
let's check
great all records are deleted
so as i told you earlier also so delete
many means what it will delete all the
records whichever are present in your
code now
clear in a similar one if i want to
perform insert
so you remember about we have an option
called what
insert many
and here
we would like to pass
post one
post to let's execute
so it'll add
the records inside this
okay
and next time what i want to perform
after adding this record i would like to
perform
the update part
okay so
what i really want in my update let's
take a look update means certain
properties i'm looking forward to we get
updated
okay
so
in case if i want to check the record
has to be updated i would first go and
check
whether the record does exist or not
yeah we have two names user one and user
2 let's go back and update bar
here
i just
save collections
okay dot
update 1
update you can see
update one here very simple
functionality
here you will go
and tell which id would like to perform
an update
so i say underscore
id
colon
which i do you want to consider i'm
saying one zero one
okay
and what else
so i just use another curly braces and i
say
sorry dollar
set
and after this
i use this colon
use the curly braces
name
okay and
use whatever you want to use it so
suppose there is a user one i'm saying
users
one two three
okay
let's see
it is loading and you can see the record
user 1v3 is updated
perfect
so
your code is absolutely working fine so
you talk about either insert you talk
about what
update
you talk about anything it works so
insert update one
delete one
insert one as the name suggests they'll
be taken care about inserting updating
and deleting one records but the moment
you use many they'll be performing
multiple records so this is a very
simple way like how the python will
connect with your mongodb
