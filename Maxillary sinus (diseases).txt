yeah this is dr. Srikant from team MDS
conquer now I'm going to discuss about
the diseases of maxillary sinus in this
pathway okay all of you know the most
common thing is sinusitis that is the
inflammation of the mucous membrane of
the sinus and and sinusitis means apart
from the maxillary sinus when it
involves almost all other similar to
your pan site-- opinio right so that is
cornice pants sinusitis so coming to the
theology the most common etiology
I feel these are the two that most
commonly theologist that is the allergy
or immunity related stuff and the
infection related stuff
okay so trauma damage during the surgery
or sometimes abnormal anatomical
abnormalities like deviated national
septum okay DNS and foreign bodies and
some genetic disorders of the wave great
cases and if you want you can make a
note about the bacteria that are
responsible and the virus that are
responsible and the fungus that are
responsible for this maxillary sinusitis
but I feel questions in this area will
be very very rare okay so just make a
note what are the bacteria and what are
the virus and what are the fungus that
are responsible or that can be seen as a
microflora responsible for sinusitis
next comes is the classification acute
sinusitis will be less than four weeks
sub acute will be in the range of four
to twelve whereas the chronic most of
your questions move around chronic that
will be more than twelve weeks okay so
coming to the acute things and most of
the things are well known by you there
will be headache heaviness because
accumulation of lots of mucus and
whenever there is a change in the
position as already discussed this is
innate space whenever there is a change
in a postural position the mucus will
try to move from here to there and cause
some sort of compression and the facial
pain will increases fever and chills are
common nasal blockage or obstruction
leading to the accumulation
difficulty in breathing cough the two
that is associated with that or maybe in
the in that John may have some pain
lymphadenopathy is already discussed
because these are going to drain into
the lymph nodes nearby and coming to the
chronic chronic most of the symptoms I
mean the symptoms everything will be
like activated or get accumulated so
most of your questions move around
chronic the pain will be dull pain on
perversion of the in voltage it's a good
sign
seen so please to add this favor is
common lymphadenopathy is common
heaviness of head is common okay acute
cases you will not help us you will have
inflammation whereas in the chronic
cases you will have pass or the pleural
discharge next course is the fistula is
again the acute case whenever you have
pass you will you will feel a halitosis
or discomfort or or abnormal taste
sensation in your oral cavity so all
these are the very peculiar things which
can be seen only in the chronic cases so
the cases where they have given a case
based patient in your comedy cane that
is about this chronic maxillary
sinusitis and of course in the ames they
have given a radiograph based questions
several times so it's mandatory that you
have to learn the difference between the
acute and chronic how to differentiate
because definitely i cute will be an
option in your question for sure
next comes the tests that are used of
the other diagnostic modalities for this
particular situation it is regularly
performed in a dark room that is a
transamination test where a safety bulb
is inserted into your oral cavity okay
with lips closed and good illumination
indicates the presence of aid in the
sinus but as the failure of the bad
illumination this is a good illumination
bad illumination indicates there is some
sort of pulse or fluid or foreign body
which is obstructing the light to hit
right so this is the transamination test
which is used for diagnosis of sinusitis
so apart from that regularly is the
radiographic sign you can see here so by
which you can diagnose is chronic sinus
acute sinusitis cannot be differentiated
on the radiograph whereas chronic
sinusitis can be differentiated by
having like you feel if you compare one
side to other side this is a unilateral
thing where you will have a clouding
with a air-filled spaces and mucus in
your sinus wall right
