hi this is dr. second from Team MDS
conquer now I'm going to discuss about
the transfer to systems of glucose so
first of all there are two types one is
insulin independent transport system
which is not depend upon the hormones
like insulin can be seen in the case of
brain your hepatocytes that is liver and
your RBC that is F through sites and the
second type is insulin dependent
transporter system which is most
commonly seen in the muscle and the
adipose tissue
apart from this to coordinate this
transporter systems we have gluts okay
so these are the transporters which
helps in transportation of the glucose
and come to the type 1 which is most
commonly seen in the case of your brain
and type 2 which is most commonly seen
in the case of beta cells of pancreas
whereas type 4 which is most commonly
seen in the case of adipose tissue and
the skeletal tissue which is an insulin
mediated glucose uptake and coming to
the type 5 which is most commonly seen
in the case of an a small intestine
helps in the absorption of flutters and
the last one s glute one which is helps
in the transportation of sodium
dependent active uptake of glucose okay
thank you l will be coming up with one
