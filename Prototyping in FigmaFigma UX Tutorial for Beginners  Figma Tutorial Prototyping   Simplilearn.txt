let's get started so what is figma figma
is a ux design tool where people create
share and test website mobile apps and
product designs it is widely used by
designers product managers and
developers it allows multiple people to
work together at the same time and share
feedbacks it is a completely free tool
in this video we will be covering figma
prototyping so let's first see what is
prototyping and why do we need it so
prototyping is basically a blueprint of
what your website or mobile apps design
looks like before it is built we can
actually show our team members our idea
of how we expect the website or app to
look like and how to navigate between
Pages even before the real product is
built isn't it cool it helps us to save
money time and we can get instant
feedback from our teammates we can test
the prototype to see what the end result
might look like and can also share the
creative prototypes with others so I
hope you got an idea about what
prototyping is so in figma prototyping
we will cover what are flows connections
how to create interaction and animations
between different frames we will go
through the settings in Prototype and
finally see how to present and share our
prototype so basically we create frames
to represent the pages and use it like a
canvas each page is designed in
different frames a flow is like a map of
all the different parts and how they
connect on one page or a different page
of your app or website a prototype can
show either the whole journey a user
might take through your app or just a
small part of it for example imagine
your prototype is for a quiz app you
might have parts that show the options
skip questions or continue to next
question figma creates a flow starting
point when you add your first connection
between two
frames now let's see how to create
connections connections are nothing but
interactions like clicking a button to
go to another page clicking an icon to
open an overlay page ET ra a connection
has three parts hotspot connection and
destination hotspot is where the
interaction happens or starts for
example a button connection is the arrow
that connects the hotspot to the
destination destination is where the
hotspot leads us to like another page or
a popup Etc so to create an interaction
select the hotspot from where you want
to start the interaction go to the
Prototype tab on the right side after
which you will see a plus icon on the
frame hotspot that you selected after
that you can drag plus sign arrow to the
destination and thus you have created a
connection now as this is done you might
have noticed that while using apps the
destination pages does not appear
instantly there are some animations and
transitions involved when the next page
appears let's now see how that's done
for that you can go to the Prototype tab
where you will find add interactions and
you can change the interaction settings
as you like we will be showing all this
in detail during the demo now that you
are creating a prototype how do you
present it to others and share it there
are options in Prototype setting where
you can choose the device you would like
to view your prototype on and once you
have created the Prototype there is a
present button on the top right side of
the toolbar which takes you to another
tab where you can view the Prototype on
the device you have selected so after
you have viewed the Prototype you will
find the share prototype button on that
same tab you can set the necessary
parameters and share the link so here we
have covered an overview of the main
components of figma prototyping now
let's see a Hands-On demo on how to
create and share a prototype okay so
let's start with the demo so this is
basically a prototype that I created
this is a very simple prototype okay
just to show the important features so
this is how you can view it you know you
can scroll the website and when I press
the ethnic button
you can see the page that contains ethn
you can go select the back option you
again go back to the main page and see
this is the page for XYZ collections
website so when I press over there you
can see an overlay page that appears
which says welcome and again when I
press the top right side the overlay
closes okay so now this is a very basic
prototype now I'll be teaching you how
to create a prototype you know including
the frames connections and everything so
let's let get started so this is how
your figma playground will look like as
I told you this is a free tool so you
can actually log in you know create an
account and login using your Gmail ID
yeah or any mail ID so this is your
playground so here this is the tool
toolbar so first you'll see how to
create a frame so this is a frame you
create a frame yeah and you can select
which device you would like to view your
prototype in so I'm selecting iPhone 18
so frame is been formed with the
resolution of iPhone 18 so now let's see
how to add the shapes so in this tab you
can see many shapes we'll add a
rectangle so you can go to design part
in the upper right corner where you can
change the color of the shape so we'll
keep it red you can also change the
color of the frame okay here but then
let's keep it white yeah so we are going
to the square okay and also we can add a
text text
box now I'm just mentioning it as header
again the text box here you can you know
change the font size
font style you know you can align it
okay you can just explore this over here
after that I'll be creating few more
shapes to give it a website like view so
here we are not creating any website so
we just creating shapes to understand
the basics
okay yeah what you can do is you can
actually you know copy this shape contrl
c and control V you can paste it so we
get the shape with exact Dimension now
if we go and look at the presentation of
this particular prototype let's wait for
a second yeah so this is how it appears
right so it's not scrolling or anything
so to add a vertical scrolling what you
can do is you can actually select the
frame you can elongate the frame yeah
you can elongate the frame
select the
shapes place it over here elongate it
further oh just a second
yeah elongate it
further yeah now you can see that we're
able to scroll vertically but then I
want this header to stay fixed so what
shall we do for that for that we'll
select the header and the text right and
we'll group it with Control G so now
we'll take the header we'll go to
prototype here in scroll Behavior right
now it's scroll with parent so we'll go
and make it fixed okay now you can see
that the header doesn't move the header
say stays fixed so here's how this is
how you create a fixed component so now
we have seen how to create a fixed
component and how to scroll the elements
vertically now let's see how to roll the
elements horizontally yeah for that what
you can do
is again we are just elongating the
frame okay now we are creating
shapes outside the frame yeah contrl c
contrl
v just adding a few elements yeah now
what you to do is you can select
everything right click yeah and do frame
selection so now this is a complete
frame now what you can do is you can
bring the frame
here and squeeze this now here in the
Prototype you can see overflow right now
it's no scrolling select horizontal
scrolling now see you can vertically
scroll also when this part appears you
can horizontally scroll so this is how
you do vertical scrolling and horizontal
scrolling see apart from shapes you can
even add pictures like how I added in my
prototype so just go to the shapes and
here there's a place image or video
option which will directly take you to
the to your file manager and you can
upload the pictures from there okay now
let's see how to add connections so for
adding connections we need another page
right or another
frame so again we'll create a
frame iPhone 8
frame okay eight frame and we just you
know we'll just change the color of the
page or the frame we just give it yellow
for a better understanding okay now I
what I want is I want this yellow page
to appear while I click the first box
okay uh yeah while I click the first box
so for that what I can do is I can click
the Box yeah go to prototype in the
right corner so now when I hover over
this there is a plus sign appearing I
can drag the plus sign Arrow towards
this page now let's see what
happens now when I click this first box
the Yellow Page appears but while I
click the rest of the Box nothing
happens see nothing
happens
okay now as you as I've already told
there are we can add interactions
because right now the yellow page is
just suddenly appearing instantly
appearing out of nowhere so for that
what you can do is you can actually you
know click over here in this Arrow where
you can actually you know do a dissolve
or there are numerous options you know
there is sliding like for example let's
take sliding you know sliding from the
top now let's see how this appears see
the page is sliding in from the
top okay so you can you know explore all
these features I'm just explaining just
one of the features there are so many
features to you can
explore now let me teach you how to
create an overlay frame okay now overlay
I think you know what overlay is it's a
text box or like any box that appears
above the page it's a comparatively
smaller box so for that what we have to
do is you have to create a frame okay
you have to create another yeah sorry
you have to create an other frame but
that frame must be smaller because it's
an overlay overlay is always smaller
than the page so the overlay frame page
must be smaller in size than the other
frames right so here I'll just add a
text saying hey yeah so now what I can
do is okay I want this to appear this
particular to appear while I press the
second box so now I can actually build a
connection just a second yeah build a
connection now instead of navigate right
I want it as an open overlay so click
the overlay option okay so see an
overlay box appeared
now you want to close the overlay so for
that what you will do is you can
actually go to the same connection you
can click the connecting Arrow where you
can find these settings you can actually
press close when clicking outside okay
so now when I click anywhere in the page
it goes back overlay appears when I
click anywhere in the page the overlay
goes back right so this is how you open
and close and overlay so these are the
frames so there are so many options and
interactions and animations so an
interesting one is smart animation now
smart animation is something which is
different so it smart animation
basically looks for matching layers and
it recognizes differences that animates
layers between frames and a prototype
okay so I will just give you an example
of what smart animation is so see smart
animation is basically done while you
toggle while you want to use a toggle
button or you know while you want to
delete an email while sliding the email
off all those options are done through
smart animation so I'll just give you
the toggle example so for toggling what
we can do is we can actually add a shape
we can add a
shape we can just you know curve the
sides
50 yeah now you can add a button and
like for the togal button you can add an
ellipse an elliptical frame yeah okay
you can color you can give a black color
to it
okay so you know this is how a tole
button looks right like right yeah now
what you have to do is you have to
recreate the same frame this exact same
frame so you can do contrl
c and control V so this thing appears
now here what you want is you want this
uh yeah you want this button to go to
the right side when you click right yeah
so initially this will be your page and
while you click this button you want
this button to go to the right side now
how to make that connection or build
that connection select here okay go to
prototype you got a red connection oh
just a second I'm sorry so what you can
do is you can press this plus sign
navigate to this page yeah so here go to
the settings and for animation give
smart animation okay you can give it's
already easy and enough and initially
while you are doing it might be 300
millisecond so you can increase it to
600 millisecond for a smooth transition
now again do it for this side too
connection smart animation so let's see
how this is done yeah see this it's very
smooth actually we have created two
frames over here but then you know it
doesn't feel that the pages are changing
right it's very smooth how you usually
toggle on your apps or websites so you
know for such interactions or for such
animations we have Smart animations as
as I already mentioned for deleting the
email and
everything so that's it with with the
smart animations so we have actually
covered you know the main features I
mean there are so many features which
you can actually you know explore but
it's all similar so the main features we
have covered over here so what to do for
presenting now we have to present and
share it so for presenting as we have
already been presenting so this is the
present icon so you can present it and
they have already selected the devices
iPhone 8 so this is your iPhone
8 and like all the features you know the
scrolling upwards scrolling
sideways
overlay tole with smart animation
everything's up now how to share it so
see here also you'll find a share button
here in this particular tab also you
will find a share button okay so for
sharing the Prototype you're supposed to
share the Prototype from this particular
tab from The View tab Okay so share
prototype now what you can do is you can
just copy the link and share it okay but
then again you can do the necessary
settings like if you just want the
stakeholders you know to just see your
prototype you can keep it in can but
then if you you know if you're doing a
group project and if you want the
teammates to also edit you can go to the
edit option okay and again here you have
another option of who all can view the
link so like you can choose the option
according to your purpose and you can
copy the link and share it so with that
we come to an end to this session hope
you guys got a quick idea on what figma
tool is and how to use its prototype
features we have explained to you the
important features that will get you
started now it is your turn to be
