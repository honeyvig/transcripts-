that having said hey everyone and
welcome to Simply learns YouTube channel
in this video we are going to cover
eight machine learning projects to make
your portfolio stand out but before we
dive into that don't forget to like
subscribe and share so here are eight
machine learning projects that can
increase the reach of your portfolio and
enable you to acquire a job as a machine
learning
engineer at number eight we have a loan
approval prediction system in this
project focused on machine learning we
aim to analyze and predict the outcome
of the loan approval process for
individuals we'll tackle this as a
classification problem where we aim to
determine whether a loan will be
approved proved or not classification
problems involve predicting class labels
for given input data examples and they
Encompass various tasks like identifying
spam mails detecting cancer and
Performing sentiment analysis to gain a
better understanding of classification
problem and learn how to construct a
loan prediction system you can refer to
the project link provided in the
description box below at number seven we
have a fake news detection system can
you trust everything you encounter on
social media it's a fact that not all
news is reliable right so how can you
identify fake news machine learning
holds the key by engaging in this
project focused on detecting fake news
you will gain the ability to
differentiate between real and
fabricated information this machine
learning project focuses on Discerning
between fake and True News we employ a
tfid vectorizer from the sarn library on
a data set the model is then trained
using a pre-initialized passive
aggressive classifier
ultimately the accuracy score and
confusion metrics indicate our model's
performance for further details you can
find the project Link in the description
box below at number six we have the
personality prediction system the
concept revolves around using machine
learning techniques to determine an
individual's personality a person's
personality has a significant impact on
both their personal and professional
life nowadays many companies are
selecting candidates based on their
personality trait leading to increased
job efficiency as individuals are
assigned tasks that align with their
strengths rather than being forced into
unsuitable rules in our study we aim to
combine ml techniques like SVD knife Bas
and logistic regression to predict a
person's personality additionally we
utilize the phase frequency method to
forast their talents this model or
approach enables users to easily
identify their personality traits and
Technical abilities to De deeper into
this project please refer to the link
provided in the description box below at
number five we have Parkinson's disease
system Parkinson's disease is a
progressive disorder of the central
nervous system that impacts movements
and lead to symptoms like Tremors and
stiffness it consists of five stages and
affects over 1 million individuals
worldwide annually in this machine
learning project our objective is to
develop an svm support Vector Machine
model model using various python modules
such as CET learn numpy pandas and svm
we'll import the data extract the
features and labels scale the features
split the data set design the svm model
and evaluate its accuracy ultimately
we'll utilize the developed model to
assess the presence of Parkinson's
disease in an individual for further
details on this project please refer to
the link provided in the description box
below at number four we have sentimental
analysis sentiment analysis also known
as opinion mining involves the
straightforward task of asserting the
author's emotions or attitudes expressed
in a given text it aims to decipher the
underlying intentions of the user when
they write something to identify
potential personal information we
utilize a range of natural language
processing and text analysis techniques
a goal is to detect extract and quantify
such information from the text enabling
classification and data manipulation in
this project we'll leverage the Amazon
customer review data set for conducting
sentiment analysis for further insights
into this project please refer to the
link provided in the description box
below at number three we have image
classification using CNN deep learning
is an immensely popular and rapidly
growing field in the present times
numerous projects and problem statements
across various domains heavily reli on
deep learning techniques when confronted
with a computer vision problem many of
us including myself would opt for a
conventional neural network as the goto
deep learning approach in this
particular project we'll employ
convolutional neural networks to develop
an image processing project and gain
insights into its capabilities and the
reasons behind its widespread popularity
we delve into each stage of creating a
convolutional model and embark on a
first remarkable project for this
project we'll utilize the cipher 10 data
set which is commonly employed for image
classification tasks to acquire further
information about this project please
refer to the link provided in the
description box below at number two we
have a face recognition system the
remarkable advancement in technology
never ceases to stound people as they
continuously introduce incredible
inventions that enhance convenience and
comfort in our lives among these
Innovation face recognition has proven
to be the least intr inclusive and
fasted form of biometric verification
over the Year this project will utilize
the open CV and phase recognition labrar
to develop a phase detection system
opencv offers a powerful set of tools
libraries and hardware for real-time
computer vision applications with open
CV we can create all aspiring projects
in real time to gain insights into the
process of building a face recognition
system please refer to the link provided

below and last but not the least we have
a movie recommendation system in today's
world most people rely on technology to
stream movies and TV shows however
deciding what to watch next can
sometimes be disheartening thankfully
recommendation systems based on a
viewers viewing history and preferences
have become common place these
recommendations are powered by Machine
learning and can be an enjoyable and
accessible projects for beginners piring
programmers can practice coding in
either python or RL is using data from
movie lens data set which more than
6,000 users generated if you're
interested in learning how to create
personalized movie recommendations for
yourself or your loved ones you can find
