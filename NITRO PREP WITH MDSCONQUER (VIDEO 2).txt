yeah good evening one and all and coming
to the second video of this nitro
activated preparation of MDS conquer
today I'll be dealing about few topics
related to dental materials and
endodontics according to our schedule
and my main focus and so on a few few
direct Peaks that are taken from our
clay books which are very smart and
important for examination point of view
okay so first of all few scientists
names agar agar was invented by polar
and GIC well known that is Princeton and
Kint I hope you know this Ames technique
that is one is to one ratio of alloy and
mercury and next one is calcium
hydroxide cement was given by Hermann
which is considered as golden standard
material for both a pacification as well
as pump capping so going in detail this
is again one of the important table that
is taken from the gypsum bonnet invest
in some products which is very very
important in examination point after I
don't know why the power set was really
loud these m secures so going to the
first part that is the type 1 is plaster
impression type 2 is plaster model type
3 is dental stone type 4 is dental stone
which is high-strength
taifa is dental stone which is high
strength and high expansion the second
column gives an idea about the water by
powder ratio that is 0.40 to 0.75 0.45
20.50 and 0.28 to zero point three zero
and zero point two two to zero point two
four and 0.18 to zero point two as it
goes it decreases next is the setting
time which is idle ranges from four plus
or minus one for the type 1 and 12 plus
or minus four for all the rest of the
types okay and coming to this next
column that is very important it is
almost zero minimum is almost zero for
the to have a setting expansion
percentage
whereas for type 5 it is
0.10 once it was asked as a question in
one of the entrance examination rest all
the minimum expansion percentage after
two hours is 0 whereas for the type 5 is
exception that is zero point one zero
and the maximum it where is it made is
0.15 for the type 10.30 to type to zero
point two zero for type 3 0.104 types
for and 0.304 time type and these are
the consistence after one hour and in
different forms one is MPA and second
one PSI so just make a note these
entities are very important as we go
down they increases okay oh I hope it's
very clear it is very important area
where they're loud last questions please
you need to have a good command over
this table next moves the bins
classification two or three questions
were given in the winds classification
in 2017 need it's very simple there are
four types according to beans
classification one is type 1 that is 1 1
it starts as 1 and says one type 2 it is
2 1 starts as 2 and ends as 1 type 3 it
is 2 2 starts as 2 and says to type 4 it
is 1 2 starts as 1 but ends as - I hope
you are very clear with this basic
channel and order of which is 11 to
enter second one it's a light
modifications of beans classification
that is vertices classification I have
seen one or two questions related to
this in 2017 as well as in 2018 need
examination so if you go in detail into
the class 1 class 1 is 1 1 so it starts
as 1 ends as 1 class 2 is 2 1 starts has
to answer as 1 class 3 is 1 2 1 starts
as 1 bifurcates into 2 and ends as one
class 4 is 2 2 starts as 2 and says to
class 5 is 1 2 starts as 1 and says to
class 6 is 2 1 2 starts as two united to
form 1 again - again - ok I hope you are
very clear that is class 6 is 2 1 2
starts as 2
it's one again it's 2 class 7 is 1 2 1 2
that it starts as 1 bifurcates into 2
united to form one and bifurcates into 2
class 8 is 3 3 starts as 3 and senses 3
very simple take any case 1 2 3 classes
they end with 1 you can see one you can
see one and you can see one whereas
class for class by class 6 class 7 then
says 2 2 2 2 2 class 3 class 8 is 3 3
hope it's very clear so again these are
very important and most commonly asked
numericals in your dental materials ok
I'm just going to brief you out these
pics are taken from your power play
books ok decently neatly given all the
density values at one shot tips embodied
in West
zip some wanted investments sorry gypsum
bonnet products the value ranges from 2
point that is 2 point 3 composite resins
is around 2 a kerlick plastics is one
point to saliva is 1.008 urine is one
point zero one five nitrous oxide is one
point five three water is one okay
water is one gold is 19.3 amalgam is
eleven point six titanium is four point
four five gold alloys is 14 to 15 and
chromium is 7.2 dentin is 2.2 amalgam is
2.8 coming to the melting points these
are the most commonly asked melting
points in various examinations if you
analyze your turn to pulse or any sort
of basic mcq book you can see these
common values were which were previously
asked that is the gold melting point is
1 0 6 0 where a silver melting point is
963 centigrade and silver boiling point
is 2 2 1 2 where as titanium melting
point is 1 1 6 8 1 gram is equal to
conversion of pounds into grams is most
commonly
area where few positives then allowed to
confuse the aspirin
and one pound is equal to four hundred
and fifty three point five nine grams if
you want to convert kgs to pounds and
pounds to cases our grams you can use
this formula and you can come up with
the right answer the first sale of a das
captain's was awarded in the Year 1931
elastic modulus of amalgam is 21 GPA
whereas the compressive strength of
amalgam is 310 MPA and the tensile
strength of amalgam is 48 2:7 mpre are
you have star questions in your amalgam
both in dental materials as well as in
your operator dentistry thank you all
signing off dr. Stricker this is the
test series module what is one right now
just have a look if you need anything
you can just ping me on double nine
eight nine four two seven nine seven one
on my what self take care study well
