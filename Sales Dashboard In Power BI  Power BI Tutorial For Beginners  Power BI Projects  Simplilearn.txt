without further delay let's get started
with the topic for today's discussion
that is building a powerbi dashboard so
these days you might be hearing a lot
about pobi we do have a lot of bi tools
in the market like Exel
Tablo click view a lot but people are
talking about powerbi the most but why
so we will be knowing that in a while so
let's get started with uh building a
dashboard first and eventually in the
process you will definitely understand
it so making a dashboard in powerbi is
just like a breeze so before we get
started with powerbi I would like to
explain you a few fundamentals that you
might want to take a look at before
getting started so data cleaning is a
much needed process so you can do data
cleaning using public query or you can
just simply open your Excel and try to
check the data types for blank cells any
inappropriate datas eliminating them
right so simple basic fundamental data
cleaning process if you have some
irrelevant data in your data set just
eliminate that row or try to fill that
with the proper data that was supposed
to be there and if there are any blank
rows or blank cells eliminate those
blank rows and blank cells so that your
data is up to date and accurate and
apart from that uh let's check out some
data types for example the first one
which happens to be the ru ID here so
this is the data set that we will be
dealing with today so this particular
Road ID has a general data type so it
can be either a number or a float and
when you come to the ship date over here
the OD date over here right so those are
date data types and they might follow
different formatting let's say they
might follow uh date number that is day
number and for month they might add the
alphabetical name like Jan or Feb and
the year or a few others might format
with date time and uh you know we will
be having date uh and at the time which
will'll be describing the hours minutes
and seconds right so there are a lot of
variations where a data from date data
type can be saved so it's your
fundamental
you know responsibility to make sure
that all the elements from a specific
column are of one single data type so
that the the entire data set is inte you
know it's very U good and it should be
intact that's the whole point of it and
if you have any inconsistencies in your
data set that might result in you know
abnormal predictions abnormal dashboards
or charts whatever you make there will
not be uh those dashboards cannot be
relied on your reports cannot be uh
reliable so that's the whole point of it
so just make sure that you go through
the fundamental very basic data cleaning
things like eliminating blank rows blank
cells maintaining a uniform data type
for all your columns you know based on
the data it's not like you have to
maintain character data type for your
dates so you need to make sure that what
kind of data type suits what kind of
data and you need to check that and make
sure that all the elements in that
particular column follow one standard
data type so I'll be going with date
data type for audit date and ship date
and ship mode will be character serial
that is row number will be serial number
or row number will be integer and uh
everything else will be C data type and
when it comes to the last four rows
sales quantity discount and profit so
those will be the uh you know float data
type and when you check out the location
here we have country not so these will
be segregated by your bi tool either
Tablo or powerbi whichever you're using
so those will be segregating these
particular location type data types and
it will show them as map right so this
is the major thing which you need to
make sure before starting with your you
know building the dashboard so that you
know having said that let's begin with
the powerbi let me start the powerbi bi
tool here it is just click on it it
should take a while so here we are we
are on the you know first page of the
PBI so you can import the data from
Excel you can import the data from SQL
Server you can just copy paste your
blank tables so you can make use of some
apis and plugins and get connected to
the data sources from web or any other
sources and you can also import the data
from that particular source so today we
will be dealing with the Excel data set
so we will be importing the Excel file
and before that here you can see some op
options which are filters data
visualizations and uh data so we haven't
loaded any data so you can see the data
over here and if you are on table they
will be available on the left side and
you will call them dimensions and
measures so you can apply the same uh
analogy here so you'll be available with
the dimensions and measures once we
import the data and here you have a wide
variety of charts and graphs that you
can just you know drag and drop and
create so once you have the data over
here you can just drag and drop onto the
canvas over here and then it will
automatically generate some type of a
data set or chart let's say it'll give
you a tabular chart you can just click
that particular chart and come over here
over over here and you can select any
one of the charts available here let's
say you wanted the P chart you can do
that uh you can do a donut chart you can
do a dream app right so once you h on to
it it will tell the name of that
particular chart and you can select that
like it's based on your choice right so
this is about it basically now you can
also do some drill throughs that's again
for a session in another time another
day so that's session for a different
day for now let's try to create a
dashboard in a routine way remember I'm
telling you or I'm specifying in a
routine way because we also about to
learn why powerbi is being uh so popular
currently in the bi industry right so
there are some tips and tricks that will
help you in the long
so let me close the filters close the
visualizations close the data and now
let's click on this particular option
which says import data from Excel right
now we are in the Excel data set so this
is the file where I basically store my
Excel data sets that I'll be working on
so you can also have access to this you
can just let me know and we will drop
down the tribe Link in the description
box and you'll have the accessibility to
all these data sets so remember I spoke
about data cleaning right so this Excel
data it is completely cleaned every data
column has a uniform data type and it
follows that data type throughout and if
you check out this particular original
data set which is sales European sales
over here so this is the original data
set which follows different
nomenclatures for data types for example
if I come down to the date column there
are different types of data types some
of the cells have only dates they follow
date month and year and some of these
cells have date month and year along
with the time so another clitch here so
a few of the cells were following the uh
you know 24hour timing nomenclature and
a few others were following 12 hours
this is specifically mentioning AM and
PM right so this causes a lot of trouble
when you're creating a report trust me
I've been that so what I did is I clean
the entire data set removed the cells I
mean the blank cells remove the blank
columns remove the blank cells remove
the blank rows and in any situation if
there is um you know uh discrepancy
followed in data types I've also cleared
that and I saved Excel data right so we
will be using this particular data now
and if you need these data sets I can
provide you with that using the Drive
Link and you can have access you can
also try your data cleaning by following
our tutorial which is linked in the
description box below for data cleaning
and you can do it and you can start with
your dashboards now let me just extract
this particular data set just click on
open and you will be having it on the
screen just in a moment so when you
check out the original data set we have
a lot of sheets here right so these were
some pivot tables that we created for
data analytics using Excel so you can
also check out that video now we will be
doing the same data analytics and
creating an entire interactive dashboard
on PBI with the same data set so you can
see uh powerbi is trying to load all the
tables and all the sheets available in
that particular file but we just need
one out of those you can also click all
of those or you can just get one out of
those so for now I just need one out of
those so here it is and you can check
the data you can have a quick preview of
how your data is looking right and then
just click on load and the best part is
powerbi will also perform a data
cleaning operation from its end and I
identifies if there are any rules or any
sells that I miss out to clean and it
will notify you if there are any errors
and it will also I mean it is also
capable to you know um fix those errors
for you you can see I have seven errors
right so you can just view errors and
clear them or I can just close so that
in the background PBI will take care of
them for me now we have the data right
so here you can see the data tab got
both opened and here you can have a new
drop down if you click on that you have
all the data elements present in the
data set or in terms of tblue you have
dimensions and measures so basically
wherever you have a sumission or any
kind of mathematical operation present
in front of the column name that
particular element or that particular
column is considered to be the measure
so which is which is basically dealing
with the numbers and all the others
which do not have any other mathematical
symbol like equals hashtag or sumission
those are the dimensions basically the
character data type or the DAT data type
whichever uh the data type it is but not
numbers right so here we have it so what
you basically do is completely similar
to uh Tablo click view or any other
business intelligence tool basically
just drag and drop right now let's say I
want to find out the U region wise sales
what can I do here is is I can just drag
it onto the canvas and again I have
sales over here I can drag sales to the
canvas I can just you know how it onto
the existing box you can see this
particular box right you can just drop
it inside the box so that powerbi will
understand that I'm trying to uh you
know extract the region wise sales and
it will perform the sumission of all the
sales region wise and it'll give you a
table let's say you're not satisfied
with this particular table
representation you can just hold your
table and here you can open the
visualizations and open the filters
right and here you have visualizations
over here if you want to segregate that
in form of a p chart you can do it right
now it will give you the sum of sales
based by region now if want to calculate
the U let's say order date you know uh
date wise sales then I can also do that
you can just drag the sales over here
and and select that particular table and
you know whenever you are dealing with
date data type right when you're dealing
with date data type then what you do is
you try to use the line craft it's the
best way to represent your sales how
they are happening right and uh few
other things let's say I want to
calculate uh the profit by city or
country which country is facing the
highest number of profits we can also do
that just drag and drop you know how it
is and okay it's giving a lot of
countries but but still it's not a big
problem for us just drag and drop the
sales and here you can select any one
out of these let's go with the bar graph
and here you have it right now so far so
good right so far we so good now if you
uh worry about the interactivity you
don't have to basically when you're
using Excel or any other table let's say
if you're using Excel you might have to
use slices right so if you're not aware
of what am I talking about you can just
go check the data analytics of building
the dashboard using Excel where I have
completely explained the day is set and
they you know built an interactive
dashboard there so it'll give you a
better idea about it so before that um
let's get let's Circle back so here uh
you don't have to create a slicer and
you don't have to report the connections
between each and every chart it's
automatically done in the background for
example let's say if I wanted to
calculate the sales of central region if
I just click on the central region it
will automatically change the display of
the entire dashboard that will give me
the central region sales right and uh if
I just go back it'll you know it will
give me the entire sales dashboard let's
say if I want to calculate the west
region I have my best data right so
that's the best part of Papi and now we
are going to identify why this this is
one One Good Reason Why powerbi is
popular but there is another good reason
why powerbi is so popular right now so
popular so easy and so effective that
even a schoolgoing kid can build a
dashboard trust me a schoolgoing kid of
grade 11 grade 12 or a candidate who is
just graduating or a fresher or any
person who doesn't have a computer
knowledge but has some good knowledge
about numbers and how businesses work
they can definitely create an
interactive dashboard using powerbi even
if they are new to powerbi so we're
going to just see just that let's create
a new page or you can just go back to
the same
page okay let's create a new page now
let's say I don't know uh how to create
a chart I don't know let's say my
manager asked me to create a complete
report of the sales happening and I
don't know powerbi and I don't know
anything about how to create a chat and
how work right but I have certain idea
right let's say I have a certain idea I
want to find out the region wise sales I
want to find out the country-wise sales
I want to find out the performance of
sales date on date year on year month on
month quarter on quarter whatever it is
you just want to create you know you
just want to extract the you want to
build an Insight on the date wise sales
and uh you want to find out um you know
profits based on uh certain regions or
certain categories right which category
is the highest performing category which
is the majorly Ed a shipment mode right
there are Limitless possibilities you
know what to build but you don't know
how to build right in such situations
powerbi is here for the rescue just
right click on the canvas just click
anywhere right now you okay it was not
the right click it was the double click
so just double click anywhere on the
powerbi canvas and there you can see
something called ask a question about
your data let me expand that for you you
can see ask question anything about your
data now let's say I want to create the
same region wise sales right you can
just type on the region wise sales and
it's already giving you a uh you know
it's already giving you a bar graph now
let's say you don't want the bar graph
you want a p pie chart or a donut graph
right donut chart so you can either
select any one of those I'll go with the
pie chart for now so you can just select
on that and here you have your pie chart
right how simple is that how easy is
that right and now you can just place it
anywhere on your dashboard check the
size alignment and you're good to go
let's close this filters for now so that
the canvas is a little more better
visible now let's say I want to find out
ship mode profits and uh the type of
graph I'll go with the bar graph there
you go sales that happened using a
certain ship mode and you have the data
right here and I'm choosing the bar
graph now let's say I want to calculate
the month-on-month sales right so double
click anywhere on the canvas
sales audit date and
remember we want to represent the okay
it's too intelligent it already gave you
a line graph right just click that
select that and uh just place it
anywhere on your chart and you can
expand it there you go there you have it
right and now let's do let's try to find
out a few more things let's try to find
out uh which of these segments gave me a
lot of uh profits category wise
profits category profit and let's try to
build uh we have a pie chart so let's
build a donut chart there you go place
it anywhere on the canvas like whever
you need it now few more things
statewise okay now let's make it a
little more
interesting State fail map you wanted a
map right so just select on that and you
will be having the map okay so
problem here so I think let's go with
country sales map okay let's enter now
let's select this particular chart okay
no interactivity I need right now select
this and here let's select map and map
and fi map visuals are disabled to
enable them go to a file options
settings options Global Security details
okay let's try this file options and
settings op options global global
security use map and field map visuals I
think this should fix this okay let's
refresh it should help us there you go
you have your map let's place it
anywhere in r in the dashboard now we
have the region wise sales or
country-wise sales and shipment mode
subcategory and uh let me know what else
we can build let's have the kpis here
now let's go to the sales and just drag
and drop the sales sign anywhere on the
table and I want the data presented in
visuals I have the card now let's have
profits and that should be a card again
and let's have U quantity that should be
a card again that's our kpi profit sales
quantity discount is another one where
which you can add and just add number
card again there you go we can go to the
insert option insert text box and there
you can just write down sales dashboard
align the text to Center and that should
be good there you go so far so good and
in case if you wanted to add a few more
visual athetics to your dashboard you
can also do that you can just click down
yeah I think you remember your
PowerPoint right just go to view and you
can select any of the backgrounds you
want and there you go you have it if
you're not happy with this you can also
have some images in the background you
can add some images which will make it
look a little more interactive right so
that's how you build an amazing
interactive dashboard in powerbi and uh
that's the reason why uh the Simplicity
why powerbi is being so popular amongst
the all other remaining bi tools and
with that we have come to an end of this
session on how to build an interactive
sales dashboard using powerbi and if you
have any queries regarding any of the
topics covered in this session or if you
require the resources that we used in
the session like the D sets pbds and
