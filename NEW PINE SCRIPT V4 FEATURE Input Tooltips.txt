hi traders i'm back with a really quick
video here just to let you know about
the latest update to the pinescript
language that the trading view
development team have added
now this is an extremely simple update
so this is going to be a very quick
video
but it's a pretty cool update the
trading view team have added
tool tip functionality to our inputs
so let me read the words here you can
now add a short description
to any user input using pine's new
tooltips if you've used tooltips before
on labels it functions exactly the same
it's easy to do simply use the new
tooltip parameter in any input call to
have an i
icon appear next to the input little
information icon
hovering over the icon displays the
string used as an argument for the tool
tip parameter
pretty simple the only extra thing worth
noting is that when inputs are combined
using the inline parameter meaning
you've combined multiple inputs on the
same line
if you're not sure what this inline
parameter is i'll leave a video up in
the top right and in the video
description
linking to the previous video i did on
the latest pan script update which was
the inclusion of inline parameters and
group parameters
for organizing your user input interface
but anyway if you have a bunch of inputs
combined on the same line
the tooltip will be displayed at the end
of that line
and basically it will apply to all of
the inputs you have put
on that line so you can read about all
updates to pine in their user manuals
release notes which i'll also leave a
link to
below this video and that's it the
trading view team
have been very busy updating the
password language in the past few months
it's great to see
but let's jump over into the pine editor
and i'll show you really quickly
uh how we can use this new tooltip
parameter all right here i am on trading
view with just a
simple strategy script added to my chart
let's jump into the source code
and we'll play around with this tool tip
parameter so here are a bunch of my user
inputs for this script
the user inputs are actually pretty
self-explanatory so this isn't the best
example of why you would use a tooltip
but i'm a huge fan personally
of making your scripts as easy to use as
humanly possible
especially if you're going to publicly
release them and so this is a great
habit to get into
early now that this feature is a thing
so i would encourage you to do this
for all of your inputs no matter how
self-explanatory they may appear to be
so to use this new parameter it's really
easy we just need to write
tool tip like we would any other
parameter in this input function
it takes a string argument and
i'm just going to write test here really
quickly just to demonstrate how this
works
visually now if i come up to the
settings menu open this up
we now have this little eye icon next to
this input which is the first input
in my code and if i hover my mouse over
it
we get a little pop-up there that says
test
so in this particular scripts case the
positive atr filter
means that the candle size must be above
this multiplier of the atr in order to
be considered a valid signal
and the minus or negative atr filter
means it must be below
this multiplier of the atr so by default
the way the script is set up
if the candle size of the current bar is
greater than three times the current atr
then the script ignores
that setup and so if i wanted to i could
explain that
using this tooltip parameter so that the
user knows what these two
inputs do so let's do that now i'll just
write out here
the minimum candle size compared
to the current atr and then here i can
say
the maximum candle size compared
to the current atr now if i save the
script
let that update on trading view servers
and come up to the settings menu we now
have two tool tips here that explain
exactly in detail what these two input
parameters do
and just really quickly while we're here
at the start of the video i mentioned
that if these were grouped onto one line
using the inline parameter then only the
last tool tip
would show on that line so i'll show you
exactly what that means really quickly
if i add in
the inline parameter here and we have
the same inline parameter on both of
these inputs
when i save the script one of these
information tooltip icons will go away
and there will only be one left
and i believe it's the the last tool tip
you used
is what stays on your interface so let
me save the script there
come up to the settings menu and yes so
now these are on
one line because we have them both on
the number one
inline parameter and the tooltip here
is showing the last tool tip we wrote
for those inputs which is the maximum
candle size
so that's just something to keep in mind
if you do use the inline parameter
just remember that your tool tip will
show for all of the inputs included
in whichever inline group that you apply
them to
so another really cool feature here
you've got to hand it to the trading
view team
they are always working to improve the
transcript language
this is the second quality of life
update they've made to panscript in the
past two weeks
so if you're brand new to panscript
you've picked the perfect language at
the perfect time
to get involved and learn this language
because it is being constantly improved
and the past few months have seen some
major improvements in terms of the
capabilities of panscript
and the quality of life for users of the
scripts that you write
so that'll do it for today's video if
you are brand new to pinescript head
over to pinescriptbasics.com and sign up
for my

teach you the fundamentals of this
language
