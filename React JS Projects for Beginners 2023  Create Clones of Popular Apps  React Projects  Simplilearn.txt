foreign
and welcome to Simply learns YouTube
channel today we will be taking you
through react.js project for beginners
we will create three clones of popular
apps the best way to master a language
is by programming it in this video you
will see how to create a YouTube clone
Facebook clone an Instagram clone from
scratch by the end of this tutorial you
will be able to create the front end of
all these applications on your own but
before we jump to the coding part if you
haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to hit the Subscribe
button and press the Bell icon so you
will never miss any update from Simply
learn so let's start this in a fun
manner so here we are going to create a
YouTube clone with react.js but before
we jump to the coding part let's see how
the YouTube page looks like
let's see
here
as you can see
there is a nav bar upstairs where you
have your logo
after that there is a upload button the
Bell icon notification button and that
mic button in the search bar and it's
written here the YouTube
and in this you will find
home Explorer shots subscribe original
YouTube music and all other things
so let's jump to the coding part and
create the YouTube clone as it is
so open your Visual Studio code
to create this YouTube clone you must
have node.js installed in your system
so let's just open one folder or just
type control
tactics and inside that write a command
in PX
create
react
app and then the folder name that you
want to create
I'll write U to
flow
press enter it'll take couple of minutes
to install all the packages
so let's wait for few minutes
it'll take a couple of minutes to
install all the modules
before until it's get complete let's see
the YouTube clone again
so we'll have this
videos
and here we'll write this
and write this
okay cool
let's go back to our video Studio code
and let's wait a couple of minutes more
so
a folder is
created
so let's go to this folder
to do that I have written a command CD
YouTube clone and then I'll hit enter
inside this I will write npm start to
see how project is working or not
so our react app is working fine
let's go back to our code
and open this
after opening the YouTube project that
we have created
let me zoom in a little for you
let's make it safe
after going to this let's open the
app.js file
inside this let's delete this header and
let's see it's working fine
hello
from Simply
learn and let's remove the react logo
save this file inside this let's
delete all the CSS part let's save this
also
and now let's run this control button
and that's right
start
with C connection hello from simpler
yes
here
we will write
again
let's add another one
and we write in game I
installed react router
Dom
let's install this
meanwhile let's create a folder or let's
create a file here
the
thought
she is
and
the header dot CSS
the center
inside this header.js let's first
release this
and this we will write
Center
and then let's save it
the chain compilation error let's work
on this first
let's cut this
chart
inside this header bar
let's import first the react
import react from
here
this will install all the modules or
dependencies that we need
but before that let's add the header
here
inside this we'll write import
data
from
and then the
fit
now let's just save this file
let's go back to our
header.js file and in this file
just a second
yes
inside this file
let's go
let's create a function here first
inside the function hit the
now inside this header function
we will return
inside this will create it there
the class name
Shader
said this
so just check
will write something in
H1 Dot
hello
from Simply learn
let's save it
and showing some error
because we have to export it
we have imported the header inside this
app.js
but we haven't
export this header so in the last
write export
default
in the
file name which is
header now let's save it and as you can
see it's showing
hello from Simply love
so going back to our code
let's
open up
CSS page
inside this we'll write some basic CSS
properties that we are going to fetch in
this health.js file
so let's write some approaches
let's give it for a padding
we can do this after a while also but I
have loaded somewhere so let's just give
it a try of giving
all
sizing border box
after that we'll give it the outline of
um
after that let's save this and inside
this header.js let's delete this and
inside this
will write
header after that
we'll write the clicks
after that we will write a line
we are going to give the property to
these in the app.js file but before that
you have to declare it here so we are
going to write a line
items
sent
will give justify content
subjects right just if I can print
and then the space between
after that
in the next line
will give it another
class name
header
left
item
of that EG Flex
and then again the line
times Center
and the height of Max 30.
and x y
let's save it
okay
that's now in this part
we'll write it
let's
we're going to create a menu bar
here these three lines are we are going
to create first after that we will
create this YouTube logo and this
premium ion
so let's go back to our code
inside this let's give it a good class
name
of menu bar only
five
inside this will write
hpg
inside this
a few blocks should be
0 0 24 and 24
let's forget this let's copy this from
the YouTube only
delete it
you have to go to here hit inspect
inside this
will copy this part
we'll copy this
let's see
let's open this
let's find it here only
clear line
paste it here
and then see as
paste it here but for that
we need to form a document
clear code
it's fine
so it's looking good
now
what we have to do is
we have to save it
let's see
we have to add some CSS more properties
let's
add some properties here that we have
declared in the header.js file
we have given here
let's go start with the
body part of this
100 percent
after that we'll go
and color
that would be white only
but let's skip it
after that click the font from view of
let's now go to
file
now
first let's add the CSS properties in
app.css file
let's complete this first and then we'll
move on to the header bar so
it will be inside it only so let's
do it first
Li
e overflow
could be
after that
I wanted
to be
let's make it as doing difficult
let's try the white
inside this let's give it a color so
we'll be right right it will fetch this
now let's do it for
black also
wherever we'll call this black
it will fetch this
zero zero zero as you know
so we'll go back to the container
everything stores so we'll make this
container as
it's really tough 80 percent
and then the margin should be
of zero percent
and then we'll make it as photo so we
can switch the screen like in Facebook
YouTube
as we can
do this in this it'll reduce the size
according to the desktop
so we can do that here also
so let's go back to another
we have floated the deflect
let's again confirm yeah
root one only
style this
deflect
let's make it as click
after that it should be enough
let's go to
line
and items
Center
excuse from this also
yes
inside this
will give it a line items
Center
foreign
just if I content
face enter
space between
now let's check it
okay now just
put the flex length in the justification
space between
basically cool
so we'll do the Justified content
inside it space
between
after that
we have also
called justify content
space between and then the single one
inside this we'll write justify content
then Center
after that
we have wrote
nothing as of now but let's go to this
save it
and let's see
a file
thank you
the display here right off now let's go
back to this
and let's edit this
in this style part let's cut this
because we have made The Styling there
and let's not give it a width of 100
let's give it a width of 30 percent
30 pixels would be fine
this should come under brackets
so
okay
okay
this should come under brackets
no it's fine
foreign
will also include the height of this
height would be
this all comes in the
in the this
height of 30 pixels in this also
common good wickets
after that let's check it
let's say this file
and as you can see
it's showing
like this only
let's
switch and then
so we are back to the we need to give it
a padding so it will come here
let's do that let's decrease the size of
this first
I think we shouldn't decrease it but
let's see
this feels fine but let's
give it a try
yeah it's fine
okay let's
move forward
now
let's make it as this cursor as a
pointer because whenever it goes to this
YouTube sign or this 3D lens it will go
to pointer
so let's make it as whenever it rolls
over this or any of these it should be
as pointer
let's go to our code
and let's write here in the class
0.2
icon
pointer
let's save it
first we need to add the CSS file here
for that we'll write import
and then the dot and then slash and then
the file name the file name is
header.css
let's close this
it's not fetching it let's see
why
okay we haven't given it in the brackets
okay fine
let's save it
let's give it a styling here first
inside this
save it
inside this
inside this
and give the padding of
0.7
and then the second should be 15 pixel
let's save it
and see
is it working
yeah as you can see whenever we go here
it's going from cursor to pointer
okay fine
now
let's move on to the next part
which is the logo
after that
will create a logo here
logo
inside this logo
will write
now we go again to YouTube
and then again search for their SVG if
this have
okay
I think it have the sweetie
let's find it
here only
inside this
VG
thank you
let's copy
and let's go back to our code
let's paste it here
it's have pasted as a junk part
so let's delete it and again go back
here
and copied manually
[Music]
it's
copied element
and back to our code let's paste it
here again
let's just
have format document
and as you can see it's coming
right
so let's see the logo again
everything's
coming right
in the Styles part
let's delete this line and let's
copy this from here
and let's paste it
here
let's save it
so you can see
it's coming but it's coming a very
short so let's edit it here only
[Music]
let's increase the size of this YouTube
premium button
go on to this style in this
60 would be a little let's do it more
75 be fine yes
let me write
let's start with fine we'll give it a
betting but after a while because let's
create a basic structure of header then
we can just style it
okay
let's first give it a anchor tag so when
we'll click on this
it can be clickable
okay
let's give it a pointer also
inside the class
inside it will write
it again let's save it
as you can see
you have to make it
give The Styling in this part let's do
it after a while
but before that let's
thank you
all right the dog
inside this logo
and create a
guitar
let's make it as empty now
we will do it after a while
after this let's close it
now let's save it so whenever we click
on this premium button it will go to
another page
let's move ahead
inside this let's
give it
styling inside this let's
[Music]
say this let's give it a bedding
[Music]
waiting right
let's give it 10 pixels
it should come under
10 pixels let's save it
and see
okay
let's see this
okay we need to add some more stylings
here
so we can get okay let's remove this and
yeah
cool
okay fine 15 will be fine
we need to give padding from here also
let's first give it a padding in the
header
okay
box or items that we have saved here
okay
that's a box
let's see
this
was 100
it will declare it inside this
now
coming back to header.js file
create
here
first let's now we'll create we are
creating a search bar
okay let's
name of
header
Road items
after that we will give it
the flex content space
align Center
left
or we can just give it this
because we don't want to give it as left
so let's save it
Ching error because I haven't
close this one
no
inside this
place
of input both
inside this box
we'll create another input
type of that would be take
inside the text
will write
again let's
class name would be
search box
says false foreign
to write
search inside this will you have the use
of
placeholder
with the help of placeholder
we can write anything inside this so
let's write search
go to that let's
close this
after that
let's save it
let's see it's coming
like this only but it's having uh we can
change it after a while
let's
come in okay
let's go back
to a code
and inside this let's give it
uh
let's create another Dev
inside this you will write class name
let's search
inbox
foreign
and then
justify content Center
[Music]
okay fine
let's first just
close this and now let's save it
okay fine
now
we need to
have the SVG file here
so we'll copy it from the YouTube
let's see inspect coming back to our
code
native
save it
let's do some styling here
inside this
let's give it
hide
well this would be fine let's go again
further
let's get the input
the box that we have created right now
the search box
let's give it a vertical
100 percent
after that let's be the padding of
zero pixels and 20 pixels
let's save it
after that
let's go to
foreign
let's see
let's now go to click
search box
here
we'll give it a width off
on the person
after that
leave it a height of 50 pixels
moving ahead
will give it a border of one pixel solid
or we need light but let's
for now
okay let's give it a light color
607d
I have wrote it down
this color scheme
8p into
let's save it as you can see it's much
lighter now as you can see here will
decrease the size of search here
after a while and we need to also need
to decrease the size of this
part we can do it after a while and
we'll create a structure
let's
give it a margin
0 pixels and it should be 10 pixels
let's see first that there is more so
we'll give it
the same
yeah
it's fine for now
and let's give it a bad thing
of zero better and
then pixels would be fine yes
after that will come to the search box
inside this search box
will give it a width off
for deep pixels
after that will give it a high top 40
again
I should be inherited or let's make it
as
one go see it
after that the top heading should be
of 30 pixels or 30 percent whichever is
fine
let's save it it's not
so let's do it should be zero percent
for now
you can change the stylings after a
while
but just creating a
structure
solid
let's just delete it and just copy it
from here
let's write it here
after that
okay fine it's
fine
now let's save it
it's not showing the importance is
[Music]
let's see
what we have not
decision
oh yeah
background color is white only
let's see
okay let's give it
the Box comes here
let's reduce the size of speed of box
I think that's
that you would be free let's make it as
25
and inside this
it's all fine
foreign
as we can see here
30 is fine we need to reduce the size
but we can do it afterwards let's see 30
is fine but let's make it as
28 for more section
okay
let's move on to the island
I know imagine is this
I think it's
important
[Music]
let's save it
okay no we don't need that
question only
okay
and the box mod and it should be more
than
it's fine but let's
okay
is the size of the search
foreign
this
so let's move it here
let's not give it a width though
20 would be fine okay now
not this
let's see here
the person would be fine
in here we can reduce the width
and the extra padding that we have given
you can reduce that
so let's start with that only
this one is inside the box that's
and box
let's say 10 only
okay A little let's say
let's see
okay
let's not give it
a person
[Music]
not remote in this okay
and let's now give it the height is fine
everything looks fine
but let's see
what is the mistake
let's move on
inside this
let's make it as a little short
because it's a very long part
to reduce the
this
the word
let's reduce it a little more let's
50
oh okay fine it's well now
let's make it guys
or let's do that 36
foreign
now we'll move forward
with this
now coming back to our JS file
let's go
now let's open our header file
now inside this part
we will write a SVG
okay we can copy it from YouTube we need
to do it
like this we need to add this search box
for that we'll inspect
and here
we can find the SVG
it's coming for for whole
but we need
it's the icons so let's
copy this
copy this from here
and then let's paste it here then format
document
here let's delete the style of
U2 and let's add the style that we have
created earlier
copy this from here
in the slides added
and make it as 15.
and 15 let's save it and see okay fine
it's coming right but let's
give it 20 pixels
then you can do pixel again
this would be a little big let's
make it as 15 only
but it's coming a little this side so
let's reduce the bedding
then
but it is fine
because let's first make it does pointer
so whenever we go here it should be
yes like this
unlike this
so let's go back to our code
go ahead inside the code
will also need to do some styling
so we have created our search box here
so let's move ahead
let's now create a
volume button
for that let's create it a Dev class
foreign
foreign
okay let's copy it from here
to inspect here first inside this we
need to
go to this
button
and save this
it can find
the SVG
let's copy this element
and let's paste it here now we need to
format document
and it's
fine let's save it
and let's see
let's now
change the style
written
and let's copy it one of the previous
and we are following
so let's paste this guy here
okay
let's again copy
okay let's
did here
and inside this let's make it a pointer
let's save it
as you can see it's coming right
okay fine let's do some editing here
and set this class
let's
do the voice part
about heading all
let's do it
let's give it the flex
deflect
we have to go to earlier
Center
let's save it
okay fine
now we need to change the positioning
here
all right
let's get the size
let's change this
okay fine it's fine
foreign
copy this reflex from here
and paste it inside this
box and let them just save it
okay
see the issue
inside it let's talk back okay
same thing
let's cut this from here this voice part
first let's
let's record this from here and
paste it here
okay
let's now do here some edit things
because
it's not coming right
foreign
so we need not have to write this inside
this inbox field letter
so let's cut it in save it so it's
looking fine now
now let's move to the next part of this
which is the header right
so after this
there let's see
we'll create another
class
let's now create a class right there
class name
the class name will be
header right
after that deflect
line
items Center
after that
we can
go another create another pair of class
name
let's give it a class name create
options
inside this create options
we will write this is sweetly
foreign
let's cut it first
inspect
and select this let's copy this
it's really easy right
let's save it and format
fine
let's delete this style
let's copy this time one we have created
save it in C
it's not coming let's see UI
okay it's coming but in the end
page size must be long here but we can
reduce it after a while but let's do
some changes first
besides is fine
let's now
inside this class
let's
give it pointer
and not in this class
let's rotate a pointer
and then the Mac
B15
okay
after that
we'll do have some changes
but let's
find now we'll go to another part which
is
the YouTube app button
this one
notification bar
we can go to this
class see where it's ending
after giving one
let's create another class
let's see
notifications
notification menu
inside this will again
expect
[Music]
[Music]
let's find out the
thank you
SVT file
there is this
3D file of it
notification button
it must be inside this
let's see
okay
first we need to make another two parts
of this notification bar
first is this ring YouTube ring and then
the notification button
so let's not create this as
notification menu let's name it as
YouTube
uh apps
inside this let's now again
go to the
bar of YouTube and this icons
we will
find the
okay let's first cut this
then inspect
foreign
[Music]
we can write it
copy element
and then let's
write it here format the document
erase this style
increase the style and copy this style
from above
okay
and let's just paste it here and then
deceive it and see the new notification
ring bell is here
now let's
do the notification bar
after this
let's create this
and first
whether we need to make it as pointer
okay let's make it as pointer here so we
can point it anywhere
and the max would be
50.
I have created the
CSS app.tss files here
so
let's now just save it it's giving it a
margin of 50
we can reduce it after a while but let's
do this for a while now
let's move ahead with
another div of class
notification yes
so let's create it
notification
menu
inside this let's
get the SVG of the notification
inside let's find out
where is the notification one comes
yes
but I can't find it so let's
dig inside this
okay
I'm coming down
it's fine let's make it at this only
but let's
create it
let's not create this notification menu
but let's create this
logo so for that
let's first create open now I simply
download page
inside this
let's get this
thank you
let's get this
copy
and let's go back to our code
creating another menu
there of class name

foreign
but I am writing this so let's
format
document
formatted
let's just ID darker we don't need it
let's move ahead
with the class and we don't need the
class also we just need the picture
is here
so we can write the
things after that
so let's
just
go let me create it
and before that let's
alter
t
and then class name
would be
and Max
let's not save it it's showing an error
let's find out
okay
let's find out the error here
we haven't
okay
now let's save it let's see
the image is coming very big let's just
cut this part
let's add the image
from my page only
copy element
going back to our code
to just paste it
we just need the
source code of the picture so let's copy
it only
and then
after deleting let's save it now and see
is it coming or not
okay
for my dead mind
let's now save it it's not coming still
let's see what's the issue here
so the issue here is coming is
I have to open the
image in new tab
then let's copy it from here
and then
I have to paste it inside this
now let's save this file
and then
it's not coming still so let's format
document
let's see the issue
why it's not working
let's let's first and the CSS
image Dot
this
and fit
limit the class name was DP
let's give it a border of
let's give them for the radius of
person after that we will get the height
of
30 pixels
foreign
[Music]
let's now save it and like you can see
the image is coming but it's not coming
right
so let's just copy some other image
foreign
let's see the issue
let's not see it here first
inside this
move it to the screen
[Music]
let's say this we'll add it after a
while
because the spacing is it's in between
the header middle items so we need to
fix this also
but first we need to fix the image part
so let's see what's the issue here
copy element let's copy it again we
don't need
let's see the
let me show here
let's open the image the image is
opening here
but why it's not working here
here okay fine let's add that
another simple long logo only
let's
inspect
open and new tab
involved with this
again let's try this picture
is it working
let's just save it
okay the Centerline logo is coming but I
don't know why that video is not coming
but let's
find let's cut this
let's
reduce the size of this picture
give it the height of
20
so I would be fine
though it should also be 25 again and
it's coming fine
yeah
now we have created this basic structure
but we first we need to delete this
space
let's go back to our code inside this we
have
given a maximum height so let's delete
that
they have seen it was in the middle part
so inside this middle
let's see
now it's coming like this
I have done one few change in this CSS
file and give the width back it was 100
but now I give it a 65 percent
so our upper body is ready now we'll
work on this bar
you now we'll work on this thing
home button explore shots in this we'll
add these all buttons after that we'll
go back to the
body part
now that we have created our header part
we will work on the sidebar which will
come here for that we have to create two
files inside this Source folder only
actually click on this and type
bar
dot Js
and another file called
side
bar
dot CSS
so
let's cut this
and this
and let's open this app.js file
and we'll write the
source of this file so we'll write side
let's save it
will show error for us for some time but
let it fine
let's move ahead
and let's create a sidebar
for that first we need to import react
from
react
no
we have been put the
sidebar
to open the folder we need to write this
add tool display also
the sidebar dot CSS
sidebar is also here
now let's create a function here
that's side part
insert this function we'll read
everything
so let's first Return of the class
let's create Dev
Class E
side path
inside this let's close this inside this
let's write
hello from Simply
hello
let's save it
let's see
which one erroring not defined
okay let's see what's there
said bar is not
okay we have to export it also
put fault and then
and let's save it now
it's it's still
the error
let's see
defined
let's see
what's the issue come in here
foreign
so let's
let's create a another class
everything will be printed
so let's click the printer
let's create another class
anymore
sorry
foreign
items
please
like items
Center
and then
we will list
close this
and then inside this
like the SVG
we can create it like this and we can
create it like this
let's create it like this only
or we can create it like this one
foreign
Ty
open let's paste it here
format
after that
foreign
I know
25 again
five pixels
cool
we have to make give it a name also
that here it's showing room so we have
to make it in the name for that we'll
use a tag called span
let's remove it
and let's give it a class name
fixed
let's take this off
okay
now let's save it
and see
how to join
ing
to do with some styling here
and let's write sidebar inside that
let's make this foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
but
I don't
active
okay we need to
add here
effective part
so everything
will come here so here we'll let active
let's save it
in here
all right
background color for this one
should be
99 E
after that let's
give some stylings to
very fast items
and set it let's scare is just different
content should be clicks
start
foreign
foreign
see what's the issue here
now I have done some edits here
on this sidebar.tss file
let's go to add
Explorer
[Music]
and inspect
inside this
let's find it it's 3D file
foreign
[Music]
create one
another
place
let's create here
clicks
and then
elements inside
let's see
okay fine
now let's just
give it a name
after this one
like this man to name it
will give it a class name
of
eight
nine
text
and then let's style it here only
wait
let's make it as 200 as of now
let's
close this inside
explore let's save it and see how it's
looking now
so it goes away
let's see what's the issue here
I think we just need to cut this part
here
let's
scale copy this part
and let's paste it here
and then as you can see it's showing
two things
so we'll name it as explore
after that
for that
let's copy this
like this
foreign
goes on the wrong side I have to put the
code here
let's see this class to another name
and now let's save it
as you can see
elevation but it's list a little cut
so we can just
let's save it
doing this fine so we need to do it
okay fine
now
let's complete this and add more parts
here like short subscription Originals

we will make it till here so let's count
it two we have created one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten and
eleven

Instagram clone and this is our clone
so we'll make
now also
this part
fill out these components only
let's create the filter component
okay
it's coming back to our
code
let's cut this Pages because they will
be done
so let's create a file called 3D filter
Dot
which is
another one is
dot CSX
so let's open the first file filter.jss
not JS
but first we need to add here the file
source
but
Theta
let's save it
let's see here but it's fine
import
filter from
filter
now we can save it
it's nothing but let's
see you
scream
because we haven't wrote anything inside
this let's start by putting the art
from here
moving ahead let's first
import me part
which is the styling
clear the part of that file which is
filter.css
okay
it's not showing because
of this part
so we'll remove this part from here
inside this we will create a class
let's name this class as main display
main display and inside this
will write that
filter
now let's save it
let's make sure it's there
let's see the issue what's the issue
here
we have given the header side part and
the filterable community let's
let's first create
a basic structure then we can see
let's just go to filter component
and inside this filter
let's create a function
inside this function
I'm really cute glass
you would be filtered again
inside this filter
looking great
H1 to C
hello from Simply
love
to see
whether it is in the correct format or
not
save it it's showing an error let's find
out after this
let's see it's the error
we have mixed export it again
export default
and then the file
let's now save it
let's see the issue what's coming
inside the filter only
module not found okay I have wrote
at the wrong spelling
but it's gone fits the filter
let's save it
now as you can see
it's coming straight
fine
let's just
focus on this now
but
filter
I have written here a property of filter
to give it a flex 0.8 and we are giving
it a 0.8 if you remember we have given
this header.css property
of 0.2
somewhere inside the side part GSS
I have given it the property of like 0.2
so Flex is what this screen is a flex
and it is divided into so many parts
so this part is it's taking 0.2
and the leftover path is taking 0.8 so
for videos and all of the stuff we need
this part
so we are giving it a 0.8 percent and
into this we are giving it 0.2 percent
so everything is clear now so let's cut
this file
inside this let's see all right okay
return
[Music]
of having done its value
let's now save it
and as you can see it will be
show here
hello from Simply them but it's coming
here but we want it to come here
so let's see what we can do
so it's coming here so let's do
something to say

creating these filters are very easy you
can see here
and I'm creating it's very easy to
create
let's just get its smallest to spinning
the filter
let's just close it too
it's like this let's create this fan
so we can write

and inside this Android or
let's save it and see
ing you here
let's change its size
let's go to this part

property
over here
let's write 50 pixel
so it should come up
and let's give it to Martin also
zero pixels
[Music]
and 10 pixels right
let's save it as you can see it came up
like this
so
let's go back to
fan class Vector item
okay
so let's write span
filter item

and inside this
that's right
now let's give it a font size of 16.
so let's try
font size

after that
let's give it a wedding
pixels and from right it will be 15
pixel
let's give it a border radius of 23
pixels
after
and after that let's give the borders so
we should come like a box type of thing
fun pixel solid
I only play the color the color that
we will beneath here is in e
and e and e 5 C
31.
let's save it
I'm receiving this let's see
as you can see it's coming

five hours
30
33 minutes
and
29 seconds
let's save it and you can see it's
coming very
like this so let's edit this one
for that let's go back to our

video duration
let's see
[Music]
oh yeah
okay
you have to give this hair
so let's change so as you can see here
the video of this link is shown in this
part
so like this you can add as many videos
as you want
here by just copying this part and then
just pasting it
so the rest is all fine
so let's just wind up this video by just
thanking everybody so thank you for
watching this video if you want the
source code for this video you just have
to comment it down
and I'll put the source code in the
description box and also I'll upload one
file which is this one
that
I haven't showed you this app.jss I'll
add these properties in the description
box in one file so you can just copy it
and then just
do the coding so let me show you
how a app will look like
here we are going to create a Facebook
clone with react.js
but before we jump to the coding part
let me show you how our Facebook login
page looks like
so we're gonna go to the Google
and this is how our Facebook clone will
look like
you can also log in from here
in this here
you have to write your email address
like my email address is
and I'll write the password and the
password I can write
and then
here I'll click on the login
lastly to say and never and this is how
I will login page main page will look
like
here you can add your status
this is your login your search bar
and here you can also add the status
and this is how you can upload a picture
so
we can easily create this clone
follow me throughout this video and you
will learn how to create a Facebook loan
so without further Ado let's create this
Facebook loan from scratch with a fun
manner
but first let me tell you what react.js
is
so what is react.js react is a
JavaScript library that is used to build
mobile and web applications fast and
interactive it is an open source
reusable component based front-end
library of JavaScript
react is a combination of HTML and
JavaScript
it provides a reverse and opiniated way
to build modern applications
so now
let's create this folder
back to our Visual Studio code
for this
you have to install node.js in your
laptop
and
react yes you can also
get our videos
just type how to install node.js and
react.js
on your system on our Channel you'll get
plenty of videos of this
so we'll go and create
new folder
let's
minimize this
say this
will open our terminal
press Ctrl backtick
or you can also
go here
and press terminal and new terminal okay
now
you have opened our terminal
here
you have to create a react project
so for that
we'll
have a command
it's just let me delete this
everything's look fine
in this video I will also show you how
to create a shortcut that you can use
which are used by the Developers
Now to create an empty react project the
command is
npx
create
react
and
and then
the folder name
so I'm gonna write the folder name as
Facebook
clone doubly because I have already
created Facebook clone with single e so
I'm gonna write clone press enter
this will take couple of minutes to
install all the modules so let's weigh
the form few seconds till it's finished
let's wait a couple of minutes more
so let's
cut this
okay maybe I have to learn this out
as you can see it's installing all the
modules of the app
ideology at home via script
moving forward we will also install the
add modules like
okay right let's talk about that further
in this tutorial
now we'll go into the
clone
now we'll write npm start
and this will open up react project
so the first step is done here now
coming back to our code
let's open this folder
my folder is inside this
C drive so I'm going to go to this here
users
and this is my folder as you can see
I've already created this video
so
this is how
this one full level look like
inside the source folder you'll have
this
app.js you don't need this logo so
you're gonna delete this
it will show some error let's see
coming back to index.js
let me do very few things here also
but before that
let me add one file here
for a couple of seconds
you can add that further in this
tutorial also
hello
we will remove this logo from here
instead of this it will import
react
we don't need this header also
here I'll write
hello
from
simply done
open Terminal
inside this Facebook loan you have
already in this hole so you don't have
to tell you CD let's zoom in for you
guys
this is fine
so it's showing hello from singular
add to a cone now
let's not waste any time and build our
Facebook app
now let's create a folder here
as login page
inside this folder we're going to create
two files login page node.js
and
login
page dot CSS
inside this GS file we're gonna write
all our code and inside this we are
going to do whatever signing packet
if you're coming back to our login page
we're going to first import react
after input is react
we need to import the CSS file for this
login
okay
okay fine
now we'll create a function
of the login page
inside this function
in the create one
fifth class
of your hands
inside this we're going to create
another class
name let's see the Facebook
text
so these are the keywords that we are
going to use in our CSS file
so let's
add his book
and here in export r
smoking Beach
let's save this coming back to a
codelets and delete this part
and then we'll leave
the login page
and let's call it Insider approaches
okay
let's find the problem here
okay
probably this here
you cannot install or import our file
like this
let's now save it and you can see it's
three
fine
coming back to our app dot CSS
here we go this so we're going to delete
and save this while let's cut this part
okay
you know
came back to our index.js
now we cannot see the Facebook
written in our
um
so let's just see what's speech okay
[Music]
close this
now let's save this as you can see the
video is written so
now let's move forward with our code
let's create this one
let's create another
class name
let me say this we're gonna write before
that let me log into my Facebook account
to see
what are we going to create
as you can see we are going to create
this
let's copy this text
and paste it here
and as you can see it's break after
shift
Define
coming back to a code let's see
the with after one
that's
move forward
after this
let's create a
class name of container
so we're gonna create this argument but
this is finished I'm gonna just create
this one you can study this color and
everything you never see subscribe
let's name this as you how to come
together
last name
here we're gonna add
two login inputs one for this email and
password
so let's fill it up first second word
thank you thank you
email
is a very intelligent language
there we are going to write emails with
just automatically knows that where you
have to write the email ID and then set
this password and I'll give it a type
password it automatically knows it's a
password type
so let's
hold here in this placeholder
let's click on this
this email address or password
placeholder is nothing but what's being
in the right inside this it can't be
fixed
so it's for the user
when we do it
press or
we will explain
let's create
games let's compare them again
another
guide
save this
it's time to see this
and sleep
good looking good
yes
it's coming back to our code
we are going to style this part it'll
look like this only
so just wait a couple of more minutes to
see the amazing love in danger
to creating this facing this we are
going to create a button
back at school
and here we're gonna leave
okay
let's just
delete button
it's created or not let's create it
okay now
coming back to a goal
see it for your password I think
it's creating the price
oh God
okay and inside this I'm going to give
it up
close this we're going to try it
forgotten
another person who will possible
save this and see
and you can see let's have another link
this is all because of the Android app
it's the data
let's quickly address
let's give it to break
us
58
is just
don't say this
button
we need a lot of speakers
[Music]
I think guys
trust me yes
foreign
this button
that's pretty good space
let's create another class name
when you're going to create another type
how to create
create
and after that what's the rest is
foreign
but it's
it's not
save this and see what's sculpted so
everything looks fine like recently now
the amazing part is the styling part now
we're going to style this part we'll
create it like this isn't it amazing
let's go to our code and inside our
view.css
let's come here
let's find it here and
let's
first
okay
[Music]
six would be fine
this part will imply on Earth will be if
this is a binder
same thing
inside this box says
so let's save this
so cute remember
F2
all right if
yes
in this login
reflects all these to this
problem it is
[Music]
[Music]
to fix it up from that
convention please space between
so
isn't it looking fine
let's move forward
you'll get to see everything like this
this login page
going to create a full-fledged in from
so just be with me

right
it's right right there
for this
yeah
are you Jim
um
to increase the size
foreign
do that
it's good
I see between this
so let's give it to the reporter of
eight
let's
give you but a little
let's give it
up
foreign
[Music]
let's see if it's
not working
this part
we will continue
let's see the issue with the container
so
the issue is here
amazing
it's include the size
of this
things
moving forward
it's
next
type is email
stupid
will be given inside this container
so we can jump
accents
and 22 pixels
[Music]
it's pretty much
yes
also
Define
this
is
now I'm just doing this week from now
and let's
stick to our parent information
so
if you don't want to know 73 pixels
same thing should be
nobody box
ES
foreign
also
let's copy this component
paste it here
because what we'll be saying
so
password
let's look on this please if we look
input
please hold them
let's see here for example this is
check there
it's much more
so let's give it a complete that's
looking fine
yes
now let's work on the button part
that
let's give it a display of links
Flex Direction
so it's slow
and width would be
good again
so you will copy this
tell me
let's paste it and save this button
again
you know this see
isn't it looking amazing
order
none
same thing
they have content
it's dating you know
it would be 15
seconds
don't even send it
slips okay
if I couldn't pretend
Center save it it's only the center
General
the person that's
just standing
and this would be five frame
should be
okay
next decorations no
that's okay
let's see here
okay everything's looks great
and let's have to see the button
s
you know
if you think
you know
because
already we are going to
delete this part login
but let's see this
is
a little Slim
it draws a bit
this is not good
what do you think is this
listening
let's move forward
and give a standing
that here
didn't help to increase
display always flicks and I've told you
this
will be ready

let's use this part
icipants
just play
tricks
and just if I could did
Center
color it is a factor will use
this building
is
true for this
that's killed it treatment
it will be
still to hit
yes

so let's first give it a trading list
you would be 15 pixels and
conferences
overseas
in this book

so
should we enter
into this button 60 percentages
very sorry

let's move forward
and here you give a bit of
flakes
hold
and what will finish this
25
margin
we have to ref
erencing Magic

so my Facebook is logged in first thing
we're going to create is this part this
header button
the search bar home and these all
buttons and these things coming back to
our code
let's open the enter dot so let's create
the files for this
here
dot Js
and then the new file header area dot
CSS first item
let's cut this part
the first thing we're going to do is we
got react
after that we're going to report
the CSS file so for that
area dot CSS
type will create a function of header
area
inside this we're going to return
welcome
foreign
[Music]
let's just see the full screen
inside this lovely button
I'm going to get them
full
so whenever we click on this login
it will redirect us to the homepage for
this Facebook
so we're going to declare the link
to
header
area
and this will drive the object
let's just save this part
we have to declare the react router but
after that let's open our terminal
inside this terminal we are going to
install the ACT router down so for that
we are going to write this command
npns installed iPhone iPhone save react
router down at 5.3.0 so let's install
these files
it will take a minute so
in the meanwhile
I'm going to add one file here
so let's import that also
it's done
so let's let's just close this and go
ahead
import link
absolutely
from
let's save this it is so you can't be
exist
so let's see the issue fine settings
forward
save this coming back to the code
let's see
what this
going back to app.js
here
we are going to report
Universal reaction
I'm going to use route
and switch method here
that's firmware which is
right now I'm going to see login and
let's import
header area from either area
let's just delete the start and inside
this we will hit switch
and switch router parts from one page to
another
you will tell you why we are doing this

and then here's an unloaded
login
let's disclose this here
let's just copy this
movie
and head
we are going to write
header
area
and this is not what we're going to need
here
foreign
so because of this function the page
will redirect from
let's just
start this
is doing what it is it will redirect our
login page to the header page
that's where we have written here out
from login to data button although main

let's find out the issue here
but it's not redirecting me
okay
so let's see
now I have added one file here
service.worker.js
you can find all these files in the
description box
I'm going to give a drive link where you
will find all this code for free
so I've also added one image folder in
which I have added few images
like this and I'm going to use in this
so let's close this this
part
it's it's done
and also done so let's
work on this
so I've done few changes in this file
also you can see
that I have important this service
worker from service worker and then

inside this header we are going to write
another class
of meal first hitter
and this
let's give it a class option logo
and then
add up your volume
so inside there is something like image
source of the image is

then
okay
let's save this and as you can see it's
coming
right like this isn't it amazing
I'm loving it
let's go back to our code again
and now this logo
we're going to add one
so far it's like this
come back to the code
this part is done
okay
so let's work on our
okay but before this we have to improve
it with another file
let's
actually install the
you can't npm install reactor and I can
save
so it will install all the icons for us
like if a users have register and we are
going to use it no worries if you don't
do that I'm going to cover up in this
video
so coming back to our code
it's just
d
written
yeah perfect
in this spot is done
after this logo part we'll create
another depth
us would be search is fine
search
and save this we're going to add AI
outline
search
I've been doing both these
here also
we'll do that
no shoes
let's just first complete this part
would be fine
okay
let's just save this and draw another
yes well you have it imported this from
the architecture so that's important
hey
root
icons slash
yeah it comes under Air library
let's say this and now
and this logo is coming
nice
lips
and forward

to the color for this will be
let's see
value will be
okay it's like although you will be
triggered and then this one would be
active so I'll tell you
here number seven
let's close this
study it
has fewer classes like this
yeah
this is funny
moving forward
let's just delete these
will tell you why I have written it
inside the first icon
so
why I have written this in the first
part is
because we need this as a blue and these
are all follows so that's why I have
written here the color wrist Blue app in
this color blue
so
let's stream the names again
so the second one
G

we have created one box and this is what
our Instagram logo
pop it up
let's open our
terminal
so
that's right
it's fine
we don't need this one
one for the main
or one for the script container to the
speed container
I'm going to add one
once
two
we have created one div here
yeah it's fine
now it's looking
up
like here earlier it was looking down
now let's remove this
till now I'm sure you have
gotten the idea
for why we have taken this
okay let's make it
thematic
yeah let's save it
now
as you can see
in our app
and in Instagram
there is this one
margin on the top
so let's open our CSS
where I'm going to write margin
25 pixels let's save it
yeah
our app is also looking like the
Instagram login page
right
and then it started looking cool
right okay
let's make it as here as it is showing
inside there
yeah you have to give betting to this
Instagram
like
you have to create this also
let's
give it some space here
let's
let's give it margin top to everything
so it should align C
uh inside the main also
I'm going to give margin
55 pixels okay
now in this rate
I'm going to give it a border which is
fine margin is fine
margin is what fruit top we need so
let's save it
this Dexter Lane is
Center so our Instagram will
be inside this container which is Center
isn't it looking very similar to The
Original Part
now let's move forward
with the next step inside this container
I am going to create
these phone number and all okay
let's work on this container open your
login.jss
yes file
after this
let's create
a Dev
inside this let's create another div
so
yeah
there are two divs
there's some space in between these and
this
so it's fine
I'm going
to
open this
let's read
class of login
page
i g i n
just written the wrong spelling
now let's write input text
inside the you have to use the play cell
you have to use that placeholder
like you also have to write these things
now
okay
let's write
similar input for password also
input type okay
or text
type which is
I am asking
let's type
and the type of this is password
let's
forward
see
yeah
for username password we can just make
it
looks similar to the original one
with the help of
what CSS right
let's create a button
let's write sine
okay
let's just save it
you'll see one sign button yeah like
this
coming back to the code
let's write
let's
okay here we are
let's make it with CSS you have to get
class name
last name we are going to give
let's name it simple only login page
next
type of this let's copy it from here
and let's paste it here
for button I'm going to add another
class
as login
button
let's just save it and see the magic
it's not showing let's see what's the
issue warming
okay
I did the CSS and why we are expecting
so many other things okay
first we are going to add the
for login text
and I'm going to write these three
page width
let's write 258
which is the exact same
height
which is 36 pixel same again
I've inspected these things so I'm
pretty sure of that
login
button
inside this let's give it a width
of
70 only
because the button should be
small
now let's see
yeah
okay we need to do some
changes here also we will it's coming
outside of this container let's see
is we have added here inside the
container
okay
okay here I have done few changes in the
dev
now
as you can see
it's coming inside the container now
we are gonna give some space so for that
let's give them some margin within your
piece dot CSS
and here
I'm going to give it a margin
of 5 pixels
okay
also I'm going to give it a border
because color is very dark there
I'm gonna change that
solid
and
DB
yeah
and this is looking good
and we have to create one more
which is
login
page
sign in
yeah
inside this let's give it a margin from
Top as
25 pixels let's save it
and see the changes yeah
so
now the color of this is looking exactly
like the
this one now coming back to the button
part
let's just
add the
bit
will be creative field it here
oh
as you can see here
it's not coming inside this because we
have
open this one in the
let's close this
let's first add the placeholder or let's
work on the button bar okay let's
just add the placeholder which is phone
number user anymore
email
so inside this text now
we have to add this
placeholder
after this I am going to add one
placeholder
it is going to tell us what's
comes inside this
number email
or
usually
okay
and inside here let's create another
placeholder
select this let's write password
let's save it okay it's called
the email is coming
username
or
save it yeah
just looking amazing
right
now coming back to the CSS file
let's give it a background
yeah
after the Border we are going to give it
a background color which is a little mix
of white
so I'm gonna write hash
f a f a f a let's save it
now it's a little bit
dark white okay
same as
this original one
yeah
moving forward
let's now
coming back to the code
let's
cut this one
let's write this
okay
uh we're going to give
padding left too
10 pixel
yeah this is coming fine
let's just
add one more which is
border radius here
5 pixel is fine yeah
no
okay let's give
the spot in some height
after the height you're going to give it
border radius for 5 pixels
after that font weight
let's give the font rate bold
and then we will order for this
which is 1 pixels solid
and the color would be
okay let's see the color here
in the original one sky blue okay
bye
the sky blue color is zero three nine
five F six let's just save it
okay
it's coming great
but let's just
sir
because we need background color of this
as blue so
3956 yeah it's a little dark
okay
and the color of the button should be
White
so
you can just
let's see yeah it's coming beautifully
right
whenever we hide the ID password Here

let's
work on
gifts
to minimize this
let's
add here 40

margin
from Top

so we are going to give with the margin
of 5 pixels yeah this is the line now

as power and all
so coming back to app.js

if
let's save it yeah

can fetch in the import
login with Facebook and then another div
of class name login forget
password

here
I think this FB
from the image folder let's just save it
and see
this is how it is looking we need to
shrink the size of this image
let's see the original one first okay
it's coming very small but in our case
it's coming very big so what we can do
is
you can go to our CSS file and reduce
the size of this
login Facebook
so I have added here
margin top is let's add 10.
and see the changes
nothing is here
so let's wait
okay let's not
ice the
here we can also
add the margin
right
so why can't we give the width here
it's right width
15 pixels
and let's see
yeah it's coming beautifully
right
now
coming to this password
you can make this as a hyperlink also
okay
but let's just give some styling to this
look and feel let's
a little less
okay let's just do it now
so
let's give it margin right
let's save it
for the image got lost
okay we just have to give
exactly
number which is
5 pixel now
what it is saying it's saying this okay
okay
this can't be fixed from here

okay we have given
now it will be fine
yeah
yes it's looking good
now
we'll work on this
sign in and sign up button
let's just
go to our
project

because we need to come out of that main
container

okay
this one is fine
get the sign up button sign in this
thing
this one is looking good
let's add it here yeah
now it's working fine
yeah
now what we can do is
you have to give this a little bedding
so it comes under this
so come back to
line up
the top base
you don't have an account sign up
you don't have any account sign up
and then oh we need to add
get app
let's first form this now
get the app
let's minimize this this one also
refresh and it's coming perfectly fine
as I'm not going to add these data we
can do that
but I'm not going to do that
so
let's add some images like this one
here
for that
let's write here
oh clone get the app after that
I'm going to
create one another div
at this I'm going to add these images
okay
images source
store
close this one
to that again
image
source
Play Store
let's save it
okay
we have to
add the images imported
just a second
yeah
let's import this app store and Play
Store images
copy this one
called B
paste
that I'm going to write
App Store
and here I'm going to write Play Store
and the image name is
app
and this one is play
let's just save it
and see
okay it's coming very big we need to
give it the width also
let's
code
everyone here we are going to give it
some width
let's give this one
136
pixels
yeah and let's copy this
that's
yeah let's paste it and
yeah you can see the output
we have to make some padding and all
okay let's coming back to our code
let's give this one
sign up page or let's
let's give it another
okay
let's let this one only
let's fix this
let's give this images
class name

add this
watching motion
okay
edit this t w i n g but
okay this is the mistake
I thought it's not fetching the right
margin
it's not fetching the right margin
let's just
from the CSS
there right
top save it
margin is fine
okay we need to give some margin in
between the
container and get the app okay

maximum petting
from here we have given some padding
buds
and things were fine so let's right here
40
