this is doctors taken from team MDS
conquer now I'm going to discuss about
few secrets of dental Anatomy
preparation in need aims easy and super
colorful so coming to the Buffs
ideology of dental an order so hope we
have finished this particular subject in
our first videos ok with all the
carvings and all the tricky task so I
want everyone to go back to videos first
year to just have a glance about few
important aspects that you need to
remember but you have the number when
you are doing the carbons and the
Weibull so because most of your
questions related to the dental and/or
turning in examination point of view as
and MCQs will this area itself so if you
just take them neat blueprint out and
just have a look around the number of
coaches that are they going to pick from
dental an ottoman it's going to be seven
order and most of the products like
occlusion or the structure of
temperament blood joint are the muscles
of mastication a few other topics are a
part of many other subjects okay so
exclusively if you want to have an
exclusive look over the dental and
automate dental Anatomy we'll be talking
more about eruption sequence
calcification sequence root and
completion sequence and the differences
between the anatomy of Internet Retailer
for example most commonly asked
questions are the differences between
the primary teeth and permanent
indentation in an autumn upon interview
are they can ask you peculiar feature
which is seen in a peculiar tip if it
can be a primary or it can be upon
or they can ask you the differences
between the maxillary can ever in the
blood can it or they can ask you the
distances between the first and second
molars or max that in mind it will activ
apart from this they can give a view of
any of the teeth and they can ask you to
identify it simply the views are
represent in the last few pages of your
verus okay most I hope you remember
those days where we used to make a note
about the lens cervical area everything
like dimensions which is highest which
is lowest and all these questions are
the most common things that that
regularly ask they can ask your diagram
based questions they can ask questions
at any level so need is going to have
seven odd score according to the
blueprint and if you just analyze the
recent sessions of aims that is the two
sessions of aims for 200 200 scores okay
there was somewhere around six to eight
questions in this particular area and
PGI is going to carry some people four
or five in some situations and same goes
with the chip not to Jeff Murray's also
going to that is number eleven root of
four okay but most of your questions has
already mentioned they will move around
the eruption sequence they're going to
give a particular is okay they can ask
you what are the teeth that are erected
or they can give you that this
particular teeth has erupted they will
ask you the eyes of the shield or they
can give most commonly diagnosed
question can be a mixed dentition they
will give you a mixed dentition on OPG
and they will ask you that any tattoo is
of this particular child is by seeing
the eruption sequence you need to
identify the rough is in the four
options so this is how and where you
need to focus so to my view theoretical
aspect means a question which is just
based upon a theory or just eruption
okay maxillary teeth maxillary can I
added set mandibular first premolar
erupted said God calcification is
initiated at or the root and completion
is developed at all these are questions
where you have to directly answer okay
you have to remember
sequence but at the end of the day you
need to remember it's more of an a
memory based thing but if you see the
recent sessions of either aims or need
most of the questions are application
based ok they're their application based
they're going to give a something and
they're going you need to apply it for
example when you're talking about your
Pediatrics or I know Donna takes I mean
a question on epics or Genesis an epic
suffocation will depends upon the route
and completion this means you need to
know the route and completion by which
you can predict whether to go for epic
so Genesis or a pacification or any
other treatment accordingly okay so this
is something called as an application
based question or they can give the a's
of heg of a child and they can ask an
orthodontic treatment related to that so
again in this particular content you
need to know the ace of the chilled so
by knowing the age of the child or ace
of the OPG of the paiace of the child of
the opz then you can plan whether to go
with a preventive treatment or
interceptor treatment or any other
treatments so similarly you will have
application based questions mostly most
oftenly and I can assure you that the
group is going to help you out in
application based questions both the
diagram as well as the clinical aspects
so this is what a rough idea and seven
months I'm allocating seven days along
with the day of examination is already
the schedules were posted I will be
discussing this year deal too and the
book that you need to carry is of course
the villas that is the dental and/or to
me physiology and absolution so Q some
more importance to inclusion of course
after collusion we will do you know
ortho occlusion will do in process oh
but whatever it is just try to give more
importance to occlusion also which is
going to be a tricky thing so I want you
guys to keep valence as a reference and
try to refer as much as you can okay so
it's going to help you out it's going to
make your concept strong it's going to
make your notes well so that you no need
to waste much of your time in the round
two so if you are spending seven days
now
I hope hardly it's going to take two to
three days for this particular subject
in round two if your material is
properly
prepare Sonic's goes next course what
are the things that you need to do like
apart from Venice you can keep it as a
as a reference book and I feel like
dental Anatomy dental denote to me in
dental pulse is fair enough okay you can
you can you can proceed with the
synopsis try to finish the synopsis as
fast as possible if you have time you
can you can start away right now after
hearing this video the media chart and I
want you guys to start the synopsis part
of dental pulse of dental Anatomy it is
tricky it is more of memory based you
need to mug up few things then play a
few concepts so that you can retain the
subject for a long consideration of time
so you can swallow them secrets that are
present in the pulse and the synopsis
once you are done with that followed by
the textbook reading and the video
discussions and the regular discussion
panel in the you know in our group as
well as in our website and that is more
than sufficient to practice on n number
of MC cues which we are going to provide
as a daily examinations so this is what
the plan and you can use or keep your
power play book volume 3 where you have
dental Anatomy as an accessary things
there a few things which were discussed
which are added and everything so this
is what my rough plan is like you can
keep whalers as a reference you can
finish your tenth dental pulse okay you
can finish your dental pulse part and
followed by the discussions of the group
and followed by the videos that are
posted on the group okay so with your
power play books okay so these are the
mandatory things dental pulse all the
chapters with the synopsis and
explanation has to be done next goes
with the discussions of the group next
goes with the video classes of the group
and followed by your PP books so these
four are mandatory things even then if
you have time I suggest okay I suggest a
quality of preparation is more required
a quality of practice is also more
required rather than doing the things
here and there here
there which all it's almost mimic for
example if you're doing it two books two
basic books
I'm Secours most of the questions will
be just just like a copy-paste version
like the questions will be same the
answers will be same in fact the answers
will differ leads to lots of controversy
in this particular subject I don't want
that to happen for you so my suggestion
is if you have time if you have that
extra elements of time I prefer you guys
to go ahead and do decks okay there is
something called as no dental decks
which is useful for NBD for USA based
exam but anatomy part of dental takes is
decent enough and it's going to be an
accessory okay I mean if you want to
have a net practice a quality net
practice then the axial thing apart from
the daily examinations discussions and
the video classes on the group the
quality net practice is going to be your
dental decks okay you can add this as an
accessary but make a note I'm mentioning
clearly you need to finish this
once you finish these four okay in these
seven days still you feel if you have
time then I feel you better go with this
so the next important thing that I want
to stress is the time that you spend
from now okay so now it's not like the
regular thing because we are five months
away from the examination we hardly have
five months that is roughly 150 days so
I suggest everyone to split your day
into two parts okay
so split your day into two parts for
example and and I suggest I suggest if
you are not a clinician I hope most of
the clinicians have not opened their
clinics even if you are a clinician and
the exception is only for the mother who
is having kids or who is very
responsible to take care of the family
of the rest of all people who are not
going to the colleges maybe the few GDC
people who are running behind the
colleges for the opie but not full-time
okay even if they're going to the
colleges they don't have high opie they
are not stressed so it's mandatory that
you need to spend a minimum ten hours
per day
from now it should the maximum can be up
to 1516 also I don't mind reading 15 16
hours per day but the minimum is 10 for
example if you are reading for 10 hours
and you need to split it into two halves
five hours five hours okay you have five
hours you have five hours and five hours
so please do divide your tasks in such a
way that you need to cover the things as
for for example morning 5 hours for a
particular topic you can keep for dental
pulse and the followed by the next 5
hours you can keep for rest of the stuff
ok so if you do this you will finish the
tasks on time and if possible if you
work extra for example when you come
back with a person who is preparing for
10 hours per day and 15 hours per day 10
novice is going to be two parts as 5 in
5 and 5 if it is 15 hours it's going to
be 3 parts 5 into 5 into 5 so you can
finish 5 hours this 5 hours this
followed by 5 hours this this is all how
much time you sacrifice and you keep in
the preparation the more you keep the
more smart you work okay the more smart
you work and the better your eyes will
be we always hear a word of one long
back when we were in school survival of
the fittest okay right so it's so it's
goes same with the need examination also
need rank list also aims examination
also aims rank list also whatever it is
but now this the statement of survival
of the fittest is just a modified no
what is that
survival of the smartest people who work
hard it is common
everyone are working hard to be
successful now the people who work hard
in the smartest way will reach the goals
in a limited time so smartness has to be
added to their preparation the more you
work the more smarter you are the more
chances that you will be successful okay
I hope you will take these words okay
and please to implement this when you
start implementing good things in the
preparation then the good things will
come back to you the next important
aspect is the rough schedule
I'm going to talk like most yeah in the
in the first two days our plan will be
on this okay we'll talk about the in
detail description of the differences
between the deciduous in the primary
dentition and followed by all the teeth
although all the teeth will be tough all
the types of the teeth will be done at
the futures will be done and followed by
the permanent dentition all the teeth
differences everything we'll discuss
then followed by calcification eruption
and route and completion to be to be
open calcification routine completion
calcification eruption and all these are
a simple table it's a table of one pace
but application based things are more
important of this area which we'll be
discussing those with the occlusion
types of occlusion what are the users
which is you will see this occlusion or
a questions are not illusion which fossa
which correspond all these things anyway
I hope you're good at you have a basic
knowledge with which you can answer
these questions but I am going to add
few more things that going to help you
out then we will talk about the ten
Tashia structures temporomandibular
joints is your theological form of the
teeth and all these will be covered
which are not that great important but
has to be covered then goes with how
given one more day extra day for the
revision synopsis and everything will
have so many extra based questions and
the examination is going to be on 12 for
120 bucks okay so you will have a
diagram based discussion I will try to
cover all 2018 2019
2017 2020 recent questions which you
have to be you should know these recent
questions so that you will get to know
how application based they are going in
this particular level so that you get
you can get prepared up to that
particular level
okay well we will have a diagram based
session forward I will have a diagram is
the exam and my ideology is to make
things fast and makes things best hope
you will follow this
you will implement this in the
preparation to make your preparation as
best and prefer abilities should be your
last preparation no thought of repeating
exams because the last few days I was
talking with most of you few people
there telling that we are not up to mark
I have decided to repeat the exam no
Karuna has changed everything right
corbett 19 has changed everything and
now even after this situation after this
tricky situation if you are postponing
things it doesn't make any sense we
thought of so much to do this do that to
go here lots lots of plans were done
right including you whether it's an
intern repeated everything they have
their hope on the life they have their
plans on the life what happened in the
last four months is a best example so my
suggestion is never postponed anything
the time whatever
