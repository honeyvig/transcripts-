design has always been my passion but
when I got promoted to a role that
requires handling a team of uiux
designers I was taken a back it was then
I realized I needed to upskill myself if
I had to supervise my team in the right
direction I chose to pursue Advanced
certification in uiux design from triple
it Bangalore powered by simply learn now
I am more conf confident I can handle my
team effectively and can deliver ideas
to the
management hi my name is adya agrawal I
am a design and creative lead and this
is my
journey I am from a small town dur which
is based out in chhattisghar so I
completed my engineering in information
technology in 2013 subsequently I
pursued mtech in computer technology
concluding in 20 2016 post this I moved
from chhattisghar to Pune and started my
career then on the first company I
joined was PN edu training private
limited as a Content developer and
researcher I again switched and joined
my present company looking at my
expertise in this field my company
promoted me to design and creative lead
and then I started handling a team of
uiux designers I was assigned a huge
responsibility of leading the team and
to to supervise them in the right
direction an advanced uiux designing
course seemed to be the only solution to
these problems I decided to upskill
myself with the tools used for Designing
I wanted to be updated and Lead my team
responsibly so I started browsing online
about the uiux design certification then
I found that triple it Bangalore is
offering this Advanced certification in
uiux design powered by simply learn when
I proposed this idea to my manager he
agreed and asked me to pursue the course
my learning experience on uiu design
with simply learn was simply great to be
honest initially when we started the
session I found it too complicated I was
also skeptical about the online classes
but soon after completing 1 month I
found the trainer to be very good he
truly had practical knowledge and
expertise in this field the concepts he
explained were Illustrated with real
life examples real life problems and how
to solve them for instance he gave a
clear understanding of what kind of
problems companies face and how ux
designers can Sol them the trainer was
very supportive and quick to solve any
of the doubts in the sessions he spent a
lot of time with us explaining how to
use figma in our mobile phones websites
Etc after the certification course with
the skills I learned I was able to
redesign my company's website which is
helping us to get more traffic and leads
at the same time for the website I
started working on its design and had a
very detailed discussion with the
manager content writer developers and
digital marketing analyst I had the idea
that a well-designed website can enhance
the user experience I understood that I
have to come up with a simple and clear
interface that can help users navigate
through the app and they can easily
understand the functionality of the
platform unlike before now I have a
particular reasoning behind my task I
have developed more logical thinking I
can say I have learned how and what
exactly user interface is why exactly
user experience
matters I got married in
2019 and I have a kid she's 3 and 1/2
years old as a married woman and mother
juggling work and personal life was
tough working 5 days a week and
dedicating weekends to a course POS the
biggest challenge leaving me with
limited time for my family I believe in
giving 100% on any task and I feel that
in life when you have the sheer
determination to achieve something
nothing can hamper your growth
