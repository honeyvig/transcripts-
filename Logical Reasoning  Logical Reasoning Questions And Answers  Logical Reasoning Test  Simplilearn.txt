hello everyone welcome to yet another
exciting video by simplyla
today we will go on a quest to uncover
commonly asked logical reasoning
questions in an aptitude test and the
topics they are based on
we'll go through all these details one
by one so stay tuned until the end of
this video
at first
we shall look into the agenda for
today's session
the section that carries more weightage
in logical reasoning tests are coding
and decoding sitting arrangement series
completion direction sense blood
relations
clock and calendar based questions
we'll tell over details of all these
categories one by one but before we
begin make sure to subscribe to our
channel and hit the bell icon to never
miss an update from simply learn
the first topic we are going to cover is
coding and decoding this section is one
of the most common sections included in
all major exams conducted across the
country many students find coding and
decoding questions quite difficult thus
they avoid attempting these scoring
questions and thereby loot some easy and
quick marks we'll look into the basics
of these concepts to elevate our chances
of tackling these questions
first let's understand coding
coding is a part of logical reasoning
section used to encrypt words numbers in
specific pattern or codes using
particular rules and regulations in more
technical terms it is also referred to
as encryption and it is widely used
across all messaging platforms to
protect the context that users are
communicating
the logic that these encryptions follow
is known as key which can cipher the
context in no time
let's have a look at an example to
comprehend this better
the problem statement given here states
that in a certain language
kinematophobia is written as
k-n-i-e-a-m-r-o-t
then how hilarious will be written in
the same language
the logic to answer this question is
engraved in the conversion of
chynomatophobia to
r o k-n-i-e-a-m-r-o-t p o h b a i
so let's take these words to our
workpiece and figure out the logic
now if you compare both these strings
with one another then you'll see that
the logic of encryption is pretty clear
after every character the next two
characters are interchanging their
positions
as we have found the logic of coding
here so the next step will be to apply
it to the question string that is
hilarious
so let's do that the first letter will
regain its position and for the second
position we'll have l and then i
after that we'll keep l as it is and
then we'll interchange position of a and
r
next characters will be i u o and s
thus the answer to this question should
be h l i l r a
i u o
on that note here is a similar question
for all of you to get your understanding
of the concept the problem statement and
alternatives are given on your screens
so make sure to solve this problem and
drop your answers in the comment box
below let's see how many of us can get
this right
next we have is decoding
decoding is the process used to decrypt
the patterns into original forms
in other words to achieve decoding
you'll require the logic of encoding
so the first thing you'll have to do in
this type of questions is to find the
key of encryption or the logic behind
encoding
let's look into the sample question to
understand how these kind of problems
work
the problem statement states that in a
certain language the word book is
written as four three zero zero
mate is written as three nine zero zero
then one six zero zero will represent
which word out of the given alternatives
here we have been provided with two
examples representing the logic of
encoding so let's look into each one of
them one by one first we'll look at the
encryption of word book
the word book has been converted into
numerical format so there must be some
sort of relation between alphabetical
numbering and number 4300
so what we'll do is we'll take the
reference from this alphabetically
ordered list
the characters b o and k have position
values 2 15 and 11 and if you sum all
these values you'll get number 43 i
don't think there is any logic behind
those two trailing zeros
but we'll look into one more encoding
example to ensure that
the next string is mate
which is encrypted as three nine zero
zero
in this case character m a t e have
alphabetical positioning values 13 1 20
and 5 simultaneously
and the summation of these values will
be 39
meaning the logic that we have found out
as the appropriate one
from the previous two coding examples we
can say that the right answer should
have 16 as a character summation value
and the only option that has 16
character summation value is cage
which is option 4 in this scenario
next we have its sitting arrangement
these questions involve arranging the
persons or objects according to the
conditions given in a question
you'll have to understand the seating
sequence direction is the person facing
inwards or outwards etc to be able to
conclude the answer
these sorts of questions include
straight line seating arrangement
complex sitting arrangements such as
circular rectangular and triangular
arrangements
first we'll solve the sample problem
based on the linear setting arrangement
the problem statement convinced that a p
r x s and z are sitting in a row s and z
are in the center a and p are at the
ends r is sitting to the left of a then
who is the right of s
from the first statement itself we can
say that we are supposed to arrange six
persons in a straight line
the next statement says that s and z are
sitting at the center so we'll place
them in the center part of straight line
moving forward the problem statement
says that a and p are sitting at the end
of our straight line so we'll arrange
them as well
the next statement says that r is
sitting to the left of a but as there is
no left position to the a
will interchange position of a and b
and now certainly we can add person r to
the left of a
now there is only one position left so
we'll place x over that position
as all the persons are arranged in a
straight line we can draw an inference
about who is sitting to the right of s
and the answer to this question
is z moving ahead we'll look at the
sample question of circular setting
arrangement
the problem statement given here states
that p q r s t u and v are sitting
around a circular table facing the
center and there are three conditions
that emphasize more about the positions
around the circle
the first one says that r is next to the
left of u and v is second to the left of
r
the next condition entails that p is
sitting third to the left of t
and the last condition says that q is
between s and t
by utilizing all these three conditions
we are supposed to find out alternative
player that has the first person sitting
to the immediate left of the second
person
let's formulate a solution to this
problem at first we'll add a circular
shape and we'll also place six holder
onto it representing the 6th person
sitting in a circular pattern
now looking at first condition will fix
the position of r at any random
placeholder to figure out the position
of other people
reading the half part of her statement
that is r is next to the left of u you
can draw a inference that u should be
the right of r
so we'll assign the position to u as
well moving ahead let's deal with the
other half of her statement it says that
v is second to the left of r
thus at the second left position of r
will place v
going to the second condition which says
that q is between s and t that means to
place q s and t will certainly need
three empty positions close to each
other and there is only one group with
three empty positions that is between v
and u
hence we'll add s t
and q there
also
the second condition of our list says
that p is sitting to the third to the
left of t now by measuring the third
left location from t we'll add p to our
circular arrangement
we have formulated the arrangement
pattern so let's dig up the right answer
from all presented alternatives
the first option we have is qt
if you look at this option you'll see
that q is sitting to the right of t
hence we'll remove this option from our
list
then we have option rp
and here
also r is to the right of p so we'll
remove this option as well
then we have sv
and
s is available at the left position of 3
hence sv is the right answer for our
question on that note here is a similar
question for all of you guys to gauge
your understanding of setting
arrangement concept
the problem statement and alternatives
are given on your screens so make sure
to solve this problem and drop your
answers in comment box below let's see
how many of us can get this question
right
having said that let's move to the next
category that is series completion
questions
in this section the candidate is
interested with recognizing a pattern in
a given set of numbers or letters then
he'll have to pick up an option that
follows the same pattern otherwise he'll
have to identify the term that does not
perfectly match the logic of given
sequence
there are three types of sequences
you'll come across in this series
completion questions first one is
alphanumeric second one is alphabetic
and third one is numeric sequences
the main task you'll have to carry out
is identifying the logic encrypted in
this set of numbers or characters
let's look into the sample problem of
series completion
the first problem of series completion
is based on numerical sequencing and the
sequence that we have been provided with
is 8 6 9 23 and 87
let's take these numbers on our
workspace to formulate an answer
now if you observe these terms you won't
find any direct pattern so let's break
these numbers
we can derive the second term from the
first one by subtracting 2 from it but
this pattern won't make sense for
upcoming terms so what if we represent
it as 8 multiplied by 1 minus 2
now let's try to relate this pattern to
our next term here if we represent it as
6 into 2 minus 3 then we'll get third
number of our sequence
this suggests that we are increasing
each breakdown by 1.
let's take 9 now
9 into 3 minus 4 is 23 and similarly 23
into 4 minus 5 is 87
this means the pattern that we have
found is correctly appropriate therefore
the next term will be 87 into 5 minus 6
which is nothing but 429
let's look into one more problem for
series completion
this time the type of sequence we have
is alpha vertical
which goes like w f b
t g d q a g and question mark here we
are supposed to find out the alternative
that can replace the question mark sign
so let's bring this sequence into our
workspace to figure out an answer
the logic for alpha vertical sequence is
most frequently embedded in their
numerical ordering
hence let's bring an alphabetic numeric
table to consider their orders
now using the table values we'll figure
out consecutive sequencing for each
character in all three terms
now if you look closely at each first
character numbering for all three terms
you'll see the pattern
23 minus 3 is
20. 20 minus 3 is 17 and 17 minus 3
should be the next character that is
with sequence number 14 and that should
be the character n
now let's figure out the middle
character of our next term
here if you observe g is one place
forward to that of f
similarly in third term we have h which
is again one place larger than g
and by abiding by this logic the middle
term for our next term should be one
place greater than h which is nothing
but
i
finally let's discover the final
character for our next term
here if you observe each character
increases linearly with the value 1
hence the final character should be 4
places greater than g
which is k in this case now by compiling
all these characters that we have
figured out we'll get the right answer
to our question which is option b n i k
moving forward we'll look into the alpha
numeric series problem
the sequence given here starts like z 1
a x 2 d
v 6 g t 21 j r 88 m and p 445 p
so we'll take this sequence on our
workspace to figure out
what this series is all about we'll
break each term into three parts
and we'll arrange it in tabular format
let's first figure out the logic behind
starting characters if you observe this
set of characters you'll see that each
step one character has been omitted we
have z and x in this set where y has
been omitted similarly we have v and t
and the middle character out of them
that is u has been omitted
and if we apply the same logic the next
character should be n
let's figure out the last letter in this
case two characters have been omitted
for each inclusion
after a we have d and after d we have g
which means we have omitted bc and ef in
accordance with the same logic we'll
discard the character q and r and will
include character s into our table
finally let's discover the middle part
of our next term here each term is
multiplied and added to the previous
term with the increment of one
for example the second term equals to
the previous term into one plus one the
third term is equal to the second term
into two plus two which is 6
next term is the third term into 3 plus
3 which is 18 plus 3 which is 21.
similarly
the following term should be 21 into 4
plus 4 which equals 88
by following the same sequence logic we
can say that the next term should be 445
into 6 plus 6 which is nothing but
2676
that means our answer is option
2
following this we have direction since
there are 4 main directions east west
north and south also there are four
cardinal directions such as north east
north west south east and southwest the
questions in this section will test your
understanding of these directions you
may also be asked to compute the
shortest feasible distance between the
starting and ending points
we'll look at one sample question to get
an idea about the question
the problem statement given here states
that from his house lokish went 15
kilometer to the north
then he turned to his left and covered
ten kilometer
then he turned to south and covered five
kilometer finally turning to his left he
covered ten kilometer in which direction
is he from his house
let's figure out an answer to this
question by testing each statement
first of all
we will add a direction plot to make
sure we get the answer plot right
the first statement states that locus
went to 15 kilometer knob this also
means that we'll add a line in upward
direction marking it with a distance of
15 kilometer
the next statement says that after
covering 15 kilometer towards north he
turned to his left and covered extra 10
kilometers
his left side is wedged so we'll add a
straight line in that direction
the third statement conveys that lokis
turn to the south and walk five
kilometer
and further he turned to his left and
covered 10 kilometer more
now if you trace his current location
from the starting point that is his home
you'll see that it is in north direction
so the right alternative for our
question
is option 3
the next topic is blood relations
the questions which are asked in this
section depend upon relation so you
should have a sound knowledge of blood
relations in order to solve these
questions
let's look at one sample question to get
an idea about how these blood
relationship questions work
the problem statement given here states
that introducing to a boy a girl said he
is the son of the daughter of the father
of my uncle how is the boy related to
that girl
let's figure out an answer to this
question by breaking the problem
statement into chunks
we'll start tracing the problem
statement from backward direction the
highlighted path says father of my uncle
and uncle's father is nothing but the
grandfather this grandfather has a
daughter
so we'll add that daughter here and this
daughter has a son whom this girl is
referring to now this means the guy in
the picture is girl's brother which is
option 1.
the next topic is clock
the questions in this section are based
on timeline clocks
you will come across questions such as
measurement of angles between hands of
clock coincidence between hands of
clocks time when particular angle
between hands of clock is given
time lost in a false watch etc
let's understand the concept of clock
first
in a watch a second hand covers 360
degrees within 60 seconds
how much angles do you think a minute
hand will cover
well a minute is nothing but 60 second
so if we divide the measurement of a
complete clock by 60 then we should get
the angle covered by a minute hand and
360 by 60 is nothing but 6 degrees so 6
degrees will be the angle covered by
minute hand in 1 minute
similarly if you compute angle covered
by rn in one minute that is 360 divided
by 12 hours into the conversion of an r
into minute that is 60 which will
further result into 1 by 2.
now we know that both the minute hand
and r n will move in same direction that
is in a clockwise direction hence we can
also compute the relative angular
displacement which will be nothing but
the comparison of difference between the
angular displacement of both these hands
of clock per minute
so doing that which is 6 minus 1 by 2
will get 11 by 2 as an answer
this is angular displacement per minute
now if we multiply this value by 60
we'll get an angular displacement per r
which is 330 degrees
also any angle more than 180 degrees is
called as reflex angles and in solving
clock questions we always try to refrain
from reflex angles so we'll convert this
angle into non-reflex angles
to do that all you have to do is
subtract the value from 360. doing that
we'll get 30 degrees as our non-reflex
angle value
moving ahead by using formulas we
derived by angular displacement per hour
and per minute we can formulate the
formula for an angle between hands of a
clock
and that will be mod of 30 h minus 11 by
2 m
h here is our value and m here is
nothing but minute value
let's look into a sample problem to
comprehend the application of this
formula
the problem statement asks us to
evaluate the angle between hands of
clock when the time is 5 dot 30.
the answer to this question is pretty
straight forward all you have to do is
the fill value in equation
the h value is 5 in this case and m
value is 30.
now 30 into 5 will be 1
50 and 11 by 2 into 30 will be 11 by 50.
after further computation will get 15 as
an answer
we'll look at one more type of clock
question
the question given here says that a
clock loses 3 minutes for every hour it
works which is set at right 8 am
what will be the actual time when the
clock shows 12 noon on the third day
let's look at this problem statement
closely
it says that a clock loses 3 minutes
every hour
that means
1 hour is equal to 57 minutes
also this pulse clock started at 8 am
and stopped at 12 noon after 3 days so
the number of hours completed by a false
clock is 24 into 3 that is 3 days plus
extra 4 hours between 8 am to 12 noon
which equals to 76 hours overall
now we want to find out the hours
covered by true clock in order to
predict the accurate time
and we know that our first clock has
covered 76 hours where each are equal to
57 minutes from this we can say that the
true time will be 76 into 60 divided by
57. this equation will give us the right
hours covered by the clock which is 80
hours and since the time covered by the
true clock is 80 hours we'll have to add
an extra 4 hours time to 12 am hence our
answer will be 4 pm
on that note here is a sample question
to check your understanding of clock
concept
all of you guys can solve this question
and drop your answers in the comment box
below
to do that i'll provide you with a short
moment
i hope that all of you guys have solved
this question and dropped your answers
in the comment box below bye now
moving forward we'll discuss the section
of calendar and date-based questions
the questions in this section will test
your understanding of the calendar
concepts
here we'll face questions based on leap
year or days a day on a particular date
etc
let's look at the sample question to
figure out how questions in this section
can be primed
the problem statement given here is
asking us to find out what day there
will be on the date 20th april 2014. now
let me tell you we can figure out an
answer to this question within 30
seconds by using a really interesting
trick
this trick begins by breaking down the
given data into 5 section
for home we'll compute odd days which
will finally lead us towards the day
evaluation and those five sections are
days months century ordinary year and
leap year let's understand how we can
figure out the answer using this data
so we have a date value as 20
then we have month as april
then we have century as 2000
and ordinary year is 40
and leap year
now what is a leap year well you must
know that leap year occurs after cycle
of four years and if we divide the
ordinary year value by 4 then we should
get the leap year value which is 40 by 4
and 10 in this case
now we'll move towards the next step
which is nothing but the odd day
calculation
first we'll figure out odd days for the
date section
in a week we usually have 7 days thus
our days can be considered as the
remainder of number of days by weekdays
which will be the remainder of 20 by 7
in our case
and that is six
for next two factor that is month and
century we have predefined odd day
values
so moving forward we'll discover them
these are the odd day values for month
you'll have to remember these values to
be able to answer these type of
questions using this trick let's also
look into the odd day values for
centuries
these values work the same in forward
direction as well as the backward
direction
what this means is for century 2100 to
2199 you'll again have order value as 4
for 2 2 0 0 to 2 2 9 9 you'll have an
odd day value equal to 2 i hope this is
clear to all of you guys from these
tables we can add the order values for
our month and century section
for month we have
our day value at 6 and for century we
have order value as minus 1.
now the only part left is ordinary year
and leave here
and if you remember in an ordinary year
we have only one odd day and in a leap
year we always have two odd dates so
according to this logic we'll add 40 odd
days for ordinary year and we have
covered leap years inside this ordinary
years as well so we'll add only 10 odd
days for leafy section
again here 40 and 10 are greater than 7
so we'll divide them by 7 in order to
calculate
order order values now remainder of 40
by 7 is 5 and remainder of 10 by 7
is 3
so we'll replace these values
now the next step will be adding this
odd days and if you add these odd values
you'll get
19 as an output and again we'll divide
this 19 by 7 which will be 5 so
the day number should be 5 on that date
and here is the code for each day
and 5 is given to friday so answer to
this question should be friday
i hope this is clear to all of you guys
out there
and that's all we have for this logical
reasoning presentation
