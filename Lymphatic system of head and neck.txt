so hi everyone myself dr saiti team
mgskonker
so the next topic from your anatomy for
your basics paper is a lymphatic system
of hydra neck
so as every every essay question has to
start with content so you have to put on
this contents as given here
so you can start the introduction like
it's a closed system of lymphatic
channels or vessels through which the
lymph flows
so it's actually one way system where
the limb flows from the tissue spaces
to to the blood okay so this is how you
can start the introduction
and then you can go with next is the
development so in the fifth week the
lymphatic vessels and the main clusters
of the lymph nodes are being formed
and they arise from the budding of the
limb sacs from the developing veins
so it's just a mild uh introduction of
the development
okay so again the lymphoid organs then
develop into a mison mesodermal
mesenchymal cells
and the thymus being the first lymphoid
organ to appear
okay and except spleen and tonsils other
lymph node uh
organs are actually poorly developed
before the birth so they're actually
developed after the bath
except the spleen and tonsils so this is
a little introduction of the development
that you can give
next coming to its anatomy and
physiology which is very important so
the lymphatic system
actually consists of all these that is
the limb the lymph vessels the lymphoid
cells the lymphoid tissues lymph nodes
and the lymphoid organs
so we'll discuss with everything in
detail so the lymph is nothing but the
extracellular fluid
connective tissue which is dominated by
the lymphocytes
so as the blood circulates throughout
the body the nutrients the waste and the
gases
are being exchanged between the blood
and the interstitial fluid
so four primary hydro start
hydrostatic and the colloidal osmotic
forces actually determine the fluid
movement through the capillary membrane
those are called as a stalling forces
so those include the capillary pressure
the interstitial
fluid pressure the capillary plasma
colloidal osmotic pressure and the
interstitial fluid cause
osmotic pressure so this is how these
are the stalling forces because of which
the fluid actually
gets exchanged so you think if you can
just put this it's enough so just have a
look
and put this diagram that's more than
enough okay
so next coming to the lymphatic vessel
so the lymphatic vessels are the one way
system
from uh in which the lymph flows towards
the heart
so this transport actually begins in
microscopic blind and lymphatic
capillaries so you can see the
capillaries which are seen here
okay so you can just put these uh
the lymphatic capillaries the green
capillaries which you can see in this
diagram
so you can draw this diagram and you can
enhance your
answer okay next the flow of the lymph
is like wire lymphatic capillaries
towards the vessels towards the
trunk and finally to the ducts okay this
is how the lymph flows
so the lymph transport is actually the
smooth vessel which is in the walls of
the lymphatic trunks and the thoracic
duct
actually contracts rhythmically to help
in pumping the lymph so this is how the
lymph is being transported
so the lymphoid cells are the
lymphocytes which
arise in the red bone marrow and they
mature to form the t cells and b cells
we know that
so activated t cells manage the immune
system so they directly attack the
and destroy the infected cells and b
cells are mainly
responsible for producing the plasma
cells which again are very important to
secrete the antibodies
okay so these are the lymphoid cells so
next coming to the lymphoid tissue
so again you can write it's largely it
is a reticular connective tissue
so the lymphocytes actually reside
temporarily in the lymphoid tissue and
then they leave to patrol the body again
so just
a little every ceased i as i
suggest the headings of every question
is very important so
now the anat part we have been
discussing the lymph the lymphoid cells
the lymphoid tissue
all that so first put headings and write
description for
everything so not entire detailed
description is not required single line
description or two three lines
description is enough because
essay question you can't write more than
six to seven pages right so if you can
put forward few flow charts and diagrams
and
descriptive part it will definitely
increase your bulk of your answer
okay so again the lymph nodes we know
the important lymph nodes which are
there so then they are actually
main two major functions of the lymph
nodes that is the lymph
filters and it also activate the immune
system
okay so next coming to the structure of
the lymph node so string
lymph nodes are again very important so
they're actually being shaped structures
and histologically it has two
characteristic distinct regions which
includes the cortex and the medulla
so it is actually it is a structure
which is encapsulated
and it has a connecting strands which
are called as trabeculae
okay so this is simple lymph node
structure do draw this diagram if a
lymphatic system is asked for the essay
question
this diagram will add or will fetch you
more marks
so draw this diagram it's simple to draw
so do draw it
next coming to the lymphoid organs the
primary and the secondary the primary
lymphoid organs are the
thymus and the bone marrow so
again you can describe the thymus so it
is behind the
sternum and especially well developed a
newborn and the growing child
so the surface of the thymus is divided
into many lobes so this is
the draw diagram of the thymus if you
can draw it's okay or else you can
ignore it's okay so next coming to the
spleen spleen is again a lymphoid organ
so it is one of the largest inflate
organ
okay so here with we have given a basic
idea
of the an anatomy part or the important
aspect related to the lymphatic system
so you have to write in in a same order
okay just
make first after this discussion again
note the important headings and the
individual descriptive part which is
important
that's enough okay so you can write the
lymphatic cells the lymphoid tissues the
lymph nodes the lymphoid organs
again individually you can have the
individual descriptions you can add it
later
okay so next coming to the tonsils these
are again the lymphoid organs so coming
to the oral facial region so coming
important in the oro facial regions are
the tonsils okay
so we know the valdez ring so this
valdez ring diagram has to fall in
so you can diagrams which are important
as i said it's a
cross structure cross section of the
lymph node you have to draw
later you have to draw this valdez ring
if it is
oro facial region so valid ring all
these are the important lymphoid organs
related to the
oral facial ring so you have to draw
this diagram okay
so which include the tubal tonsils and
esophageal tonsils or the eddy noise the
palatine the lingual tonsils and the
lateral pharyngeal bands so these have
to you have to put in this word and you
have to draw this diagon that will be
very fetching so then you have to
classify
okay the hedonic lymph nodes you have to
classify like
which come under the superficial and the
deep okay the outer circle the inner
circle these are the outer circle
and these are the inner circle and the
deep terminal lymph nodes that is the
upper jugular digastric and the inner
comes the
homo hyoid so the outer circle
importantly the submandibular
supplemental buccal parotid moistoid
occipital and the superficial cervical
and the anterior cervical whereas the
inner circle includes the
pre laryngeal pre tracheal para tracheal
and the retropharyngeal so this is
directly taken from your chaurasia
so next this is according to the gray's
anatomy so horizontal
chain uh textbook this is given like
that so you
even you can mention so according to
grace it is given like this even while
writing the answer if you
if you can mention that's again fetching
so horizontal chain
outer circle inner circle and the valdez
ring
okay so the outer circle in the head and
in the neck again you can classify so in
the head it's hospital
retroacticular parotid and buccal and in
the neck it's submandibular submental
and the
cervical lymph node so like this you can
write so inner circle again all these
that is pre-danger pre-tracheal
paratract electrophagy lingual and the
infra hyoid
okay so the vertical chain includes all
these so
you have you have to write accordingly
so this is
if you're right it's really fetching
okay so according to shower rasher it's
uh that classification which was clearly
described in the flow chart
and according to the grace it is like it
is given like this outer circle and the
inner circle
and again horizontal and the vertical
chains are being given so you can write
like that
now in case if it is an essay answer
you can just put a box like this you can
draw a very big box and you can write
the innervations efference and the
difference of that particular lymph node
so do have a look of individual lymph
nodes it's quite simple the name itself
has
the has the reference and reference
hospital is like the hospital region
and difference is to the superior
cervical glands okay it's like that so
posterior clear is again from the
temporal region or the auricular and a
pinna that's the back side of the
external auditory meatus
and again it difference or it goes to
the superior
deep uh cervical gland so the pyrotech
individual glands you can individual
lymph nodes you can write
so so do write do
make a note of this it's very important
so if you write
because that is the main heart of your
answer
okay so again the facial nodes the
submandibular nodes
so how the the location the reference
and the difference if you write like
this it is really fetching so do
write it like this all the other nodes
like the submental
the anterior cervical and the
superficial cervical
so i'm not going to read everything
anyways this is there in these boxes
so just make a note of this so
the rest all is one thing and this is
again another thing so this is the main
scoring part
the diagrams and this box will fetch you
more marks so do
draw this box if you can okay
so next coming to the drainage of the
scalp and the ear
so it's just additive points it's not
required but if you can write for the
scalp and the ear its
its useful so just write these if you
can
next of the face this is actually
important so this diagram again you can
draw so the upper part is to the
preorder lymph nodes the middle part is
submandibular and the lower part is to
sub mental so you can draw this diagram
so as it shows and you can label it
there
so do draw the diagram and do mention
for the lymphatic drainage
of the face so coming to the clinical
approach
so you need to take the detailed history
of if you
if you think the patient is having an
any etiology of related
and large lymph nodes then you have to
take the detailed history later you have
to evaluate
you know every every dentist usually
does this
or inspection and palpation so we have
to evaluate for the location number size
consistency
discrete the number of unmatted nodes
tenderness and even fix it to the
underlying structure so this examination
is important
so how do you examine you everyone knows
that so
but you have to write because the
clinical aspects is very important so
individual nodes you have to write for
pre oracle
post oracle so periodically it's like in
front of the ear you do with your
in uh fingers and then digital aspect of
your fingers and again post oracle
do submit the submandibular glands you
have to bend
the neck towards the side of examination
for supplement you'll have to bend the
neck
forwards and then you have to examine
okay again this diagram clearly shows
the super
superficial cervical the posterior
cervical you have to bend opposite and
you have to
the look for the lymph nodes deep
cervical and the supraclavicular
okay this is how you have to examine
then if the palpation node
characteristics you have to write
so it could be the acute infection its
last soft pain
full mobile discrete rapid onset chronic
infection it is large form less tender
lymphomas it is rubbery inconsistency
metastatic cancer it is tony hard and it
is fixed to the underlying structures
so you have to write these this very
fetching
syphilis it is shorter lymph nodes
tuberculosis tuberculosis you know what
the matter dymph nodes are there
but again it is as three stages the
first stage nodes are enlarged without
matting in the second stage matting is
same
third stage collapses occur and other
applied aspects
so it's again useful so lymph node
examination and lymph nodes
evaluation is very important in
prediction of the disease history for
diagnosis and also
in prediction for the prognosis and the
treatment outcome
okay so for head and neck side so
especially for the oral medicine and
oral pathology students you have to
write the nodal
staging of the node nodal staging end
stage and you have to write
okay so this is very important
so next again you have to write the
disease of the lymphatics that is lymph
lymphangitis neoplasms of the lymphatics
you have to just mention these
and then you have to write the disease
of the specific lymph nodes either it
could be inflammatory neuroplastic or
leukemias or autoimmune disorders
you can write this classification which
is given here
and then you have to clearly mention
about the lymphadenitis
so it could be any infectious or it
could be
added to any other underlying cause so
you can write these
and lymphadenopathy is nothing but the
enlargement of one or more lymph nodes
which is described as greater than one
centimeter in its size
so generalized lymphadenopathy these are
the causes so it could be infectious
like systemic viral infections or
infectious mononucleosis or hiv
or it could be any malignant etiology
like the leukemias or lymphomas
and storage disorders like the niemann
pics disease
and localized lymphadenopathy it could
be the in local infection cervical
infections either bacterial viral
and all that or a non-infectious
etiology could be acute
leukemia lymphomas kawasaki disease and
neuroblastoma
okay so sub maxillary and submental
again the oral and dental infections
and occipital includes rubella and scalp
infections
and pre-oracular includes any skin
infections or scat scratch disease or
any ophthalmic infection
so supraclavicular lymphadenopathy okay
the workhorse nodes
we call it so if it is on left uh left
uh it's
related to malignancy on right it is
inter thoracic lesions
simple so i have just give a
