movies about hacking or hackers boomed
in popularity towards the end of the
20th century from Cut Classics to OG
hacker movies these movies give
audiences an inside look at the
Mysterious World of hacking but
challenging to find Goods in hacker
movies why one reason is that it's
challenging to make an engaging film
about someone using a computer another
reason is that most of the drama around
hacking at the digital world is hidden
from view for a visual storytelling
medium like cinema this causes a unique
problem
very few movies have shown the actual
depiction of hacking correctly till date
therefore simply learn has tried its
level best to bring out the list of
these best movies showing hackers at the
10th position we have Trump 1982.

is still fairly a fantastic today
in the ninth position is The Italian Job
2003.

it makes up a small amount of The
Italian Job it the 21st century one of
the earliest comprehensive
representations of how hacking patches

the computer crimes in short it's an
epic pursuit in cyberspace
in the seventh position is the Matrix
1999 among all the films on the list the
Matrix is arguably the most popular the
story barely briefly departs hacking
despite the fact that it has attracted
widespread public interest worldwide
this movie spends a lot of time focusing
on a complex neurological man in the
middle attack design computer overloads
to extort humans for energy while the
fishing scene in the film is much more
sophisticated than anything that could
be done today or is it it does feature a
very interesting hacking scene
one example of this related to how
people can teleport themselves in and
out of the Matrix using just a phone
following that in the sixth position is
1988. Die Hard is the perfect movie to
depict cyber warfare the main character
of this action-packed movie is engaged

cyber terrorists in the world

public computer systems and initiate a
massive financial asset sale he teams up
with a skilled ex NSA hacker to find the
security specialist in charge of the
scheme it showcases how cyber warfare is
different to Conventional Warfare how do
you train and prepare for cyber attacks
or is this really something we need to
worry about and what does the future
hold
that's what the movie Hope to explain
more about in the fifth position is
Hackers 1995. hackers on a 1995 movie
that wasn't immediately popular
gradually clean classic cult status
The Blood Centers on a bunch of high
school hackers who successfully
negotiate an unintendent corporate
extortion plot the portrayal of hackers
as youthful Geeks pushing the boundaries
of this Cutting Edge technology
officially captures the popular attitude
towards computer and the hacker
community in the 1990s
the film also makes numerous notable
notes to hacker philosophies of the type
including those outlining the hacker
Manifesto which was published in late
1980s
now comes the fourth position where we
have citizen 4 2014.
there's the iconic tale of Edward
Snowden and his initial Revolution to
the media of a controversial NSC spying
operation
the movie gives a thorough Narrative of
how Snowden was first only known online
as citizen 4 got in touch with
journalists to reveal the bombshell
revelation of massive American
government surveillance
before the disclosure he witnessed
firsthand the alarming amount of data
collecting taking place by the U.S
government
through this disturbing revelation of
government overreach Snowden becomes a
whistleblower and learns the masses
although the film offers a broad
perspective rather than detailed hacking
scenes and discuss Mass monitoring one
of the most significant issues that are
extremely pertinent to the field of
hacking and cyber security
now comes the top three movies of the
list in which a third position is the
fifth state 2013. this partially
fictitious movie tells the tale of
Julian Assange and Daniel domit were as
they were together to create Wikileaks
one of the world's most effective
Digital Watchdog organizations
Wikileaks spent a lot of time publishing
information taken from unidentified
sources through successful hacking
attempts or by unreliable users with
excessive access eager to share
information with the public
this still focuses a lot on what happens
after the hacking occurs but it also
does a decent job of conveying what it's
like for those who work closely with
hackers daily
in the second position is war game 1983
war game is the oldest movie on the list
as well War Games a movie that was
released at the height of the Cold War

film gives the ideal blend of heightened
specifics while carefully balancing this
with an engaging overarching story
and now comes the movie that backs the
first position in the list which is 23
2007 23 emphasizes a really important
tenet of cyber security and the need to
build a culture of security in your

starts doing further investigation and
discovers a global conspiracy in an
effort to gain access to more
information the hacker enlist the aid of
a student Carl develops hallucinations
after using drugs and breaking into
Chernobyl
till correctly identifies common
security issues with passwords that are
still applicable nowadays using common
words like rock you or easily
identifiable information like a Pet's or
wise name is a mistake which leads to
data breaches and with that we have come
to the end of the list of the top 10
