did you know Microsoft is planning to
invest $10 million in Chad gbt developer
even silicon Valley's biggest
conglomerates have begun to take note of
chat GPT versatility and practicality
people have started earning money
through chat GP and some even predict
the Revolutionary AI chatboard will
replace Google search but what makes
chat gbt so resourceful what chat gbt is
and how it works and at the end we will
discuss some of the ways that chat GPT
is being used in the real world the
potential implications of this
technology from chat boards to language
translation chat gbt has many
application that make it easier for
businesses and individuals to interact
with technology hello everyone I am M
and welcome to Simply learn make sure
you are subscribed to our Channel and
hit that Bell icon to stay updated with
the latest technological Trends before
we move on to the demo part let's
discuss what chat gbt is and proceed
further for the same so what is chat gbt
chat gbt is a conversational language
model created by open AI it is a form of
generative pre-train transform gbt model
which was trained on a data set of
conversational prompts such as diog
Snippets and chat logs the model is
capable of generating humanik responses
to text input so now let's understand
how chat GPT actually works this model
is pre-trained on a large tax data set
and then F tune on a smaller data set is
specific to the everyday task when the
model receives input from a user it uses
the pattern it learn during fine tuning
to generate a response let's take
another example the model can generate
an appropriate response even if the
input is not a complete question or a
sentence after seeing what is chat gbt
and how it works now moving forward
let's see how we can use chat GPT in our
day-to-day
life so this is a Google search here we
will write
chat.
open.com
chat will take
time this is the chat window UI of the
chat gbt so our first use case is chat
gbt can explain complex subjects okay so
first we will ask like what is
Neuroscience it will take
time it's taking time to load because
many of the users are
using it started Neuroscience is the
scientific study of the nervous system
which includes the brain it will write
all about the Neuroscience you can ask
anything any subject okay like hard to
hard easy any or even you can stop
generating too if you want
to okay so this is how you can ask like
any question to the any complex question
to chat GB okay uh we'll ask one more
like what is
quantum it's loading I don't know why
it's taking time because of net issue or
I don't know why take time and it will
come quantum computer is a field of
computer science that uses properties of
quantum mechanics to perform operations
on data like this
okay who St zero or one and all the
Quant Computing
knowledge okay so this is how you can
ask any thing like any about any complex
subject to the chat GPT okay so with
chat our Second Use case is we can write
code using Chad GPT okay we can write so
here I will give give me a
machine
learning
program for
prediction okay press
enter okay so here let started there is
a simple Python program that uses CED
learn Library this this this and
this this is how you can take write a
code any code if you ask anything like
sorting like add two
numbers or
palindrome anything you can anything you
can ask from charj
it will give you a code proper
code I right please note that this is a
simple example of short prediction is a
complex task and this example is not
enough to make a good prediction it
would need a lot more data feature
engineering and model tuning to make
accurate prediction okay
so let me give another Java
implementation
implementation of the what
bubble
algorithm okay let me ask
this yeah it started like here is a Java
implementation of the bubble sort
algorithm so give you proper runable
algorithm okay like bubble
s give you
full you can ask any type of code any
type of like apis
anything it will explain to this
implementation using nested Loop to
compare adjacent elements in the area
and swp them if they are in the wrong
order
okay and then after the outer loop
completes the array will be sorted in
ascending order our third use case is we
can debug the code okay so for that what
I will I will take this one
code okay I will take this code and here
I will write debug the code and I will
paste it here and what I will do I will
instead of
temp here I will write I will
write okay I will write 2p okay so now
what it will do JB will do it will de
work see the error in the code is in the
this line okay a r j TMP it should be
temp you can see here it is St so from J
you can debug the
error okay you can have the conversation
with pull the chat gity like if you have
any question you can directly write
what's wrong in the above question and
like this okay like you have an extra p
in this variable name which is causing a
compile error this is because temp is
the variable that you declared earlier
to store the value of current element
whereas temp is not a variable that has
been declared here you can see the stamp
is declared
here so that is why the error is causing
the code not to run once you fix the
issue okay like sort the arrange sending
order using the bub okay so using chat
GPD you can easily debug your errors the
code and it is very helpful on your
project building okay so fourth use case
is you can create custom marketing plans
or strategy okay I'm repeating again you
can create custom marketing plans or
strategy like how so here I will write
how
should
promote
videos on social
media okay
present it will give you proper plan how
how you can promote your YouTube videos
on your social media
okay I will chat with this okay I will
ask some
question to INE views engagement
everyone know there are few strategies
you can use see first second and more
like more to come like share your video
on personal social media accounts this
include your Facebook Twitter Instagram
and other accounts thing like that join
relevant communities and groups through
use social media ads platform like
Facebook Ina Instagram and Twitter
collaborate with influencer it is also
true create a hashtag for your videos
use YouTube video buildin sharing
features it will give you all the
marketing plans it can create marketing
plans any type of
plans see remember your video should be
engaging informating and should be
provide value to our audience it is
something like that now I will ask one
question to chat GB okay so I will ask
what
if
make
only s
videos
okay what if I will make only okay s
videos how should
I
capture the
AIO you can ask any type of question
okay relevant to this question or this
answer you
got okay now let's
see it will give you everything if you
are making travel videos there are like
few strategies you can use to capture
and engage your audience like this okay
so the unique interesting aspect of the
destination you visit people are often
drawn to new and unique experience like
they share your personal experience and
insights it will give you a proper plan
like how you can increase your audience
engage your audience
okay collaborate with other travel
bloggers it's true engage with Audience
by responding to comments messages
true remember your video should be
visually appealing and provide valuable
information to your audience it is also
important to be authentic and true to
yourself like this okay so this is how
you can like using chat gity how you can
create your marketing plans or your
something like that okay our fifth use
case is we can generate articles and
blogs using chat gbd okay so that me ask
write an
article
machine
learning sh is also machine learning
kind of machine learning on machine
learning
in 500
Words
prenter it will write only exactly like
500 Words it will give you only 500
words like machine learning is rapidly
growing field that is transforming the
way we live and work it is the branch of
artificial intelligence blah
blah basic idea of machine learning is
that computers can learn from data
without being explicitly programmed like
supervise learning is the most common
type of the machine learning yes
true you can see here there are three
main types of machine learning supervis
learning and supervis and import it's
true
it will tell about it will write a
proper article in only 500 word not more
than
that
okay machine learning has a potential
application Vari Healthcare machine
learning patient data and more accurate
diagnosis like that
I wrote 500
Words it will give you exactly 500
Words your conclusion in conclusion
machine learning is rapidly growing
field that has the PO to Rize many
Industries it allows computers to learn
from the data without being EXP
this is 500 Words of article okay you
can ask write article vide descriptions
blogs any kind of content writing you
can
see okay so let's do one more question
in the same so I will write give me a
FY
on to write
okay SK for my
YouTube
channel YouTube channel YouTube
shorts
videos video on cyber
security
okay here is a short script for funny
YouTube video on cyber
security like narrator
welcome to the world cyber where every
click could be your last
exactly so something like
that one always use strong password like
password 1 2 3 or
4 the tip number two never click on
suspicious link unless it's linked to be
to free
pizza see this is how you can create
your funny how you can generate your
content
from chat GPT using chat GPT okay thanks
for watching stay safe out there please
note that this script is just for fun
exactly we know and not mean to be taken
seriously it's important to take cyber
security seriously and follow best
practices to protect your personal and
professional data okay so this is how
you can write your make your content so
easily like by writing the title of the
content oh our six
use cases you can even Summarize the
book or article using CH like how I will
write here
Summarize the
book beli
travel Noel written by Jonathan Swift in
this say the book tells the story of LL
g a ship surgeon who become Shipwrecked
it will WR only it will summarize all
about G travel yeah in part one this
happened G washes up on the island of
Lort yeah
exactly this happen and part three this
happen
this is how you can summarize any book
any related to like educational novel
fiction any type of book or article and
blogs okay whatever you want to
sumarize page will run the book is being
commentary on the Society of sft one
time
okay so this is how you can Summarize
the book
beliel our seventh use cases we can ask
interview question to using chit so here
I can ask how to
answer what
is
your
weakness
okay so when answering the question it
is the best to be honest but also to
frame your answer in a positive way yeah
exactly for example you could say
something like I have a tendency to be
perfectionate and sometimes struggle
with delegating task however I've been
working on this learning like this you
can ask any question any interview type
question okay related to HR or technical
anything you can
ask so let's
see
how
to
answer
the
viewer uh like where do you see
yourself in next five
years when answering this question it's
good idea to be align your answer with
the company's goals and values yeah
exactly for example you could say
something like in 5 years I can see
myself going within the company and
taking more responsibility exactly so
this is how
you can ask any type of HR questions you
are facing off
okay so our next use case is our eighth
use case is we can develop apps using
chat
gbt okay yes we can develop apps using
chat gbt like I
want to
write an Android
app
that shows
me is
stock
prices as
a
list
from uh let's see
Yahoo
API
okay or how can I
to like this so it will write a proper
Android app code for
you a new Android project or it will
give you a proper idea how you can make
a you know
app on this
steps from starting to the
last use a view holder to hold the
reference of the views for each item in
the list okay use asynchronous task to
fet all the step from starting to the
end this is a brief overview of the
steps and you will need to take a build
Android
okay okay so this is how you can like
ask anything to
create app okay using any language
flirter Java python any language okay I
repeat our ninth use case is we can
create our exercise plan diet plan using
jgb okay so I will write my weight is 25
okay let's take
25
kg and I want to

marketing strategy anything you want Tim
table of focusing something anything you
can
make and according to you yourself you
can rearrange them okay it will be very
easy and it is very time
saving okay it will create seven days
plan day six excise 60 Minutes St
running session like this
right this you want to
lose healthy weap avocado toast with
post
deck it's important to note that this is
just a plan Simple
Plan so our 10th use use cases last use
case you can ask any genine Knowledge
Questions to Chad like okay who
invented
first invited by German Goldsmith
yeah you can cross question to chat
answer
okay this is the all the use case of
chat like it can debug the code audit
the code like explain complex subject
create custom marketing plan or strategy
diet plan exercise plan you can generate
your content like article blogs you can
Summarize the book and the Articles or
interview question preparation or
developing apps coding
you can easily do with the chat GPT okay
