it
because all the states are done with the
examinations
except telangana and few colleges in
delhi state delhi few colleges and
telangana state where results were not
out so rest of all the states were done
with their examinations their internship
has been started this will have
a measuring
a major
impact on your preparation in the future
not now
in the last few days like last three to
four months of preparation are very very
important
so what happens in this last three three
to four months is you will be stuffed
with your
postings and everything and seniors will
be seriously reading
other state people will be reading
because their internship will be
completed seniors will be reading and
you will be stuffed with all this
college work and the internship still so
that's going to hurt you in the last
two to three months of the preparation
so there are few necessary
modifications that you have to do in
your preparation so that you can give a
regular competition like a regular
intern every year okay so that is the
main

we'll try to learn as many things as
many unknown things as possible okay as
many unknown things as possible right
so how many of you are so worried uh
about what after videos okay so what
after bds
how many of you are worried you have
your pandemic that is being added from
your third year third year is a pandemic
fourth year half of the fourth year is a
pandemic
late for your um
i mean the university examinations the
results were late okay so you're going
to start your internship late how many
of you are really having this sort of
question mark or
or panic situation how many of you are
feeling this as a panic situation
telangana students how many i'm very
seriously i'm seriously bothered about
you because we used to have an
extraordinary result from telangana
every year grabbing n number of seats
throughout the country
particularly the interns of telangana
have done extraordinarily well in the
last seven years for mds conquer
including your seniors who are going to
give the examinations in in a couple of
i mean like in one one and a half month
so as an intern uh
how many of you are really feeling bad
for this pandemic to occur during your
third year and final year and creating a
good impact on your internship in fine
layer i just need your response guys on
the chat box
do you really feel bad for it or you are
okay for it
do you really feel bad for it
or you're fine or you're okay okay with
what has occurred in the pandemic
because there was
no proper exposure to the cases classes
were not conducted well okay so
internship i mean like the final year
postings were not done well okay right
so
many of the students has a major impact
on on this definitely okay but what what
i can strongly say is yes yes past is
very very important okay but past cannot
be changed
cannot be changed
what you can change you can change
only the present this can be changed so
whatever you're focusing on whatever
you're going to learn now whatever
present you have so please focus on the
present
so that the future can be changed
okay so most of the students were so
worried about the past okay but logic is
past cannot be changed okay so i want
everyone to focus on the present so once
you are focused on the present there are
high chances there are high chances that
your future can be changed
so
i want to start with this particular
saying okay a goal without a plan is
just a wish
everyone every one of us in the life we
have so many wishes i want to become
like this i want to become like that i
want to do this i want to become like
this so you see your teachers and most
of us we take our teachers as an
inspiration so this is what like even i
was when i was there
at a user level i used to take i'm very
passionate towards two or
three teachers their lifestyle the mode
of handling the patients the mode of
teaching and everything i'm so
passionate and i always take them as my
inspiration and i used to wish that
someday i should become like this
but wish
which is very very important but which
should be associated with the plan
should be associated with the plan then
you can convert that wish into reality
so with this saying i want to start the
today's session a goal without a plan is
just a wish like most of us
uh we travel right we travel
we go out and for that we plan we plan
like how much the budget is going to be
what places we are going to cover how we
have to go to that particular place and
planning is very very important and i
strongly believe most of the
bds aspirants at a uc level they fail
because they don't have proper planning
to reach their wish or to make their
goal possible
hope i am audible to you guys i need
your response i don't want this to
this to be a one-way one-way mode of
communication i want a two-way mode of
communication i want your response on
the chat box am i audible am i audible
to you guys
i'm audible to you
so we are almost hitting 60
yes it's good yes perfect
okay right
so uh like i i just i just uh rely
everything uh basing upon myself as an
example okay as an undergraduate student
so
i was just in my hometown village in my
hometown and i got a call from my
batchmate telling that shrikhand the
result was out the finally a result was
out so finally a result uh is a mixed
feeling okay it's a feeling of happiness
it's a feeling of the most happiest
result throughout
your bds
apart from your neet examination result
throughout your bds or throughout your
first second third fourth year is your
final year examination result okay
telangana students had to come okay the
happiest moment so i got a call from my
batchmate telling us three the result
was out
i said like okay is it okay that i have
passed how many all of the batchman
because the first goal of any final year
student is not for a distinction or
something xyz whether we have passed it
or not so i asked my batchmate okay
everyone cleared it
you and i finished off i said like she
said yes
so once we are cleared then our next
goal is getting a first class right this
is a very common genuine thing i hope
most of them having the same buzz in
your brain okay so next i asked my
batchmate uh is it first class you and
me are first class or not yes first
class and now tell me what are the
percentages oh she told okay you got
distinction okay i felt very very happy
finally here i got distinction and that
night i mean the result was out
somewhere at a 7 30 or 8 o'clock in the
night and
that complete night i did not sleep yet
i did not sleep i was not in a position
to sleep
okay my adrenal
rush in my body was very high and i was
very very happy excited and throughout
my night so this is what the image that
is going in my mind i want a good life
i want to make money because i came from
a middle class family so i need to take
care of my parents i want a good life i
want a better profession better
professional life and dentistry making
treating more patients
making more money having a good life
all these cars something excited because
i'm in a like uh we we were not exposed
like you to the social media uh probably
during 2012 2012 is my
internship it's almost like hitting 10
years now so this is what my my mind
okay so the next question is the next
day okay the started the next today
whether i have to stay in
you here or i have to live in india
because profession of making money
you have two options option one domestic
option two international
and the only way where you can judge
whether you have to go for it
for for an international or a domestic
the main first criteria is money
money
okay only in india if you want to do mds
you can do free of cost you have
government dental college seat 600
government dental college seats are
there
gdcs
600 mds seats are free of cost
because you are born here you are an
indian they are going to give it free
but if you are planning to move
international nothing is free okay you
need to spend money lots of money before
you start earning so the first criteria
that is required to go to usa to go to
canada to go to any other place
to extend your dental profession is
first you need to have money without
money you cannot do anything so that's
the first criteria so i started
searching the options and uh digging the
options then i got to know when you want
to go for international level okay so
you think you basically require lots of
money okay so you decide whether your
family is financially very sound to
handle you for your the next projects
internationally if not you need to do
the projects nationally then you need to
make money then you need to you can
shift international there are many of my
teachers who has done this
okay so
they they make money then they have
planned the international process in the
future so first of all money is required
so
you talk with your parents whether like
when you have both the options in your
mind you talk with the parents what are
the possibilities what are the things
so when you are talking with the parents
okay so there are three major factors
that has to be taken into consideration
okay once once you are talking with your
parents
about the international so this is
particularly about the
international plans if you have any
international plans there are three
factors but you can see only two factors
are what is the third factor the third
factor is one who is balancing it
the first factor is time
means
how much time you are going to take
in other country in other country how
much time you are going to take in other
country to settle down or in a simple
words how much time you are going to
take in other country to make money
means directly if you get into flight
and if you get down there
the country is not going to give you
money okay you have to start working so
how much time you are going to take to
start working to earn money so first
important factor is time time is the
biggest thing in the life
second important factor is money how
much money you are going to spend
before you earn money
how much money you are going to spend
before you earn money so sorry you told
the third factor what is the third
factor the person who is balancing this
who is the person balancing this can
anyone tell me who is who is the person
balancing this
this entire picture is yours who is this
balancing this your time and money are
balanced by
which which which most important person
in your life is
anyone
65 we are hitting good it sounds good
now i want your response guys who is the
one balancing this
now enter this entire picture is you
okay
right anyone
give a try
who is who is going to balance all the
things till the date in your life
okay so third important factor is
your
parents
wish for example your your father has a
different plan on you you go and tell
that i want to go for usa i want to do
this do that may he may have a different
plan
so
who has to give you time
your father has to give you time for
example it is more specific for girls
if he has a plan of making you to get
married there is no time
he may have a different plan so who has
to give you time in indian indian i mean
like the indian customs is your parents
has to give the time who has to give the
money it's not bank manager okay it's
not bank manager who is going to pay you
the money it's your father it's your
mother who are going to pay you the
money so
the two factors time and money are given
by your parents okay so the third
important factor is the parent so so you
should have money
you should have money you should have
time and you should have your parents
wish
for your international plan okay so this
is very important for all the people who
are planning internationally because i
have seen so many of my students
including myself
who has wasted so much of time because
of improper planning okay because if you
see my example i have started my
preparation then i jumped into u.s plan
then i jumped into this that and finally
i have wasted one one and a half year of
my valuable time so first of all try to
be clear if you have any any plans of
international so first of all you try to
be clear with these three major factors
then you try you you need to dig out and
learn what what is the country which
makes
your life or your professional life
better
okay so then accordingly you can plan
so that's what i'm telling
pros and cons so you have many options
you have canada as an option
you have usc as an option
okay you have mds as an option
you can open a clinic with bds stack so
there are many options but do make a
note about the positives about the
negatives of every option
before you pick the option so before you
pick the option make sure you try to
discuss the pros and the cons of each
and every option
and plan accordingly for this you need
to talk with a person who has good
knowledge
and good orientation towards the each
and every option
and should know the present trends also
for example you know some person who has
done dds 10 years back
and if you're talking with he he's not a
right person to guide you for dds you
need to pick a person who has a
knowledge over this
considering the latest trends because
kovite 19 has lots of impact on many of
these provisions so what are the present
trends that are going after kovid 19 or
the present things that are going right
now so everything has to be clear-cut
you should be very very clear-cut you
should not take i mean like for example
you're preparing for mds entrance you
don't go sit and talk with your hbod who
has given the entrance probably 20 25 or
28 years back because 28 years back the
trend was totally different because
trend changes every two to three years
so you should talk with an individual
who is
who is having a very great knowledge
over this particular thing or who has
cleared the recent one for example you
can talk with a with your senior who has
cleared the recent examination with a
decent rank good rank ranker holders you
can talk with or your senior recently
super senior or three year senior
recently cracked dear cracked your nbd
followed by getting admission in dds you
talk with them so they are the good
source of information to knows the pros
and cons of every step what you are
planning to take
right so next one okay so next one
clearing all the options like for
example is there anything which you
require specifically guys
you want me to discuss any international
option very specifically you can drop me
on the chart box so that i am ready open
to discuss discuss with that if it is
useful to you i i'll give you one 30
seconds time if you have anything any
international option if you are planning
for that okay you can drop me on the
chart box so that i will discuss or else
i'll directly jump into the mds mds part
i'll directly jump into the mds options
or indian options
right anyone
anyone any one of you want me to discuss
about the abroad options in detail
no no one
okay right challah so i'll be jumping
directly into the
directly into the mds part okay so
most of us have this confusion okay so
is mds only the leftover option or is
mds best among the rest of the options
available for me because most of us we
plan to go dig out the mds park and come
out so what i can tell you is
how many have you traveled this
how many have you
right we are hitting almost 70 figure
yes good so how many of you traveled on
flight yes durga bhavani and on ship
how many have you traveled on flight or
ship any of any of the one i want your
response guys come on let's have a
two-way communication this is about the
main problem with the dentistry so we
need to interact with the patients for
that your talkative skills should be so
great
come on
i want okay right
right everyone like most of us have
traveled on flight
so how many of you have used it have you
seen this you'll have this on the flight
right live jackets how many have you
used this
seriously really okay
so
problem is everyone none of us none of
us because we have never faced the
situation to use this so what is
strongly what i can say about mds is
mds
mds
mds is something like a life jacket
which is going to protect you
when the things are turning worst when
the things are turning bad
okay so live jacket is going to save
your lives so mds is something like a
live jacket which no one
knows how important it is but that is
going to give you that confidence levels
to protect you
okay to protect you like i can ask you
one question i can ask you only one
question all of you all of your interns
and everything
okay so if your mother has a root canal
therapy
that has to be done
will you give this root canal therapy
case
to to an undergraduate
who is of you who is your best friend
or to an undergraduate who is a
distinction holder
or to a post graduate
or to a postgraduate with lots of
experience so these are the four doctors
available for you
so root canal therapy has to be done for
your mother which option you want to go
with among these four
bds
your best friend bds with distinction
candidate mds mds with lots of years of
experience okay definitely it's you or
me or anyone
we will always try to go with a person
who has done masters in that who has
having lots of experience
this is not only restricted to a root
canal therapy or not only restricted to
an endodontic procedure or a dental
procedure this is common for everything
like for example most of you is you
already said like you are from telangana
you may be from hyderabad most of us
what we do if we get any problem will we
go for an rmp doctor or for an mbbs
doctor or a doctor who is having lots of
experience in a particular field for
example you have an endocrine or
endocrine problem
okay nowadays if you have an endocrine
problem most of us my 90 percenters in
metropolitan cities are going for an
endocrinologist we are not even going
for a general physician also
leave about rnp mbbs people
the thing is
people want a quality of health care
system
people want a quality of dental care
system so to have a quality of dental
care system masters and the knowledge
which you gain through your experience
is mandatory i'll give you i'll give you
a wonderful example okay we will
i want your response okay right
okay now i'll talk about cons
so at a ug level what you do in cons
department
cons and okay i'll take cons and
at a uc level you are using students
what you do in constant in your
department
you you have a posting of uh one one and
a half month you have finally read plus
internship you'll have one and a half
months two months posting so what you do
in this two months of posting of cons
and indoor department
i'm asking you you what you have done
just class one class two anterior cities
cavity preparations
any anything more guys class one class 2
rcts restorations okay a few of you are
telling anterior cities amalgam nikhil
is telling amalgam still we are doing
amalgam
anything anything more than this
amalgam
anterior rcts
composite restorations
gic fillings
anything apart from this guys
anything you have done apart from this
we have only three days or so
so only class one cavities
cannot do anything it's feeling so bad
for this pandemic creating a bad impact
on
okay right
i'm very um very happy okay so what a pg
will do any idea what a pg will do so
you have only
internship plus
you're finally posting total 60 days
only in cons department
you know what pg will do pg constant end
of three years
three years means you will have thousand
working days
where is 60 year where is thousand year
there is 60 working days various
thousand working days know what pgs will
do
pgs will do root canal therapies one
both anterior posterior difficult cases
third molar root can also will be done
by pgs they do all sorts of registration
better than you in all aspects they do
endless they do only
okay they do smile designing
few colleges not all colleges
they do periapical surgeries
they do apoxifications epixones all
these procedures and do you know what
outside i'm talking about metropolitan
cities i'm not talking about uh i mean
dentistry is a very expensive how many
of you agree dentistry is a very
expensive thing dentist is very
expensive thing because you cannot keep
you cannot keep a branded gic
for 100 rupees because branded gic the
bottle costs only three to four three to
five thousand
branded gic 3m gic bottle it's cost
three to five thousand rupees okay so
dentistry is very expensive thing
you cannot keep a gic registration or
you cannot keep an implant just as a
service oriented service oriented you
can do an extraction by decreasing the
pain for the patient but you cannot keep
an implant as a service thing so service
things are not possible in dentistry
don't feel bad for this but this is a
reality
service oriented thing like sir i want a
beautiful smile that doesn't comes under
service sir i am feeling i'm having
favor so please write some medicine okay
i'll give some medicine medication free
of course that is service that is fine
sir i'm getting married i want a
beautiful smile i'm getting married i
want a good facial to my face good
haircut to my face that is not done free
at any level even at various level
videos also will have saloons villas
also will have beauty parlors are they
doing it as a
as a free service or a paid service so
dentistry is something
where the only part of dentistry which
comes as a free service oriented is
extraction to decrease the pain
to decrease the pain pain is a very
severe thing you decrease the pain your
god there so only extraction by which
you are going to decrease the pain that
is going that can be done free of cost
but nothing gronium crumbs can you give
free of cost for gyronium crown
can you keep free cost for implant so
not possible dentistry is expensive
thing
negligence in dentistry is an expensive
thing and can you tell me what we
regularly do outside in a clinic in a
metropolitan city
concerned to constant indoor department
we do more root canal therapies agreed i
i do more root canal therapies okay
right we do more root canal therapies
done
we do smile designing nowadays smile
designing is very very
uh
i mean smile correction is very very you
can you see so many stars
recently i i have clearly seen so many
stars recently have done smile designing
okay so you you see smile designing you
do root canal therapies you do crown
cuttings
you do periapical surgeries
re-rct cases means already rc is done
i'm not bothered about whether it is
done by ug or pg failed rc cases because
today we got two failed rc cases of our
students last year students their
husband recently they got married two
failed root canal therapists were there
okay right so we are the cases so
just just an imagination for example i
am talking about the costs of hyderabad
mumbai or somewhere
what is the cost of a root canal therapy
in your college
what is the cost of root canal therapy
in your corners
i'm just going to tell you what what is
happening outside the globe
how much how much you charge for a root
canal terrifying the college
so uc is 60 days posting
pg is thousand days posting
outside is lifelong posting
come on tell me here how much you charge
for the root canal if you don't know how
much you build for the root canal
therapy you said like most of you have
done anterior root canals
how much you charge in a college
so the charge in the call is yes it will
be around
500 2 000
bucks okay can you tell me what is the
charge outside in hyderabad
mumbai hyderabad delhi bhupal
all metropolitan cities capital cities
roughly
how much you're expecting
for you to get paid for a good root
canal therapy done under magnification
with rubber dam and everything
1500 3500
i am talking about metropolitan cities
so in metropolitan cities okay so we
charge
somewhere around 5000 minimum
to a maximum of ten thousand for example
re-rc cases
re-rc cases already failed cases they
charge twelve to fifteen thousand
re-rc cases twelve to fifteen thousand
smile designing how much how much you're
expecting smile designing outside
smile designing how much you're thinking
of smile designing is going to cost
one to two lakhs so it is just payment
for the skill skillful work one to two
lakhs they charge for smile designing
periapical surgery
30 to 40 000 for anterior peripheral
surgery they charge okay
so i'm going to give one more liable
example okay again 60 days posting
period department
so what you do at a usa level in a
period department 60 days posting 30
days
in the final year 30 days an internship
so what you do regularly is 30 days you
do hand scaling
30 days you do ultra ultrasonic
do you think hand scaling is done
outside in the clinic
we do hand scaling outside in the clinic
trust me guys if you do hand scaling
in a clinic outside the patient will
never see the clinic the patient will
completely
leave that particular place and will run
away
okay right so whatever you do hand
scaling and whatever you do at a ug
level
is not what we practice outside the
practice outside is totally different
and the pc thousand days of your pc
curriculum is going to lay a bridge
because the most money making aspect for
a periodontist is a good flap surgery
lazar associated flap surgery or a
normal surgical flap surgery or a deeps
cleaning none of these deep scale
scaling or root planing or
flap surgeries surgical flap surgeries
or laser associated flap surgeries none
of these are practiced at a us level so
most of you will learn this
in the thousand days of your pg life
so same goes within departments every
department oral surgery what we do we do
extractions but logically outside
outside
in a clinic
extraction cases will be very very less
in a very creamy zone none of them will
leave till the date of extraction okay
only impactions will be done extractions
will be very very less the only
extractions that we do mostly are ortho
ortho related extractions but decay and
all these extractions are very very less
so whatever you do in uc life will not
be practiced outside okay so there is a
bridge where you have to learn all the
advanced things okay which we regularly
practice then that is the reason why pg
is very required and that is the reason
why because i got a call from the
student her name is kiranami
found sir we got hyderabad my husband is
having root canal therapy that was
failed and the past is coming it has to
be done i want someone who is good
having microscope to handle this why the
people are finding a very genuine and a
correct individual is because she's
already failed
she's a dentist
the case was already failed now they
want a good one to handle the situation
so now he he he she clearly told sir are
you going to do the case no no i cannot
do the case because i have so many
classes i cannot do the case then who is
going to do okay i told particular
individual
are there i mean
she is a endodontist she is a specialist
how many years experience she is having
what she was going to do she has
collected all the information then she
started then we have started the
procedure so
we are very keen about the outcome so to
have a good outcome we need to have a
good experience and pg is going to give
a thousand
thousand days of clinical experience for
you
which is really required to lay a proper
path for future in the dentistry so most
of us what we feel
uh ortho what you do here
ortho what you do at a ug level
come on let's have a two-way
communication 70 people
bhavani
hindu
why are banding
we will i mean if the patient is going
to come to your clinic you do straight
wire wire bending you do straight wire
bending you take a proper case history
and send the patient
now what is going in ortho regularly uh
now in a clinic for example a clinic is
there in hyderabad what cases you will
get in
hyderabad clinic
you may have your friends having this
malala nt they'll ask you they'll call
you what to be done
what to be done sir what i have to do
now ortho now is moving around liners
aligners are nothing but invisible
invisible aligners okay
you see aligners you i mean now the
trend is completely if do you see
invisalign
you know invisalign right right so
nowadays most of them are keeping
invisaligns you know what is the cost of
in invisalign or what is the cost of a
normal ana how much how much how much we
charge any idea about invisalign cost of
invisalign
60 000
the cheapest invisalign will also not
come 60
invisalign costs invisalign costs 1.5 to
2 lakhs
1.52 lakhs most branded one it is 1.5 to
2 lakhs
what we learn at a usa level is a
straight web is right very useful for
the patient no
so that's what the bridge of thousand
days of pg life in author department
will give you a gateway
will give you a gateway
for your future i mean college charges
we don't charge an outset if we charge
college charges we have to close the
clinics okay so center of the city is
different periphery of the city is
different college is different that's
what i'm telling you
we charge 500 rupees for an rc in a
college but we cannot charge 500 rupees
for an rc in a clinic your own clinic
you don't charge 500. you charge 5000
and it's almost like ten times you
charge more right so fifty thousand uh
in a college for an author treatment is
i feel like it's very expensive
okay right so
so everything uh we have a certain thing
now that's what i'm telling you why i'm
giving an ortho as the best example is
the future of dentistry is moving
towards the lnrs okay so lns are going
to be the future of an orthodontist so
how many of these uses practice learners
none of us how many of the pgs will
practice this so few of the pgs pg
colleges they're practicing their lnr's
or their past practicing the
mini implants and all these things which
are required
in outside to become a good good
orthodontist so that's what i'm
requiring i'm telling you pg is must if
you want to get settled down in
dentistry
with good hope and good scope okay it's
mandatory that you have to do pg without
any break don't take breaks
kovit already has given you a huge
breaks irritating irritating breaks
again you intentionally don't spoil and
take an extra one year or one and a half
year break breaking your heads so that's
my valid suggestion for all of you so so
let's get into the next part
so what i strongly believe in any
individual particularly when we are like
moving more about the dentistry is you
have to be very very unique in your
approach towards the crowd so you have a
crowd and you need to make the crowd
happy by giving beautiful services to
the crowd
from the field of dentistry so for that
your way of thinking should be totally
different you cannot develop this unique
way of thinking uh sir i'll finish ug is
done i'll finish
my internship sir ramsey then i'll jump
into my pg so after finishing pg i'll
think about this uniqueness uniqueness
cannot be developed over a day
today no uniqueness tomorrow i'll
try to develop uniqueness no not
possible so uniqueness should be a
process a growth process so you have to
start working on being unique thinking
unique approaching the crowd unit so
that
you'll move out of the competition so
this is a competition zone so you see
all these black fellas
there they're just following blindly
like a like a sheep like a goat they're
following but there is one person who is
going to turn unique
okay it's going to turn unique so you
always try to focus on how you become
better individual
to approach the crowd like what market
requires what the crowd around you
requires you try to become such
individual and this process has to be
started not after finishing your third
year mds it has to be started from the
internship internship is a bridge
where you should start thinking about
your future or the scope and dentistry
okay guys
okay next jumping into how can we do mds
so in india
to do mds you have
two options okay one is
neet examination
neet mds exam the second one is ini set
okay coming to neet mds exam
neet mds exam is going to carry almost
97 to 98 percentage of
seats in the country
and any set is going to carry that
two to three percentage of seats
so init set occurs two times a year
neet occurs
one time in year
guys are you clear with this very
important because you are planning for a
trip
the plan is very very important
so need
occurs once in a year
inicit initiate occurs two times in a
year initiate occupies two to three
percentage of seeds
okay and neet occupies 97 to 98
percentage of the seeds in the country
is it clear can i move to the next part
everything is important from now
clear guys
next how many government college seats
are there per year in india anyone
how many government college government
college seats means free seats
indirectly free seats
you don't need to pay any fees and every
month
every month they are going to give
stipend for you
okay so in india you have around 600 gdc
seats
600 government college seats free seats
throughout the country okay
can you tell me what is the stipend in
and around
in and around stifens
okay
what can you tell me what is the highest
hyphen highest hyphen
highest stipend
okay there are colleges like ames pga
gypmar
bhu
kgmc lucknow there are many many
colleges smaller and everything they are
going to pay a stipend of 80k plus to
one lakh
per month this is per month
and of course as you said like most of
you are from telangana can you tell me
what is the stipend of gdc hyderabad the
only gdc available for telangana
students i think
i think gdc is okay gdc hyderabad now
it's been increased to 45 to 50 k per
month
any other state people are there
andhra people are there
andra is also hitting 40 to 45 k per
month
so there are many colleges in the
country where they are going to pay a
stipend of in and around 50 or plus of
course colleges are there where the
stipend is 80 to 90k plus also stipends
are there but to be in this particular
colleges you should work so hard for the
upcoming one year so that you can move
to these colleges and have a good
quality of life with good quality of
patients
next question how many government
college seats are there per year in your
state
there are many different state people i
don't know how many state students were
there on the on the live but i got a
response from telangana students apart
from telangana there are any other state
people please do respond me so that we
are going to discuss how many seeds are
there per year in the state
okay so first of all i will be
discussing about telangana okay so how
many seeds are there in telangana gdc i
hope like gdc hyderabad students are
there they're very familiar with number
of seats available in their colleges
okay so these are the mds seats
available in gdc hyderabad that is
public health three seats oral pathology
three seats speedo conservative oral
surgery perio prostho omr and ortho so
one two three four five six seven eight
nine
nine into three you have 27
seats
is it clear
so there is one more important concept
than it that i need to explain so there
is something called as all india
50 percent this quarter
guys are you following me i want your
response in the chat box
i want your response on the chat box 27
gdc seats are there in telangana state
okay
50 days of all india quarter is nothing
but we have already discussed that
number of seats in all india are 600
in and around 600 government college
seats are there
out of this 600 300 will be in all india
quarter that's what i'm talking about
all india 50 is
300 will be in all india quarter
and gdc hyderabad people has to give 50
percentage of seats in every department
every year for this all india pool
means arthur people has to give medicine
people has to give us they all have to
give their 50 days so three seats are
there three seats cannot be converted
into fifty three seats fifty percentages
one point five one point five
three seats fifty percentage is one
point five one point five
three seats fifty percentage is one
point five one point five so one point
five cannot be give what they do
one year they are going to give two
seats the next year they are going to
give one seat
is it clear
for example if you take gdc hyderabad
this year they are going to give one
seat to all india pool means nine seats
will go for the all india pool out of
this 309 seats will be in
the all india board
nine seats okay
right so rest 18 seats will be in the
state pool so you are eligible to take
and telangana student is eligible to
take this 300 all india seats
as well as this 18 states in 18 seats in
the state pool if you want to take seat
of these nine seats also you can take
through all india
but you exclusively can take 18 seats of
state pool is it clear
this is this is a common rule for all
the states
maharastra morning i did not get any
response so maharashtra slides were not
included in this
so we are going to discuss i'll send you
the video which is prepared for
maharashtra people
do drop me a message on my number i'll
send you the video
so you got an idea right 18 seats
will be for the state pool
so telangana we have totally 27 seats so
one year we give we we donate 9 seats to
our india pool the next year we donate
18 seats to all india pool
is it clear guys
the number of seats we are donating to
all india pool
the number of seed states seeds
available for you
just give me one minute time
okay similarly
i hope i hope my screen is again visible
to you
is it visible guys
yeah for example i'm taking one more
example if you talk about karnataka
there is one government dental college
which is providing mds seats as of now
that is bangalore
so number of seats in the bangalore are
one two three four five six seven eight
nine
same as that of hyderabad you have 27
seats but one year they are going to
provide nine seats to all india pool the
next year they are going to provide 18
seats to all india food
the leftover seeds means one year nine
seeds are provided
eighteen seats are left over these
eighteen seats will be taken only by
state people
here nine seats are left over these nine
seats will be taken only by
state people is it clear
clear right
so this is how uh the categorization
occurs
now you have in front of you you have uh
you have a government college from uttar
pradesh
so you see pedo seats are two only so
one year they are going to give one seed
the next year they are going to give the
other seat
whenever you have two or whenever you
have four
two
two for all india two for state pool
okay so the problem will be less
whenever you have
odd number of seats then they are going
to have this particular bias i hope
this clarity over the seats is
very very important the state pool seats
how they divide and again in the state
pool you will have reservations okay so
for example telangana
you have reservations like scst
open category apart from open category
you have vcs that is bca bcb
bcc bcd
and bce five bc sub categories are there
in telangana similarly maharashtra you
have a different different
categorization of
the reservation is available and
similarly different state has a
different proposal andhra and telangana
almost have a similar proposal and
different states have a different
proposal but if you are talking about
all india all india has sc st
one is open category and the next one is
obc
so in this obc non-creamy creamy are
there means basing upon the
revenue of your father
okay so non-creamy creamy are there so
that we'll be discussing further we have
some rules and regulations to be
followed to be in the non-creamy zone to
get that extra edge in the counseling
clear guys some basic knowledge i don't
want you to go very deep into this this
is not basically required as of now but
you should have some knowledge like what
you are going what you are doing
what is happening how the seats
distribution will be there okay which
seat to target would see to approach and
everything you should have some basic
knowledge
if you're clear i can proceed to the
next part
similarly gdc
i mean like
andhra pradesh we have gdc vijayawada
vijayawada has three departments three
three three so one year they are going
to donate three seats the next year they
are going to donate six seats to all
india
similarly you see gdc kadapa gdc kadapa
as of now has
three plus three plus three you have 11
seats
but now dci has recently approved gdc
cut up and so gdc kadapa seats are
becoming double
all departments will be open in gdc
kadapa and very very soon so
similarly for example you have two
prosthetic seats so one
for all india one for state pool whereas
in rest other seats one year they're
going to donate to the next year they're
going they're going to donate one so
this is the rough calculation of
seats available in few states what you
have mentioned to discuss with me before
the session i have discussed
okay next
next we will be talking about
the exams
okay so as of now
the first exam that most of us are
eligible is going to be
number 2022
now number 202 to innocent but
unfortunately as telangana state exams
were done late you people are not
eligible to this okay so don't feel bad
for this okay but just have a clear-cut
idea so there will be
one exam any set
in november so the number of seats
involved in this are 15 seats
number of questions in the examination
hall will be 200
time duration will be 180 minutes that
is three hours
negative marking is minus one third i
want to make it simple don't make it
complicated means for every right answer
you will get plus three marks
for every wrong answer you will get
minus one that is called as minus one
third negative marking
and each question should be solved in
fifty seconds
diagram based questions don't don't
don't don't hurry up
diagram based questions are nothing but
your clinical like histology like for
every department from bds first year to
final year you have something called a
spotters
histological spotters are there
specimens are there general pathology
you have specimens you have instruments
in all the final layer subjects so such
questions they are going to give they
are going to give a radiograph and they
are going to ask you what is the
diagnosis of this they are going to show
an instrument what is the use of this
instrument those are called as diagram
based questions
so most of your questions in any set
will be regular questions except 15 to
20 are new pattern questions
what is this new pattern questions guys
are you familiar with ar questions
mostly at your msit
at your 11th and 12th standard during
your entrance examination to get into dd
to get into this bds you have given this
assertion reason based questions are you
familiar with that word assertion reason
based questions
yes okay so that is called as ar
questions do you have one or two ar
questions
you are going to give a few of the
material they will ask you to arrange
the following in ascending order
descending order i hope you are familiar
ascending order descending order
questions ar questions
match the following questions true or
false questions so all these are called
as new pattern of questions which are
recently added to initiate they are not
there in neet neet we don't have all
this stuff okay instead they have added
so what do we focus on everything we'll
be discussing once we start uh the
reading part of the classes and
everything
so whether it's a neat or any set
60 to 70 percentage of the questions
will be coming from the clinical
oriented part that is clinically
integrated subjects and most of your
questions will move around endo ortho
oral surgery cons perio pedo prosta
implants
oral medicine radiology oral path and
general anatomy
so you have 25 to 30 diagram based
questions this is all about immunity
so i'll i'll try to compare the any set
the the model to that of the need okay
so next one is need
so neet examination
all your government colleges till now we
have discussed except aims pga and
japanese pga and gym will come under any
city
and rest all government colleges like
for example you take gdc hyderabad
gdc hyderabad or gdc kadapa or gdc
vijayawada gdc bangalore
okay you you take your all the
gdc's in your maharashtra
gdc mumbai
gdc nagpur
you take your gdc indoor for manchester
people gdc indoor and all these are
going to be filled through neet
examination all your private college
seats most of you are from private
colleges all your private colleges
telangana andhra every private college
every deemed college all seats will be
filled through
need means neet will fill around 6000
seats and here out of six thousand seats
six hundred are gdc seats is it clear
we have discussed six thousand our gdc
seats overall is six six thousand seats
six hundred gdc seats anyone familiar
with army corps selection
army cops
last year there are one or two interns
who got army who got selected into army
cops from mds conquer
okay so there is something called as
army cops you want me to discuss about
army corps also guys
i need your quick response on the chat
box
because we need to wrap up these things
okay so there is something called as
army cobs army cop selection every year
army cop selection occurs
indirectly these are army
dental doctors
in a simple term army dental doctors
so in and around
every year in and around you will have
30 to 40 30 to 40 seats
or more than 40 sometimes will be filled
by army cops
so army cop selection occurs in
two categories category one and category
two
category one is too clear and neat with
your great rank very good rank you have
to clear the neat examination
okay so once you clear the neat
examination they are going to select the
top 600 people who has applied the
notification the top 600 rankers and
they are going to call
all these 600 rankers for an interview
so on an interview they are going to do
the medical examination followed by some
xyz stuff and interview so they are
going to release the top 60 list and out
of top 60 list 40 45 people are going to
get allocated with army cops as a job so
this is somewhere around like 11 to 13
years service to the country and you
will get all the privileges of army and
the pay you're going to get initially
will hit somewhere around 90 and it's
going to increase basing upon your
service and there will be several
examinations internally that is going to
happen so basing upon clearing the
examinations your pay will be increased
but initial pay is somewhere around 90
000 per month is it clear
anything more you want me to discuss
about army cops
13 years of service to the country
two-step examination one is need is
mandatory second one you have to clear
the interview strive you are going to
get a pay of 90 plus and apart from this
all army services you know what are the
extra edges and what are the extra
provisions that the government of india
is going to provide for army you are
eligible to take all those provisions
clear clear about army cops guys
uh
uh
sorry so now i will be talking about
the need okay so need is for 200
questions so previously i have discussed
about init initiatives for how many
questions guys
initiatives for 200 questions neet is
for 240 questions
neet time is 3 hours initiate time is
also 3 hours
negative marking here is minus 1 4 minus
1 4 means every right answer you will
get four marks and every wrong answer
you will make you will get minus one
square
whereas in a set every right answer
three marks
and every wrong answer you get you make
you will get minus one square
right you have to answer these questions
within 45 seconds diagram based
questions will be somewhere around
40 plus in your need and compared to
initiating will have a less number of
diagrams neet will have more number of
diagrams
clear small difference mode of
preparation is almost same for both
innocent and as well as need and we
provide
a combined mode of preparation okay a
combined mode of preparation i hope you
are clear with
clear with any set inside as well as
need is it clear some basic information
you just need to know how many seats are
there how many questions you have to
attempt how much time is the exam
the negative marking and all these
concepts are very very important so i
hope you got some basic
knowledge as of now
right can i move to the next part
so as already said you okay so
uh
any set occur two times a year so one is
in the november second one is in the
month of may
so now in this may first week after the
neet examination your seniors are going
to give this initiate exam so two rounds
of any set one is in november
and second one is in the main and one
round of need per year clear right exams
their patterns their model papers
number how much time how many mcqs and
everything okay as we go
in detail started learning you will get
a clear-cut idea over these
contents can i move
done
inicit is two times a year one is in the
may session the second one is in the
november session whereas neet is once an
year so nv people for need they have
given some blueprint blueprint means how
much is the weight is that each subject
is going to carry
so each subject is going to carry 14
marks
okay medicine and surgery will carry 15
14 to 50 but rest all subjects will
carry 14 each this is officially given
by
nbe people who are the organizing
committee for conducting of need
examination in our
country we'll discuss what is the use of
blueprint and how we start once we start
the preparation how to use this
blueprint and how this blueprint will
smartly work
uh in approaching our preparation all
these aspects we are going to start one
we are going to discuss once we start
the preparation
next is
must
do for need and as well as any set for
an mds conquer student so these are the
things that if you are a part of mds
conquer there is something called as a
material of power playbooks will be
provided for you as a hard copies it
will be delivered to your postal address
we provide hard copies of the books
second one
you have to take either dentist or
dental pulse
which is the recent one released
available in the market
similarly you have to be thorough with
all the previous question papers which
will be available on the side
as a subject wise
all the latest concept videos will be
available on the website all the smart
notes will be available on the website
so in the last
mode before you take examination
you have last minute revision notices
you have mock exams everything available
on the website textbook reading will be
done and that textbook reading
associated videos and the content will
also be available on the website so that
the main difference between mds conquer
and rest other coaching centers is
every day there will be direct intimacy
with you means every day the mentor is
going to talk with you
every day the mentor is going to teach
with you it's not like in a weekly based
approach or a weekly based process
weekly one or two classes not something
not like that so every day the mentor is
going to have
a talk with you
every day the mentor is going to
motivate you every day the mentor is
going to teach something to you
according to the schedule
right so
hyderabad people this is the offline
center
offline center available in hyderabad
the location of this center is kukatpali
housing board jntu the location of this
center is
jnto
so these are the addresses and
everything i'm going to post
okay coming to the
courses available okay
so we have three courses available with
us
okay three courses available one is plan
a this is a regular course
so here you have a topic specific exams
of mcqs of more than 5000 to 6000
you'll have subject specific means on
every subject you will have one or two
examinations
on every topic in this particular
subject that is called as topic specific
for example endo you take 15 topics are
there you'll have exam on all the 15
topics
and followed by you will have mock exams
grant exams like weekly
weekly exams monthly exams every two to
three months you'll have an exam so
these are going to come under mock exams
grant exams
and as i said you you will have access
to all the previous question papers
subject-wise
pp books will be given as a hard copy
which is very special feature of mds
conquer because most of the online
activities or online coaching centers
they don't give you hard copies
of the material
you will have video classes you'll have
case-based discussion videos you'll have
diagrams discussion videos you'll have
smart notes
you'll have a discussion board every day
you'll have a discussion board where
your mentor is going to interact with
you discuss with you something you have
doubt clarification session the only
difference between plan pro live pro
live and plan a is the live classes okay
so in pro live
you'll have two
live classes
weekly
and these will be on the weekdays
and the timing of these live classes is
to six to eight o'clock in the evening
classes will be between six to eight
o'clock in the evening okay so you'll
have two classes per week six to eight
o'clock because they are not going to
hinder your regular college hours
or your dinner timings okay so you'll
have six to eight classes even if you
miss this class by mistake this pro live
class
this will be available as a
recorded version for prolife students
only so recorded version available for a
prolife student if you miss the class
for reference and everything you can use
the recorded version the live class will
be recorded and it will be uploaded on
the website which you can use you can
which you can use so these are the two
online courses one is plan a
the second one is
plan pro
the difference between the plan a plan
pro is
the only live hours
two live classes each of six to eight
hours
if you miss the classes the classes will
be available as a recorded version
okay
next one there is something called as
offline offline course the offline
centers as of now available are
available are vijayawada
and hyderabad
offline centers vijayawada and hyderabad
so what is the difference between
offline offline course is called as
hybrid course
so they get access to online content
as well as the offline content
so weekdays
you regularly follow the plan your
schedule which is going on the group
and the weekends and other days you will
have offline classes so these offline
classes will be of four hours
they start at morning 8 30 and they drag
up to 12 30 to 1 o'clock with half an
hour break in the middle
and the mentors the experienced mentors
are going to come
from all the corners of the country to
interact with you teach you in the most
effective way
so apart from that the main advantage of
offline is you will know the competition
spirit how other college people are
doing
how the repeaters from your same college
are doing
how they are reading
how the competition is there because if
you you're just an online student your
competition will be within your
college
or you may see the competition levels
during an activity or during a live
session in the pro line
but you can feel the live presence in
your offline centers okay so people who
has access to offline centers
particularly i want to vote for colleges
like uh
like malaria women malaria coin or koid
sri balaji mnr are very near to the
offline center less than so malaria
women and koat is less than 10
kilometers
sri balaji and mnr are less than in
india around 20 to 25 kilometers
is accessible
army dental policy is access accessible
is accessible gdc hyderabad is
accessible and all the people either
from
or common any everywhere like if you're
coming for a weekend vacation every week
you are coming to home you can pick
offline because offline will have that a
little bit of extra edge
regularly what what most of the colleges
like particularly the magana
kamini
mamata
svs what they do is
so they used to come in the last three
to four months of the preparation phase
to the offline center once they're done
with an internship but for this
particular batch you don't have that
accessibility because your internship
will be
from march to march if you start your
internship in the month of march it will
be extended up to the march by the time
your examination will be done so it's
very difficult for you to take a break
and come to the offline center for
offline interactions or offline classes
so you see basing upon your travel
convenience and basing upon your comfort
for the preparation you choose offline
or online okay you'll have a little bit
of extra edge for offline when compared
to the online because you will have that
pressure that is being created by the
mentor every week
okay so
right so these are the state uh
best rankers of mds conquer in the last
few years
the main reason of keeping these things
is okay
he is
an intern
somehow is an intel
rt is a repeater
and bharati is an intern
okay so a little bit of extra edge for
instance only if you read
if you take it as granted it doesn't
work so only if you read you will get
that extra edge
so and if you see the toppers of your
telangana list the recent toppers
so 2020
conquer has banged 13 out of 13
and 2021
we made 10 out of 13
2019 we made
8 out of 10. okay so these are the
things and i hope most of you are
familiar with your senior names
okay puja jain is from kamaneni kids
akang shabera is also from kamini kids
balaji i hope you know balaji srisai
vikaraba
anusha is from kids again
padmashree is from mnr
and padmashri has done
the internship from gdc hyderabad
okay
niharika is from kids again
srinamas is from malaria
kritika is from army dental college
and chaitra is from army dental college
and most of you i hope most of you are
familiar with your senior names and if
you just list out the state andhra top
three out of three are mds congress
students
okay uh hari priya is from gaitham's
padmashree is from mnr
and uh
sravya is from uh vishnu denver colors
the main reason to keep all this like
you'll be familiar so these are the
things that mds conquer has gained till
the date
so apart from andhra telangana we got
third rank from orissa fifth rank from
himachal pradesh category first rank
from karnataka and most of these are in
gdc's first rank from jk
third rank from mp fourth rank from jk
okay so these are the 2020 state toppers
and i hope most of you are familiar with
your seniors
okay right you see uh
chandna is from pananiya
prashanth are from magna dental college
maitre is from mnr
kusum
shishmita mam is not from uh not from
our state she is a non-locality
uh she is from karnataka colleges
swanalatha is from panania
yesh is from svs i hope you know karthik
karthik is from srisai vikaraba
okay so i hope most of you are familiar
with these faces
vishnu dental college somehow vishnu
dental college divya armani is from
anitz
i hope anitt's people are there
ownerships
she is from san jose dental college
manisha bdc magana
anuradha is from narayana gsl
rosa is from annettes
from it so most of these people who are
sharing their mds first second third
years at different levels and most of
them are in government dental colleges
so this is my phone number you can
contact me at any time uh
for any sort of details or for any sort
of help so i'm done with i'm done with
the content now if you have any doubts
you can just post me so that we are
going to discuss so this this uh
video will be streamed live will will be
streamed on on the youtube whenever you
want you can access okay so every every
month a new batch is going to start with
mds conquer so you can ping to this
particular number whenever you feel like

of conquer or not we are ready to help
you out
in giving your proper guidance so
whenever you want you can call us or

message so that will be telling the
upcoming batch when it is going to start
and everything
features i am not going to discuss in
this class i will be posting once the
session is done
uh on your respective groups because
freezes uh are
the mds conquer features are always
associated with some merit-based
offers
in a limited time
so i don't want to disclose the fees
here because it's going to vary from
batch to batch
and everything
so offline classes timings has already
stretched really the offline classes are
going to start
morning
at 8 30
and 8 30 to 10 30
10 30 to 11 o'clock will be a small a
small break to have a tea and a coffee
from 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock
so these are the timings for offline
classes and every sunday you will have
an offline class
apart from sundays
you will have non-festival holidays
means for example you have independence
day you have republic day you have
gandhi jayanti and all these non
festival holidays will also be taken
into consideration the jnts and
everything except like
the regular festivals celebrated in
hyderabad the non-festival holidays also
will have
classes apart from that sometimes the
mentors may be coming from
delhi or coming from mumbai come from a
longer distance so in such cases we are
going to intimate you
a week ahead so in such cases if it is
required you have to keep one day extra
leave
for your from your internship because
internship will have a leaves number of
leaves so that leaves has to be at least
properly so we are going to intimidate
you a week if there is any extra class
on saturday so in such conditions you
have to keep a leave on started
so that is about offline hyderabad and
vijayawada
anything more guys
or else anything more any doubts related

offline classes will not be recorded
offline classes you have to attend
offline sessions will be done in two
rounds if you miss round one class
the same subject will come in second
round also then you have to attend it
two times every class will be done twice
in offline center
i i told you i'll share the
present fees details and present fees
benefits
once you ping to me on this number
it will be shared immediately after the
session
i i hope for then it is clear
only till this course
offline
we are only taking 150 students
150 students per session
so once we cross 150 you will have a
morning session and an afternoon session
so you have to register either for a
morning session or afternoon session as
of now it is only one session first
not up to you crack the exam
only one year
till the date of exam priyanka
namrata
i am not clear with the question
hi if you have interest to meet me
you can come to the offline center we
can we can sit and talk for some 15 to
20 minutes about the plan and everything
that is open if you want you can come
and meet the team the team will be
available
now once the offline afternoon session
is open till now we've never opened
we never opened the offline session
because it will be done from
two ways
it will be done from two rounds so first
round people once they are done they go
back to the preparation
we are not very sure the time about
timings as of now we are doing it only
in the morning session
yes priyanka we can have a talk after
the class
if you want you can come to the offline
center and you can meet me so that we
can discuss further
or as i said you like once your result
is out
uh for sure i'll be coming to the
colleges i can give hundred percentage
assurance that i'll i'll come to gdc
hyderabad for sure
i'll try to come to army uh pakka i'll
come to mnr svs srisai vikaraba
mallard women already
i'm not very sure about carmen any
panini
mamata i'm not sure also i'm going to
come i'm gonna also i'll be hitting but
i'm not sure about uh
two to three colleges of telangana
whether i'm going to come or not but
we'll give a hard try
to get permission to
to get access to talk with you if not we
can meet we can meet in hyderabad it's
not a big deal we can meet in our
offline center or we can meet
meet in our clinical oriented center
and one more important thing
that
i just want to add
all the students of mds conquer
all the students who are a part of mds
concur
whether it's an offline or online all
the students of mds conquer
will get access to two
clinical
online
certificate based courses
if you are a part of this this is free
two online clinical certificate based
courses you'll get access
and you'll get consideration two
offline clinical courses also which will
be done in the center which i have shown
during the initial during the first
slide so we have an academic center
where we are going to
do microscopic associated clinical
practice
so most of the topics particularly the
clinical dentistry will be
handled with most of the clinical cases
okay so that's a that's an extra edge
for you so that you can uh orient
yourself to a better clinical practice
also which you have missed in third year
final year or which you are going to
miss in internship
so you will get exposure to all latest
devices
lasers microscopes
rotary endodontics
what are aligners how it will be done
how the cases has to be selected and
everything all such
major things will be discussed in your
classes along with your classes also
you'll have your clinical visit for
example if you're an offline student no
fellowships we are not doing any sort of
fellowships because fellowships are not
valid the fellowship certificates are
not valid official in india so we are
not doing any sort of fellowships or we
are not giving any sort of fellowship
fellowships as of now because this is
completely preparation oriented so you
have your focus should be more on
preparation
uh to give that extra energy in your
preparation here and there we'll have
some clinical visits some special cases
visit some instrument visit
so this is just to
create that energy energy buzz in you to
make your preparation better so that's
what i'm telling this is a part of the
coaching center curriculum
this is a part of the coaching center so
clinical exposure rubber dam how you
have to use how many times of rubber dam
are there how you have to keep rubber
down on the patient
how you have to select the patient how
you have to open the clinic can handle
the future future of your clinic how the
clinical course clinic is different from
your regular college so all such
knowledge oriented clinical aspects
which are going to make you better in
dentistry to make more money dentistries
like you treat more patients you get
more exposure you get more money so all
those things will be discussed
whenever you feel like weak bored of all
this stuff you'll have such a discussion
to make your preparation active
so that's that's one important thing
that we are planning to come out
right anything more
so rest everything we can discuss if you
have anything you can call me give me a
buzz on my
whatsapp or you can call me so that we
can talk we have a group of 15 to 20

government jobs are not there in
telangana government jobs are there in
other states you can follow the mds
congress instagram page for all the
updates of government jobs throughout
the country
pse based jobs will be opened
every six months in few few states few
states not all the states so the job
opportunities of government job
opportunities will be very very minimal
in state telangana and andhra compared
to other states
okay right
as of now
