T is an image classification and neural
network processing machine learning
framework by Dodge is an open source
python-based machine learning
implementation based on the torch
Library it is the most widely used AI
Library among the industry and academic
researchers around the world hey
everyone you're already watching simply
learn and in today's video we're gonna
be learning all about Pi torch and how
to build a neural network using pytots
if you love watching videos like this do
hit the Subscribe button to never miss
any updates from Simply learn so now
without any further delay let's get
started with the pytots installation so
to install python first make sure the
python is installed in your system so to
install python for programming visit the
python.org website so that is
just end up python
so visit this first link
www.python.org so here
just click on this downloads and click
here on python
3.11.1 version okay so since python is
already installed in my system I'm not
going to install so here you just need
to click this and will be installed here
so it will be downloaded so once it is
downloaded you can run and install the
python in your system so once installing
python check if it is successfully
installed using the following command
so
open the comment prompt
and here enter python
version
so as you can see python is installed so
python 3.11.1 is installed successfully
so if you get the python version then we
are good to go and our next step is to
install Anaconda so to install Anaconda
visit the link
Anaconda
so here as you can see www.anaconda.com
so once you scroll down here you can see
this green download button so you can
just click on this download
and wait for it to get downloaded it
will take some time to download
so suppose if you are running through
pep then you can also check whether
paper is installed in your system so to
check if pip is installed using a
following command VIP
you can save version
so here you will get the proportion so
but here today we are going to install
the Anaconda
say it is downloaded
so once the Anaconda is downloaded open
the file and click on next and next
click on I agree
select me recommend it and click on next
so it's already selected just click on
next and here in the fourth step choose
the install location so here it's asking
choose the install location so this is
the default location if you want to
change the location then you can change
it
so you can just click on next
and here uh in The Next Step it's asking
Advanced installation options so here
you can just click on this first add
Anaconda 3 to my path environment
variable and click on install finally so
once you click on install it will get
installed so Anaconda will be installed
so since it's already installed in my
system I'm not going to click here but
once you click on this they are gonna
will be installed successfully so to
check whether the Anaconda has been
installed successfully check Anaconda
version in the Anaconda prompt
so just open the Anaconda from
and enter conda version
so as you can see here we got the
version of Honda
so you can also check in the comment
prompt
second version
and here we got the version of condo so
that means Anaconda is successfully
installed
so now to install pie torch visit Pi
torch
and here click on the first link
and here we are with the pie torch.org
so scroll down
and here you can see this so considering
your system specification will run any
one of the following comment so that is
here you need to select pytorch build
that is stable and then your operating
system would be Windows if it is Linux
or Max then you can select either of
them
so I'll assist windows so I'll click on
window and package would be uh as per
your requirement if it is PIP then you
can go with this else condom since we
have installed Anaconda so we will click
on condom and language would be python
because we have
um we are running using Python language
and coming to the compute platform
here if your system is having GPU then
go with conda let's go with CPU since
this system is not having GPU so we will
go with the CPU so run this comment so
here we got one comment so according to
our compute platform if it is Coda then
we'll get this command if it is CPU then
we'll get this command so just copy this
command
once copying this command
paste it in your comment prompt
okay Enter
so as you can see collecting package
meta data
so as you can see here the package plan
we got all the things and following new
packages will be installed so click
proceed yes or no will give us
so you are downloading and extracting
packages
preparing verifying executing
now here
to check whether the pytos has been
installed successfully run the following
command
so let's run in the comment Anaconda
prompt
so just enter column
this F
yphen F by torch
so as you can see the name pytouch
version also we got and build channel so
once you get all this if you get the
python version after running the command
that means python just successfully
running
so if you want you can also check in the
comment down just enter Honda list
hyphen f
and Pi torch
just click give enter and it should
display the pytorch version name and its
version
so as you can see we got the name
version and build channel so now we know
pytots is installed so now let's start
to build a neural network so this is a
pytorch deep learning tutorial for
fashion MNS data set so to predict data
set classes we will build a CNN so now
without further delay let's get started
to build a neural network using pi torch
so in our first step here we have first
let's import important libraries so
these are the libraries that we are
importing
so import numpy as NP find as SPD and
Mac plot lip as PLT and next we are
importing torch torch.nn as NN and
thoughts.autograde import variable and
coming to torch Vision torch
vision.transforms as transforms
torch.utils.data so this is to load data
in batches we we use the data loader
class from tors.utils dot data and from
sklearn dot matrices import confusion
Matrix so next check if the GPU so here
next check if the GPU is available use
it for the computation otherwise use the
CPU so here we are asking conda is
available else CPU next using the method
read CSV so using this method let's load
the disk using pandas okay and device
the data set into the test and train
data now in your own class let's say
fashion data inherit the data set class
and coming to this
we have user defined class for creating
data set with pi torch dataset class and
next method to initialize variables and
First Column is of labels and dimensions
of image is equal to 28 cross 28 cross 1
where height is equal to 28 and the
color channel will be equal to 1 so this
will be the color channel that is 1 and
we have 28 cross 28 and using two
methods get item and length
so this is the item method this is the
length method so to get item and length
we are using two methods so get item
will return the image and labels and the
length will return the number of items
in a data set and this one or transform
data into tensor that has a range from 0
to 1 so next the fashion Mist fashion m
s class from the torch visual module is
being used and the data set will be
loaded for the first time so here the
data will be loaded and coming back here
the fashion MNS data set contain 10
different types of clothing that is we
have t-shirt or top brushes pullover
dress coat sandals skirt sneakers back
and ankle boot so these are the clothing
the types of clothing and creating a
method that Returns the class name for
the label number so here we have the
label item so here creating a method
that Returns the the class name for the
label number so for example if the label
is 5 then we return the sandal right so
next print the train loader size and its
length so here we are printing the train
loader and the length and then
experimenting with data and displaying
images with the matplot clip that is IM
show method so using this method I am
sure we are going to display the image
so here we got the image so as I said it
was like 28 cross 28 and the color was
gray so here we got all the labels that
is we have pullover ankle boot shirt
t-shirt dress code coat sandal coat and
bag so the labels are printed and then
building a CNN here we are create a
model class in our class fashion CNN
that inherits the NN module class so
which is a super class for all neural
networks in pytorch and the following
layer Compares our neural network
so here we have the two sequential so
these are the two sequential layers each
with the following layers so we have
conventional layer that is 3 cross 3 and
padding is equal to 1 kernel sizes 3
cross 3 and then a layer for batch
normalization this and a DOT full batch
normalization and then we have NL r e l
u is used to activation function and Max
pooling layer here we have of size uh 2
cross 2 and then comes the flatten the
output of the dense layer and here we
have
um this flatten the output of the dense
layer also known as the fully connected
layers so three fully connected layers
with a different in out features and one
Robert layer here we have one dropped
layer with a class probability of p is
equal to zero point
two five and then all functionality is
provided with the forward method so this
is the forward method which defines CLS
forward pass so let's implement the
network so here model
making a model of our CNN class so
creating an object in the code a model
and transforming it to the GPU if one is
available and then creating a loss
function in this case cross here we have
the cross and drop by loss as used and
then we are using the atom algorithm
so this atom algorithm is used for
optimization and here we got the output
and here this step training and testing
a neural network on a test data set so
list for here we have the list
loss list
iteration list and accuracy list so list
for a visualization of laws and accuracy
and then list for knowing class wise
accuracy this is the class to knowing
the classes accuracy and then here we
are going to transferring image and
labels to GPU if available and forward
pass and then initializing the grade
here here we are going to initializing a
gradient as 0 so there is no mixing of
gradient among the batches and then the
propagation the error backward and
optimizing the parameters and then
testing the module so here we are going
to test the module and here we got the
accuracy for the labels
so each label accuracy is checked so
here we have given 0 to 5 so we got 6
accuracy and you can see uh the loss
it's been decreased and final accuracy
that we got is 34 percent and then so
here we are going to examine the
accuracy in each fashion mnis data set
class so each label accuracy is checked
here we have the iteration versus loss
accuracy and iteration versus accuracy
so after finding accuracy we are
printing the confusion Matrix
so accuracy of t-shirt or top is 86.98
and accuracy of torsion since 99
occursive pullover is 91 dress is 92
code 90 sandal 99 shirt 94.40 sneakers
96.97 bag is 99.68 ankle boot is 98.53
so here we got all the accuracy of uh
clothes
and finally printing the confusion
Matrix so this is our confusion Matrix
so this is my deep learning
implementation in the fashion Eminence
data set using pytos and I got 94 on the
test so to improve it modify the layer
architecture or parameters and with that
