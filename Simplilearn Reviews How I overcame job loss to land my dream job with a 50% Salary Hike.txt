I was literally depressed my brothers
and sisters were earning so much my
husband was earning so much I was the
one who was earning like literally in
chunks I went through a lot in my career
I lost my job in lockdown I got
pregnant I have learned a lot from my
family I have learned to keep on
fighting I believe one day you will get
everything but you just have to to work
for it and eventually everything will
fall into place I made it to Juniper
network with a 50% salary

hike my name is NAD mital I belong from
panipat so I did my schooling there I
did my bcom honors from Delhi
University after my graduation I did
MBA I got my first job through campus
placement so I had to move to Bangalore
when I moved to Bangalore the pandemic
hit and the book my Forex had to scale
down its operations so I couldn't work
there
anymore and as there was a shortage of
jobs in Market I wasn't getting one so I
had to take a break and I was sitting at
home and in between I got pregnant and I
delivered my first
baby so I was looking for more
opportunities at that time and then I
encountered a company called
University's Nation who was providing
remote job opportunities
after one year of working there they
also started calling people to office
but I was a new mother I wasn't ready to
join office
physically my daughter was very young I
didn't wanted to sacrifice my time with
her at that time I realized if I
continue to work through office I would
earn some lxs more but that isn't worth
sacrificing my time with my daughter
going office was not an issue the office
was in NOA I was living in Bangalore so
at that time what I was doing is
wherever I could see a apply button I
would straight away go and hit that I
was applying jobs on LinkedIn no.com I
am jobs portal I don't think there is
any platform which I have
[Music]
left so it went on for months but
suddenly then I thought can no this is
not going to work and I will only apply
to the jobs where it is worth working
for so being a first time Mom I never
wanted my daughter to be you know sent
to daycare mom guilt was there so it was
a major
roadblock from my previous companies one
of my colleagues suggested that there is
a online platform called simply learn
where you can just sit at home and
you'll get to learn from the comfort of
your home and you can watch your
daughter also so I thought this is the
perfect thing which you know being a
first time Mom I could have my husband
was very supportive in my entire Journey
we used to work Monday to Friday and
then on Saturdays and Sundays we used to
cook we used to take care of the house
we used to take care of the kid due to
some XYZ reason if I couldn't attend the
class so then I used to ask for
recordings and simply Le used to provide
me recordings immediately and I by
watching videos I used to cop up with
the class I really had a great
experience with simply learn and my
relationship manager rajes he has been a
very you know big support in my journey
whenever I used to feel low down
regarding my career and he was very
patient with me he used to tell me ke
sometimes you have to wait everything
will work out everything will fall into
place I think those were the words which
I really wanted to hear at that point of
time I had given a virtual interview for
jiper and they told me that I've been
selected for face Toof face interview
then came the day of interview I was
very nervous I went for the interview my
legs were literally shaking I was
sitting in the meeting room I was
waiting for them to arrive but on the
contrary they were very positive finally
I made it to Juniper Networks with a 50%
salary
[Music]
hike so I feel things can never be
avoided difficult situations can never
be ignored they will keep on coming but
ultimately what matters is your patience
so whenever I face any situation I tell
my myself this two shall pass
