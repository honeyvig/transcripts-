by 2023 66 percent of people on the
planet will be connected to the internet
data scientists are the next perfect
profession because they can expect to
make between sixty five thousand dollars
and one fifty three thousand dollars
annually the field of data science is a
hot cake and has a promising future hey
everyone before moving on to today's
topic please make sure you subscribe to
our channel and press the bell icon to
never miss an update let us check out
today's agenda
starting with what is data science next
difference between tools and libraries
further we will cover top 10 data
science tools following it top 10 data
science libraries and final is
conclusion to the topic
before accelerating forward let me ask
you a question
which is the famous programming language
used in data science
java
c hash
c plus plus r
let me know the answer in the comment
section below
first let's understand what is data
science data science is a field of study
that works with enormous amount of data
utilizing contemporary technologies and
methodologies to uncover hidden patterns
obtain valuable information and make
business decisions in a simpler way data
science is the field of extracting
valuable information from data using
scientific methods which will help in
decision making for businesses
data scientists should be aware of the
field of machine learning
modeling like mathematical models and
algorithms statistics programming and
databases
now we know what data science is we will
understand the difference between tools
and libraries
tools are any software programs or
utilities that help software developers
or programmers create modify debug
maintain or carry out any tasks
relevant to programming or development
is referred to as a programming tool
software development tools are another
name for programming tools
libraries in computer programming
library is a group of documents
applications scripts routines or
functions that can be used as references
in the source code
we now know the difference between tools
and libraries it's time to jump for top
10 data science tools
first one is sas it stands for
statistical analysis system it belongs
to the class of data science tools made
especially for statistical processes
large corporations utilize sas a closed
source proprietary program to utilize
data sas does statistical modeling using
the fundamental size computer language
it is commonly used by experts
and business developing reputable
commercial software you can model and
organize your data using a variety of
statistical libraries and tools from sas
as a data scientist
let's look into features first is data
analysis skill
the first feature is that sas
programming is capable of performing
strong data analysis
flexibility syntax is easy to learn
statements are similar to the code these
sentences provide clear simple
instructions for the systems

large amount of complicated data must be
processed as a part of big data
processing therefore when it comes to
processing businesses and organizations
need such frameworks that can handle
enormous volumes of data quickly
next comes easy to use java scala python
and our programmers we create scalable
apps with spark as a result developers
can write and operate spark applications
using their choice programming language
flexibility
in addition to running on hadoop yan

this is all about top 10 data science
tool now we will see top libraries in
data science
is numpy
the essential python module for
numerical calculation is called numpy
and it includes potent n-dimensional
array object it is a general purpose
array processing software that offers
capabilities for working with high
performance multi-dimensional objects
known as array by offering
these multi-dimensional arrays as well
as functions and operators that works
effectively on these arrays numpy
partially overcomes the slowness issue
next is scipy
because it extends numpy and offers a
variety of user friendly and effective
routines for scientific calculations it
is widely used for scientific and
technical calculations a scientific
computation package called scipy is
built on top of numpy
python is a common abbreviation it
offers more helpful functions for signal
processing statistics and optimization
scipy is a open source therefore it can
be used just like numpy
the data science life cycle is not
complete without pandas along with numpy
in matte polyp it is the most well known
and commonly used python module for data
search
it is widely used for data analysis and
cleansing with almost 1700 comments on
github and has an active community of
1200 contributors
keras keras is another well-liked
framework that is frequently used for
deep learning and neural network models
much like tensorflow
if you don't want to get or into the
specific of tensorflow kera supports
both the theano and tensorflow packets
next comes pytorch the next best python
libraries for data science is pythons a
scientific computing toolkit built on
python that makes advantage of graphics
processing units
one of the most popular deep learning
research platforms
is pytorch which was designed to offer
greatest flexibility and speed
scrappy scrappy is the following
well-known python library for data
science one of the best well-liked quick
open source python web crawling
frameworks is called scrapping
using selector based on xpath it is
frequently used to extract data from web
pages scrappy creates feed exports like
xml csv json formats
next is beautiful soup the upcoming
python library for data science is
called beautiful su it is a well-liked
python package that is mostly used for
data scraping and web crawling users can
gather data from websites that don't
have adequate csv or apis and beautiful
so can assess them with scrapping the
data and organizing in the necessary
format
next comes plotly
data visualizations can be created using
plotly a graphing toolkit that is open
source and free in order to build
web-based data visualizations plotly is
built on top of javascript library
more than 40 different chart types
including multiple access
three-dimensional charts etc are
available in plotly
next comes seaborn based on matpo lip
and strongly connected with the numpy
and pandas data structures cbone is a
python data visualization framework
there are several data set oriented
graphing routines in seaborn that works
with data frames and arrays that contain
entire data set
the relevant statistical aggregations
and mapping operations are then carried
out internally to produce the user
requested informative displays
last is scikit learn
scikit learn is also a library that is
free machine learning software
library that is mostly written in python
computer language it was first
introduced in june 2007 after being
created by david as a google summer code
project due to its foundation on other
python libraries like numpy scipy
madpolet pandas etc scikit-learn offers
complete interchange with them although
scikit-learn is mostly built on python
some fundamental algorithm have also
been developed in cyto to increase
efficiency
have you guys got the answer for the
question we went through earlier
so answer to that question is our
programming language
this is all about top 10 libraries in
data science next is conclusion to the
topic
data is essential to any organization
survival in the competitive world of
today's data-driven society data
scientists use data to give important
insights to the main decision makers in
organizations without the use of the
potent data source techniques outlined
above this is almost unimaginable
it offers a method for performing data
analysis developing aesthetically
pleasing interactive visualizations and
creating robust predictive models using
machine learning algorithms these
capabilities make
data science simpler to extract and
deliver insightful information from
seemingly useless and raw data
after watching this video entirely you
may have realized that one of the most
notable characteristics of all this tool
is that they offer a user-friendly
interactive with built-in functions for
conducting computing on data increasing
efficiency and lowering the amount of
code required to extract value from the
provided data sourcing for meeting the
needs of end users as a result deciding
which tool to utilize from a variety
should be based on the particular need
for each use case
