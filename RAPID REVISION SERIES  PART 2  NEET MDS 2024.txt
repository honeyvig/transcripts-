yeah hi veners uh welcome to Quick
revision series uh this is Dr srikant
from Team MDS conquer now I'll be
discussing about a few important topics
related to your examination okay so now
you have a clinical photograph in front
of you so where you can see uh an Elser
uh which is
uh which is character like
ulcer on
pallet okay on pallet you can see so the
diagnosis of this is uh necrotizing Silo
metaplasia okay so diagnosis of this is
necroing pom metaplasia the important
things that you have to make out about
this is uh this is most commonly
associated uh with minor salivary gland
cellary glands which are present on the
pallet so pallet is the most common site
of occurrence intra worldly and uh this
is most commonly seen in the males when
compared to females with 2 is to one
ratio and of course in the diagram you
can clearly see this is a unilateral uh
okay it occurs in bilateral also but
most commonly an unilateral and it is
painless sometimes pain may be present
along with
lumus
okay and uh the mean is uh which is
given in the Shaffers is around like 48
years okay a similar lesion can occur on
the skin the lesion which occur on the
skin is called
as siringo
metaplasia a similar relation can occur
on in the
breast of the female so that is called
as post
trumatic
lobar metaplasia of the breast okay so
it can occur on the skin that is called
siringo metaplasia and this question was
also repeated so many times in the exam
it can occur on the breast that is
called as posttraumatic lobar metaplasia
so ethologist which are given in the
shaes as of course like it occurs in the
breast okay trauma is one of the
ethology okay so the other ethology is
decreasing in the vascular
Supply okay decreasing the vascular
Supply
trauma okay uh it can be due to
radiotherapy it can be due to surgery or
it can be due to Tobacco so these are
the ethiological uh findings which are
given in the Shaffers okay so please do
make a note of this and followed by the
most important area is we need to talk a
few lines about histology so first of
all we'll go to this okay so that is
that is n and S that is necrotizing
silom metaplasia okay so necrotising
silom metapa and for necrosis so you can
see on histology you can see
necrosis the necrosis which you can see
is basically called as coag
necrosis so you can see on histology you
can see coagulative necrosis of the
glandular tissue that is C gandul
glandular tissue okay that is called as
necrotizing why coagul to necrosis is
decreasing the vascular Supply is one of
the theology for of Co necrosis next one
is silom metaplasia means you can see
metapa one is you can see necrosis the
second one you can see metaplasia of the
ducts okay the most important thing
where the questions are being frequently
repeated is please do add this
particular word where you can see
pseudo
epithalamus
hyperplasia so what all you can see one
is you can see necrosis the type of
necrosis you see is coag necrosis that
is because of the vascular Supply
decrease second one you see metaplasia
third one you see hyperplasia that is
pseudo hyperia you see so these are the
three important lines that you have to
make a note when you're talking about
the histology of this particular SM ands
okay right so next comes is the
treatment there is no need of any no
treatment and the prognosis is excellent
and it it heals spontaneously it heals
spontaneous sometimes surgery may be
required if the response is not proper
but in most of the cases the recovery
occurs spontaneously there is no need of
treatment you need to follow up the
patient so these are all important
points related to necrotizing pom
metaplasia necrotising pom metaplasia
okay preferably the question will be
with this particular wording called as
crat like depression seen on the pallet
because of minor salivary glands most
commonly seen in the case of males when
compared to females it is painless the
mean AES age is 48 years skin leion is
called a siringo metaplasia breast Le is
causing post-traumatic lobar metaplasia
ethologist decreasing the vascular
Supply trauma radiotherapy surgery uses
of tobacco okay then comes histology
three important things necrosis
necrotizing that is cultive necrosis
metaplasia in the ducts and pseudo epiom
matus hyperplasia you can see treatment
no treatment you in most of the cases it
recovers spontaneously okay so these are
the important points that you have to
make when we talking about the
differential diagnosis the next scene
cames Okay so previously we are talking
about C like
ulcer okay so C like ulcer on the pallet
that is called as negraz silom
metaplasia the second category is you
can see CER like depression on
interdental
pap so this is again a very frequently
uh asked question okay so CR like
depression of the interdental pap yes
your answer should be anak okay so the
question was given in the last two years
of neat examination also so make sure C
like depression okay okay character like
ulcer or character like depression like
ulcer or punched out ulcer of ental Pap
your punch out
also Punch Out ulcer of interdental
papill C like interdental Pap so
whenever they use these words to inal
Pap your answer should be anak okay
alcer on the pallet your answer should
be necrotising silom metapa okay so next
comes is is like whenever you have uh
some few other important lines related
to parette so whenever they give
un prot protective sexual
contact plus a
palal ulcer or
lesion or whenever they mention
peripher now you need to go for sexual
contact related mic microorganisms okay
one most important thing which is going
to cause this is
syphilis syphilis and the lesion is
gumma okay the most common area for
occurrence
of intraoral intraoral area for
occurrence of GMA is am is
pallet so other important areas that you
have to make a not is most common
occurrence of
intraoral intra oral
KN okay the answer is
parot the most common area for
occurrence
of
intraoral intraoral occurrence of case
kosis saroma most common Cara that is
seen in the case of HIV positive patient
kosis saroma the most common area for
occurrence of kosis saroma is
again par hard paret these are hard
parets okay so please do make a note GMA
most common occurrence is pallet okay
then siringo metapa your neing Sil
metaplasia the most common area is
occurrence of palet intraoral Nei
occurrences heart pallet and intraoral
kosis saroma in HIV patient occurrences
heart palet so please do make a note of
these important lines then comes most of
you are familiar about this blue color
cylinder okay so very important in con
station that is your nitrous oxide so
few lines about your nitrous oxide so
nitrous oxide is of the most commonly
used gas in the case of your uh
concentation okay concentation is one of
the most important topic uh in your pedo
coming to dentist conation is more
important okay so the points to be noted
when you're talking about the nitrous
oxide is the color of the cylinder
okay cylinder color already mentioned it
is blue color okay the next comes is the
few other important values that you have
to make a note when I'm talking about
nitrous oxide that is uh MAAC value Mac
value is minimum alular concentration
value the minimum Al concentration value
is 104 percentage very good okay right
next comes is uh blood coefficient value
okay so blood gas coefficient value of
nitrous oxide is
0.47 then comes the specific gravity or
density
value is
1.53 okay is 1.53 now I want you to uh
tell me the pin index value pin index
value so please do mention the pin index
value in the comments in the comments
below please do mention what is the PIN
index value of nitrous oxide very
important okay pin index value table
will be there for uh most of the gases
we have a nimonic for that also which
has been discussed with you so many
times so the pin index values are very
very important please do mention the pin
index value of nitrous oxide in the
comment session then comes uh the next
important aspect that you need to to
make a note is the next one that is you
can see one more cylinder that is called
as anox you can see this is anox so what
is anox anox coming to the color uh anox
is going to have a blue
cylinder with white
shoulder okay again I'm telling okay
color coding of these gases which are
used in general anesthesia is is very
very important so please do make a note
of it okay you have a table whenever
cylinder is having a shoulder the
shoulder is always white enox is blue
plus white okay blue plus white shoulder
okay a blue cylinder with a white
shoulder whereas nitrous oxide is a blue
cylinder okay now what is anox anox is
basically 50%
of nitrous oxide and 50% of oxygen the
few other important lines that you have
to make a note when I'm talking about
nitrous oxide a few of you has asked
doubts regarding this so what what are
the adverse what are the problems or
Contra indications related to nitrous
oxide so these are the lines which are
given in uh sha tendance so I'm just
trying to focus on those lines it is
contraindicated in the case
of
nemox and in the case of
upper
respiratory tract
infections okay nitrous oxide is contra
indicated in Nemo thorax respiratory tra
infections and one more important thing
is
pulmonary
fibrosis means the patients under the
uses
of momy are prone to pulmonary fibrosis
in these individuals nitrous oxide is
contraindicated nitrous oxide is
contraindicated in pregnancy women
because this may lead
to this may lead to abortion okay and of
course one more very important area the
question about nitrous oxide is diffused
hypoxia okay so we learn about diffused
hypoxia is one of the common thing that
occurs after the usage of nitrous oxide
the patient's going to have uh the
following symptoms like headache the
patient is going to have immediately
after nitrous oxide the patient is going
to have
headache disorientation and all these
problems what is the treatment of this
yes you're right guys the treatment is
giving 100 percentage of oxygen for 5
minutes
after the procedure give 100% of oxygen
for 5 minutes after the procedure you
can avoid this diffused hypoxia which is
one of the most common complication that
is seen after injection of or after
using nitrous oxide as a conation in the
individuals okay so apart from this one
more important vitamin that we need to
make a note which is given in your sha
tendon Is nitrous
oxide is going to decrease the DNA
synthesis how it's going to decrease the
synthesis because nitrous oxide is going
to act on vitamin B12
oxidation okay vitamin B oxidation and
it's it's going to decrease the
synthesis of it and nitrous oxide has an
indirect effect on occurrence of altered
hemo pois that is it may lead to
pernicious anemia because it's playing
with beell okay so bew right so bewal it
may cause
altered hop Tois or may cause perous
anemia okay so these are the important
lines that you have to make note when
I'm talking about Nito okay then comes
the next one these are the few lines
taken from your uh Power Play Books orop
part okay so I mean I have given few
ques so please try to follow it um mode
of horific so when I'm talking about
mode of horific the first one is endoc
condal oifc in which a cartilage oifc is
going to convert into into bone okay so
the most common example for this is
ethmoid bone okay the most common most
of your questions will be moving around
this for this uh you can remember the
code h i s e h for highy bone I for
incus stus and ethmoid H next comes is
intram salification where a fibrous
tissue is going to aify to Bone okay
here the most common example that is
frequently Asked is maxilla so apart
from maxilla there are other bones which
are going to have this intramembranous
sification that is your nassal bone
zygoma peral bone Omar okay and your
lacrimal bone zy zygomatic bone the most
commonly asked question is which of the
following is seen in both okay which of
the following is seen in both your your
to plus your
mandible okay to plus your mandible Okay
so so that is temporal bone occipital
bone and spinoid Bone plus mandible
shows both intramembranous as well as
indoc condal OIC okay so this orifices
are very very important okay the there
will be slight difference uh uh from
reference to reference in in few
examples but I want you to strictly
follow this particular um particular uh
uh info info which is taken straight
away from jendra sharan one of the
standard one to be followed for most of
the uh MDS aspirins okay right so then
I'm jumping into one more important
topic related to your microbiology okay
right so I hope like you're familiar
parasites are very very important so I
see few of you are neglecting parasites
particularly malaria damn important and
hisoa damn important okay so malaria
andoa are very very much important you
need to learn top to bottom about
malaria top to bottom about
Tica if time permit
few lines about other parasites but you
see in 2023 uh recent need exam you have
a question on Ana okay and 2022 or 21
you have questions on malaria so very
frequently asked so the hosts hosts of
these parasites were divided into uh one
is definite to host and second one is
intermediate host definite host and
intermediate host and when I'm talking
about uh protozoans okay so definite
host is a host
where the sexual Cycle takes place
whereas intermediate host asexual Cycle
takes place when we talking about helic
parasites okay so definite host is a
host which is going to host the adult
form whereas the intermediate host is
going to host the laral form so that is
the difference between the protozoa as
well as helic parasites when I'm talking
about most of the
parasites humans are definite humans are
going to be definite H most of the
parasites that definite host are going
to be humans okay that's very very
important and now we need to talk about
the exceptions exceptions are very
frequently asked questions so they can
ask you uh in which of the following
human is considered intermediate host so
you need to remember this humans we
always what we do humans definitely have
pets humans are definitely going to have
pets and P for you're familiar okay so P
for
plasmodium
P for plasmodium E for
ocus E for ocus t for
toxoplasmosis okay so plasmodium ocus
toxoplasmosis are exceptions whereas
rest other parasites okay humans are
going to be the definite hosts so humans
are definite hosts except for plasmodium
ocus and toxoplasmosis in few cases they
rarely mention about about this third
host apart from the primary host and
secondary host that is your definite
host and intermediate host okay there is
one more host called as third host the
third host is also called as Partin host
okay it is it may be sometimes called as
carrier it may be sometimes called as
transport Host this is nothing but
called as third host okay so there are
few lines that you need to make a note
about malaria the infective form for the
humans is going to be the sporo zoids
whereas the infective form for the mus
is going to be gametes go back and
please do check the malaria life cycle
all the important points related to the
malaria and everything okay so when
talking about the
different types of malaria okay right so
the incubation period is going to be
maximum for maximum for maximum ma right
so intermediate is is going to be
maximum for
malaria okay whereas it is minimum for
minimum minimum means fast it is going
fast minimum
is faly perum okay minimum is faly perum
fast okay maximum is ml area okay right
I hope you are very very clear with
these contents okay so I'm done for now
I'll be coming with few more series of
videos where I'll try to cover the most
important topics Concepts and important
areas which are very very frequently
Asked in this leftover days before you
take your exam I hope these videos are
going to be useful effective okay so
please do mention in the comment box uh
about the question which I have asked
related to the pin index value of
nitrous oxide if you have any sort of
topics that you feel to be discussed not
subjects I'm very very clear okay
subject cannot be discussed as a short
form okay if you want any particular
topic to be discussed you can post those
topics on the comment box and we'll try
our best to include those topics uh
within the discussion part and stay
tuned to this particular uh Channel okay
for further more videos and updates
related to your upcoming examination bye
take care study
well
