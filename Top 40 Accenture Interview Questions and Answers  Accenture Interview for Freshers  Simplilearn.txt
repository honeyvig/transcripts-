so hurry up now and join the course the
course link is mentioned in the
description box so guys let's start with
our first question that is what is the
significance of using objects in oops
programming as compared to procedural
programming now as we all know that
objects provide a way to model real
world entities and their interactions
with software unlike in procedural
programming where functions manipulate
data in objectoriented programming it
encapsulates data and behavior into the
objects this makes code more modular
organized and easier to understand and
also maintain objects promote
reusability scalability and flexibility
in software development so this was all
about significance of objects in OBS
programming language this is one of the
basic question and can be expected to be
a starting question in your interview
now let's move on to the next question
so our next question is also kind of
very basic it says explain the concept
of class with an example now guys as we
all know that class is like a blueprint
that defines the properties and
behaviors of the objects consider the
class car it defines characteristics
such as color model speed behaviors such
as driving and stopping each car object
created from this class will have its
own unique State like the color and
model and behavior like driving and
stopping but they all share the same
structure defined by the car class so
this was one of the basic example if
somebody asks you what is class and
explain it with example you can quote
this example now let's move on to our
third question that is how does
encapsulation helps in managing
complexity in software development so
guys encapsulation is the bundling of
data means attributes and methods that
operate on the data into single unit
that's object it hides the internal
state of an object and restricts the
direct access to it allowing it for
better control over data access and
manipulation encapsulation helps manage
complexity by providing a clear
interface for interacting with objects
reducing the risk of unintended data
modification and making it easier to
maintain and refactor the code now let's
move on to our next example that is
provide an example of encapsulation in
Java so guys we all know that in Java
encapsulation is achieved using access
modifiers like public private and
protected for example a class might have
private Fields like attributes such as
name age and public methods like
behaviors like get name and set name to
access and modify these fields this
ensures that the internal state of the
object is protected from direct external
access and also maintaining
encapsulation so in this way you can
just quote the example now I will show
you an one example by putting up a code
and you can also show a code or dictate
a code to your interviewer so guys let's
say we create a class called
public and let's name it as person
okay now let us create a private
variables to hold the data now I will
have the data such as name and age
so
private the data type for name is
string okay next can be your age
so the data type will be
int now let us create a Constructor to
initialize the object so our class name
is person so we can just create our
Constructor something like this so
public
person and just add those arguments so
string name and int age and finally here
what you can do guys that you can bind
it up like this do
name equals to
name
and this. AG equals to age
and then what you can do guys is create
Getters and Setters
okay so in this way our half of the work
is done okay now what will be the
Getters and Setters so I'll show you
once so it would
be say
public string get
name and here we can say okay let us
return the
name and for the setup we can write
something like this public
void set
name and
here you can name String
name and similarly you can just
set the name as this do name equals to
name and similarly you have to create it
for the age okay so I have created it
for the name
okay and similarly just create it for
the
each now finally just create the object
okay so
say public static
void
main
string
okay and let us create the object as
person P equals to new
person and finally you can add these
things so say the name
as Neil and say age as
80 and finally just you can print this
system
out. print Len and
finally just add P
dot so this shows an example of
encapsulation this was kind of lenier
but you can dictate this to your
interviewer and I think so
it would be perfect answer to show that
you are clear with the concept of
encapsulation now let us proceed for the
next question that is what is
inheritance and how does it promotes
code reuse so guys as we all know that
inheritance is a key Concept in
objectoriented programming that allows
class like a subclass or derived class
to inherit properties and behaviors from
another class that's called super class
this promotes code reu by allowing the
subass to reuse the code or methods and
variables defined in the super class so
this is how it promotes the code
reusability a very easy question now let
us move on to the next question so guys
our next question is describe a real
world scenario where inheritance would
be beneficial now as we all know that
inheritance allows class to inherit the
properties and behavior of another class
and it promotes the code reuse by
enabling the subass to inherit the
properties and functionality from their
super classes this kind of reduces
redundancy improves maintainability and
facilitates the creation of specialized
classes that builds upon the existing
functionality now you can quote an
example something like this that we can
consider modeling different type of
vehicles the super class vehicle could
contain common attributes like color
speed and behaviors like start and stop
subclasses like car and truck and
motorcycle would inherit from the
vehicle and add their specific
attributes and behaviors such as number
of doors for cars cargo capacity for
trucks so in this way you can describe a
real world scenario that makes the use
of inheritance now let us move on to the
next question so guys our next question
is what is polymorphism and how does it
improves flexibility in programming so
guys we all know that polymorphism is a
fundamental Concept in objectoriented
programming that allows objects of
different types to be treated as objects
of common super class it enables a
single interface to represent multiple
underlying data types providing
flexibility in programming basically
there are two types of polymorphism the
first one is compile time polymorphism
and the second one is runtime
polymorphism so if I talk about compile
time polymorphism it occurs when
multiple methods in the same class have
same number but different parameter list
the compiler determines which method to
call based on the method signature
whereas method overloading allows for
flexibility in method invocation as when
the appropriate method is chosen based
on the number of arguments provided if I
talk about the runtime polymorphism
basically also known as method
overriding it occurs when a subclasses
provides a specific implementation of a
method that is already defined in the
super class at run time the jvm
determines which method to execute based
on the actual type of the object method
overriding also allows for flexibility
in method Behavior as different subass
can provide their own implementations of
the same method now polymorphisms
improve flexibility in programming in
many ways like code reusability then
extensibility and also enhance
abstraction so this makes the answer
complete for this question I hope so you
would have got a brief idea regarding
poly morphism and the types of
polymorphism involved in it now let's
move on to our next question so guys our
next question is given an example of
polymorphism using method overwriting so
guys let us code this question so what
I'm going to do let us create a class
called animal okay and we'll make a
method like sound and we'll try to make
it like print that animal makes sound
then we're going to create a subass of
the animal that is dog and we are going
to override the make sound method okay
so let us directly deep dive into that
okay so let us create our parent class
first so let's say
class
animal okay then let's create a method
so I'll
say public void Mak
sound okay and I can just print certain
thing like
okay so I printed certain thing like
this now let us create a inherited class
okay or a child class so let's see that
we can say like class animal Okay so
class dog and it
extends okay this is uh this keyword
demonstrate that we are using
inheritance right now and we can say it
directly inherits from the class animal
now what we are going to do right now
that we are going to override this
method called Mak sound so let's use
that annotation
and let's copy this method and paste it
right over
here okay and in this what we can do we
can override it
say now let us create the objects so
I'll say that this is our main method so
I'll just write the short form pvsm okay
and okay now
say
dog D equals to new
dog and we can just call here like
system
and we can just uh call this method
called me sound so D dot uh make sound
method pretty fine so this shows the
example of how method writing is
done
okay and we are using inheritance in
this so I hope so you got a brief idea
regarding this so guys let's start with
the next question it says explain the
importance of access modifiers in
controlling access to the class members
so guys as we all know that access
modifiers play a very crucial role in
controlling access to the class members
like Fields methods Constructors in Java
they Define the visibility and
accessibility of the class members
within and outside the class ensuring
proper encapsulation and maintaining the
integrity of the class implementation
the importance of access modifiers lies
in several key aspects like
encapsulation data hiding and security
so these were some of the importance of
access modifiers I hope so you would
have got a brief idea regarding this now
let's move on to our next question that
says what is the difference between
public private and protected access
modifiers so guys the difference between
public private and protected access mod
modifiers lies in the visibility and
accessibility of the class members now
if I talk about Public public members
are accessible from any other class or
packages they have the widest scope of
visibility allowing them to be accessed
from anywhere in the program and if we
talk about protected guys protected
members are accessible within the same
class subclasses and class within the
same package they provide more
visibility than the private members but
restrict access from the class outside
the package now if you talk about the
private members private members are
accessible only within the same class
they are hidden from other classes
restricting access to the class internal
implementation details very basic
difference between the three I hope so
you have got an idea regarding this now
let's move on and discuss our next
question so guys our next question is
how do Constructors contribute to object
initialization in Java very amazing
question
and this has a high probability to be
asked in the interview so guys as we all
know that Constructors play a very
critical role in object initialization
in Java by setting up the initial state
of an object when the object is created
using the new keyword a new Constructor
is called to allocate the memory for the
new object and to initialize its field
so it sets up the initial values then
what it does guys it provides overloaded
Constructors Java allows Constructors to
be overloaded enabling the creation of
objects with different initial States
depending on the Constructor used
suppose if I have a class called person
and I declare the fields such as private
string name and private int age now if I
create a default Constructor like public
person and I bind it up like this do
name and set the state to unknown and
this do age equals to zero so in this
way I'm setting the initial state of the
given arguments so these are all the
behaviors which are going to be set in
our object when it is going to get
initialized similarly you can put a
parameterized Constructor like suppose
public person and inside this you put
string name in age now bind it up after
binding just create the getter Setters
and after that when you are creating the
object like person one and person two
then you can add like name and age so in
this way you're going to get an output
because whenever you are trying to print
out the object name do given getter like
get name or get age so your output is
going to get printed out so suppose in
this case guys if I try to print out uh
person one dot say get age so it's going
to print like 30 because uh 30 is the
stage which I put it up so just an
overview of it in this way you can
explain this question question but
basically setting up an initial State
and also providing overloaded
Constructors are the two main reasons
that they contribute to the object
initialization now let's move on to the
next question so guys our next question
is explain the different types of
inheritance very fundamental question
and can be asked most of the time so
guys in object-oriented programming
language inheritance allows a class to
inherit the properties and behavior from
the another class there are very several
type of inheritance so the first one is
single inheritance if I talk about
single inheritance in this scenario a
class is going to inherit from one and
only one super class next one we have is
multiple inheritance here in this
scenario a class can inherit from more
than one super class so guys we all know
that Java does not support multiple
inheritance because of the ambiguity so
this can be achieved only through
interfaces next one we have all over
here is multi-level inheritance in this
scenario a class is derived from another
class which is also derived from another
class creating a chain of inheritance
like you can see all over here so super
class subass one derived and there is
subclass 2 and finally you have the
Hybrid inheritance so in the case of
Hybrid inheritance you get to see that
two classes are derived from a super
class and one class is derived from two
super classes so you get a chance to see
a scenario of Hybrid inheritance now
here in the hierar where you have one
super class and three different
subclasses are derived from one super
class but this is a scenario for your
hierarchy so these were some of the
different type of inheritance you can
explain to your interviewer now let's
move on to the next question so guys our
next question is what is the default
Constructor and when does it gets
invoved so guys the default Constructor
in Java is no argument Constructor that
automatically is provided by the
compiler if no other Constructors are
explicitly defined in a class it
initializes the object with default
values so this is all about default
Constructor now let's move on and
discuss about the next question our next
question is describe a situation where
you can use method overloading so like
very simple guys uh whenever we want to
use method overloading so so suppose in
a scenario where you are creating uh a
calculator and you have created a method
certain thing like addition and where
you are generally returning a plus b now
you have overloaded the given method and
added the third argument like in the
first one we took two arguments A and B
and we were returning two and we were
returning the sum of the two and in the
third one we can see it is returning the
three arguments means the sum of of the
three arguments like a plus b plus C so
this is situation which is using the
method overloading very simple example
you can demonstrate this example to tell
that you are aware of the concept of
method overloading now let's move on and
discuss the next question so guys next
question is what is the role of static
methods in Java and how do they differ
from instance method so guys we all know
that static methods in Java belong to
the class rather than any specific
instance meaning that they can be called
without creating an object of the class
they're defined using the static keyword
instance method on the other hand
require an object of the class to be
created and called upon the object so
Guys these were some of the role of the
static methods now if I talk about the
key differences the first one is Axis
static methods are called using the
class name while instance method are
called using the objects the second one
comes on the context static methods
cannot access instance variable or
instance method me directly because they
do not operate on an instance of the
class third one is usage static methods
are used for operations that do not
require data from then instant like
utility or helper methods so this were
one of the basic answer to this question
now let's move on to the next question
so guys our next question is give an
example of a situation where you would
use a static method so guys a common
situation where you can use a static
method is when Crea in utility or helper
methods that perform general purpose
task that do not require any data from
the instance of the class for example
consider a utility class that provides
mathematical operation so say you create
a class called math utils and you have
the static method to calculate the
square of a number so here public static
in square in number and just you can
return number cross number so again you
can create a static method to calculate
the factorial similarly static int
factorial and you take a number n and
finally you take a for Loop and result
the multiplication of the given chain of
numbers so that's how you return the
factorial I hope so you are aware of the
logic like how would you create a method
for factorial now finally in this
scenario what we are doing that we are
creating a certain helper class and uh
in a situation we are creating a static
method so while uh you know printing the
factorial or in the scenario or
basically printing the square so I have
created all these two static method and
they are helping me out so in this
situation you can use the static method
so I hope so you have got an idea
regarding this it's also one of the most
important questions so please take a
look on this one now let's move on to
the next question so guys our next
question is what is a concept of
abstraction and its relevance in
software development so guys if I talk
about abstraction abstraction in
software development is a concept of
hiding complex implementation details of
a system and exposing only the essential
features and functionalities to the user
this is achieved by creating abstract
classes and interfaces that Define what
actions can be performed but not how
they are performed so this is a basic
idea regarding abstraction I hope so you
have got a brief idea regarding this now
let's move on and discuss us about next
question so one of the most frequently
Asked question uh it says what a
difference between method and
Constructor in Java now I know many of
you get confused when this question is
asked so in this way you can answer this
question so guys in Java methods and
Constructors are both integral part of
the classes but they serve kind of
distinct purposes a method is a block of
code that performs a specific task and
can be invoked multiple times within a
class
methods can have return types and
parameters allowing for flexibility and
code reuse on the other hand if I talk
about Constructor it is a special type
of method that is used to utilize
objects of a class Constructors are
invoked automatically when an object is
created and are responsible for setting
initial values to the object attributes
unlike methods Constructors do not have
return types and their names must match
with the class name so this is the basic
difference between methods and and
Constructors now let's move on and
discuss the next question so guys our
next question is can an abstract class
have a Constructor so the answer to the
same question is yes guys an abstract
class can have a Constructor and the
purpose of the Constructor in an
abstract class is like to initialize the
common Properties or perform setup tasks
that are required by the subclasses so
this was the answer to this question
very tricky question and please take a
note of the this one now let's move on
to the next question that is can an
abstract class have static methods if
yes then provide an example where this
might be useful so guys yes abstract
classes can have static methods and
static methods in abstract class can
provide utility functions or behavior
that is not tied to the particular any
instance of the class these methods can
be called directly on the class itself
without the need to instantiate an
object so for example here is a
scenario so guys let us create an
abstract class called
shape and
say let's create public
static here I'm going to create a double
and in this I'll say let's calculate the
area okay now here you give the argument
say double and say
radius you can return
here math.pi or you can give 22 by7 and
just multiply
radius cross
radius now what do you have to do next
let us create a static method to
calculate the parameter so if I talk
about the same so here you can create
certain thing like this public static
okay
and double so charger charge charger
charger laptop
so guys here what you can do uh let's
create public static double and say
calculate
perimeter and in this what I can take
radius as the
argument
and
written to cross
m.p star radius okay so this is a thing
and so you can see all over here we have
created a these two
stuff so in our abstract class we have
created two itic methods now let's try
to create a class called
Circle and it will extend the abstra
class shape the class Circle
extends say
shape okay now
so I have declared a variable called
radius okay then create a Constructor
all over
here so I won't create it just I leave
you to do it okay now next what you can
do all over here in the main method okay
so
pbsm
string augs
okay what I can do I can create an
object of circle so
say Circle
C equals
to New
Circle and here you can give the radius
so suppose I give as five okay so after
that what you can do guys you can call
the method such as
system.out
do print Len
and you can calculate the area plus the
perimeter how with the name of the
method so our object is C the C dot you
can just call this
method
and C Dot calculate parameter so in this
way guys it going to calculate the
entire thing for our area and the
perameter provided we have given our
radius so this example shows that
abstract classes can have static methods
very important question uh please do
take a look on this now let's move on to
our next question next question says is
it possible for an abstract class to
have final methods and the answer is yes
it is possible for an abstract class to
have final methods like a final method
in an abstract class cannot be
overridden by its sub classes which
ensures that it behaviors remains
consistent across all the sub classes so
one of the very important questions and
it is generally asked in the interview
so please take a note of this one so
guys let us discuss the next question so
guys our next question is that can
abstract class Implement an interface
without providing implementations for
all its meth methods and the answer is
yes an abstract class can Implement an
interface without providing
implementations for all its methods
however in this scenario the abstract
class itself must be declared as
abstract meaning it does not have to
provide implementations for all the
methods defined in the interface the
subclasses of the abstract class will
then be responsible for implementing the
remaining interface methods let's move
on to the next question so guys our next
question is is what happens if abstract
class does not contain any abstract
methods very amazing question and the
answer to the same is like if an
abstract class does not contain any
abstract methods it behaves similarly to
a regular class however because it is
declared as an abstract it cannot be
instantiated directly instances of
concrete subclasses of the abstract
class can be created but there is no
requirement for these subclasses to
provide implementations for these
methods so this is the answer to this
question now let's move on to the next
question so guys our next question is
can you create an instance of an
abstract class so guys the answer to the
same is no you cannot create an instance
of an abstract class directly in Java
attempting to instantiate an abstract
class using the new keyword will result
in a compilation error so this is one of
the thing and the purpose of an abstract
class is to serve as a blue print for
the other classes to extend and
implement it typically contains one or
more abstract methods than the must be
implemented by its sub classes so this
is the overall scenario of this now let
us discuss the next question the next
question is how do abstract classes
support polymorphism So guys if I talk
about the abstract classes supporting
polymorphism in Java It Is by allowing
subclasses to provide their own
implementations for the abstract method
while still being treated as instances
of the abstract class this means that
you can use a reference to the abstract
class to refer to the objects of his sub
classes and the polymorphic behavior is
exhibited when invoking overridden
methods so this is the answer to this
question now let's move on and discuss
the next question so guys our next
question is can an abstract class have
private methods and why would you use a
private method in an abstract class so
guys answer to this question is yes an
abstract class can have private methods
in Java private methods in an abstract
class are not inherited by sub classes
and they are also not accessible outside
the abstract class itself however they
can still be used within other methods
of the same abstract class so guys this
is the answer to this question now why
should we use a private method in an
abstract class the first reason is code
organization private methods help
organize the implementation details of
the abstract class by encapsulating
certain functionality that is not meant
to be accessed or overridden by the sub
classes next one is code reusability
private methods can be reused within the
abstract class itself reducing the code
duplication and promoting
maintainability third one is
implementation detail private methods
can represent implementation details or
helper methods that are not part of the
public interface pH of the abstract
class but are necessary for its proper
functioning so this was the answer to
this question I hope so you would have
got a brief idea regarding this now
let's move on to the next question so
guys our next question is how would you
design an abstract class to ensure that
certain methods must be implemented by
all subclasses but other methods still
have a default implementation first
let's try to understand this question it
is basically asking you you to design an
abstract class and here you have to
ensure that all the methods or like
certain methods must be implemented by
all the sub classes but other methods
also should have default
implementation so like we did uh let us
think of the answer to this solution uh
say we create an abstract class called
shape and uh we have an abstract method
that must be implemented by the sub
classes so say we create an public
abstract double calculate area okay and
this is abstract method now in order to
provide a default implementation for the
method okay so that it can be
overwritten I create another method like
public string get color and I return the
given color say like blue agree then I
provide a default implementation for the
method that subclasses can inherit so
public void display info and uh like
here I am basically printing the get
color okay now finally when you create
another class which is child of this and
here you can override with the public
string get color and here you can change
the color from Blue to Red so this way
you can do it and this is one of the way
where you can design abstract class so
that you can ensure that all the classes
are implemented by the other methods so
guys I have given you a brief idea
regarding this question I'm not showing
you the code of this question
and you should try this question by
yourself give it to the thought uh try
for 5 10 minutes and if you're not
getting it write down a comment on this
video and we'll definitely get back to
you now let us move on to the next
question so guys our next question is
can an abstract class inherit from
another abstract class A very
interesting question and the answer is
yes an abstract class can inherit from
another abstract class this allows
basically for hierarchial abstraction
where each abstract class can Define
their own set of abstract method to be
implemented by the sub classes now let's
move on to the next question and the
next question is pretty interesting one
it says how do abstract classes handle
Constructors in an inheritance chain so
guys in an inheritance change involving
abstract classes Constructors are
basically called in a top down manner
like starting from the super class down
to the subass here each of the
Constructor initializes the respective
class State before passing control to
the next Constructor in the chain like
suppose if I say if I have a class
abstract animal and I create a default
Constructor like public animal and just
print out certain thing in inside this
that animal Constructor now I create an
abstract class called mammal and it is
extending animal so I create a
Constructor public mammal and I just
print out in this system do out. printel
in like mammal Constructor now similarly
you can create another class called dog
and it is extending the mammal okay now
I create a Constructor for this it says
public dog and I'm printing out this
Constructor so similarly when I'm trying
to create an object of dog okay so the
output which I'm going to get is first
the animal Constructor okay then the
mammal Constructor and then the dog
Constructor so the top down approach is
always there uh guys it's a pretty much
of a tricky question okay so give a
thought on this one so guys our next
question is can an abstract class be
final why or why not so guys the answer
to this question is no an abstract class
cannot be final because it's meant to be
extended by sub classes to provide
concrete implementation for its abstract
methods making an abstract class Final
would prevent inheritance and and
contradicting its purpose so it's not
possible most of the time interviewers
ask this question to make the candidate
you know confused so if it is asked in
your interview please do remember the
answer of this question now let's move
on and discuss the next question so guys
our next question is why might you
choose to use abstract class instead of
an interface even though both can Define
methods that subclasses need to
implement very tricky question and it
can trouble you a little bit so the
answer to the same question is guys that
you might choose an abstract class
instead of an interface like when you
want to provide a partial implementation
of the functionality that the subclasses
can inherit if I talk about abstract
classes abstract classes can have member
variables Constructors and non-abstract
methods they provide more flexibility
and code reuse compared to the
interfaces so guys our next question is
what is the difference between inner
join left join right join and full outer
join so guys the answer to the same
question is that first one is inner join
so guys as you can see in this diagram
that inner join returns a row when there
is at least one match in the both tables
if I talk about the left join it returns
all the rows from the left table and
match the rows from the right
table if I talk about the right join
right join returns all the rows from the
right table and the Matched rows from
the left table if I talk about the full
outer join it returns all the rows even
when there is no match in the table now
let's move on and discuss the next
question that is what are the difference
between union and Union all so guys if I
talk about Union so Union combines the
result of two or more selected
statements removing the duplicates
whereas Union all also combines results
but retains the the duplicates let's
discuss the next question that is how
can you optimize a SQL query that uses
multiple joints and
subqueries so guys you can optimize a
SQL query with multiple joints and
subqueries using indexes on join columns
limiting the result set with wear
Clauses and ensuring that subqueries are
efficient and return the necessary data
now let's discuss the next question that
is how do Group by and having Clause
work with SQL so guys we all know that
group by groups rows that have same
values into the summary rowes and having
filter groups based on specified
conditions Let's us discuss the next
question that is explain the concept of
normalization and what are the different
normal forms and why is normalization
important so guys first answer to the
same that is normalization is a process
of organizing data in a database
efficient
the different normal forms like 1f 2 NF
3nf bcnf are there they are used to
eliminate the redundancy and dependency
issues improving the data integrity and
reducing the anomalies now let's move on
and discuss the next question that is
what is the difference between truncate
delete and drop statements in SQL so
guys if I talk about truncate truncate
removes all the rows from the table
without logging individual row deletions
if I talk about about delete delete
removes the specific rows and drop
deletes an entire table or database
object now let's move on and discuss the
next question that is what is a stored
procedure so guys a stored procedure is
a pre-compiled set of SQL statements
stored in a database it can accept
parameters execute SQL queries and
return results enhancing the performance
and security next question very
important it says explain the concept
concepts of trigger in SQL so guys a
trigger in a SQL is a special type of
stored procedure that automatically
executes when certain events occur such
as insert update delete operations on
the table triggers are used to enforce
business rules maintain data integrity
and automate the task with this we have
come to the end of our question that is
what are the security considerations
when using stored procedures and
triggers in a database so guys very
amazing question and it's a kind of
practical one so the answer to the same
is that security considerations when
using stored procedures and triggers
includes such as parameter validation to
prevent SQL injection attacks proper
permissions to restrict access to the
sensitive data or operations and also
auditing to track changes made by stored
procedures and triggers additionally
using parameterized queries and limiting
privileges can help mitigate the
security risk so guys that was all for
