hi winners hope you're doing good so
this is Dr strian from Team MDS conquer
now I'll be discussing uh the pattern of
reading and how to approach the upcoming
subjects in your schedule the subjects
the subject the main subject
is prosto integrated with most of the
dental
materials so normally if you just
consider DM okay okay so I I regularly
split DM into three parts okay part one
part two and part three so part one is
mainly inclined with
prosto like you see uh most of most like
more than half of your DM that is 50%
more than 50 percentage of TM is
integrated with prosthetics and the next
one is conservative okay you see like
more than 30% of your dental materials
is integrated with conservative that is
the common topics will be there uh you
see your Composites you see your amalgam
direct filling Golds Dental cements so
you see like more than 30% is integrated
with operator and more than 50% is
integrated with prosthetic part that is
your impression materials Investments
casting casting procedures casting
defects you see your dental waxes uh you
see your gypsum gypsum products there
are lots of things like casting Ceramics
and all these are like common topics for
both DM as well as for Prosthetics and
the leftover is others that is your DM
related to your ortho DM related to your
pedo so the leftover is going to uh be
in the zone of 15 to uh 20% is so it's
better like uh it is better like the
schedule of MDS conquer is always in a
such a way that we try to integrate and
read the subjects together so that the
overall burden on the preparation will
drop down so now in the upcoming coming
few days we are going to handle both
proo in combination with the DM topics
which are related to Prosthetics that is
the game plan and I hope you're ready
for this so I just give a brief glance
that what we are going to do in the
upcoming few
days so the next uh very important
aspect uh is about uh the areas the
areas and how many marks does
Prosthetics or DM is going to carry so
most of you are planning to give two
important examinations okay one is going
to be your
uh neat
MDS uh and according to the blueprint of
neat MDS that is given by nbe people so
they have clearly mentioned in Part B
that your uh Prosthetics is going to
carry 14 marks okay right and if you
talk about the next exam that most of us
have planned to give is your iron e
which will be two rounds one will be in
the November session and the next one
will be in the May session so and the
marks that are allocated for Prosthetics
will vary from year to year when you're
uh when you're Keen in observing the
inct question papers that ranges from uh
18 to sorry 10 to 18 in the range
sometimes it will be low sometimes it
will be too high okay but uh the overall
I'll be considering it as uh 15 as a
mean value okay so these are the proo
scores in your neat MDS as well as in
your inic that that is around like 14 to
15 you can consider it as in general 14
to 15 mcqs will be from
Prosthetics and when I'm talking about
the DM which is now integrated so
normally DM is going to carry 14 marks
according to nbe blueprint but now we
are focusing only on half of the DM that
is let it be like half 50 percentage of
the DM which is related to proo part so
I'll be adding seven marks okay in an
around like seven marks uh and inct yes
of course it will be almost in the same
range okay so I'll keep it as 7 7 so the
overall things that we are going to do
in the upcoming few days is going to be
14 + 7 that is going to be 21 to 24 so
you know that right your in C is for 200
mcqs whereas your neat is going to be
for 240
mcqs and in the upcoming few days in the
upcoming few weeks like 3 to four weeks
you're going to do 10 percentage of your
entire syllabus like you see inct let's
consider as 20 marks you're doing so in
is going to be 10% days and if you're
talking about NB NE So you you're
roughly carrying like 23 to 24 or 22 to
24 so it's almost equal to 10 percentage
of your syllabus will be integrated to
the prosthetic integration part of your
DM so prosto integrated topics of DM
together is going to carry 10 percentage
of your score in the final exam and of
course it's a dental subject familiar
subject so most of you like an interns
who has done this subject few months
back maybe repeater who is taking the
exam for the second time has done this
subject like few months back like few
like an Year back okay so you're
comfortable when compared to a subject
of like General and art or biochemistry
which was done in the first BDS I feel
like people are more comfortable with
the Prosthetics okay right so this is a
rough glance that we are going to do 10%
is of the syllabus of your inic and the
need in the upcoming 3 weeks that is
proo with DM so topics to be done okay
so topics to be done and the rough
schedule is this so first we are going
to start with prosthetics and that two
we are going to start with the topic
which is more comfortable for you
because you do more practical oriented
stuff in your BDS final year Let It Be
an internship is most of CDs complete D
but whatever rpds we do we do is not a
real RPD so RPD part is going to be
difficult so whatever ever we do
practical wise is different and whatever
we do Theory wise is different so
definitely RPD is going to take more
time okay but CD is going to be taking
less time because the Practical part and
the theory part will be same so it is
easy for you to understand and read so
what I have done is I have allocated
four
days uh for your CD and followed by one
extra day for your pre-prosthetic
surgeries as well as maxo facial process
why I want to add a three star
uh Max ofcial processes after covid-19
you see more number of micosis cases I'm
not very sure about your college in
specific but you see like most of your
government dental colleges okay right
you see uh there is a bulk of uh maxal
process cases for your postgraduates in
the
Departments that is basically due to the
uh mucom micosis so mucom micosis is a
complication which is seen in covid
individuals so you have more such cases
and the best alternative is a maxal
process so nowadays you see uh a regular
question on a maxal process compared to
few years back and this topic is is is
most oftenly ignored in most of uh most
of your McQ books so that is the reason
why I have added a three star so
pre-prosthetic surgeries which is an
integrated part of
your oral surgery that is covered in
oral surgery also uh and maof facial
processes is a topic which is more
important after covid-19 so I have
allocated one special day to handle this
maxo facial process along with the
pre-prosthetic surgeries then I have
given a 3 days plan for your fpd fpd is
more comfortable I see like according to
me uh the most comfortable subtopic in
your Prosthetics is going to be your
fixed partial danger fpd is going to be
so easy you can understand and you can
you can finish it as quick as possible
this is going to be the most comfortable
topic okay right and then jumps is the
most difficult part then it's going to
to be your RPD is going to be difficult
part so I have given four days one extra
day for an RPD but I'll try my best to
explain the things in the most easiest
in the simplest way so that we can
handle and finish the things fast
understand the things fast to get a
better score in the examination followed
by a five star Topic in our proo uh
which is integrated to other subjects
like implants is integrated to your uh
uh oral surgery implants is integrated
to your pero you see like lots of of
stuff related to implants will be there
in your pero and implants apart from Pro
is integrated to DM because all the
basic characteristic futures or the
things of titanium gradings of titanium
uh what happens with the titanium
everything will be discussed in your
dental materials because that's a
material titanium is a material that is
used in dentistry for an implant so it
will be a part of your DM also okay so
implants I have given two days so we
will try to cover uh the most important
areas and the frequent areas and the
concepts of the implants so this is a
plan of prosto I have splitted the proo
into
CD uh preprosthetic
plus your uh maof
facial then uh I have given
fpd and I have given
RPD and the last one is I have I have
planned for implants okay so these are
the major subtopics uh where your uh the
pra has been splitted so then I'll be
talking about DM uh which is more more
inclined to proo so I have given the
physical properties that the first
chapter all your coefficient of thermal
expansion your compressive strengths
different types of materials uh your
concepts of surface energies so there
are lots of things like uh contact
angles lots of Concepts which are very
very interesting okay because uh you see
like DM DM is more of a memory based
subject but the first chapter is a is a
solidly a concept oriented aspect how
the stress strain graph and what is
going to happen what is toughness so all
these are going to be so interesting
okay so the first two days we are going
to cover uh the physical properties of
dental materials then we'll be jumping
into impression materials and gypsum
products for the next two days in which
we are going to cover agar in detail
alginate in detail and all the aroic
impression materials that four
impression materials we are going to
handle okay that is for the next two
days and followed
by uh the next two days we are going to
handle the metal
as well as Ceramics Ceramics is a very
very important topic mety is a very very
important topic where the questions are
very frequently repeated from these
areas even if you see the recent neat
examination that is neat MDS 2023 are
ready to be the recent in you have so
many questions on these areas and all
the minor topics like you see like d
material is a minor topic which can be
done in half an hour dental waxes is a
short topic casting missions casting
procedures casting defects investment
materials soldering welding brazing
finishing polishing all these are minor
topics okay and most of the topics will
take less
than uh 30 minutes of your time the
Smart Video is going to take less than
30 minutes of your time so then I have
planned a 3 days uh
revision 3 days revision for you and we
have an uh a neat pattern examination of
240 marks so that is 240 into 4 so every
right answer is going to to carry plus4
and every wrong answer is going to carry
minus one unattempted answer is going to
carry zero so this is a rough uh plan of
action of the pra integrated to DM okay
right so this is out and coming to the
checklist like what what are the major
things that you have to keep in your
head uh when are talking about this
particular subject okay so must do or
mandatory to do the first one is uh like
your uh power
playbooks one okay as of enough if you
don't have access to the pp books I
strongly recommend you to go with
the dental pulse synopsis okay meanwhile
because there are few people the books
will take a delivery time of 7 days at
least after after you after your part of
MDS coner so meanwhile you can start
with the dental P synopsis not an issue
the second one is
the smart videos on the
website okay right the third one
is your
uh your topic
specific
exams on the
website or you can solve the uh
questions for practice from any of the
McQ
books either Dental pulse or
dentist or both sometimes okay but uh I
initially strongly recommend you to
start with one book then if you're fine
then you can have the second book so
because like uh Inns may have uh may not
have a flexibility of time but if you a
repeater strongly recommend you to solve
more mcqs to keep two books first start
with one and end with other okay and
plan the revision for both but an
intern I don't want to keep it as a
standardized but if an intern is able to
manage the time reading two books is
very safe okay because the accuracy will
be more the practice will be more if not
you can keep one book as a primary
source and the second book as a
secondary source okay right then uh
evening we are going to have a short
activity that will be on the
WhatsApp and it will be for 30 minutes
time where we are going to discuss some
diagrams some Concepts some confusion
aspects some content directly from
textbook reading something will be done
okay so this is a this is a main
checklist that you have to uh make a
note and uh for example if you're if
you're a if you're in a pro- life
student
so if you are a Prive student so PR life
student is going to have Prive
classes that will be from evening 6:00
to
8:00 so you'll be having a PR live
session maybe uh proo will be having
four
classes so it will be 8 8 to 9
hours and uh the integrated part of DM
uh maybe we may plan two or three
classes so it's going to turn around
like four to 5 hours so this is an extra
part that the prol students are going to
have a live interaction with a worksheet
so they'll be given a they'll be given a
worksheet of uh of questions and the
mentor is going to take a class of 2
hours along with the solving the
worksheet so Mentor is going to make you
to solve the worksheet in the live
session even if you miss the live
session uh because of some commitments
or because of ill health or something so
PR life students will get access to to
the um uh to the recorded version of
this Pro live classes also okay so
that's going to be an add-on okay so
coming to the sequence like if you ask
me the sequence these are the mandatory
things that you have to do during the
first reading but if you ask me the
sequence okay the sequence goes like
this okay uh I want you to start with
smart video on the website first so
because like I'm not very sure like uh
how far you are good with the concept
and how far you are good with the
subject maybe if you're uh if you're a
Topper if you have done very well or
extraordinary then maybe the concepts
may be strong so it will be easy for you
to understand but considering a below
average student or considering a student
like me okay so I strongly recommend you
to start with a smart video because
Smart Video is going to give you a good
glance of the important areas a good
glance of the concepts a good glance of
the content straight away from the
standard textbook so this is this
concept is more important so it acts as
a uh basement like for example like if
you're building uh if you're building a
stairs okay for example like stair 1 2 3
4 like 10 stairs you building the most
important thing in this building is the
basement so basement will be laid by the
smart video okay laid by the smart video
and and I strongly recommend students
don't write heavy heavy notes when
you're watching the smart video for the
first time so don't write the running
notes when you're watching the video
smart video for the first time so when
you're watching the video smart video
for the first time try to understand the
concepts try to to understand the areas
where the mentor is stressing so there
by which you can understand what are the
important areas and you can understand
the
concept so once you understand the
concept then you can write a short notes
if you're writing a running notes the
running notes is going to be too heavy
but if you're writing a short notes
after understanding the entire topic
then the things will be easy for you to
read and understand because Smart Video
will be available for you throughout
your preparation time the same video
will be there okay we don't have a time
limit like few other apps which has a
time limit that you can watch once or
twice we don't have such time limit so
whenever you want to access a smart
video Smart Video will be there for you
okay I don't want you to write heavy
heavy notes okay right just try to move
on and try to understand understand the
concepts build building the basement is
more important when you're watching the
smart video so my first checklist is
Smart Video then I want you to uh I mean
I want you to jump into the second
checklist that is your
uh your dental pulse synopsis or your PP
book synopsis part maybe PP books is
going to have a combination of uh mcqs
plus synopsis okay but I want you to
check more on the synopsis part okay so
there's a customized condensed synopsis
part so that you can understand the
things very easily okay so this is
second thing third thing I want you to
solve the mcqs okay of of the particular
topic like you you have started a
particular topic solve the mcqs from any
of these two sources both of this try to
solve the mcqs understand the mcqs then
fourth one is I want you to attend the
evening activity some or other things
will be like like an add-on like evening
activity is something like uh it's going
to make your preparation more
comfortable it's going to make your
preparation more athetic like something
like evening activity of half an hour or
40 minutes is something like a finishing
and polishing on your restoration so you
do everything cutting cavity is
something like in watching a smart video
then you you uh you finish the cavity
then then you start mixing uh the cement
or filling the composite curing and
everything is done final part is like uh
the add-on like the finishing and
polishing will be done by your WhatsApp
activity and finally a topic specific
exam is going to tell you means your
Mentor is going to tell you and check
and he's going to give a rating out of
10 how far your registration looks and
he's going to approve the registration
so that approving of registration
getting a rating or getting a score is
giving a topic specific exam right so
this is the fifth part so this sequence
I want you to follow okay but uh I told
you right uh it's always uh important
that we have to follow the rule of 21
days okay so anything new anything new
pattern the approach of reading is new
uh the understanding the concepts is new
okay so maybe Theory exam approach is
different vaa approach is different but
reading for an entrance examination let
it be a neat Let It Be an in or you're
planning to go for inbd or you're
planning to go clear the the
international license exams whatever it
is the approach of reading for an McQ
based exam is going to be different I
hope this video is useful okay so let's
start proo and dm with a positive
mindset if you have any doubts or
concerns uh you can always uh open to
Ping us on our uh regular WhatsApp uh
numbers so that we will come in touch
with you if you want to have a
pre-preparation talk before you start
your proceedings for the preparation we
are always open you can ping us uh block
a particular slot of five or 10 minutes
so the mentors are here open to talk
with the students before they start
their preparation or if you have any ups
and downs in the preparation you're
always open to interact with your uh
mentors okay so by the time we finish
this uh DM in combination with
prosthetics I feel I strongly believe
that your seniors are going to finish
their final exam and maybe from next
exam the 100 percentage of focus of all
the mentors of Team MDS con will be on
you so this month is a golden month of
transformation okay because things will
get speed up things will get more
focused we may start reaching you we may
start interacting with you more okay and
the team has planned to reach you uh in
your respective colleges uh few of you
in their respective colleges and we are
planning to interact with you to make it
more effective and more impactful okay
so as of now signing off uh Dr Shan from
Team MDS conquer take care study well
and all the best
