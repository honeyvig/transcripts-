hey everyone welcome to another video by
simply learn in this video we will look
at typescript interview questions if you
are planning to attend an interview on
typescript then this video will come in
handy
before we begin with the video make sure
you have subscribed to our youtube
channel and clicked on the bell icon so
you never miss an update from simply
learn so let's get started
we'll first look at beginner level
interview questions
what is typescript
typescript is an object oriented and
strongly typed programming language
which is a superset of javascript
typescript was designed by anders
hijalsberg at microsoft the limitations
of javascript for developing large-scale
applications at microsoft and among its
external customers led to the creation
of typescript because of the difficulty
of working with complicated javascript
code there was a demand for custom
tooling to make developing javascript
components easier
typescript code is converted to
javascript which can be executed
anywhere javascript is supported in the
browser or nodejs or any other
application
typescript is javascript with some
additional features to support a more
robust interaction with your editor
typescript adds additional syntax to
javascript typescript is a scripting
language that understands javascript and
uses type inference to provide powerful
capabilities without additional code
explain the features of typescript
typescript supports other javascript
libraries typescript is a new microsoft
language that is highly typed superset
of javascript with support for object
oriented programming and other current
features like decorators
because browsers and nodejs comprehend
javascript typescript compiles
javascript
typescript is portable typescript is
cross browser cross device and cross
platform it can run in any environment
that supports javascript
typescript unlike its competitors does
not require a dedicated virtual machine
or a specific runtime environment to run
typescript is superset of javascript it
is strongly syntactical that superset of
javascript with the addition of optional
static typing typescript is a
large-scale application development
language that transcompiles to
javascript existing javascript programs
are also valid typescript programs
because typescript is a superset of
javascript
typescript is static
when a client doesn't have a value for a
parameter he can personal optional
arguments are a feature of typescript
you can declare some arguments in the
function optional by utilizing optional
parameter features so that the client is
not necessary to supply a value to
optional parameters
object oriented language when it comes
to object oriented programming with
javascript typescript shines
because of the class keyword it makes
object oriented programming look quite
similar to programming in other
object-oriented languages like c-sharp
or java
what are export and import keywords in
typescript
import keyword is used to export
declaration example export star from
module and the export keyword is used to
export any variable function and type
aliases
below is the example for import keyword
and export keyword
can typescript be used for the backend
typescript can be generally used for
back-end applications by using node.js
and having additional safety that the
language brings
how to declare a variable in typescript
let and const are the two methods to
declare variables variable names can
contain alphabets and numeric digits
they cannot contain spaces and special
characters
except the underscore and the dollar
sign variable names cannot begin with a
digit so is the example code where we
have declared a variable with let method
and we have declared a variable inside a
function
list the applications of typescript
script can be used to develop javascript
applications for both client-side and
server-side execution
typescript can be deployed instead of
javascript language since it adds more
features and gives error directly with
the code typescript is used for building
large-scale applications for enterprises
how can a base constructor be called
from a child class
a base class constructor can be called
from child class using the super method
as shown in the example
what are getters and setters getters and
sectors intercept access to a member of
the object
they give us a way of having finer grain
control over how a member access each
objects a getter method starts with the
keyword get
and the sector method starts with the
keyword set
what is the purpose of
tsconfig.json file
tsconfig.json file is a json format file
in which we can specify different
options to tell the compiler how to
compile a given project this file in the
directory indicates that the directory
is the typescript project root
list the advantages of typescript
typescript highlights errors at the
compilation time during the time of
development
any browser or javascript engine can run
typescript
it has a namespace concept by defining a
module typescript supports strongly
typed or static typing typescript has
the advantages of being tightly typed or
allowing static typing
it may confirm type correctness at the
compile time because of static typing
what are rest parameters in typescript
when the number of parameters that a
function will receive is not known or
can vary we can use rest parameters we
can pass zero or more arguments to the
rest parameters the compiler will create
an array of arguments with the rest
parameter name
how to compile typescript with visual
studio code
visible studio code includes typescript
language support but does not include
the typescript compiler we need to
install the typescript compiler either
globally or in your workspace to
transpile typescript source code to
javascript the easiest way to install
typescript is through node package
manager
the node.js package manager if you have
npm installed you can install typescript
globally on your computer by using this
command npm install hyphen g type script
we can test the installed typescript by
checking the version or help
for this run the command tsc
hyphen hyphen version
list access modifier supported by
typescript typescript supports three
access modifiers
protected private
and public in protected all class
members can access them but the instance
cannot but in private it's only
accessible by members whereas in public
it is accessible by members child
classes and instance of the class
list the disadvantages of typescript the
typescript takes a long time to compile
the code typescript does not support
abstract classes
an extra compilation step for converting
typescript into javascript typescript
has overly complicated typing system
how to debug a typescript file
to debug a typescript file a dot js
source map file is needed to debug the
file
compile the dot ts file with the source
map flag for generating source map file
use the command type script tsc space
hyphen source map file dot ts source
mapping url is equal to file.js.map
how can we convert a string to a number
with typescript in typescript conversion
from a string to a number can be done
using the following commands parse int
method and we have parsefloat method
and number method
explain type aliases
type aliases give a type a new name type
aliases are similar to interfaces in
that they can be used to name primitives
unions tuples and any other kinds that
you would have to define by hand
otherwise
aliasing doesn't truly create a new type
instead it gives that type a new name
aliasing a primitive isn't very useful
however it can be used for documentation
purposes type aliases like interfaces
can be in general
all we have to do is add type parameters
and utilize them on the right side of
alias declaration below is the syntax
for type aliases
what are nullable types in typescript
null and undefined are the two special
types in typescript that have the values
null and undefined respectively they are
not particularly useful much like void
null and undefined are subclasses of all
other types by default
that means you can give things like
number null and undefined values
when the strict null checks flag is said
however null and undefined can only be
assigned to unknown
any and their respective types the one
exception being that undefined is also
assignable to want this helps to avoid a
lot of frequent errors you can use the
union type string null undefined if you
want to send in either a string null or
undefined
what is in operator in typescript
the in operator serves as a type
narrowing expression
the true branch narrows to types that
have been an optional or required
property n
and the false branch narrows to the
types that have an optional or missing
properties in for a n in x expression as
shown in the example below where n is a
string literal or string literal type
and x is a union type explain index
types in typescript
using index types we can get the
compiler to check code that utilizes the
dynamic property names a typical
javascript pattern for example is to
select a subset of an object properties
we may build and use this function in
typescript using the index type query
and indexed access operators
in this example k of t the index type
query operator for any type t key of t
is the union of non-public property
names of t and t of k the indexed access
operator is the second operator the type
syntax reflects the expression syntax in
this case t of k can be like index type
queries be used in generic environment
which is where it's truly potentially
seen all you have to do now is make sure
that the type variable k extends to k of
t
what are map types
typescript has a feature called map
types that allow you to define new types
based on the existing ones the new type
turns each property into the old type in
the same way in a map type
it's important to note that this syntax
refers to a type rather than a member
you can use an intersection type to add
more numbers as you can see in the
example it is the simplest map type and
its parts are type keys and type flags
where syntax is similar to the index
signatures
with 4 in the middle there are three
sections in total
the type variable k is assigned to each
property one by one
and the literal union of strings the
name of properties to iterate over the
stored in case
and properties type as a result
what is meant by contextual typing
when there is a type on one side of the
equation but not on the other the
typescript compiler finds out the form
we can omit typing on the right side as
typescript can work it out automatically
this increases the amount of work needed
to type code
distinguish between typescript and
javascript typescript is an
object-oriented programming language
whereas javascript is a scripting
language
typescript supports static typing
javascript does not support static
typing
in typescript error can be found and
corrected during a compile time in
javascript errors can be found only
during runtime as it is an interpreted
language
there is support for
es3 es4 5 and 6 in typescript
whereas in javascript no support for
compiling
in typescript functions can have
optional parameters whereas in
javascript this is not possible
in typescript converted into javascript
code
to be understandable for browsers
javascript can be directly used in
browsers
typescript has proper build setup dot
package manager is required for static
type definitions no build setup is
required in javascript
what is jsx
jsx is an xml like syntax that can be
embed it is intended to be turned into
legitimate javascript though the
semantics of that transformation will
vary depending on the implementation
typescript allows you to embed jsx type
verify it and compile it to javascript
immediately jsx needs to be translated
into a valid typescript we use the jsx
file with the dot tsx extension
define static typing
static typing refers to a compiler
having variables parameters and object
members that are recognizable at the
compilation type this helps in detecting
early errors static typing as is an
important concept
static typing is when the compiler
enforces that the values use the same
type here's an example
what is meant by type inference
when you don't specify an explicit type
for variable typescript can infer it
type inference is the term for this this
is normally done during the declaration
when the variables or parameters are
initialized
typescript recognizes that the variable
foo is a string even if we don't mention
string as a type
here is an example
how to create objects in typescript
objects are collection of keys and
values that resemble a dictionary the
keys must be one of a kind resemble rs
and are sometimes referred to as
associate arrays
an object type in typescript refers to
any value with properties it can be
defined simply by specifying the
properties and the kinds of these
properties
as an example
explain different data types in
typescript
number both integer and floating point
numbers are represented by the data type
number boolean has true and false values
string it is used to denote a string of
characters
void is usually applied to function
return types
null it's used when an object isn't
worth anything
undefined indicates the value assigned
to an uninitialized variable
any any type of value can be assigned to
a variable if declared with any data
type
what are the benefits of using
typescript
compilation javascript is an interpreted
language thus there is no need to
compile it as a result it must be run to
ensure authenticity if there is an error
you write all the code only to find no
output as a result you will have to
spend hours looking for faults in the
code
error checking is provided via the
typescript transpiler if typescript
detects any syntax mistakes it will
compile the code and generate
compilation error
this aids in detecting errors before the
execution of the script
the next benefit is it provides an
optional type system for javascript code
when a client doesn't have a value for a
parameter he can pass null
optional arguments are a feature of
typescript
you can declare some optional arguments
in the function by utilizing optional
parameter features so the decline does
not need to supply a value to optional
parameters
strong static typing
javascript does not have a powerful
static typing system
through the tls typescript comes with an
optional static typing and type
inference system the tls can deduce the
type of variable defined with node type
based on its value
typescript supports object oriented
programming
typescript support classes interfaces
inheritance and other object oriented
programming principles
typescript supports type definition
existing javascript libraries can use
typescript type definitions
external javascript libraries are
defined in typescript definition files
as a result it can include these
libraries in typescript code
how to install typescript
typescript is a javascript programming
language for use in application
typescript exchange javascript with
optional types that support tools for
large-scale javascript application in
any browser or any host on any other
operating system to install typescript
globally with node package manager which
means you can run the typescript command
from anywhere in your terminal to
install the latest stable version of
typescript you just need to run the
command npm install hyphen g space type
script this will install the latest
version of typescript
what are decorators
a decorator is a type of declaration
that can be used to decorate a class
declaration method accessor property or
argument
decorators take the form
expression where expression must
evaluate to a function
that will be called with information
about the decorated declaration when it
is called at runtime
what are mixins
combining simpler particle classes is a
popular approach of constructing classes
from reusable components for languages
like scala you may be familiar with the
concept of mixins or characteristics
to extend a base class the design relies
on generics and class inheritance the
finest mix in support
in typescript is provided through the
class expression pattern
explain classes in typescript
classes are not supported in javascript
es5 or earlier this feature
that typescript inherits from es6
a class is a collection of items with
similar characteristics fields methods
constructor blocks
nested classes and interfaces are all
included in the classes
below is the syntax to declare a class
in terms of oops a class is a template
for producing objects
what is the name space and how to
declare it
the namespace is used to group
functionalities logically to enable a
single or group of link functionalities
a namespace can include interfaces
classes functions and variables
the namespace keyword followed by the
namespace name can be used to construct
a namespace curly brackets can be used
to define all interfaces classes and
other objects
below is the syntax for namespace
explain the components of typescript
internally the typescript language is
separated into three layers each of this
layer is further subdivided into
language compiler
and language services
language it is written in typescript and
includes typescript language components
it includes syntax keywords and type
annotations
compiler the typescript compiler
converts typescript programs into
javascript code it also converts our
typescript code to javascript code
parsing and type checking it
it provides information that allows
editors and other tools to deliver
greater assistance capabilities like
automated refactoring and intelligence
it adds a layer of abstraction to the
core compiler pipeline
what are the recent advancements in
typescript
typescript 4.2 has been released and it
includes more flexible type annotations
tougher checks and additional
configuration choices and a few breaking
changes
rest arguments can now be placed
anywhere in triple type in type error
messages type aliases are no longer
enlarged resulting in a better developer
experience
typescript 4.2 brings the language one
step closer to its aim of accurately
typing javascript at any size anywhere
javascript is used
describe as syntax in typescript
the as is an additional syntax in
typescript for type assertion it was
introduced as the original syntax
conflicted with jsx
while using jsx with typescript only as
style assertions can be used
define lambda function
typescript provides shorthand syntax for
defining function expressions a lambda
function is an anonymous function
without a name
below is an example for lambda function
what are conditional types in typescript
based on a condition given as a type
relationship test a conditional type
chooses one of the two alternative types
when t can be assigned to you the type
is x and when t can't the type is y
because the condition depends on one or
more type variables a conditional type t
extends to u
x is to y and is either resolved to x or
y or delayed whether to resolve to x or
y or to differ when t or u contains type
variables is determined by whether the
type systems has enough information to
conclude that t is always assignable to
you
what is an interface with reference to
typescript
the interface defines the syntax for
classes to follow a class implementing
an interface implements all its members
it can be reference but not instantiated
typescript compiler uses an interface
for type checking
what is a declare keyword in typescript
as javascript does not have typescript
declaration to use it in the typescript
file without any compilation error
declare keyword is used
the keyword is used for ambient methods
and declarations to define a variable
that exists elsewhere
now we will look at advanced level
interview questions
what are object oriented principles
supported by typescript
all object oriented principles
encapsulation inheritance polymorphism
and obstruction are supported by
typescript
encapsulation is a major component of
object-oriented programming language and
its method of structuring code so that
each block of code has its own set of
access points for external code
polymorphism occurs when many class
inherit from the same parent and
override the same functionality
each of those kit classes is now
responsible for implementing a property
or method
but they may do so it on their own
unique way
inheritance
typescript makes creating an object
model and inheritance chain a breeze to
construct classes
simply use the standard class keyword
abstraction is a method of modeling
objects in a system that separates the
responsibilities of the classes or type
from the code that inherits it
explain index signatures in typescript
index signatures interact with the key
off and t of k
the type of an index signature argument
must be either a string or a number
if your type has a string index
signature key of t will be a string
or a number because in javascript we can
access an object property using either
string or numbers and t of string is
simply the index signatures type
the index signature consists of the
index name and its type in square
bracket
followed by colon and the value type
what are assert signatures
the asset signature features allows us
to construct functions that operate as
type guards as a side effect instead of
returning their boolean result
explicitly
after a search string typescript has no
way of knowing if you have guaranteed
the type of input to prevent this most
people just make the parameter input
string which is fine
but it also moves the type of checking
problem somewhere and in circumstances
where you just want to fail hard having
the option is beneficial
what is type assertion explain its types
a type assertion is similar to a type
cast in other languages but it does not
do any additional data verification or
restructuring it has no effect on
runtime and is only used by the compiler
there are two types of assertions
one is the as syntax other is the angle
bracket syntax
below is the example for async tax and
angle bracket syntax
explain how typescript files can be
supported from node modules
typescript includes a series of
declaration files however there are two
drawbacks to using this declaration
files with typescript
one is while upgrading typescript we
must deal with changes to typescript's
built-in declaration files
and the other is customizing these files
to meet the needs and the demands of
project dependencies is difficult
a new feature like at the rate types was
added that allows to override the
specific built-in library then we can
update typescript and the log file in
dependency management ensuring that it
utilizes the same version of the dom
types as a result we can update the
types on our own schedule
explain the typescript generics
typescript generics is a tool for
creating reusable components in
typescript it builds a component that
can interact with various data kinds it
enables users to consume these
components while also using their own
kinds
the identity function now has a type
variable called type
this type allows us to capture the type
of data the user supplies for example a
number or a string so that we can use it
later we are going to utilize type as
the return type once more below is the
syntax for typescript generics
what is recursive type aliases
the ability to recursively reference
type aliases has always been eliminated
the reason for this is because each type
aliases must be capable of substituting
itself for whatever it aliases
interfaces can be recursive but their
expressiveness is limited and type
aliases cannot
that involves combining the two creating
a type aliases and extracting the types
recursive portions into interfaces
it's effective
typescript has no trouble working with
the interfaces and the other object
types because they introduce a level of
indirection and their whole structure
does not need to be eagerly built up
explain tale recursion elimination on
conditional types
when typescript identifies infinite
recursion or any type expansions that
take a long time and damage your editor
experience
as a result typescript includes
heuristics to ensure that it doesn't run
off the tracks while working with types
that provide a lot of intermediate
results
the trim left type removes spaces from
the beginning of string like type when
provided a string type with a space at
the beginning trim left returns a
reminder of the string to the user
advance typescript removes tail
recursion from conditional types it can
prevent
intermediary instantiations as one
branch of conditional type is merely
another conditional type
explain the awaited type and promise
improvements this type is intended to
represent activities such as await in
async functions and the dot then method
on promises notably the way they
recursively unwrap promises
existing apis such as javascript
built-ins like promise.all promise.trace
and others can benefit from the awaited
time in fact some of promise dot all's
inference concerns provided as
foundation for awaited promise dot all
combine certain traits with the awaited
to produce far superior inference
results
