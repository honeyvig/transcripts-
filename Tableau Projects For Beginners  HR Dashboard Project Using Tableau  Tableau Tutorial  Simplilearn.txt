hey everyone welcome to Simply L's
YouTube channel today we will learn
about HR data analytics using TBL that
is we will go through some of the HR
data sets available online we will
download one of them and we will read
the rows and columns and understand what
the data is talking about and then load
the same data and if required we will do
some data cleaning and if we will do
some calculations using TBL and then we
will extract some impactful insights
from that particular data set and then
load all the charts onto One dashboard
and create one final interactive HR data
analytics dashboard using tabl that's it

which will redirect you to find the
business analytics program that fits
your experience and areas of Interest so
without further delay over to our
training so we have opened up the
popular website for all the data sets so
out of those data sets I found this
particular employee attrition data set
to be a little interesting so you can
create a kagle account and then download
this particular data so um I have
already downloaded this particular data
and repeat so I have already downloaded
this particular data and uh we can
directly get started by understanding
what exactly this data set talk about so
this particular data has
about 26 columns and um it has about
6,000 no it's about uh
1,470 rows right so this is about the
data set we are having here and let's
observe each and every column with a
little more clarity first we have age of
employees and then we have attrition
which is in the form of Boolean so what
is attrition you may ask so attrition is
something uh let's say if you are
present in the company then it is known
as no and if you are leaving or if you
have left the company then it can be
considered as yes so basically to keep
it simple attration is something
reducing right let's say if your company
is facing some uh Financial issues or if
they want to cut down some cost cuttings
or do some cost cuttings then they will
do something called layoffs so that is
that particular action can also be
turned as attrition so the particular
data set that we downloaded also talks
about attrition of employees and we can
also create a dashboard based on
attrition rates right so this particular
value we have here is in the form of
Boolean right so we have character data
set and if you load this particular data
set onto tblo then this particular data
type will be considered as Boolean by
tblo so we might have to write some
calculations you know calculated fi and
W and convert this from Boolean value to
numerical value we will do that on uh on
the line and the next one is about the
business travel and uh this talks about
how frequently or how rarely a
particular employee travels on the
purpose of business so you can keep this
or you can also in know kind of turn it
into a Boolean value if you want and you
may not uh it's based on the data set
use case if you want to create a story
or if you want to create a chart based
on this particular parameter you can do
that and if you if you are not willing
to do that it's all right and I think
the daily rate here is about the rupees
or dollars that are paid for every
employee based on working per day and
this particular column talks about sales
research that the department and um I
think this particular column talks about
if we expand this distance from home so
how many miles or how many kilometers
each and every employee is traveling
from his home to reach office and uh
this
particular uh column is about education
which talks about one two and three four
four being the highest number five is
the highest number so let's
read data right next to it so if we
expand this
education field Life Sciences Life
Sciences okay is it is it like uh
bachelor's degree postgraduation Masters
or something like that it's a little bit
unclear but again if we come into the
education field we find a little more
clarity here whether it is coming from
Life Sciences other medical right we
have multiple uh courses here marketing
I think marketing will go into sales yes
marketing is into sales technical degree
again sales so we have multiple
education Fields over here and employee
count so I think uh uh each and every
employee has a value over here so if one
uh I mean it's like let's say if I
filter out the research and development
department and then I count or sum all
these uh numbers then I think I'll get
the employee count so I think this
particular column is here for a reason
and this particular employee number can
be considered as employee ID number and
then we have uh some interesting columns
here employee environment satisfaction
so on a scale of 1 to five or on a scale
of 1 to 10 how satisfied this particular
emplo employees in this particular
environment then we have gender column
then we have hourly rate in case we
discuss a column based on day right so
this particular column is about hourly
rate or hourly charges you would be
paying your employee we can create some
good um stories or we can create some
good use cases with all these columns
then job involvement so I think this
particular column or this particular
rating is given by the manager for the
employee so how involved this particular
employee is into his job role so again
job level I think this is based on the
irchy is it from Easy from an manager
level or easy from um you know intern or
a junior level I think this describes
about that so here we have the highest
level as four which describes as a
manager I think yeah that's what it is
and uh we have job satisfaction this is
also one of the interesting columns so
we can also create a you know chart
based on job satisfaction from the
Departments how are the employees I mean
we can find out which particular
department has the highest job
satisfaction rate so let's check the
values and um marital state is single
married or divorced right and monthly
income monthly
rate so we have monthly income here and
monthly rate so uh monthly rate again is
a little confusing monthly income is
higher than monthly rate okay we might
go into these
details okay we might uh change a few
column names here we can check out that
and then we have number of companies
work wow this is also another
interesting column which talks about the
number of companies the current employee
has worked with and over
18 yes I think this particular Corum
will by default have all the rowes yes I
think this is about the age and then
overtime how many employees are doing
over time percentage of salary high this
could be another good um story board so
what's the highest percentage of a high
receip by an employee or what's the
highest high percentage based uh
Department wise we can do that and
performance rating relationship
satisfaction standard hours stock option
level total working years train yeah
work life balance right so nice we do
have a good data set over here and if we
come back to this particular columns
here then I think uh monthly
income and this could
be confusing here monthly income and
monthly
rate
anyways uh is there any calculation here
nothing no calculation here think we'll
go with monthly income as the salary and
we might ignore monthly rate because it
is a little confusing so why uh are we
reading this data uh with such key in
observation because once we understand
the data we can build our use cases and
we can proceed with building charts and
you know dashboards unless you know
unless you know what kind of data you're
dealing with unless you know what kind
of assets you have in your data you
cannot proceed with any of the use cases
so that's the reason we are trying to
understand the data first in a very good
way then we can proceed with the process
of building charts process of extracting
insights process of building a dashboard
so throughout this tutorial we will be
performing some in tab will for
performing some calculation or
calculated fields in tab then we will be
creating some bins we will be you know
we'll try to um search every major or
critical corner of T and then understand
or at least get a brief overview or a
short overview of that particular
feature in T and um I think this should
be helpful for you to get a decent
Insight on what a stab and how exactly
going to work with it right and now
let's proceed with
T I have already worked a few examples
on this particular data set so let's
open a new uh tblo session or a
window yeah there you go we have a new
uh session or New U instance of TBL here
and now let's go back to Connected data
or you can directly come to here which
is about data source and uh so since the
data that we downloaded is in the form
of excel we will choose the option of
Microsoft Excel here and um previously
we did not find it because it was
looking for workbooks so instead of
workbook if we select all files then we
can get the HR data set over here so
basically uh we will be working on CSV
type of files so unless your um data set
is saved in the form of workbook you
cannot do that so if you go back to your
Excel and uh go to excel save options
and save it as a workbook you can find
it but it's not a trouble you can just
change from Excel workbooks to old files
and you'll find your dat set now I think
uh it might take a while to load an
error record it's communicating with
Excel connect to the data source okay uh
I think it is about the illegal file
format which is in the CSV format I
think it's not taking or identifying it
in the form of CSV so if we take or save
it in the form of uh workbook which I've
done here I think it should be
beneficial for us yeah there you go it
directly extracted the data in the form
of U workbook and here on the left side
if you can see let me expand it a little
so here we have all the fields you know
the column names which we had initially
these are the column names and these are
the if if I close this we have the data
which is about the columns and rows we
have which we went through right so
these are the columns and rows and since
we are working with one particular or
one single uh data set we don't have to
work much on the joins and Union options
let's say if you are working with two
different tables related to one single
organization which are connected based
on one primary key like the employee ID
or something like that then you might
have to perform some joins or unions
operations which are present entirity
over here and that could be another
tutorial for another day for now let's
continue with the HR data set that we
have today right so we can just directly
go on to the worksheet
and we have the um dimensions and
measures so whichever value you're
finding over here in blue color or which
is in the text format which um you know
that will be considered as uh um
Dimension and here employee number in
fact it is um uh it is a you know
numerical value it is still considering
it is a dimension since it is unique so
it it was in text format leave in Excel
so it is considering it as um measure I
mean Dimension and the number whichever
you have which is a numerical value
which describes a certain measure then
that could be considered as a
measure and apart from this you might
find another set of uh you know uh
inputs here which can be either a
parameter or a calculated field so there
is a difference between a measure and a
calculated uh measure so if the hashtag
over here I don't know if you can see
this a little green color hash if it
starts with equals to and hash then it
means that it's a calculated field right
and apart from that you have the filters
over here and you have the color size
text detail tool tips and once if you
start dragging your datas that is
measures and dimensions you can also
find uh text labels which is present to
here and uh if you want to you know tilt
your let's say if you want to reorganize
your columns and rows you can just click
on the swap Icon and if you want to
organize your columns or you know the
row charts or column charts whichever
you find in ascending or descending
order you can use these to do that and
um you can present you can directly go
into the slid show or presentation mode
with this icon and this particular one
is based on the view currently it on it
is on the standard view let's say your
chart is really small and you want to
expand out if you want to fit that your
entire um screen or let's say um you
know this particular view area then you
can click on that entire View and apart
from that um and yeah I forgot to
mention show me if you drag this
particular icon if you click on this
particular option you have a wide
variety of charts so tblo will give you
its own choice or it decides which
particular chart could be more uh better
uh you know visually appealing and it
will decide and it will give you the
type of chart which matches for the data
and in case if you want to change your
perspective or if you want to change
your view then you can select the uh
type of chart which could be which you
feel is more appealing and you can
change the type of charts from here here
so that said let's start with the data
analysis or Data Insights now um
starting with Department okay now let's
find out how many number of departments
we have and what is the employee count
how many number of employees we have in
our organization so we have found we
have three different departments which
is H our research and development and
sales now let's find out the total
number of employees so we had something
called employee count in our um dat set
so let's try to drag that employe count
to this
particular and we have the department
which is research and development which
has highest number of employees and
sales is about 446 and HR with 63 we can
click on this label icon which will give
us marks right now it has to count and
if you click on colors uh then you can
drop this particular thing on colors and
it will change
colors let's say we can choose different
colors based on
Department type chart you want as
this yes now we have different colors
for different
departments you
can say you can designate this
particular sheet as you know when we are
trying to build a dashboard we might
have to drag all the sheets onto the
dashboard right and it's better when you
have an understanding of what sheet are
you going to drag onto the um you know
dashboard so employe
count let's create another
another story which talks about
graduation levels or you know education
level of the
employees will track education to
columns
so these are the degrees I mean these
are the education levels of employees
and you can again dag the employee
account over here and you
can drag education to colors and we have
different and we can reorganize in terms
of um yeah the highest is in bachelor
degree can enter view there you go and
um if we track Department let's see what
happens if we track department so here
we have Department wise decrees right so
in HR department the people number of
people people okay let's try to label
it we have 27 people from HR department
with a bachelor's degree and uh 379
people from R&D with a bachelor's degree
and
166 people from B sales department
having bachelor's degree right impressed
now
let's see where we go with genda so uh
how many females and how many males are
in you know every Department we can do
that so take
department and we
will
count if we drop gender onto color we
will have two different colors for two
different you know
genders
and and in case if you want to change
this part particular
you know uh type of chart into this uh
by chart you can do
that and entire
view just keep it as it is you can also
do that and if you want to uh you know
change this particular one into a pie
chart that can be
done you can also click on
labels and if you want to change some
you know uh if you want to mod ify or
change the color or CH do some
modification to this particular angles
you can do that by clicking on this and
you can change colors or do some
detailing on it right and education
gender now uh remember we had some
decent columns to select with that is
performance and uh you know performance
rating um job
satisfaction and few other details right
job involvement let's try to Build That
B
department now uh since we have uh three
different departments let's go with
HR
department Sals
department now the HR department sales
department and research and development
so let's keep it as R and D
Department
right now we have three different you
know uh canvas now we will perform some
good insights
so we want Department here so
yeah in
rowes you know let's try to put another
depart
filters let's try to
filters and they will want only HR since
we are working on HR okay
so let's see distance from
home
okay
count Let's uh let the um table let
table build the charts the way it is
building we will at last modify it and
the way we want let's go with the T
table chart right so the total number of
employees present in the HR department
we will keep it you know we will keep it
as a default for all three departments
first the number of employees then
another parameter then another parameter
right so first we have added the number
of employees
then job
satisfaction right then
uh okay let's monthly rate monthly
income
then percentage of salary
hike
[Music]
rating work life
balance standard working
hours I think that's good enough now we
can go to show me and change this to
table you know table type all right and
you can also to change this to entire
view so what we can do is we can add
this onto a dashboard so we can have uh
one H Department another next Department
three particular departments over here
right which shows about you it's like an
overview of how many number of employees
you have job satisfaction and now let's
also try to calculate the attrition
right we have the attrition over here we
can do one thing what we can do is uh we
can remember I said we will perform some
uh time calculations right so we will
try to convert this particular text or
you know Boolean type of value numerical
value and we can try to uh calculate the
attrition rate all right so let's try to
calculate
that
can you have to look for format over
here
you need a calculated field
right create a calculated field let's do
this
as attrition value or attrition
count right I'll keep it as attrition
value
so it's a simple F function
and attrition is here
called
stent
yes
then
one
l b
as Z and and pressing have to select the
uh you know function
so table has verified the code and it's
saying the calculations F press okay and
I think you will be able to find a new
calculated field which says equals to
hashtag attrition value all right so
this means equals to hashtag is a
calculated field now we have it and uh
we have to find out the attrition rate
attrition rate is simple create a
calculated
field name it as
rate
so some
of addtion value that we just
calculated divided by sum of employee
count yes that should give you the give
us the attrition rate and uh we can for
format it
and
change uh yeah that is the attrition
trate right now we have the attrition
trate over here if we go into format we
have it as in the form of numbers let's
give it as percentage Ag and let's also
keep
um okay let's keep it in two decimal
places let's say we have uh 98% or let's
fingers crossed no company should have
98% addtion rate let's say it's about 5%
or 5.08 5.59 something like that so
let's keep two decimal places in there I
think it's done now we have let's go
back to Fields let's close this
particular now we have let close this HR
department and measure modes so it's
taking all the measures so here we have
uh I think we don't need business travel
right let's remove
this you can just drag and it's gone so
we have attration rate employe count job
satisfaction monthly income percentage
salary high performance rating and
standard working
hours
so remember the uh values or let's
say yeah remember these values so we
will be creating this particular
dashboard for all three departments so
first we will be having department so I
mean first we will be having attrition
rate employee count job
satisfaction okay we'll refer to it not
a problem right now we are in the sales
department
right
now you're in the sales department so we
will get the Department
again to
rows department and filters and this
time we will have
sales this a small info you can also you
know um keep it uh in the form of you
can apply this to all
worksheets uh
right all LED uh worksheets so if I go
into r& D again um I think we will have
let's look around it once again now for
now we will have the sales department so
we will get
the and then we have employee
comp emplo in particular Department
job
satisfaction first page of salary
height rating standard working
hour there you go you can use show me
change it into a table format change the
view from standard to entire
right and we'll have our last Department
which is
rting there you go so same applies here
go to Department add it into filters go
to Department add it to RS and then here
change it from sales to R remember we
selected that entire sheet right so
whenever you add the department filter
it will by default go to sales but again
you can change it from the options over
here and uh we will start with attrition
rate similar to the previous one employ
count job
satisfaction the income percentage
salary
hike perance rating and standard working
apps C we missed standard working
hours let's check the order monthly
income percentage salary
hike there you go you can change the
standard view from entire view to entire
view there you go done all right so far
we have the attrition rates calculated
here and um now let's say we try to
create some vins right you can try to
create some Vin based on gender based on
Department okay we have already created
a lot of Department and we already have
gender we can create some bins based on
age right uh
age AG wise
bin I think if we go back to the data we
already
have AG bands right so we have five
different H bands but again if you want
to create a pin specifically you can
also do that just for the uh you know um
how to do it purpose let's say you
wanted to know how to create bins we
already have that bin prerecorded in the
data but again if you want to do that
let's try
it let's go to
age create you have calculated Fields
groups B so all are one and the same so
let's go with Ben over here and let's
name it as h one and instead of a
decimal value let's keep it as a whole
number and click okay before that you
need to create a parameter over
here and minum will be you know this the
step count to right once I create the
chart you will understand what I was
talking about the step Downs I think
yeah everything is fine let's press okay
okay and there you go and now if you you
drag the hins onto the columns
and count you should get how many
employees are in what pin right so now
if you click on the parameter over here
you can see a new parameter just got
created you can rename it you know
rename it as age
parameter done and if you click on
this there you go remember we uh created
the step count if you increase the step
count to four then the age starts from
16 to 20 20 to 24 24 to 28 right so
these are the things you want to keep in
mind and if you label these um then it
count and you uh do this based on your
department right we already have the
number of employe cons over here right
employe con number of employees working
in a certain department and and right um
and if you try to drag the H bin into
color you will have different color for
different HS and if you try to sort it
you can also do that so the age group of
uh 28 to 32 have the highest number of
employees right so that's how we do it
and we barely have employees uh with
high r 60 and um from 16 to 20 maybe
they are here for internship something
like that right so so far so good now we
can get started with a
dashboard right now right now we have
remember we were naming our uh uh what's
see um every chart right when you're
dragging some chart into the dashboard
you need to know what exactly you're
draging so you can directly uh drag all
your uh charts onto this dashboard and
finish it or if you want to make it look
a little more interesting you can also
add some image into the background I
want to add an image so insert an image
file fit Image Center image and choose
the particular image from your download
section I think this is good
okay there you go
you can change you know I can see this
particular you know visual is a little
small you can't fit all the charts into
this and it's not clearly visible and of
course if you click on the slideshow
this will become bigger but again that's
not the way right so let's try to change
this to
maximum let's change the pixel density
over here let's check the screen size
and then add the input over here so that
it fits properly just a minute so uh
let's try to increase this or customize
this
720p let's try to increase a little
more our m is to make it fit within the
canvas so um yeah
let's increase the
work I think this should be fine or we
can also eliminate this particular image
Al together if it's blocking the view so
much right remove image from dashboard
so we can make some good modifications
to the existing uh dashboard right and
then we can try to add them over here
now uh we have employee count let's Okay
that called got added to all the uh
worksheets let's select all here or edit
filter I want
all it will affect all the let me delete
this particular C shelf so I'll have one
particular Department here and I will
ch
not to worry anyways we are dragging
this right so I think each and every uh
this is the ultimate uh thing what we
wanted to
have so I think we need to make a little
modification to the attrition rate over
here format and change this from numbers
to percentage and R&D the
same right I think in one place uh we
can have all so if I drag One dashboard
to the uh if I drag one chart to the
dashboard I think we can have all three
departments in one Cod right so uh one
thing is that we understood how to use
filters and how to add those filters to
all existing you know uh
sheets let's get started with dashboard
now we can try to edit this in a in a
little bit we can make it look Bolder
and uh instead of tab I think tab light
is good
enough Department wise and make it look
bold and again these you can edit a
little okay we can just do it
automatically
right we have to U you know reduce or
set some size to so I'm trying for
that second
chart I think reiz it a
little gendu wise we have the gendu wise
uh employee numbers here and we have uh
the data related to attrition rate
employee count job satisfaction in one
go and if we add age wise then we have
age wise and EMP and um we can go
through education details of all the
employees Department wise and uh we have
um the first one employee count we can
you can also drag the employee
count yeah so far so good uh the details
what we wanted are all on One dashboard
so we wanted the employee account based
on gender and we have that and if you
wanted to understand the details of all
employees of about their attrition rates
about their employee counts total number
of employees working in the entire
department and their monthly income and
percentage of salary hike and uh
performance rating standard working
hours right so here you can see there is
a whole number 930 right instead of this
you can make some modifications to the
data set right you can do that if you
could just go to uh the um percentage
salary hike and go to you know uh there
should be some okay we have it
over here right so if we go to
percentage of salary hike and go to the
measure then it should be average and
again if you go into the format here it
is again numbers and if you change it to
percentage and two decimals and then you
have some percentage over here some
minor changes I think it should be 14
.76 and
15.16 and 15.16 right so there is some
uh uh modification that need you need to
do here and I think you'll get the final
number over here so uh if you could see
if you refresh it you will have the
latest data over here so if you are
working in a company which is giving you
a standard uh 10 to 15 person then I
think you're lucky so it's the decent
number which is going on in all the I
mean overall all the organizations and
here you have another dashboard which
explains about the education levels of
each and every employee The Bachelor uh
the number of employees in each
department with a bachelor's degree
right you have the details with here and
even here you have uh you know um drop-
down option if you click on this
particular U age group you know keep
only you can find out that these are the
details will this details will be
highlighted and uh if you go for a
