hi this is dr srikant from team mds
conquer
now we are going to have a quick recap
of operator industry
so the first important thing that you
have to make a note when you're talking
about
the mandibler first premolar okay the
mandibular first premolar is
whenever you do a preparation in
mandible or first premolar
make a note you should have a slight
tilt okay
that is basically due to the lingual
inclination of this particular
teeth and make a note about this
particular criteria
okay so the enamel must be supported by
sound dentin
enamel rods which forms the cable
surface angle
must have their inner ends rested on
sound dentin
enamel rods forming the cable surface
margin should be covered with
restoration always and make a note your
angular
cable surface angle should be trimmed
always so these are the four criteria
that you have to make a note and the
next one is preventive resin restoration
so basing upon the extent and the depth
they are categorized into type a
type b type c so please go through what
is type here what is type b on top what
is type c
and simonson has uh advocated a type of
sealant in each type of
category that is we learned a b c right
so
a is generally you go for an unfilled
sealant okay where the
fillers are less whereas b is a
combination of
both unfilled and filled and whereas c
is a filled
composite resin means you will have more
filler content
in the c
and the next one these are the few
scientist names that you have to make a
note the first one is the prophylactic
odentotomy was given by
height and the restorative material that
is used in this
is uh initially they have they used
amalgam
and followed by the final registration
is done by oxyphosphide cement
oxyphosphate cement or restoration okay
so
fischer eradication was given by make a
note
make a note of the scientists bisima was
given by okay make a note of these
scientist names which are
frequently asked questions so coming to
the wedging techniques i hope you're
very familiar with the three types of
wedging techniques so this is the
wedging techniques where
two wedges are used okay so this is most
commonly used in the case of a
measles side of the maxillary first
molar because of the presence of fluids
in the
root near the gingival area so you can
see the two types of edges they can ask
a diagram based question
also over this the second one is double
wedging
here two edges are used in opposite
direction one from the buccal and one
from the
lingual you can see this double wedging
technique
and the next one is called as in a
piggyback so piggyback they will give
you the diagram based question as this
in this cross section you have two
wedges of two different sizes one is
larger which and the second one is the
smaller wedge so when you have to use
this is indicated in the case of a
shallow
proximal box with ginger russian this is
a this is an
indication case where you go you're
going to use this particular type of veg
so coming to xylitol again is the most
commonly asked question this is a phi
carbon sugar alcohol so it helps in
reducing the
lactic acid that is produced by the
bacteria
the two things that helps in that that
plays an important role one is it helps
in increasing the buffering capacity
of the saliva it helps in minimizing the
demineralization
decreasing the demineralization and also
helps in increasing the dementialization
so
make a note it also helps in increasing
so this these types of gums
which are useful in the case of your
white spot lesion
helps in the initial treatment of white
spot lesion
the next one is cpp acp okay so most of
you are familiar with this cpp acp
cpp icp plus that is called as tooth
mousy or tooth mousy plus the plus means
nothing but additional fluoride
a normal one will have no fluoride if
you
if you use a word plus means the
fluoride content is extra
so how much fluoride content is extra it
is very simple that is
900 ppm of 0.2 percentage of sodium
fluoride is an extra
okay i hope you are well familiar with
cpp acp which we have learned in the
smart videos
the next one types of fischer these are
the different types of fissure they can
ask you which type is
more common or more prevalent so this is
the one
that is the first common and this is the
two that is the second most common
okay that's picked visual sealants this
is a this is an area of
questioning okay what are the first
generation second generation third
generation fourth generation
fourth generation question is repeated
in 2018 2019
fourth generation is fluoride releasing
first generation is uv second generation
is self cure or chemical cure third
generation is visible light
the next comes indications and
contraindications of pitot and fusion
sealants and most of them are very
familiar just go through this table
the next comes is chemo mechanical
preparation the two important things
that most of you are well familiar is
carried x and k resolve and the new
thing that is added to the list
yesterday i have posted
a three or four lines of notes regarding
the papa kerry so which is extracted
from papaya
okay so the solvent contents to please
do make a note and
slight differences okay so slight
difference mixing is not required in the
case of papa carry so please
all these three carry salt carry decks
and papa kerry are very very important
regularly ask questions are 0.5
percentage of nacl one percentage of
nucle
okay they can ask you the ammonia acids
that are present in this they can ask
you the ph values ph values are almost
the same
they can ask you the die is absent here
whereas you can see a die that is
present here and here
okay which of the following is in liquid
state this is the liquid state
so all these things are very very
important please do make a note
okay so uh carries risk assessment tests
are very very important i request
personally go back to your pp books
okay the entire notes of carry carries
accurate test was clearly given so
please do check it and this is one which
is most important
that is the cinder test so please do
make a note about the
uh about the changes and this
and other one is salivary reductase test
okay so most of these questions
these two are most commonly repeated by
giving the time and by
uh asking you the caries activity
the next goes again this question is
repeated in 2018 and 2019 what is type
which type is used
okay so if they ask like a rt is used in
both the types better go with
nine as an answer okay so nine
type nine gic is used in art okay so
they can ask you what is pitch and
figure type what is what is looting type
looting type and registration type are
most commonly asked questions
the next comes with a few modifications
of the composites and most of you are
well familiar with this
if you have a confusion over this please
do check these slides which are more
than sufficient
this is components how the compoomers
are differ from normal composites
okay so these are the most commonly
asked questions in your mock
examinations
i hope you are done with them what is
geomer
geometer is a combination of glass and
number cement with the composite
few few words okay so just to make a
note
what is uh fluoride recharging capacity
okay so what is fluoride recharging
capacity how a restoration
when it which helps in releasing of the
fluorides
when it loses the fluorides how we are
going to recharge so just go through the
literature that is given
okay so please do these are organically
modified ceramic
restorations ceramics please do
silorence okay all these comes under
your smart materials
and most of you are well familiar what
is smart composite add a note of this
and what is the advantage of smart
composite so they can ask you this
diagram based questions over the
recent smart materials this is an
elastic
post that is a fiber reinforced
composite
which helps in uh preparing the partial
i mean like temporary
fixed partial dentures okay self-healing
composite what is what is the catalyst
that is used
uh what are the what is the element that
is present in the micro capsule and
these are the questions which are given
in 2018 neat exam
most of the questions on smart materials
okay so what is the resistance form
okay so flat pulpal floor in a sound
tooth structure
to resist the forces directed
in the long axis of the teeth and to
provide a strong stable
restoration so this is a basically
definition of restorative
resistance form okay so please do make a
note what what are the
things which are required for the
resistance form and the retention form
so balancing so uh like if you see the
long axis the
if they see the long axis the the blade
of the instrument should not be more
than
one to two millimeters it should not be
more than one to two limit two
millimeters this is how a balance is
provided when the instrument is used
amalgam bonding agents i hope you are
well familiar tooth
and the bonding between the uh the
dental structure and the amalgam is
mechanical bonding
so to improve the bonding a bonding
agent is add which bonds to that of the
teeth structure as well as to that of
amalgam that is called as amalgam
bonding agents
and the best example of amalgam bonding
is in sardis
what is sandwich technique you have open
sandwich technique close sandwich
technique open sandwich technique in
which
you'll have it you you have your gic
facing
outside okay so open sandwich is a gac
you can see gic is opened outside
close sandwich in which the gic which is
present towards in the inner side is
inside it's not outside
so your composite will be outside and
gic will be inside here
your gic will be outside so when we use
an
open sandwich technique is whenever you
want a fluoride release at that
particular area whenever you want some
sort of
remineralization at that particular area
go for this sandwich techniques
what is cause of failure cause of
failure means same failure or
loss of bond between the same is called
as cement cement this is
cement this is cement this is called as
coriosophial addison failure is the
interface
between the thing this is the different
thing and this is the cement so adhesive
is a failure is different
failure between different objects and
curse of failure is failure between the
same objects
and most of you are well familiar with
eight ivory number eight this is ivory
number eight matrix
and this is ivory number one very simple
eight
this this looks like eight eight is
higher number one
and the previous one is it looks like
one one looks like eight and eight looks
like one
okay again these are the diagram based
questions these are the particular types
of forceps which helps in removing the
rotor instruments gg drills
and your silver points from the root
canal you can see these beaks these
beaks are prepared in such a way that
you can hold and you can remove it
okay mounts classification mount is
called as
father of minimal invasive dentistry or
minimal minimal invasive registration
so in which the class class has two
numbers one point one or some one one or
one point two something like that
one means minimal moderate enlarged and
extensive
one means here one means it is a fitted
fissure set two means
a contact area that is a proximal
surface three means cervical one third
and this is icd's classification so
please do make a note about the
terminologies that are useful for
the coding okay this is zero one two
three
four five and six so this is a
pick which is taken from the students
latest edition so they can ask you the
diagram based question they can give you
this and they can ask you which coding
it is it is six
and what is the treatment the treatment
procedure is minimal restorative
treatment in all the cases
because treatment varies from individual
to individual basing upon the risk low
risk
moderate risk high risk and extreme risk
so for four five and six okay
the treatments are minimal invasive
restoration for all the categories of
individuals
and coming to the three three it is the
sealant or a minimal
invasive same for all okay whereas
coming to one
two and three there is a variation in
the treatment plan according to the risk
of the patient so risk
assessment is very very important
the next one is terminal preparation so
they can ask you diagram based questions
related to the terminal preparation so
what is the angle of bur that is used
internal preparation that is 45 so
you're going to keep and you're going to
access
means you're going to uh you're going
you're not going to disturb the
marginal reach this is the marginal rich
but you are going to access the lesion
which is present on the proximal surface
by using the bur in 45 degrees
angulation
so these are the c factors i can these
are these are regularly discussed around
the group okay don't worry c
factors they can ask you the c factor
values
okay and of course these are new things
and familiar things they can ask a
diagram based question over the dental
operating microscope they can give this
schematic representation
so these are eyes these are lens okay
this is an assembly that is prism
assembly this is a binocular objective
and monocular objective this is this is
this is the object
so then they can ask you what is the
object lens what is the reference lens
and everything
and uh one more important thing that you
have to make anyway we have learned
about this during our
micro surge micro surgery at the
endodontics so
what is the magnification and what is
the associated resolution
i feel like this is very tricky to
understand but nowadays they're
giving such questions like formulas and
everything because we have seen
a question in 2020 neet about formula
parklands formula was given from general
surgery so
this is one of the important formula
that when when they're when they're
planning to ask a question over the
dental operating microscope okay so
don't don't try to understand it as of
now just try to remember the formula
because
any chance it may come in the
examination that is the focal length of
binocular that is called as
flb focal length of objective length
that is
f l o l ips power ep
and the magnetic magnification factor mf
okay
so the total magnification can be
represented by tm that is total
magnification
is equal to is equal to f l
b by f l o l into
i power into magnification factor this
is a formula that you have to
make a note you have to remember this
remember this okay
so in some situation they can give you a
formula by giving all the values
okay all the values i power and
everything asking you to find the total
magnification
so this is a mathematical thing if you
remember the formula you can
just include all those values so please
do make a note of this
learn this mug up this okay maybe
unfortunately if you get a question
so you're going to get that extra
benefit and coming to i was always
stressing about this
careers risk assessment so what are the
things that to be done
in the case of an office based
treatments and in the case of
a home based therapist like what are the
precautions everything has to be taken
so in high risk moderate risk and low
risk please do make a note of this
and now i'll try to recap some diagrams
and i hope you are well familiar with
the chair positions
uh the universal chair position is 11
o'clock that is called as right rare so
what is what are the different things
just make a note
make a note of it and coming to this
this is an air abrasive aerab resource
system okay so they can ask you a
diagram based question on a rubberized
resistor
and this is how the air abrasive system
equipment uh
the schematic representation is they can
ask you the different
terms and terminologies they can ask you
the particle size which is previously
asked they can ask you the air pressure
again this is question is
as they can ask you the angle of
attachment okay
so there are few other things like
duration motion and everything so it's
just
do make them they can ask you the
distance are they gonna give you the
diagram
and they're can ask you any question
over this area so please do make a note
of this
and the next goes are the instruments
which you are well familiar with so
please do make a note of these
instruments
okay so the first one the these are the
examples of chisels one is striped
chisel okay the second one is middle
stack chisel
okay and the third one is bin
angle chisel okay so the next comes is
uh
the hatchets okay so the first one this
is hatch your gmd's
the next comes is the burs and the
dimensions of course questions are
previously asked on this
area in 2017 examination 169 l bar is
important 245 bar is important
and of course of course these 271 and
272 are important
so please do make a note of this burst
their sizes and the dimensions
the next comes is is of course
is of course the excavators just to make
a note this is an
angle former do make a note this is how
i think this whole
hose is given as a diagram based
question one of the examination recently
c is a dental file uh and do make a note
of all these diagram based stuff okay
these are different
sizes of purse okay uh shapes of bursts
