this is dr madhuri from team mds conquer
we will see the glance of over medicine
and pathology subject in this video
so here the clinical pictures are given
here if you see this is the retrognathia
glossoptosis and because of this
glossoptosis there is an airway
obstruction
so these three features if you combine
it comes out of which syndrome
that is peri robin syndrome and you can
also see here the patient
of perry robinson syndrome will have a
board like faces and this is because of
retrognathia and this is because of
mainly because of the retrognathia
and if you take this patient's which of
perry robinson syndrome
will also have cleft palate
okay so the important features of perry
robin syndrome
includes bought phase
retrognathia airway obstruction and the
glossoprosis
so there is a very robin sequence okay
we'll see the syndromes which comes
under this peri robin sequence
peri robin sequence is nothing but a
isolated clinical feature that means the
patient will have a
glossoptosis or a cleft palate or only
cleft palate
or abstraction along with the cleft
palate so
it is an isolated phenomenon ok so this
isolated phenomenon can be seen
in other syndromes also like stickler
syndrome
willow cardio facial syndrome treacher
colin syndrome
and fetal alcohol syndrome okay remember
peri robin sequence okay see the
terminology sequence is also seen
in other syndromes like stickler
syndrome willow cardio facial syndrome
treacher colon syndrome and fetal
alcohol syndrome
so the syndrome given here is a clinical
feature of
you can if you see this clinical picture
so this
is a picture of treacher choline
syndrome okay and the important uh point
you have to note
in rachel colin syndrome is fish face
okay bird-like faces
is perry robin syndrome whereas fish
like face is the
tricera colon syndrome and one more
important point you have to note here is
collaborate okay collaborative eye
also belongs to treacher collins
syndrome and in these patients will have
a
ear mall formations okay the there is no
up complete absence of
ear or a partial development of liver
you complete absence of ear or a partial
absence of
ear and only a one your earlobe can be
can also be seen okay so
ear defects and the fish face belongs to
tresor colon syndrome and you have to
remember the
facial or a clinical appearance of this
syndromes also which they can be asked
as a
clinical based question or a picture
based question
coming here this is a parry robbins
rambok syndrome
if you see here this face cut
also relate with the scleroderma okay
there is a terminology called as
encomptisable
okay which is mostly called as
localized or linear
scleroderma okay
so if they ask about a syndrome which is
related to the linear
scleroderma or a localized scleroderma
then your answer will be of your
parry romberg syndrome okay so this is
the facial appearance of a parry romberg
syndrome only important point here that
is
it relates with the scleroderma and the
term
which is related to related to both this
is and copdy sabor
so we have seen board like fishes and
fish like faces
now we'll see the frog like face okay
frog like phase
belongs to krausen syndrome okay krausen
syndrome is a
craniosynostosis okay remember the
terminology craniosynostosis
belongs to krausen syndrome and here the
patient will have a frog
like face or a flower leaf skull
on the radiograph okay so two things
three things here craniosynostosis
frock phase and the clower leaf phase
belongs to
krausen syndrome
then coming to the malcus and rosenthal
syndrome so what are the features you
can see here
in this clinical pictures one is the
fissure tongue okay
so this is the fissure tongue
and you can see this killitis
granulomatosa
and along with this you can see that
kelitos granulomatosa
or swelling of that
leaves and along with this pulse
unilateral
palsy okay so all these things belongs
to marcus and rosenthal syndrome only
the important
thing is fish your tongue so the tongue
appearance in the malcus and rosenthal
syndrome is
fissured tongue okay
so identify this tongue
picture clinical picture you can see
here this is
called as hairy tongue
and in the hairy tongue you have to
remember the
philly form papillae okay so in the
hairy tongue the filliform papillae will
be
elongated or
hypertrophied
so they can ask you regarding the
papilla okay so in the
hairy tongue the filiform papilla will
be elongated or
hypertrophy
one more important tongue feature here
microglossia okay
so everyone knows that microglossia is
in back with with man syndrome
sarah so there are other three syndromes
given here
along with this back with whitman
syndrome where you will see the
macroglossia
the other three syndromes include down
syndrome
taller syndrome and bahamal syndrome so
you have to remember these four
syndromes
okay so where do you see microglossia
that is back with windman syndrome
down syndrome taller syndrome and the
bahamal syndrome so in these four
syndromes you can see the
macroglossia
okay there are two type of teeth that is
natural teeth and the neonatal teeth
okay what are the natural teeth which
are present at the
birth okay so the natural teeth of the
teeth which are present at the
birth if you take the neo natal teeth
the teeth present in
first month of birth
that is within 30 days they are called
as
neonatal teeth so in this slide they
have given
three type of disorders and or syndromes
which
where we will see the needle or a
neonatal tooth they include
rigafide disease halaman strife syndrome
and alice van gravel syndrome so in
these three syndromes you can see the
presence of
natural teeth the this is a very
important point so in these three things
you will see the
presence of natural teeth that is
regarded disease halaman steve syndrome
and
alice van gravel syndrome
here the classification of cyst are
given so this classification is based on
tissue of origin okay so they can ask
that
cyst which they can ask you in multiple
option questions like
which are derived from the rest of
molasses that is periapical system the
residual cyst and which sister derived
from the reduced enamel epithelium that
is done desert assist
and the eruption cyst and there are
a few cysts which are derived from the
dental lamina or
rest of service so this is include
odentogenic keratosis
gingival cyst of newborn gingival cyst
of adult
lateral periodontal cyst and the
glandular orientogenic cyst
okay so they remember these things which
are derived from the rest of molasses
which are reduced enamel epithelium
derivatives and which are the
derivatives of
rests of ceres
coming to the federal cyst okay here i
have given a list
of cysts which are called as fissural
cysts okay we'll see them
so a median anterior maxillary or a
nasopalatine cyst
median palatal cyst globular maxillary
cyst
median mandibular cyst and the nasolar
or nasolabial cyst so all the cysts
are the fiscal cyst okay so remember
these names median anterior or
maxillary nasopalatin median palatal
globular maxillary
median mandibular nasal allele or
nasolabial cyst belongs to the
fiscal cyst
so important definition regarding
amyloblastoma okay
you can remember the short term like
unicef
if you see that is unicellular this is
according to the robinsons
classification of amiloblastoma this
definition was given
so it is a unicellular it is a
non-functional
it is intermittent in growth it is
clinically persistent and it is
anatomically benign okay
so amyloblastoma unicellular
non-functional
intermittent in growth clinically
persistent and anatomically benign so
you have to remember this
phi terminologies regarding the
amyloplasty mind which is according to
robinson classification
and histologically actually there are
six common varieties of amyloblastoma so
other than this six common varieties
there are also three
rare varieties histologically okay we'll
see the common varieties common
varieties includes
follicular plexiform acanthomatous
granular cell in granular cells you will
see the
lysosomes okay then
basal cell and desmoplastic so this
follicular plexiform
acanthomatous granular cell basal cell
and snowplastic belong to the
common histological varieties of
amyloblastoma
whereas rare varieties includes clear
cell
papillae ferrous and
kerato-amyloblastoma so please do
remember these three
histological varieties which are the
rare varieties of
amyloblastoma
coming to the two-thirds tumor so they
can ask like which is a two-thirds tumor
so that is nothing but a adenomatoid or
endogenic tumor
avoti is also called as two-third tumor
why because
two important reasons is two third of
this cases
appears in anterior maxilla
and two third of the cases are
associated with
impacted canine okay
so because of these two important
reasons it is called as
two thirds tumor that is two-thirds
associated with anterior maxilla
and two-thirds of cases are associated
with the impacted canine
we'll see few features which are not
seen in squamous
or endogenic tumor okay so as they have
given like famous
most of the students think they have
uh features which are related to
epithelium dysplasia okay but
we i am giving a list of four very
important features
and they can ask you in statements okay
the four
statements given the four features given
here are not a feature of
squamous or dendrogenic tumor okay
so they can ask you like a true false
base questions
so squamous or dendrogenic tumor do not
have pleomorphism
it doesn't have nuclear hyperchromatism
it doesn't have mitotic activity and it
doesn't have the
epithelial pulse so remember they do not
have priomaphism
they do not have the nuclear chromatism
and they do not have the mitotic
activity
and they do not have the epithelial
pulse so remember these four features
are very important which are not seen
in squamous or dendrogenic tumor
there are three features given that is
oral a patient comes to you
and he has a oral liken plan is plus
hypotension plus diabetes
mellitus okay if you see these three
triad
there is a diagnosis there can be a
diagnosis for this
three triode okay that diagnosis is
nothing but a
greenspun syndrome so the greenspan
syndrome triad will be of
your oral icon plan is
hypertension and the diabetes
mellitus
so identify this syndrome this is
syndrome or a disorder it is nothing but
a clinocranial dysplasia
so the most characteristic feature is
hypoplastic clavicles and they can bring
their shoulders too close okay
so hypoplastic clavicles hypo clavicles
or
even in few cases the clavicle is absent
okay so this is
seen in cledo cranial dysplasia or
disorders
and here the important gene is your cbf
a1 gene remember cba fa1 gene is
associated with
your clidocranial dysplasia
so what here this is a macula okay so
this is a feature of
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
okay the what is that feature this is a
cherry red macule on the skin
with a crushed spider appearance
remember this
statement cherry red macular on the skin
with a
crust spider appearance is a feature of
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
you can see this is a red michael cherry
red molecule
and one most thing is given here that is
a herald
patch okay where is the the herald patch
is a feature of patriotism
rosia okay in patriasis rosia you can
see the herald patch it is a
very important feature and this is also
a
red molecule remember two things here
one cherry red macules
crushed spiderweb appearance with is
seen in
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
whereas this red molecule which appears
in the form of a patch
that is nothing but herald patch is seen
in vitriolis
rosia
so what can you suspect in this patient
you can see in this patient there is a
period pigmentation or a freckle type of
appearance okay perioral pigmentation of
freckle type of
appearance over the perioral region so
in these patients what can you suspect
you can suspect a
huge jog syndrome
okay in this patients you can suspect a
pure jogger syndrome
so if the patients comes with perioral
pigmentation you can
directly or you can advise the patient
to take a
endoscopy
because even this patient will have a
polyphosis endoscopy of intestine okay
so the features important in your jogger
syndrome are
perioral pigmentation plus an intestinal
polyposis okay
what is this lesion which mimics the
carcinoma
so that is necrotizing cylometaplasia it
is a salivary gland disorder
and it mostly mimics the salivary it
mostly
mimics the squamous cell carcinoma
okay and this
ah necrotizing cell metablasia may
develop more during even the palatal
injections also that is forceful or a
traumatized or a pressurized
palatal injections it can cause the
necrosis over the region
so loss of blood supply and it results
in the necrotizing xylometaplasia which
sometimes
makes the square muscle carcinoma and
one more thing there will be
you can also suspect a i mean like you
can see the deep
dd that is differential diagnosis for
this palatal necrosis or perforation
those
are deep fungal infections
and one more important here is syphilis
okay
so syphilis d fungal infections and
necrotizing cylomatoplasia make and
calls the necrosis of the palette
necrotic lesion of the palate
so what is the gold standard diagnosis
for the jochran syndrome
that is lip biopsy lower lip biopsy
is a gold standard diagnostic test for
the
jogger syndrome remember this is a very
important point that is
gold standard for the diagnostic test
for the jagran syndrome is
lip biopsy
here a classification of candidiasis is
given so in this classification the very
important things are
candida associated lesions okay what are
the candida associated lesions they are
dengue stomatitis angular kilitas
median rhomboid glossitis that is
dangerous stomatitis
angular kilitis and the median rhomboid
glossities
are the candida associated lesions
there are two lesions here asked here
one is a kissing lesion and one is a
kissing this is okay
what is a clinical picture given here it
is a
kissing lesion so in this clinical
picture is nothing but a
multifocal
candidiasis is associated with
kissing lesion why because the patient
might develop a candidiasis on the
tongue
and if the tongue touches the palate on
palette also
it the same the lesion may develop so
hence it is called as a kissing
lesion and there is a one more term
called as a kissing disease what is
kissing disease
it is infectious mononucleosis
okay so kissing disease is a infectious
mononucleosis caused by
epstein-barr virus so you have to
remember kissing
lesion is candidiasis whereas kissing
diseases
infectious mononucleosis which is caused
by epstein-barr
virus coming to the densest stomatitis
there are three this is a clinic picture
based question
so here there are three types of uh
candidiasis
include on the dangerous dermatitis so
the first one is the patient will have a
arithmetis region only on few focal
areas of the palate or the allele ridge
okay so if you take the type 2 densest
dermatitis
the patient will have the erythematos
region over the complete allele ridge
but if you take the type 3 the patient
will have a erythematous region
and also the granular type of lesions
granular lesions all over the palate
okay so the type 1 only focal
type 2 allele rich type 3
entire palette and you even you can see
the
granular growths also
and one more important thing that is
snail track ulcer if you see this is a
snail track type of ulcer where it does
it seem it is seen in the secondary
syphilis so don't confuse
if they ask about the single track ulcer
it is seen in the
secondary syphilis
one more thing hpv 16 okay
hpv 16 is more important because it is a
high risk
type of papilloma virus and most
commonly involved in the
carcinoma so hpv 16 is a very important
number because
it is a high risk and also associated
with most of the
oral carcinomas
what is this see the you have to
concentrate on the clinical picture
that is this is a horrible hairy
leukoplakia
and caused by epstein-barr virus and it
also
associated with hiv so they can ask you
are they present in the form of a
clinical picture so concentrate on the
clinical picture
which occurs mostly in the literal
border of the tongue
and it associated with the hiv and
caused by the
epstein-barr virus it is oral hairy
leukoplakia
so this is the classification of hiv
infection there are three groups that is
group one
two and three group one and two given
here the lesions which are strongly
associated with the hiv infection
which includes candidiasis hairy
leukoplakia
kaposi sarcoma non-hodgkin's lymphoma
and periodontal diseases so these are
the lesions which are strongly
associated with the
hiv infection but if you take the group
2 they are less commonly associated with
the
hiv infection that includes bacterial
infections
melanotic hyperpigmentation and
necrotizing ulcerative stomatitis okay
group 2 less commonly
whereas group 1 lesions strongly
associated with hiv
infection and here the lesions which are
seen in hiv infection that is bacterial
infections
drug reactions lycanoid reaction
epithelid angiomatosis fungal infections
other than candidiasis
neurological disturbances and recurrent
after stomatitis okay
so all these things are lesions which
are
seen in hiv infection so first one is
strongly associated
second the group two is less commonly
associated and third will be
seen in hiv infection
what is this alarm clock headache okay
alarm clock headache is seen in
spino palatine
and due to which ah
nerve damage there is a paraximal crying
during eating okay
so the paraxial crying during eating it
is due to the damage of
facial know this is very important
because of that this damage there is a
paraximal crying
now this is a what sign and and
which in seen in which syndrome so this
is called as a sternberg
sign okay remember sternbox sign and it
is seen in
marfan syndrome and this is also a
clinical picture based
question that is this is a sternberg
sign which is seen in
mafan syndrome
so this is a clinical based question so
you have to
identify the syndrome based upon the
facial features and it is very easy that
is
downs syndrome
so this is a down syndrome patient
and here even this patient is a down's
syndrome even this patient also has a
downs
syndrome so this is a direct question
they can ask to identify the syndrome so
based on the facial features you
have to identify the syndrome and you
can see here there is a frontal
bossing and in some patients there will
be of a hypoplastic maxillary mandible
again you have to mix these clinical
features that is
the more important thing you have to
note here is the
multiple oral papillomatous lesions okay
multiple oral papillomatic lesions
and you can see vats or the skin
manifestations
along with the patient may complain of a
uterine cancer array
breast cancer
so the multiple one important is this
the multiple oral papillomas
and the patient may have a complaint of
a breast cancer or
uterine cancer then your diagnosis will
be
cowed and syndrome so they can ask you
like
this combination type of questions also
with which is only diagram based okay
so you have to know the each and every
feature at least the important features
of
syndromes and what is this clinical
picture
so lion like faces it is seen in
pages this is okay so initially we have
red
bird like faces fish like faces frog
like faces now the lion like faces
it is seen in pages this is so remember
these faces what is this appearance of
the mucosa
you can see here this is a cobblestone
appearance okay cobblestone appearance
of
mucosa
where do you see this cobblestone
appearance
one important thing is
crohn's disease okay
and the second more thing is
hex disease okay so in the crohn's
disease
and the hex disease and also in the pios
tomatitis
vegetans okay so crons hex disease
and piopsomatitis vegetans you will see
the
cobblestone appearance of the over
mucosa so remember these three points
and also the picture
and based upon this can you diagnose the
syndrome that is nothing but
phrase syndrome how can you diagnose
this as a phrase syndrome
if you see here the patient has a
sweating
over here and that to the gauss statory
sweating that near the ear
and also you can see the flushing okay
so the flushing and the gauss stator
sweating is
associated with the phrase syndrome okay
now we'll diagnose few cases with their
clinical features or clinical
presentation
so here a patient i have written only
important points
or hints for the diagnosis okay the
patient complains of a
swelling in the floor of the mouth is
the first point
and that swelling is in six months
and that patient has pain
and that pain increases while eating
okay
and the fourth one on palpation it is
tender and
hard okay the swelling in the floor of
the mouth
since six months pain increases while
eating
and palpation it is tender and hot okay
so with
all these things if the floor of the
mouth so you can
think of few lesions like a granular
but okay so you can remove these two
lesions
okay why because on palpation it is
tender and hard okay whereas granular
and lipoma
will be soft and
non tender mostly they will be soft and
non tender okay
so there is only one one thing here that
is silo lip
okay relate to these points silo lit is
can be seen in the floor of the mouth
which is mostly because of that
submandibular silolith
and it will it can present since many
days like a chronic
salidinite and they have give the
patient had presented with it
so we will so the patient
has a swelling in the floor of the mouth
okay
since six months
so i have given only important hints for
the diagnosis
okay so the patient complains of a
swelling in the floor of the mouth that
is first
hint second will be it's a chronic
lesion that is
in six months thought is pain increases
while eating
and the fourth thing is palpation it is
tender and hot
okay so here the swelling in the floor
of the mouth what can you expect in this
floor of the mouth usually regular cases
you can go for the
granular or a lipoma
or a silo liquid
so but in palpation i have given that is
tender and hard right so you can you
have to eliminate the
options granules and lipoma these both
are soft in consistency and
non tender mostly they are soft in
consistency and
non tender and if you take the pain
increases while
eating okay see silo lithius then hard
inconsistency
and floor of the mouth yes it can
present in the floor of the mouth
because of that submandibular lesion or
if it involves a submandibular gland and
it can
present from six months yes it can
present from six months like a chronic
silentinitis
and one more important feature is pain
increases while eating so all these four
features are related to
your silo lip so the patient has pain
since
six months right so this is in six
months and the patient
has pain while eating increases while
eating so you can go for
chronic cy ladinitis
may be because patient is developing the
bacterial infection because of this
silo lithius okay so chronic salidinite
is secondary to
silo lithius can be your provisional
diagnosis
next one the patient has it is a 22 year
female that is young female
complain missing teeth on examination
the patient has space hair
periorbital pigmentation radio
salivation
and opg multiple missing teeth okay the
positive findings here
are space hair and reduce salivation so
with these things
along with missing teeth you can go for
your provisional diagnosis as ectodermal
dysplasia because the patient has the
reduced elevation and decreased
number of teeth and also the decreased
number of health that is
ectodermal structures are
this plastic here so you can go with the
provisional diagnosis
ectodermal dysplasia
and here the case the patient is a 40
years
male and he has radiotherapy completed
15 days back
and in this patient oral mucosa is
ulcerative and very tender
okay in which cases you can see oral
mucous are very
on ulceratives and tendons maybe you can
see in
infectious conditions
or you can see in autoimmune conditions
like our erosion lichen planus
or a pam figures so in these infectious
conditions or most commonly or a
autoimmune conditions you can see the
ulcerative or a tender oral mucosa
and even but
here there is a hint given that is
radiotherapy so the patient
had underwent radiotherapy so in these
type of patients the patient can develop
radiation mucositis so you can eliminate
these two
and you can go with radiation mucositis
with this positive finding that is
radiotherapy
so in the diagnosis provisional
diagnosis will be radiation
mucositis
