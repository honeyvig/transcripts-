everyone this is dr abhijit pursuing mds
in the department of conservative
dentistry and endodontics
i am going to discuss about muzzles of
mastication
these are a group of muscles that help
in movement of mandible
during chewing and speech all these
muscles
originate on skull and insert onto
mandible
they also play a role in the
configuration of face
here is a mnemonic to remember the
muscles of mastication
take time to chew food
the lettuce in the word time represents
muscles of mastication
t for temporalis eye for internal
terrigord
emperor masseter if a external terry god
internal pterygoid is also known as
medial terracoid
whereas external telecoil also known as
lateral pterygoid these muscles have
certain characteristic features
all these muscles develop from mesoderm
of
first pharyngeal arch that is mandibular
arch
hence they are supplied by the nerve of
that arch
these muscles are located in and around
infra temporal fossa
and are inserted into the ramus of the
mandible
these are concerned with the movements
of mandible at tmj
let us see in detail the origin
insertion
and action of each muscle masseter
this is a thick quadrilateral muscle
the muscle fibers are arranged in
multi-pin net
it is regarded as the strongest muzzle
of the body
it includes three layers superficial
layer middle layer and deep layer
let us see in detail the origin and
insertion of each layer
blue denotes the superficial layer which
arises from the
zygomatic arch and adjoining zygomatic
process of maxilla
and inserts onto the ramus of the
mandible
whereas the middle layer arises from the
posterior one-third of zygomatic arc
and inserts into the central portion of
the ramus of the mandible
and the deep layer arises from the
deep surface of the zygomatic arch and
inserts onto the
upper part of ramus and coronoid process
one important thing about masseter is
this is the most
commonly affected muscle in bruxism
temporalis this is a fan shaped muscle
it this muscle fills up the temporal
fossa
the muscle fibers are arranged in
different directions
anterior fibers run vertically downwards
middle fibers run obliquely and the
posterior fibers
run horizontally all these fibers
originate from inferior temporal line
and converge to form a tendon that
passes beneath the zygomatic arch
and attaches to coronoid process of
mandible
before discussing about pterygoids let
me familiarize you
with one special bone that is spinoid
it is also known as bad bone
the spinoid bone has two pterygoid
plates medial and lateral
both the pterygoid muscles arise from
lateral pterygoid plate
guys remember both the pterygoid muscles
arise from lateral teleguard plate
lateral terrigord this is a short
conical muscle
consisting of small upper head and a
large
lower head this is regarded as the key
muscle of the
infra temporal region
it is also known as external pterygoid
muscle
the upper head arises from the
infra-temporal surface
and crests of greater wing of spinoid
and
inserts onto the articular disc and
capsule of the tmj
whereas the lower head arises from the
lateral surface of lateral pterygoid
plate
and inserts onto the perigold phobia
present on the neck of the mandible
one important thing about this muzzle is
this is the most commonly affected
muscle in
myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome
medial paracord this is also
quadrilateral in shape
consisting of superficial head and deep
head
the superficial head arises from the
maxillary tuberosity and palatine bone
whereas the deep head
arises from the medial surface of
lateral pterygoid plate both these heads
insert into the medial surface of angle
and ramus of the mandible
close to the mandibular foramen and
myelohyde grow
this slide shows the actions of muscles
of mastication
protrusion is a forward moment of
mandible retraction is the backward
moment of the mandible
elevation is upward moment of mandible
depression is downward moment of the
mandible
among every muscle group there will be
one
or muscle which differs from others
with respect to muscles of mastication
lateral pterygoid is considered as odd
because
it causes depression of mandible that is
opening of the jaw whereas the other
three muscles
cause elevation of mandible that is
closing of the jaw
here is a mnemonic to remember the
action of lateral pterygoid muscle
when you pronounce the word lateral
there is opening of
jaw which indicates that lateral
pterygoid is associated with
depression of mandible apart from the
lateral pterygoid
there are certain accessory muscles
which cause
depression of mandible these include
myelohyde geniohyoid and digastric
both the medial pterygoid and lateral
pterygoid cause side to side grinding
moments
help in the protrusion of the mandible
when medial and lateral terragoids of
one side
act together the corresponding side of
the mandible
is rotated forwards and to the opposite
side
the superficial fibers of masseter also
cause
protrusion of mandible whereas the
posterior fibers of
temporalis help in the retraction of the
mandible
coming to vascular and nerve supply
since these muscles are derived from
first pharyngeal arch
these are supplied by the nerve of the
torch that is
mandible are now the masseter temporalis
and lateral terracode
derive their supply from the anterior
division of mandible arnold
whereas the medial pterygoid derives its
supply from the main trunk
with respect to blood supply all these
muscles
derive their arterial supply
from the second part of maxillary artery
which is a branch of
external carotid artery
this is a short discussion about muscles
of mastication
which includes all the important points
and thank you for
