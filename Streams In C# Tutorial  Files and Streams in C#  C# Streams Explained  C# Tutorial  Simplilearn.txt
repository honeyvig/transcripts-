hey everyone i am ravagandava and i
welcome you all to our simply learns
youtube channel today we will be going
over streams in c sharp but first let me
remind you that we have our daily
updates on numerous technologies so if
you are a techie looking for the latest
technological innovation then try
subscribing to our youtube channel and
don't forget to hit the bell icon and
never miss an update on simple
so now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin a session with a
discussion on what our streams
and their purpose in a real life
situation
then we will have a brief discussion on
the types of streams
following that we will discuss each of
these streams
one by one first we will go through
binary stream
then we will go through text stream
finally we will end this session with a
demo on reading and writing in a text
file
now let's get started with the
discussion on what are streams
first a stream is an organized sequence
of bytes
that is transmitted from one application
to input device to another
these bytes are transmitted and read
sequentially and always arrive in the
same sequence they were sent
next
streams are the main way of transmitting
information in the computer world
streams enable various programs to
access computer data and create network
connections with remote systems
then in the world of computers many
operations can be interpreted as either
reading or writing to a stream
for example printing sends a sequence of
bytes to a stream
associated with the corresponding port
to which the printer is connected
at last
when you read or write from or to a file
you must first open the stream to the
matching file then we will execute the
reading and the writing and then we have
to close the stream
next let's go over the type of stream
there are two types of streams defined
first we have binary string
then we have text strings
let's discuss them in detail
first let's have a look at binary
streams
a binary string comprises
one or more bytes of unique data
users may write the value contained in
an abstract object
to a bicorator or a binary string
and read back the identical value that
was recorded in the object when the user
wrote it
next
the library function do not change
the byte sent between the program and
the binary stream
they can however append an arbitrary
amount of null bytes
to the file that you write with the
binary string
the application must deal with the
additional null right at the conclusion
of the binary strings
then
except for positioning relative to the
end of the binary stream location within
a binary string is always well defined
the current file position indication can
be obtained and changed the same way as
a text stream can
finally
the file is viewed as a series of bytes
in a byte string
except for the potential changes
discussed previously
the stream appears to the application as
the same sequence of files
next
let's discuss text streams
a text stream comprises one or more
lines of text that may be written to a
text oriented display and viewed
next a software reads a nl or
new line at the end of each line
while reading from the text range
after that the software prints an anno
to signify the end of the line
when writing to a text frame
the library functions can change the
amount and representation of characters
transferred between the application and
a text stream to meet different
conventions for encoding text in files
among target environments
[Music]
the last
positioning is constrained inside a text
string
calling fk pose or f10 will
return the current file position
indication
by using fsetpole or fc command you may
place a text stream at a location
found in this manner as well as at the
start or end of the stream
finally let's conclude this session with
a demo to read or write on a text file
now we will start with creating a new
project
we will be creating a console app so
console
then we have
now we have these many options
note that we will be using a dotnet
framework one as well as which uses c
sharp
so let's use this
then we will go to next
let's name this
text file
demo
we will use the framework.net framework
4.7.2
then we will hit create
now let's get started
so first
we will define string
and name it
file
dir
then we will hit enter
now here we will be entering the file
path to which a text
text document will be stored
so
we will use accelerate then we will use
semicolon now we have to give an address
here
so let's first go over and create a new
folder i've already created a folder so
let's right click over there
here this is my folder x12 demo
now we will create a new
text document
we will name this
as demo file
let's name this this
now we will go over
properties
and we'll copy its location
ctrl c
we can close this
now
we will go back here
we'll paste this
we will add one back arrow
and write the name so name was demo file
let's make sure
that we are using the site name
demo files
should be capital
demo file
dot txt
now we will create a list
so we will have a list
[Music]
this list will have string
[Music]
we will name this
text
lines
equals to
new
[Music]
list
string
and close
[Music]
then we will write a file
function
file dot
read
we are using
file now it may happen that it's not
working
so what we will use is this using
system.io
this will give us the correct
directories to use these
so let's try it again so read all text
so we have options like read all text
read all bytes
let's suppose if we are using binary
stream or we are using text stream but
let's go and use you read all lines so
that it's easier to rope in both of
these cases
so we will use read all lines
[Music]
then we will give
the file path as file dir
dot
but now
by default
this file only uses a string error so we
will need to convert this whole thing
into
a list so we will use
to list
now you guys must be asking we haven't
added anything in that file
so list how is it going to read all
these all lines from that so first let's
go over to the text file
and add some data to it
so
here we'll open this
let's write some data
let's use superhero names so
it's open man
he is from dceo
then we have
batman
or let's use spiderman
he is from mcu
[Music]
then we can use hulk
again from see you
let's use someone from dc so let's use
flash
dc
eu
[Music]
let's have one more
wonder woman
[Music]
pvc
we have saved this
and close this
now we have added some data in these
so let's go back to our code
now
according to our code till now it should
have read all the data from the file but
now we have added this the data to file
about we check if it actually got added
or not
so let's have and for each
loop
so for each
line
for its
string
line
and
[Music]
text
life
[Music]
let's go this
okay
now we have better look at our code
so
then we will have console
dot
bright line
here we will have line
[Music]
now this will print out all the lines
now let's also add
a console
dot
redline
this command will make sure that
the window the console window which will
open when we will run this code will not
close it will only close after we hit
enter
now let's run this
and as you can see it has finally read
the data from the text file
now how about we can write something on
this
so we will close this
then after this forage
let's add some data to this list
so
we will use
text
lines
dot
add
and curly braces
let's add another superhero
iron man
and
x universe has mc
[Music]
now this will
add the data
to the list
but how do we write this data to the
file
so we will use
file
dot
write all lines
then
for the file path
we will give
our file dir
and
what we want to
write all these lines here will be from
the list text lines
now we will save this and let's run it
[Music]
but why is it not printing the new line
which we just added
that's because
this program
where this file
this printing function then before then
we were adding but it still did add
these lines
so to check that we can go
and check that file
let's open it
and here you can see we have ironman mcu
now
let's comment these lines so that we
don't add double values
now run this again
now
as you can see the ironman is added to
this list
and this is how you read and write to a
file
now let's get back to our slides and
