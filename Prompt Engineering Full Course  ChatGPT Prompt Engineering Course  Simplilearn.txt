Welcome to our course on prompt
engineering a field that transforms how
we interact with artificial intelligence
consider the story of a company named
artificial intelligence.com a digital
marketing firm that implemented an AI
model in their firm to generate
advertising content initially their AI
generated ads miss the mark often ofone
or irrelevant leading to poor customer
engagement and wasted Resources by
applying prompt engineering techniques
that company restructured how they fed
information to the AI especially prompts
specifying tone style and target
audience more clearly this adjustment
led to a 70% increase in campaign
Effectiveness and a significant rise in
client satisfaction so now we'll start
by explaining what pumpt engineering is
and why it's indispensable in leveraging
AI effectively you will learn about AI
machine learning and the applic ations
we will focus particularly on gp4 which
AIDS in task ranging from content
creation and SEO to coding and
presentations this course will equip you
with the skills to use gp4 including
understanding the features like memory
and how to develop your own AI tools or
plugins so join us to discover how
crafting the right prompts can unlock

up and enroll now you can find the
course Link in the description box and
pin comment so let's get started so guys
let's get started and let's understand
what is prompt engineering so prompt
engineering is like directing AI models
such as the advanced GPD 4 to ensure
they perform the best based on how you
ask your questions and now we'll see why
it's crucial so imagine you are seeking
restaurant recommendations if you ask
where should I eat tonight you might get
random suggestion but if you specify I
need a cozy Italian place for a date
night within walking distance you will
receive much more relevant advice that's
prompt engineering shaping your
questions to fetch the most useful
answers so this was about why it's
useful now we'll see the crafting
effective prompts so crafting effective
prompts so the number one reason is be
specific because detail is key asking an
AI what are some easy vegetarian dinners
that is better than just asking for
dinner ideas the next is provide context
adding context helps AI tailor its
responses like telling a friend a story
with enough background so they
understand the next is focus attention
highlight crucial details to keep the AI
focused on what matters most for your
question and then comes I trade as
needed refine your prompts based on the
responses similar to adjusting a recipe
to get it just right so this was about
crafting effective prompts so these are
the basic ones moving forward in this
course we'll see the most prominent
things that we can add in the prom that
will come in the next 4 to 5 minutes so
let's move to the next one and we'll see
a practical example for a prompt so the
example is suppose you are using AI to
plan a birthday party a v prompt might
be that how do I plan a party and this
could lead to a generic checklist
however a well-crafted prompt can be
like what are some creative themes for a
10-year-old's outdoor birthday party in
summer and what games would you
recommend so this Pro will likely result
in more specific and acable ideas so
this is how you can generate a prompt so
prompt engineering is essentially about
making AI work smarter for you
transforming complex task into simple
enjoyable activities it's a skill that
enhances your interactions with
technology making every AI encounter
more effective and engaging so having
explored what prompt engineering is and
how to craft effective prompts let's now
dive into the various ways this skill
can be applied so prompt engineering is
not just a technical skill for AI
specialist it has practical uses in
nearly every industry imaginable from
enhancing customer interactions to
streamlining software development the
applications are vast and varied so
let's see some of the key use cases so
the number one use case is content
creation so in digital marketing and
blogging prompt engineering helps
generate targeted content such as
articles social media post and marketing
copy that resonates with specific
audiences the next is customer support
AI can be used to automate responses in
customer service well-crafted prompts
ensure that the responses are accurate
helpful and contextually appropriate
then comes software development
developers use prompt engineering to
generate code Snippets debug programs or
even use AI to conceptualize new
software Solutions then comes Education
and Training EI can tailor educational
content to students learning levels or
answer specific academic queries making
learning more personalized and efficient
and then comes market research and data
analysis by directing AI to analyze
large data set with specific prompts
businesses can extract meaningful
insights about market trends customer
preferences and operational efficiencies
and then comes Healthcare in medical
settings AI can assist with diagnosing
from symptoms described in prompts or
help in researching treatment options by
processing medical literature and then
comes legal and compliance that is the
most used case for the ai ai can help
pass through vast amounts of legal
documents to find relevant precedents or
compliance issues based on prompts
tailor to specific legal questions or
topics these use cases illustrate the
versatility of prompt engineering
highlighting its potential to enhance
productivity and creativity across a
wide range of Industries so these were
the use cases now we'll see the flow of
AI Technologies from where this llm
models or the large language models or
gp4 that's an example come into action
so let's start with the flow so AI is
the overarching category that defines
the goal of creating machines capable of
Performing task that would require
intelligence if done by humans and then
comes ml so ml is a method within AI
focused on giving machines the ability
to learn from data then comes deep
learning so deep learning is a technique
within ml that uses layered neural
networks to analyze various factors of
the data and then comes llms that are
large language models data specialized
application of deep learning focused on
understanding and generalizing and
generating human language this hierarchy
moves from broad General techniques and
applications down to more specialized
and sophisticated systems showing how
foundational Concepts in AI lead to more
advanced implementations so this was all
about a conceptual or the context of the
prompt engineering now moving to the
applications of prompt engineering and
we'll be using gp4 for this purpose and
we will be writing prompts in the gp4
and asking the gp4 model to provide us
the relevant answers so let's move to
gp4 so as you search on on any of your
browser that would be
open
open.com you would be directed to this
website and and here are their products
that is chat GPD that is for everyone
for teams for enterprising and there has
been a pricing listed here so you could
come here and click on chat JY login and
after proceeding with your credentials
you can log in into chat JP and start
writing your prompts so coming back to
the open a website so you could see here
that's a research and the latest
advancements that is GP 4 d 3 Sora so
GPT 40
that's a model that has been developed
by open AI that can use the camera or
the vision technology and can tell you
that what object it is and if you show
him a code snippet that will tell you
what that code snippet has been written
for and if you use that to just scan
writing on any of your pages or any of
your copy it will just scan it and
translate to you in what language it has
been written and you can translate to
any other language and then comes T 3
that is used to create images and then
we have Sora that is used to create
videos so now moving to the next that is
products and you could see that the chat
GPT these are the versions that are for
everyone for teams for Enterprises and
then we have the pricing for that and
here we have the chat jpd API or open a
API so you could click on that and see
so before that before going to the API
we move to documentation and let's have
an overview of all the things so here's
an introduction about the key Concepts
that is tax generation models that is
gp4 and GPT 3.5 then there are
assistants that gp4 can be act as a
assistant to anyone and then we have the
embeddings that is it's a vector
representation of a piece of data that
is meant to preserve aspects of its
content or its meaning and then comes
the tokens so there are tokens so you
could see here that text generation and
edding models process text in chunks
that are called tokens and as a rough
rule of thumb one token is approximately
four characters or 0.75 words for
English text so these are tokens and now
moving to models so we have GPT 40 gp4
turbo 3.5 turbo and here are all the
models that are listed by open AI so
here we'll be talking about GPD 4 so gp4
that's a large language multimodel model
and it has multilingual capabilities
that has multilingual capabilities and
you can ask him any question in any
language and then we have Del that is
used to create images then we have TTS
whisper and then the medings so let's
move to chat jpd and before that let's
have a API reference that is if you want
to use open AI API or you want to
integrate to create a chat board or we
have seen a use case that is to create a
customer service representation so for
that you could use this open a API so
for that you have to install the open
module with the command pip install open
and after that you could use the npm and
here are the API keys from where you can
generate it and they have provided you
all the steps how you can use it for
streaming purpose for the audio to
create speech this is how you could use
the API to create your own models so
this is the interface of chat GP or gp4
so this is the overiew of chat GPT and
here we write the prompts that is the
message box and this is the login person
that has login and if you click here you
could see my plan and we have purchased
the plus plan that is $420 per month and
the other features also we will come to
that so let's see one of those that is
customiz chat GPT so here you could
write custom instructions that what
response you want from chat GPT so you
could mention here that I want the tone
to be specific mild not to be too loud
and you can ask him don't use uh
Advanced English I want the answer to be
prompt and in a simple English manner so
you could write instructions for the
responses you want to have and this is
the window if you click on that you
could see explore GPT section and here
is the History Section that what you
have written and what prompts and what
responses you have created till date so
if you click on this you could get a new
window for chat gp4 and these are the
models that are listed here that is chat
GPT 40 chat gp4 GPD 3.5 and this is the
temporary chat section we'll discuss
about all this but but currently we'll
start with the types of prompts or
generating the prompts and what things
to consider while generating the prompts
so moving
back so let's see how you can create a
prompt so you have to have six things in
prompt to make it more precise number
one is context so this sets the scene or
provides background information
necessary for understanding the promt
for example if you're writing a promt
that in a world where artificial
intelligence has replaced most jobs
describe a day in the life of a human
worker so you have asked him and
provided the context here and then we
have task so the specific action or
question that the responder needs to
address so if you are writing a prompt
number one is context that needs to be
included then comes the task so what
task you want the GPT to act and provide
the response so for example write an
essay on the effects of global warming
on agriculture so you have provided the
task here that is write an essay so now
the next thing is Persona so Persona
specifies the Identity or role the
responder should assume while answering
for example as a medical professional
advise a patient on managing type two
diabetes without medication so this is
the Persona then comes format so Define
how the response should be structured or
presented for example list five tips for
improving personal product productivity
in bullet points so the format you have
asked him to address the personal
productivity in bullet points so that's
a format you have asked him and then
comes exampler so if you want to give
the example to GPT that we have a sample
here use that and provide us a response
according to that so for example
sometimes a sample answer or part of an
answer is given to illustrate the
expected style or content so we'll have
a prompt example here like in the
example with the protagonist overcomes
fear write a story about overcoming a
personal challenge so this is the
example that we can give to an llm model
and then comes the tone in which tone
you need the answer so indicate the mood
or attitude the response should convey
for example write a humorous blog post
about the trials of parenting todlers so
you have mentioned what humorous blog
you want the tone as a humorous blog so
with the right technique you can prompts
that are not only precise but also
versatile suitable for any learning
management system so this approach
ensures that prompts will engage
students encourage critical thinking and
drive meaningful discussions no matter
what the platform is as we are using the
gp4 here so you could use clae or
anthropic like there are many platforms
you can use any of them with these type
of crafting the promps techniques so
Embrace these strategies and you will be
equipped to create promps that resonate
across various educational environments
enhancing The Learning Experience for
all each component plays a crucial role
in guiding the response to ensure it
meets the decided objective and quality
so let's see some of the examples and we
will use all the context or all the
types that can be used to create a
prompt so our first example is as a
nutritionist speaking at a high school
career day create a presentation
outlining the importance of healthy
eating head habits for teenagers and use
a friendly and engaging tone and include
real life success stories to illustrate
your points so the context here is high
school career day you have given a
context and the task you want is create
a presentation on healthy eating habits
and then comes the Persona that is
nutritionist you have asked him that you
act as a nutritionist here and then the
format you want all the response in a
presentation that is presentation with
real life stories and then comes the
exampler so you want real life success
stories here and you have set the tone
here that is friendly and engaging so if
you write this prompt in gp4 so let's
ask this prompt from the gp4 and let's
see what he answers so we are mentioning
as a
nutritionist I don't remember the
spelling but uh we'll write So speaking
at
a high school career
day create a
presentation
outlining the
importance and importance uh what we
writing importance of healthy heating
habits for teenagers
and what we want here is use
a friendly
[Music]
tone and
[Music]
include real
life success
stories to
illustrate your
points so let's see uh how does the chat
respond as we have mentioned all the
types of prompt or all the components of
prompt that can be used to create a
prompt that is context task Persona
format exampler and tone so you could
see that he has started providing the
response with the slides that is slide
one introduction slide two why nutrition
matters slide three the teenage plate
and slide four the success story so this
is how you could write a prompt and you
could get a fully structured response as
you want if you want to like moderate
this response or alter this response as
you are not satisfied with it you can go
on and write some more prompts to get it
more precise so we'll see another
example for that imagine you are a
Sci-Fi author writing a short story set
in a future where water is scar where
water is scars so craft a narrative that
explos the daily challenges faced by a
family using a dramatic and suspenseful
tone so what we'll see here is context
that we have mentioned that is future
world with water scarcity and the task
we have asked him for the GPD model is
write a short story The Persona that we
have given to the llm model that is GPT
is that you are a Sci-Fi author and the
format we want is narrative and the
example we have given is the daily
challenges of a family and the tone is
dramatic and suspensible so we have
mentioned all the things for a prompt
that could be created a better response
so similarly we'll see another example
so this example is as a financial
advisor prepare a guide for young adults
on managing finances after college so
use a conversational tone including
actionable steps and start with the
story of a recent graduate to illustrate
common Financial pitfalls so we have
mentioned the context here that is
financial management post College the
task is to prepare a financial guide the
Persona financial advisor and the format
we need is guide with actionable steps
and the example we have given is story
of a recent graduate the tone is
conversational and this was all about
this form similarly we'll see another
example that is as a war correspondent
draft a report on the effects of the
conflict on civilian life focusing on a
particular City use a serious tone and
provide interviews as examplers to
underscore the human aspect of the story
so the context here is effects of War on
a particular City's civilian life and
the task is draft a report and the
Persona is more correspondent the format
is Report with interviews and the
example we mentioned here is interviews
with civilians and the tone we have set
here is serious and impactful so we have
seen some of the examples for the prompt
creation now we'll see the examples for
writing proms for a particular field so
we'll start with number number one field
that is content creation so we have
mentioned some of the use cases for
prompt engineering so starting with
number one that is content creation and
here we'll write a prompt and that could
be that as a marketing manager draft a
blog post aimed a new entrepreneurs on
the importance of branding so use an
authoritative yet approachable tone
including examples of successful Brands
to illustrate key points so let's write
this so as a market
manager draft a blog
post aimed at new
entrepreneurs on the
importance of
branding use an authoritative
yet approachable
tone including
examples of successful
Brands to illustrate key
points so this prompt we have written
for the content creation
so similarly you can ask him to write a
story or draft a blog post or write any
content that you have asked him a
Persona here that is marketing manager
so let's simplify this prompt we have
marked the context here that is blogging
for new entrepreneurs and the task we
have asked him is draft a blog post on
branding and the Persona that we are
asking the GP to act as a marketing
manager and the format is blog post with
examples and example that we have given
him is casee studies of successful
Brands and the tone we want is
authoritative and approachable so
similarly you can write promts for
Content creation that I want to create a
blog post or I want to create a YouTube
video or I want to create an article so
provide me a storyline how can I
approach a particular topic that could
be what is llm and as we can write it
here that act
as AI
specialist
and help me write an
article on
topic what is
llm and and keep the tone in engaging
manner so you could see that CH has
started generating the response that is
he's creating an article on what is a
large language model and he has decided
the title here and providing all the
content for your article so what we have
provided here is context that is we want
an article on what is llm and the
Persona that act as a EI specialist and
the format we want an article and we
have set the tone here that is in an
engaging manner so similarly you can
draft other PRS and you could help them
with your content creation Journey so
moving to next example that is for SEO
purpose so there's another use case that
is SEO and for that we can write prompts
that imagine you are an SEO expert
running a workshop so create a
presentation that explains the basics of
SEO including practical tips on keyword
research and Link building and use a
professional yet engaging tone to keep
your audience interested so similarly
you could have a prompt in your large
language model and ask him with all the
components of prompt and we can wait for
the answer and let's see but it responds
so imagine you are an SE expert here we
are asking the GPT to act as a SE
Persona or SEO
expert and we are asking him that you
are running a workshop also so we are
setting a context
and asking him to create a
presentation that
explains the basics of
SEO including practical
tips on keyword research and Link
building and now we'll set a tone here
that is use a
professional use a professional yet
engaging and now we set the tone here
that is use a professional yet engaging
tone to keep your audience
interested so we have crafted a prompt
here that is for the SEO purpose
and similarly you can create your own
but so let's simplify this prompt and
see what context task or Persona we have
mentioned here so the context here is
SEO workshop and the task we have
assigned to llm is create a presentation
of SEO Basics and the Persona that we
have asked the gbts to act as a su
expert and the format we want the
responses in slide presentation with
tips and the example we have given him
is screenshots of SEO tools and the tone
we have asked him is Prof Prof and
engaging so you could see the response
that has been generated by the
gp4 that he has provided us that in
slide one you could have a introduction
slide with a title and the opening
remarks and then in slide two you could
have the title that is what is SEO you
could mention the definition here and
what would be the goal for this
presentation and similarly we have the
slide three that is for how do search
engines work and then we have slide four
slide five and similarly all the slides
and you could just mention how many
slides you want and you can also mention
how many slides you want as a response
so this was about the SEO thing now mve
to the next use case that is for
developers so for developers we can
draft a PR that as a software engineer
write a tutorial for beginners on
writing the first web application using
react include step-by-step instructions
and code Snippets make your tutorial
detailed yet easy to follow so this is
one of the prompts similarly you could
ask him to debug any code you can
provide a code snippet to GPT and he
will debug the code and provide all the
necessary changes that can be made to
the code snippet so for this we will
write an example that so we'll write the
prompt here that as a software
engineer and we are asking him to write
a tutorial for beginners
on building the first web application
using
react using react and include stepbystep
instructions and code
Snippets so we'll write here that
include step by-step instructions
and code
Snippets and make your tutorial detailed
yet easy to
follow so you could see that our gp4 has
started generating the response and
similarly you you could ask him to
generate some code for a particular
application or you could also create a
website by just asking him the HTML file
the CSS file and the Javascript file and
what options or the applications you
want a website should have so first see
the response that chj has
created so you could see that he is
writing a tutorial for beginners on
building the first web application so
first we will see the simplification of
this prompt that is we have set the
context here that is tutorial for
building web applications and we have
assigned a task to the GPD that is write
a tutorial on react and the Persona we
have given him is as a software engineer
and the format we want the response is
in tutorial with Cod Snippets and the
example we have given is example project
and the tone is informative and clear so
you could see here that he is providing
the code Snippets for setting up your
project then navigating into your
project directory and starting the
development server and then creating a
list component as you go along you could
see that he has created the whole
tutorial and if you want the tutorial to
be specific that in the first tutorial
you want just setting up your project
you could ask him and he will create
that for you and in the second one you
want it to navigate into your project
directory or you want to create your
first web app that GPT will help you
create that and similarly if if I ask
him that as a software developer or act
as a software
developer we are giving a Persona to
him help me
create a travel
website and make it
engaging and easy to handle and user
friendly so you could see that gbd4 has
started creating the response and you
could see that he's providing us the
steps that is to define the scope and
features of the website and if you want
the code Snippets you can ask him that I
want the HTML file for the current
website so he will provide you HTML file
if you want any any modifications or
want to alter that you could provide him
the prompts that I want a specific
navigation bar or the search
functionality or the visuals so
similarly the gp4 will act upon the
prompts and provide you the code
Snippets that would be helpful in
creating your website so now moving to
the next use case that is data analysis
so for data analysis so you could see a
pin bar here here you could upload the
documents from computer that could be
your text files XLS files or you could
connect it to the Google drive or the
Microsoft One drive and have your
documents here so we will paste a xlx
file that would be for the data analysis
purpose so here is the Excel data here
we are uploading it and providing it to
chat GPT and I will open for you guys so
you could also see
so I have this data for a particular
company so you could see that they have
the order IDs and the quarterly order
date the shipping date and the shipment
mode so we will use this data and ask
the chat GPT to simplify this data or
analyze the data and provide us some
that could be paper tables or creating
bar graphs or bar charts or provid us
the kpis for the particular data so
starting with we will provide a simple
prompt to chat jpd that is you are a
data analyst conducting a workshop
prepare a guide that teaches how to
create effective dashboards in Excel and
include practical examples and visual
aids to enhance understanding and use a
direct and instructional tone so
starting here we will ask him that you
are a data
analyst and we'll start with that file
only we will upload that
file that is Excel
data and we have the file open
here so we will ask him to create a
payer table so we'll write a prompt that
you are a data analyst and I
have provided
you a sample
data create a pivot table
so let's move to the table and see that
we can create a p table with sales and
Order date so we'll ask him that create
a pivot
table
and a corresponding
chart to
analyze sales
performance by order date
so let's wait for the response and you
could see here that he started analyzing
it and I have something more for you if
you go to explore GPT
section you could see here that these
are the gpts provided by open Ai and
other creators these are the training
ones that is image generator scholar GPT
and these are provided by chat jpt that
is D data analyst creative writing Cod
modes coloring book hero so you can use
this
I will show you guys but before that but
before that we will move back and see
what our prompt has generated the
response so you could see that CH J is
asking that it appears that the Excel
file contains several columns related to
sales data including some duplicate or
similar columns with variations and
names so to simplify the analysis I will
focus on the main columns like order
date and customer name so we will ask
him to proceed with that only
yes proceed with
that and if you click here this is the
analysis this is the code that you could
use to do the analysis so you could see
that it has started generating the
response and he is generating the chart
here so here is the chart and he is
provided the description that this line
chart showcase the sales performance
over time based on the provided order
dates and you can see how sales FL
fluctuate on different dates which help
in identifying Trends Seasons impacts or
specific dates with high sales volumes
so if you need further analysis or
adjustment to the Chart feel free to let
me know and if you click here you could
see all the analysis and all the code
Snippets that are used by the chat jbt
to do and create a bar graph here so you
could use this code and you could use
any ID that could be Visual Studio code
or any ID that you have hands on and you
could do the similar analysis there so
this was about the data analysis use
case now moving to the next one that is
for educational purpose so if you want
to learn something or you want a road
map to learn any programming language
you could use these chat GPT or the llm
models for a particular road map so for
that you could write a prompt that as a
experienced educator write a road map
for learning Python Programming and
provide a road map that should cater to
beginners and include sources practical
exercises and Milestones and use an
encouraging tone to motivate Turners so
let's see but this llm or gp4 provides a
response to this prompt so we'll ask him
that as a
experienced
educator write a road
map for learning Python programming
and the road
map should
cater to
beginners and include
resources practical
exercises and Milestones
use an encouraging
tone to
motivate
Learners so let's provide this prom and
see but our GPT will respond to that so
let's simplify this promp so we have set
the context here that is we are learning
a Python Programming and we have
assigned a task to the llm model that is
write a learning road map and the
Persona we have asked him to be as a
educator and the format we want is a
road map with resources and the example
we provided him is step by step
progression and we've said that tone is
encouraging and supportive so let's see
what response the chat has provided to
us so you could see that he has proved a
step one that is understanding the
basics and the goal here is get familiar
with python syntax and basic programming
Concepts and the resources we have
provided is documentation for python
that is python.org
code academy python course and then we
have exercises Milestone and now moving
to the step two that is diving deeper
and the duration is 3 to four weeks and
the goal is to explore more complex
programming Concepts like data
structures and loops and we have the
exercises here and he mentioned the
resources and the Milestones similarly
you could see that he has proved the
full road map with step three that is
with applying projects in Python and
then we have step four exploring
Advanced topics and then we have joining
the python community and then the
conclusions so similarly you could have
a road map with him and ask him that you
act as a educator and a guide to me and
I will start with this road map and
provide the road map to a day wise
columns and you start with the day one
and ask him to judge me or examine me
with the knowledge or the basics that I
have concurred through the day one so he
will act as a educator and he will
examine all the information or all the
skills you have gained and ask you
questions and analyze them and help you
get through the road map easily so this
is all about the educator use case now
move to the next use case that is legal
and compliance so for the legal and
compliance use case we could have an
example as a prompt that is as a legal
adviser specializing in data privacy
create a compliance checklist for for
small businesses managing online
customer data use a formal yet
accessible tone and include examples of
common compliance pitfalls and how to
avoid them so you could ask the Char as
a legal guider or as a legal adviser
that will guide you for the particular
Acts or the compliances that are aligned
with judicial custodies of your country
so we have a prompt here and we'll ask
the
chat that as a legal
adviser specializing in data
privacy so create a compliance checklist
here for small businesses
managing online customer
data and use a formal
tone and include
examples of common
compliance of common compliance pit
fs and how to wordid them
so we will simplify the prompt here that
is we have provided a context that is
compliance with data privacy laws for
small businesses and we have assigned a
task that is create a compliance
checklist and the person I we have
asking the GPD to act as a legal adviser
and the format we want the response is
in checklist with examples and the
example we have provided is case
scenario of non compliance and the tone
we want is formal and accessible so
similarly you could have have other
legal advisers with chat JP and what you
need to do is if you want to read any
act or you want to analyze any act you
could provide the documents to chat jpt
and he will Analyze That and provide
what rules or regulations you need to
follow or with what compliances you
should move forward with that act so you
could see here that he's drafting a
document with all the compliance efforts
for small businesses so with that we
have done with the legal and compliance
use case now moving to the next use case
that is Healthcare so in healthcare we
can have an example prompt that you are
a medical researcher presenting at a
conference on the advances in tele
medicine so prepare a detailed paper
discussing the impact of tele medicine
on patient care during the pandemic
using clinical studies as references and
maintain a scholarly get engaging tone
to Captivate your professional audience
or in the healthcare section you could
also also have a diet plan or a chart
plan and you could ask him recipes for a
particular diet and you could also
mention if you have any allergies so we
will act with a prompt
here so let's write here that you are a
ditian so provide me a
recipe that is
healthy
and include
carbs protein
content and a small amount of
fat and
remember that I am
allergic to peanuts so you have set the
context here and the
that you are a dietician and you are
asking a prompt that you want a recipe
that is healthy and include cars so you
could see that Chad j has started
generating the response and he is
suggesting a CA chicken salad so you can
also mention that you are a vegetarian
or nonvegetarian and similarly CH will
act upon that and he has provided all
the instructions and all the ingredients
for the recipe so similarly you could
use the promps for for the healthcare
use case now coming to the next use case
that is customer support so we could
have an example for that that is as a
customer service trainer we will design
a training module for new agents that
focuses on handling difficult customer
interactions and include roleplay
scenarios key phrases to use and tips
for maintaining professionalism so use
an instructive and supportive tone to
encourage learning and confidence among
trainers so let's draft this prompt and
let's see what does chat jpt respond to
that so we'll ask him that as a customer
service
trainer design a training
module for new
agents that
focuses on
handling difficult customer interactions
include role play
scenarios key phrases to
use and tips for maintaining
professionalism
so use an instructive and supportive
tone to encourage learning and
confidence among
trainers so we are setting the tone here
that is use an
instructive and
supportive and setting the tone to
encourage learning and confidence among
traines
so let's proceed with the prompt and now
we can see that we have set the context
that is training for customer service
agents and the task we have assigned is
designer training module and the Persona
we have set here is customer service
trainer and the format we want the
response is a training module with role
plays and the example we have set here
is scripts and responses for role plays
and the tone we want the responses and
instructor and supportive so you could
see that CH has started generating the
response and given a model overview that
you could have understanding difficult
interactions then communication skills
and key phrases roleplay scenarios
maintaining professionalism and module
review and assessment so he has drafted
a whole new training module for the new
agents that can handle difficult
customer interactions with this module
so this was all for the customer support
use case now move to the use case where
you could create PowerPoint
presentations using the VBA code that is
provided by CH jpd so let's ask him to
write a VBA code so we'll write a prompt
that act as
a presentation
specialist and write a VBA
code to create a
presentation on
topic verce
llm and provide the
steps
where we can use the VP
code to create
one and you could also set the tone here
but let's see what chat JP respond to
that and we will open a presentation
here so we will open a blank
presentation and for using the VBA code
to create a presentation what you need
here is developer options in your
PowerPoint as I've already enabled them
you could enable them by just right
clicking on the ribbon and clicking on
customize the ribbon and you could see
here the developer options as as I've
already enabled it I will checkbox the
tick and apply it so after applying it
move to the developer option click on
Visual Basic and after that click on
insert user form and click on module
section here now coming back to a GPT
and he has created the VBA code we will
just copy it and paste in the module
section getting back to the module
section we'll paste it here and click on
this play button that is run sub or user
form so you could see that there's a
runtime error that is an error occurred
while PowerPoint was saving the file
let's debug it and we'll run it
again as we getting the error again here
so we'll try to copy the error and
provide it to chat jpt so let's ask him
that we're getting an error on this I
have
encountered an
error and the error
is and we'll ask him that the error is
while saving the
file so let's see how does he provide
the response to this
query so he's writing the modified VBA
code we will copy that and move back to
module and paste it here and let's see
if it works or not currently we are
having the same error and now moving
back
let's see what it provides
here so you could see that we are not
saving the presentation now and he has
generated the pp for us and this is the
basic PPD you can customize it you can
ask the chat jpd to create dialogue
boxes or insert shapes or you could just
choose a design from here and make your
PPT or the presentation a goodlooking
one so now moving back to GP model so
this is all about the use cases we have
hands on the prompts now now we'll see
the key features of chat GPT and some
are newly introduced we will have a
hands on the memory feature that has
been latest introduction by the open AI
so if you click on the settings and move
to personalization section we have a
memory feature here that is you could
store the memory that we entered as a
prompt in chat JP so the chat jpt memory
section works by capturing and
summarizing key information you provide
using your interactions so unlike
onetime commands that need to be
repeated in every session this memory is
designed to retain useful details and
automatically incorporate them into
future interactions so this means chat
gbt can adapt over time improving its
response based on the history and
context it has accumulated almost like
it's getting to know you better with
each chat and if you want to delete some
chats you could move into the manage
section and these are the memories that
has been created with chat jpd if you
want to delete one you could delete it
from here or you could just write a
prompt or you could just write a prompt
that I want to delete the memory and you
can mention some keywords there so this
was about the chat jpt memory section
and if we go to settings we have data
controls that if you want to export data
you could export the whole chat and send
it to someone else and similarly you
have the security feature if you want to
have multiactor authentication enabled
on your gbt you could do that and you
can have some connected apps that could
be Google Drive Microsoft One Drive
and we have a builder profile section
also that is if you want to build your
profile here you could place your
LinkedIn mail ID and the GitHub section
and you could also link your X account
and then we have speech module here that
is you want to listen Something by A
chbt you could have a voice assistant
here and listen to a particular voice so
this was all about the features of chat
gbt now moving to the chat GPD or
explore GPD section here I have shown
you that these are the GPS created by
creators and some are created by chat
GPT on and here you have an option to
create your own chat GPT or the GPT
model so to create that you just have to
write prompts here
that I want to
create a data
analysis GPT and you could write more
prompts here and you will having a
preview here how your GPT looks and
here's a configure section where you
could name your GPT provide a
description to it and the instructions
and you could have the capabilities of
web browsing or the D image generation
and you can add an IOD for your GPT here
so you could see the preview here that
he has provided a sample prompts with
the data analysis insights and
visualization support so this is how you
can create a GP on your own then we have
a feature that is temporary chat as we
have discussed about the chat GPT memory
so it's Source memory as you ask him or
write a prompt that remember I want all
my responses to be a tone specific and
they should be emphasizing so he will
support this and store this memory into
chat GPT memory section and use that as
a response for the next upcoming
responses and if you don't want chat JP
to store this as a memory you could use
a temporary chat section here so you
just have to click on chat jpt 4 drop
down and here we have temporary chat you
just enable it and here you can have a
chat with the llm model or gp4 model
here and he won't be storing any feature
or any memory regarding this chat and
with that guys we have come to the end
of this session and I hope that you have
a handson prompt creation now and if you
guys have any doubt com comment down in
