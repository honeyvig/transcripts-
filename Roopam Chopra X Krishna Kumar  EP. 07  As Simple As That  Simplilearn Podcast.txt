nothing much I am born and brought up in
Maharashtra so I'm a maharashtrian uh my
schooling your name is choa not Punjabi
yeah that's the catch actually I am a
maharashtrian married to a Punjabi who
is born and brought up in Rajasthan but
after getting married we spent 23 years
in Delhi so uh I am all over India like
uh being there so that's a beauty of
India that's a beauty yes and I've been
through many many religions and really
seen the Integrity uh that we have in
India in different cultures and yet we
are one so I'm born in nagpur
Maharashtra uh yes my my name is rupam
Chopra I'm married to a Punjabi who uh
lived in Rajasthan born and brought up
in Rajasthan and the two of us then we
lived in Delhi harana so it's multiple
cultures that I have experienced in my
life um my family was a educational
learned intellectual kind of background
family my father was a head of the
Department of
zoology uh my sister is a doctor my
another sister is a
mathematician and both families are full
of phds and all I'm proba the only odd
one out who has done
engineering uh my husband is also an
engineer and my your husband uh in the
engineering College of course yes and my
daughter is doing MBS your daughter is
back to she's she's also doing medicine
so very nice so only one daughter have
three sisters and and I have two
daughters the Elder one is doing
medicine uh and the younger one is she's
in 12th but she also intends to pursue
engineering oh very
nice so
so tell me about your like first job so
you both were inine you were in college
and then did you get your first job
through campus placement or you had to
go out and find job like how was your
first job getting into the first
corporate job sure my first job was
actually a referral okay uh
interestingly in Sapient through the
referal of my husband who was in Sapient
he is in the networking Department uh
Telecom and networking department but he
referred me for uh the software
development area and at that time Visual
Basic was the in thing and I was
certified in Visual Basic and uh I was
lucky enough to pass that exam and get
into Sapient um Sapient was uh for a
fresher who is newly into a job it's
like the
foundation and it taught me so much I
still carry the values that it emed in
me uh I learned from the seniors uh the
PE the kind of hiring they were doing in
Sapient at that time uh because it was
just launched in India it was the first
time it had come to India so they were
only hiring uh people from the elite
colleges uh and me coming from otherwise
know average background I had an
opportunity to work with one of the best
in the industry they are still doing
very well they the one of the best in
the industries and I had opportunity to
work with them learn from them carry
those cultures and suncar and know now
that I am in one of the similar
positions I am for sure this CPN also at
the end of the day it servic is company
but they're always differentiated they
always looked at the highend part of the
services that time also now also that's
like I completely understand that part
so how long you were in C like 3 four
years or first few years seven years so
for seven years you had chances you must
have grown from a Visual Basic
programmer to a manager level right so
what was your last designation when you
left they call it a senior associate
okay yeah so you made a point point that
since you a Visual Basic certified and
that's how you were able to crack the
exam and got it if I like dial back to
97 when you must have got your first job
so in 97 not many people used to talk
about teching certifications and teching
trading so who inspired you to take your
Visual Basic certificate because you you
had not got job by the time since you
were certified you could clear the job
so where did you get this idea of the
usual basic what was the like trigger
point or inspiration or when did you get
that thought that I should do this sure
um it was was actually 2001 okay uh
between 97 and 2001 I went through uh
personal transition um I lost my father
in
1995 and then it was just my mother and
me um that's my father's passing away is
another interesting story a very tragic
interesting and a lot of learning story
I'll share that with you but coming back
to the discussion uh since it was just
my mother and me just like all Indian
mother she was worried for getting me
married uh so I thought let me do that
first and uh we went to chandigar I was
into it training institutes like eptech
and it we used to have at that time the
local institutes I was teaching there so
I have not recorded that in my resume
but I was really not into it software
development working as a professional
until 2001 so you you completed your
Engineering in 97 so that four years
you're saying that you also acting as a
it trainer in the trainer settling down
getting married got so in that period
itself you had done this visual B
because maybe you might might be
teaching that to the students we had
that Microsoft Visual Basic big book
with a CD the white color right yes a
blue color I think yeah and
certification was also happening at that
time so I did that so that certification
like indirectly helped you in cracking
that exam and you got your first job and
you walked there for seven years in in
that sevene period also did you did so
of course you learned on the job and had
some of the best people working for them
so you must have learned a lot from your
colleagues as well as seniors but did
you do any specific program also there
seven years or not really during that
that seven year period like taking any
any other certification any other course
that you remember yes of course uh
vignette was one of the big things at
that time content Management Systems so
VN is a Content man I don't know it's a
Content management kind of a software
yes uh we used to use a language called
stcl I work I learned Java I have worked
a lot on Js ASP at the time was a lot of
so I did software development for a long
time and it was the time of dialup
Internet so setting of operating system
browser lab for testing was a big thing
it was a big task using the uh dialup
connections so that's how I got a little
bit of experience into testing um and uh
that my first experience of successfully
setting up one of the OS browsers lab
was what uh people suggested me that why
don't you consider a career in testing
okay with quality uh as an uh integral
character of my personality um I did
have an inclination towards testing but
I thought uh having a core technical
knowledge that a software developer has
as a or a designer or an architect has
is very important so I did continue in
the core software development line for
quite some time let's say 7 to eight
years in parallel the testing Journey
had started and again in parall the
third parallel was uh quality Frameworks
like CMM so my first experience with CMM
was incipient so part of the CMM Jour
that inent yes what happened to CM
nobody talks about CM I think I wanted
to ask this question later on but maybe
I not get a time but every company used
to claim that they C level three four
five and suddenly I see nobody talks
about that uh cmmi is very much there in
2021 uh we went for cmmi level five
assessment in one of my previous
organizations Aspire that's in goodgo
and I was one of the part of the ATM the
assessment team members the assessment
team is a team chosen by the uh lead
assessor who comes from another
organization he picks up 10 people from
your organization and this team then
assesses the organization so kind of you
are not a part of the organization let's
say you are an external to the
organization and assessing your
organization and we were assisted at
level five so I think that most
companies are already level five so they
keep maintaining that hence we don't
hear so much of news so it's like taken
for granted the different IT services
company must be at some level and and
it's a business as usual now I remember
long back in 20012 3 it used to be a big
deal that de every company used to do so
that see one one thing that we have seen
is that as simply learn in the last 12
years we we have position ourself as a
platform where you come and learn new
skills so that you can get a promotion
or you can just be better at your job or
many typ people want to switch their job
so they want to do something to get
prepared or also come in that mode that
now I'm thinking about taking a job so I
applying and I'll have some mental time
so let me also add some additional
skills to me so that's been our business
in India for sure of course there is
different dynamics that play in us but
India this is what I have seen as a
trend after speaking to the lar but I
have also seen resistance the people who
are let's say two year 3 year four year
5 year below 10 years they are generally
faster in decision making they know that
I'm working in Java or I'm working in
machine learning or I'm in testing or I
in quality or I in digital marketing
they take quicker decision okay I I have
number of years of experience I work in
three four companies I think if I do
this additional course that will help
help me get to a better career but we
have seen that people who are like say
20 plus experience they generally give
up they generally have this tendency
that I reached where I had to reach now
nothing can help me except luck which I
think is a wrong notion so they give
saying I am where I am maybe if I'm
lucky I not get rid off or even if I get
rid off I can do something but a course
can help me is not going to happen but
of course you have always been learning
and I saw your resume on LinkedIn you
have done not one you have done multiple
things so what inspired you to do keep
on learning keep on acquiring external
validation and and has it really helped
you of course yes what will be your like
message to people who have who are in
the other thought process
that my message is that if you are not
updated you are
outdated so it is very important in
especially in the corporate field a
professional field like uh it of course
definitely in other fields also I would
recommend uh it is important to keep
yourself updated with what's happening
in the market uh so see there are two
aspects uh from from a personal point of
view I want to grow I want to learn
that's a different point of view and
what the market is demanding that's
different so let's first consider from
the market side that the mar that the
industry is growing industry is
advancing and whatever is the latest and
greatest in the market you have to catch
up with that for different for various
reasons you know because you that's what
you are using in your day-to-day work
hence you have to learn that is one of
the needs from a personal point of view
I want to grow to something uh that is
recent in the market or I want to get a
better understanding of a technology or
uh any other
service that is a personal requirement
drives from a personal
need okay a personal ambition it could
be your children's education and
investment uh long-term for you know
foresight where you want to be when
after you retire one interesting thought
I uh experience there was uh this person
who was 78 uh who goes for a health
check and the doctor says you are very
healthy you I think you're going to live
till 100 and he realizes uh my
retirement money my pension is not going
to last that long and that's when he
starts cutting the cost so you never
know how long you will have to be
prepared for uh and that could be one
driver why do you want to keep yourself
updated so that you can probably earn
more invest more and we see definitely
there I don't think anybody thinks that
anybody does not try to earn more they
definitely want to try more they want to
be successful they want to need a
accomplished life so that is like basic
human nature most people have that but
the question is that can can how to
achieve that in a very structured well
defined manner that you do one two three
you'll get four as an out
so there the question was that people
think that courses will not but in your
journey where you moveed from one
company to another company moved from
being a senior associate to senior
manager to director to VP has this kind
of courses helped you how do you see
that or it was just a for you to keep
intellectually challenged and keep doing
something keep completing something or
it actually tangibly also the courses
have helped me in from various angles
I'll tell you uh there were times when I
knew the topic but I wanted to know
something specific a specific area uh
very simple example for people who are
listening let's say if I want to
understand about assertions uh maybe
I'll take a course on that I already
know the subject but I want to know more
about it so I can go for advanced uh
course on assertions or something like
that or if I I'm working on a particular
Tech the the current scenario is that uh
a software if I talk about software
industry it's never one or two or three
softwares that you are working on it's a
plethora of softwares you're integrating
and working together in fact now that we
are talking about AIML it's like so many
tools and Technologies you are working
together and you have to know all of
them so if I am combining um let's say
selenium there is uh Jenkins there is
Maven I have to understand gitlab I have
to understand GitHub I have to
understand how agile works so I need to
learn all of them so these parallel uh
Technologies tools methodologies
framework Works to understand them as
another area where I help and the third
is the first point that I said if you're
not updated then you're
outdated so so let's let's Dr down
little further into this topic so one
one like thought philosophy is that okay
of course you need to learn but you can
learn by going to YouTube you can learn
from going through your book and you can
you know that you you have learn this
topic maybe you go and try out something
on your own why do you need to take an
expensive course for them so and there
I've seen some people believe that okay
even if I have learned a topic how do I
go and show this to my within my own
organization that see I've learned this
particular topic and here is an external
Val valid valid validated certificate
versus you having this confid confidence
yes I know and I can actually perform
the job on the on the Fly and if you
want to question me you want to
interview me you can do so so have you
seen a third party popular certificate
or a or university that is very popular
playing a role in getting you a seat on
the table or that you have not seen
playing out as long as you know the
topic and you can demonstrate that it's
fine what training one should take or
what learning platform one should take
is an important decision yes YouTube and
so many other mediums are available my
favorite one being classroom raing
classroom training after all uh uh okay
so what do you want what is your
objective what do you want to achieve
and how would you like to use it in a
long term these are few factors that
help you decide what kind of training
you should go for yes similar trainings
are available on YouTube however my
objective was to be able to use and
implement it and the other thing that I
knew uh as a issue on my side is I of
course the time limitation and um
sometimes you know okay I'll do it
tomorrow procrastination I wanted
somebody to compel me to make me sit
down and Lear so that is one of the
reasons why you should go for registered
courses so I'm just talking about any
registered courses I'll come to the
point why expensive courses um so they
really help a lot the second option is
uh these courses are tailored they are
created in a way to attend specific
uh what do you call group of people okay
and cater to their tailor to their needs
so these people they are in the market
they know what the audience needs to
learn and that is the kind of material
combine and bring together to you Vis
your YouTube If you go to YouTube you
will find thousands and millions of
videos and choosing one from them which
is suitable for you is a uh difficult
task Vis if you go to a learning
Institute there are people who will help
you pick up the right uh training for
you of course you use your personal
judgment also because you are in the
market for some time now talking about
an expensive course uh I have a
engineering background and I always
wanted to do MBA however I could not for
whatever personal reasons or something
but I needed to learn as I was growing
in my career I needed to learn uh
leadership know finance and everything
so I did a diploma course from isv okay
and I had an opportunity where they
Professor from Stanford and such Harvard
Stanford they were teaching us and I
could see the difference of the
teaching so um yeah of course it comes
with a pinch of sword that the price is
higher but you don't compromise I'm
coming from a quality engineering
background when you know what quality
you are getting then you don't
compromise with anything else so when
you are at a pedestrial in your life
that okay this is the next Milestone
which is very important for me to pass
to achieve and pass through uh then I do
not compromise on the quality and that's
when I decided that yes uh what does the
course go for what kind of background
support it has so the if I can if I talk
about the particular course that I did
it had a background or support of
Caltech
um I had a special AFF affiliation with
CTIC because Big Bang Theory is my one
of my most favorite sitcoms okay uh I
closely relate to Sheldon and they are
all working in CTIC so I always had a
curiosity what is CTIC and when I found
out it is a place of Nobel Prize winners
and uh then when I saw it was backed up
by ctech and I was very sure that ctech
will never go for anything less than
100% in terms of quality so that so did
it meet your exper
absolutely good that's really great to
know now let's come back to rup some
questions on on this 20year journey of
it in India right I think the world has
definitely changed in the last 20 years
when you went into into the industry
maybe getting into Sapient was a big
deal you must have got really excited
that okay I'm I'm lucky and fortunate to
get this break get this break and and
I'm and I'm into the job whatever came
your way you started working on it now
that that you manage people in in in
your organization there are a lot of new
new fresh um students who come out of
colleges and start joining those
companies what what is the difference
that you see from the 20 years back when
when you were there in that place
compared to your your Junior most team
members who are part of your team have
you seen any change in their thought
process and their aspiration and their
way of working yes absolutely uh this
generation is more inquisitive
intelligent and uh they stand for
themselves uh this is something
different from the generation that I am
coming from um and on the other side
attention span maybe because of the
social media and
insight so you have information but
Insight is something that I probably
hope that this generation Generation Z
and the generation before that as they
progress they should be able to catch up
on as compared to the previous
generation that I'm talking about that
you your or mine that are both the plus
and minus the why attention is is less
they know what they want and they're
more clear about their expectation live
one thing that I noticed that that point
when I started my career way back in 99
that time whatever was given you you
start working on it you don't try to to
question whe whether this is good for
you or not be testing beit software
development beit project management bit
anything but now I've seen increasingly
this young kids they are very clear that
they want to be a marketer or a software
developer or a sales guy or a product
manager they they don't take you just
because you say because of so much of
information they're not afraid of
breaking yeah they're not afraid and
they also question you right which is
never good because maybe maybe because
parents have also become more open with
their kids like in our generation if
your parents say something you just
follow you don't argue back but now I
see parents also are more open with
their kids in terms of like
brainstorming and their deciding so
maybe that also is helping now tell
me see I have seen that um and this is a
topic that is very close to my heart
which is like women participation in
Workforce I have seen that if in India
there are this huge population of Labor
class both male and female all of them
work because they can't afford not to
work like in Bangalore whatever PPC mes
coming to our our house most of their
husbands are either security guard or
something so security guard they work in
the night the wives work in the day when
the kids are in the school so they're
very hardworking unless both of them
work there is no way they can have a
stay in Bangalore in a Metro same in
villages also husband wife entire family
works in the field so very hard working
from that
perspective but when it comes to working
women who they have like they're married
and their partner or husbands are are
working in a in a job and they earning
enough to meet the basic requirement of
the family most ladies give up saying
that why should I put so much of effort
let me put some time with my kids and
there's all the reason to have that
thinking because it's not so easy to
concentrate on kid on your work managing
house so I'm sure you must have got this
thought that why am I doing enough of
work maybe I should just take take a
backseat and let the life continue once
the kids are in college I'll think about
doing something part time again I'm sure
every lady goes through this uh thought
process so tell me about your journey
that what are the different Ms you two
kids I'm sure this thought have come to
you twice right how did you navigate
this entire Journey absolutely uh allow
me to go back to the 1995 where I told
you I as I lost my father I was I think
19 years old and uh my father uh always
and encouraged me taught me to make sure
that I Stand On My Feet as they say
stand on your feet so be independent
financially independent okay so I came
from that learning um his passing away
was a shock for me and
um I did not have a brother uh I have
two Elder sisters who were married and
uh the experience was a little tragic
but now that I look back it was a huge
learning for me and probably for other
women as well um that there was a
discussion he was sick I was uh doing
his SAA I was looking after him he was
hospitalized and then long story short
he passed away and all through that I
was alone and when he passed away when
you get all the relatives coming in the
rituals kick in then there was a
discussion happening who will give the
Agy and that was quite shocking for me
that I do not have a brother so while at
all the places I am doing it just for AG
why can't I do it so my father's elder
brother he was uh he has served as a
rare Admiral in the the Army um Navy in
Navy sorry so he was there and he said I
have read the shastras and I have not
seen anywhere that a girl cannot do it
he encouragement that I did that for my
father you know actually going around
theug and
doing that experience was uh I was when
I was doing that I was thinking about
what my father has told me throughout
has throughout his life what I have
learned from him and at that time I
decided his biggest learning or the
message that he has given to me was to
always be independent especially
financially independent so to coming
back to your question I never had a
second thought that I will not work or I
will not be uh dependent or I will be
family focused in fact now I'm thinking
that uh taking a early retirement but no
throughout my journey never through
that's like a very touching story and
it's difficult to imagine so tell me
while while obviously you were
determined that okay come watch me I I
need to financially independent I'm sure
you and fortunately you also have two
girls right so I must I'm sure she they
have also learned the same thing from
you so but there are like practical
challenges we are not designed as a
society we not designed as a country to
make that happen so tell us some of the
tips because I'm sure there are a lot of
people like you maybe listening to our
episode who might have given up five six
years of working and how did you when
those moments came you keep it kept
yourself strong and made it happen of
course yeah see a successful career for
a woman is always a mix it's a mix of
sacrifices there have been times where
I've been uh focusing on family family
and children were my priority and there
were times where work was my priority
and uh yes uh women might wonder has she
done that yes there have been times when
work was my priority I did decide to
manage my daughters it's a very personal
decision uh a woman needs to make and a
couple a husband and wife need to make
how they will manage their children it's
actually a very important message that I
have been observing for years being
through that myself and observing as
well uh which I would like to share my
experience here particularly for
women we uh think that multiple areas
that we by tradition that are put on us
typically cooking taking care of
children uh taking care of relations or
basically taking care of the house we
cannot come out of that web to consider
which of these can be outsourced or
which of these can be probably managed
by someone else I did that uh I was
clear that okay cooking children house
management work absolutely not possible
which of these is something that can be
managed so may I so since I don't want
other people to get biased there were a
couple of areas that were clearly I
decided I can manage and some areas I
clearly decided I can cannot give it to
anybody who's being children my time
with children so there were other areas
that I Outsource I or I manage somehow
um I am very lucky to have my
mother-in-law support us she's still
supporting me actually right now as I'm
in Bangalore my family is in guro she's
still there supporting my family so I'm
very lucky for that um so yes support
system needs to be there or needs to be
built and you have to be very clear what
you want what your priorities are where
you are going to manage Where You Are to
not compromise and go by that got it so
have you done project management course
also yes I'm okay looks like that is
that is helping you very clearly like I
see people talking about multiple things
but this articulation that here are four
or five different things that is write
it down what you can give what you can
is a very good analogies I'm sure lot of
working ladies will will get benefited
from them see one message that I always
communicate and and I want to to think I
want to ask whether this thought ever
got into your mind or not so many times
see we have thousand of people working
in simply Lear and we have almost 40% of
our employees are actually ladies so
some and we we have this new now 6
months of maternity law so I see that
people take this maternity and they only
come to resign so every time they come
and if I know them I talk to them that
why why are not continuing and they have
the same challenge that I can't manage
the kid I don't have support system and
whatnot so one like thought process I
always try to sit in their mind is that
see you can decide to give up
and possibly is fine for you and your
family but always think that if you are
not working and if you are capable of
working actually you are doing injust
Justice to the society because when you
work you are also paying taxes a part of
the tax goes in taking lot of people who
are in poverty who otherwise not come
out of the poverty if everybody starts
thinking there's a data that says that
if all working working age women in our
country they start working India GDP
will grow by 2 % faster imagine the
impact of 2% that's like huge so that I
really admire like all this working
women who are always going and adding to
every aspect of the life right that's
really commendable so let's talk about
your kids like um so when you take up a
course and you are continuously spending
time on on going through it is
additional work like there there there
already kids there is already house
there is already work and then you're
adding another variable that okay now I
need to do a course and then also
student so how do they react that okay
do they react saying that okay is
studying not going to get over ever for
us because my mom is doing that means
once we are also done we have to
continue doing what has been the
discussion in your house like yes sure
uh in fact I would like to add the point
that I was making uh there are times
when you have to your balance shift this
side and at the other times that side so
there was a time in my career in fact
when I left Sapient my baby was very
small uh at that time we had only three
3 months of maternity leave it was a
feeding baby and uh because of the
logistical and infrastructural reasons I
had to choose for office or for a
workplace which is nearer to my place so
see a woman has to make this make those
decisions this is not a compromise
actually this is something nobody else
can fulfill feeding a baby is something
only I can do so I had to make that
decision and I Chang my job so there
have been times where I have done
compromise for my children there have
been times where I have stayed with
them uh but to come back to uh the point
that you have mentioned one interesting
fact I observed about children uh that
if we if you consider them a little
mature and talk to them a little
maturely let them make a decision or ask
them questions make them participate in
your decision it helps them grow it
helps them broaden their perspective of
thinking and letting them participate in
your decisions uh makes them feel
included so this feeling of being
inclusive opens further doors of
thinking what I really mean to say is uh
I used to converse these with my
daughters um should I do this I used to
travel a lot on my job uh so I would ask
them do you miss me are you okay there
have been times my daughters have said
no they are not okay when I'm traveling
and now that they have grown up in the
middle you know when they were 10 plus
10 to 15 they were okay with it uh
particularly because I used to bring
gifts for them for them and then they
could show off to their peers now they
are almost 20 and they look back and say
Mom I think you are right okay and but
talking about including them in the
decisions letting them be a part of uh
your mature decisions will make them
think in a different way in other words
simple words I should don't treat them
like children this generation can
participate can think can suggest and
you will be surprised at their response
so my daughters were they were okay and
now they're actually happy were like
they they say that we are happy that you
did not leave your job or uh we are okay
that you were not there at home all the
time we do not feel that we did not get
enough of mother got it it's a feedback
and I'm happy about it thanks to God
thanks to wonderful children that I have
this is our really amazing to hear and
this so This Must also be helping you
manage the new kids that are coming as
part of your project because I'm sure
they also have a similar kind of story
at their home so that they parp in their
parent decision making so they want to
participate in the work decision making
also so I think look at your journey
there there are the very two clear
distinct part that we'll ask our team to
highlight because there are a lot of
people who can take inspiration from you
one is in general this thought process
that after 10 12 years of experience
doing anything does not help clearly in
your case you have continuously added
not only one program you have added a
lot of programs from different point of
time and you have continuously grown in
your career right so that's one a very
clear message to every that is like
gender agnostic message that if you are
10 plus 12 plus and you continue to
learn something continue to be updated
there's always an opportunity for you
the second part is on the like as a as a
human right that okay you have two
daughters you have like mother-in-law
also to take care of and and you had a
traveling job that makes it even more
complex but you you had this
determination that I need to be
financially independent I need to like
be not be a role model to my to my like
daughters as well as live up to your
father's expectations so you're able to
successfully manage it now obviously now
we are completely free right because
kids have grown up so both this message
will highlight to our audience that both
is possible 10 plus years experience
also you can grow so don't take it for
granted that you didn't go to the go to
a top school and hence you don't have a
future both is untrue so that's really
really amazing now let's come back to
your your personal side again right
because I hear from my team that you're
also a poet you have written a book now
that adds one more Dimension to your
life so already have so many things to
do how do you find find time for that
also and where did you pick up that
from it's purely your determination and
your will to do it uh I actually used to
be involved in lot of athletic
activities at the age of 32 when I had
two children I started running half
marathons and participating in obstacle
races um how did you manage with your
children I took my children along with
me I took them to obstacle races devil
circuit um
I took them to marathons where they
would do the smaller runs we would do
the bigger runs and I would take them
even to the exercise courses that is go
in the gym or whever yeah so um that was
the way we managed uh my husband isn't
triathlete so together as a couple we
have a health freak environment so that
probably something help he's the mo he's
the main Energizer in terms of health
and fitness in the family so but that is
the way that the whole family
if you basically what I'm trying to say
is if you decide some to do something
there is always a way out you just have
to think it in an Innovative way okay U
there is another point that we were
talking about children and women and
being financially independent if you
really love your children you will
decide to be financially independent
because you will think longterm will
think about lot of those scenarios in
which you will realize why you need to
be independent you know the the risk
areas the rare possibilities you know
what I mean yeah you know I don't want
to mention those but yes if you really
love your children if you really want to
take care of them in the long term you
will realize why I I need to work today
so that if there is a m have 15 years
down the line you cannot suddenly take a
job Y and we have that actually this
situation is so much prevalent in India
yeah you know 15 years down the line 20
years down the line the woman is uh
helpless so that is is one reason we
should take a job uh coming back to the
Hobbies uh so that Health journey is
still going on not to the extent of
marathons and all
um so around
2006 literature is something I have
always been interested in uh with my
family my maternal family has always
been interested in literature that's
what moved me to literature and again a
message that was a time for me to make a
decision how much do I want to get
involved in because coming again from a
quality background and I as I keep
saying quality is a part of my
personality when I picked up literature
particularly poetry I want to make sure
I follow quality in that area as well
but then you have to learn grammar you
have to learn the proy of poetry I did
not have that time I had small children
I had a traveling job so I literally
kept it away I decided till my daughter
passes her 10th class I will not take it
up I kept reading I kept you know do
Ling scribbling that's it but once she
was done with her class 10 that's when I
started I had a guru I learned from him
I learned U I learned the uh AR of shi
uh the pro of other poetry and I have
been writing gazals Doha Doha has a
different type of format so I learned
that as well my Guru is still there he's
still guiding me and I do not publish or
read anything without his review and
approval that uh Guru shisha parara is
still continuing
any any favorite poet poet that you
admire like not near time but I'm saying
all this popular you know if you ask uh
hardcore poets you know very passionate
poets who is your favorite poet they say
we don't have a favorite poet we have
favorite poetry okay because we have we
like bits and pieces of many poets but
yes if I would name uh in the field of
shi um there is a very well-known poet
from Pakistan called Ahmed
faras of course there you know they are
the big ones but yeah they are of course
liked by everyone personally personally
I like Ahmed farz um I write Doha and
Kabir is the king of Doha I can tell you
mine I also like like Hindi poetry a lot
and for me my favorite poet is ramhari
SAR alltime favorite book is Rashmi rash
like I don't know lot of lines that I
can like tell at any point of time when
I feel little bit let's say down I
always try to read that and I think my
wife also likes it my kids they also
love it because of this whole what we
call the cemetry that we have in that
that poem well ramhari singhar I did not
expect I
am so overwhelmed to hear that you not
only know him but you also know rashiti
it's a huge uh piece of poetry yeah yeah
do you remember asiri you want talk no I
I don't remember anything I don't
remember my own poems you
know okay but I I'll tell you some lines
that I remember on top of the man when
Krishna goes to like coras and that part
is the most interesting that I like
it's it's beautiful yes it's one of my
favorite poetry pieces of poetry other
one is Baba nagarjun which I really like
um not sure if you heard I've heard of
my my 10th class Baba nagaj had one poem
but I don't remember but I think he was
still so when I was like I studied in
Hindi medium school so of course Hindi
was a part of our subject so we had
studied RAM and thinker for sure we had
this mat sharang gupt he had lot of very
good of course we had subad Kumari Chan
and Prem Chand who is not a poet but at
least great writer so all those I'm very
very exposed to but it's very difficult
to get Hindi books you know I have not
studied Hindi in school so you studed
marati no only Sanskrit oh stud only in
Sanskrit I studied only Sanskrit I think
I think I had Hindi only till fifth uh
thereafter I have neither marati nor
Hindi only Sanskrit so I have not I have
not studied Kabir I have not studied
dinkar um all these poets and even Hindi
to that extent of being able to write a
poetry I so Sanskrit also a very amazing
subject in our school Sanskrit was or
language too but Sanskrit also is so
amazing right there are so many good um
thought Pro provoking what we call
slokas yeah any favorite Soka that you
have very uh in my childhood I used to
remember kast the 15th ADH of Gita
okay I'll tell you one one thing that I
like that's really favorite which
is so what happens is also part of the
mahabarata where this yud meets that yet
and he is questioning him saying that I
hear that you are the biggest expert of
Dharma so I want to ask you a question
to check you so the question he asks is
that which is the biggest surprise in
the world and if this provides an answer
that say Earth say every day people are
dying and still people expect that and
they live as if they are never going to
die so what is the biggest
surprise and he says that this is the
biggest surprise so like that Sanskrit
is very very thought Pro I really love I
don't understand Sanskrit so much but if
I had given the chance to learn I think
that's definitely in one of my todos
because every sloka is so thought
probably absolutely
yeah but I think related to candidates
also there is there is there very
popular thing that we at least in our
house we use that a lot which is like
the Lord says that focus on your work
and don't worry about result because
result only I give your work does not
decide result I decide the work but if
you don't work then there is no result
absolutely uh but coming back to the
Poetry Journey uh so yeah uh that's
after my daughter was in class 10th I
started the journey um I started
attending poetic events I recently
attended one in Merit uh its video is
available I've been on dur dasan um TV
couple of couple of those channels um
there is a the largest database of
poetry and probably Pros as well is
called Rea R Rea r.org that's the
largest database of literature um they
have contemporary poets also so I'm
listed on Rea you will have to look by
the name RC a a RS I that's my pen name
okay uh so it's an honor to be there on
that website so that that's my poetic
Journey uh that's when I started writing
Doha and um Kabir being one of my most
loved poets in terms of
Doha around 2010 when my uh poetic
Journey started but I kept it aside
another uh inquisitive Journey started
is
spirituality I would have I used to have
so many questions about life actually uh
to tell you the truth my mother passed
away in
2006 and uh that was another actually
that was the biggest trag event in my
life a shock uh for a woman because she
had come to see me uh when I had my
second daughter and during that process
during that so she came to see my
daughter to Delhi and she passed away so
I was a like one month old I baby I
had the shock of life or the to relating
to the fact that you were mentioning
about yudish that the biggest surprise
about death and people live as if they
are U
Immortal the question that came to my
mind is here is a two mothers and two
daughters so one mother is passing away
uh and I am bringing another daughter
into the world and I know that I am also
going to go away so is this the final
truth of Life what am I here for is this
you know you give birth to a daughter
she gives birth to another daughter and
the cycle goes on what is the purpose of
life what am I here for so those
questions triggered of course I assume I
must have been in trauma I had a small
baby my mother had passed away uh all
the little clothes that she had brought
for my daughter they were hanging there
and they were very depressive and
saddening for me but I came out of it
thanks to my elder sister she told me
you have to decide you have to look back
and uh mourn for your mom or you have to
look at your daughter so that it does
not affect your feed yeah no I agree I
think that's life an eye opening if
you're spiritual and if you go to
Banaras it's just one 1 and half kilm
I'll say boat ride from that Temple to
the that I think what is the G you
call that there a very popular g r
Harish Chandra if you go through that
between these two G you can see that in
1 kilometer ride every day like we'll
see hundreds of kids coming and having
their mundan which is a celebration of
life right and you have this fire
burning 24 by7 non-stop yes so that also
is a beginning of Life and and end of
life happening yes in one same yes
that's exactly so those questions
triggered my uh there is actually a
process called Spiritual Awakening you
know if you Google it or look at it on
YouTube you will see 10 signs of
Spiritual Awakening uh so that is
something I could not control I started
reading trying to find out and they
started all all the things that you
could you know prayers shlokas mantras
japas fasting
rituals
um
Reiki tried couple of Babas uh tried
different things like Karma question and
all but nothing was able to give me
answers and uh somehow I had in my mind
that meditation is probably the final
answer to all these things um and the
kind of family that I'm coming from
meditation was also something that I had
learned in my childhood so uh you might
not believe or some of you might find it
funny uh the place where I live in guram
is like the end of guram and aravali
Hills start from there so I used to go
into the hills in meditate over there
very interesting um between uh lots of
peacocks uh but I am a normal human I
could not do it I could not survive it
there were ants and mosquitoes and all
that so just like any other normal human
being I got defeated and I came back uh
but I continued looking for answers and
I will not share what I found because
it's an individual journey and what you
seek is what you get it's it's
everybody's Journey uh finally after
trying lot of other opportunities other
ways then I landed on vasana meditation
um since 2016 I have been a vasana
meditator okay surup what I hear from
the team that while doing this AI course
with Caltech and simply learn you
learned some skills that you used to
take a Kabir Doha and you're trying to
rewrite that using AI so tell us more
about that sounds very interesting yes
so uh that's how the Journey of poetry
and uh technical background merged um my
one of my poetic line is the English
poem that I write the heading is the
program of girlfriend okay okay so all
my English poems come under the bracket
of program a girlfriend where I draw a
parallel of you know your poetry your
love life and by giving an analogy of
software okay uh but coming to the Kabir
Doha when I was reading Kabir Doha I'll
give you a simple example I'll give you
example of a because it's very
famous so this is a spiritual DOA you
pass on this Doha to anybody he says
okay he's probably talking about God God
is hidden we cannot see him but as we
all know God is prevalent everywhere
this kind of understanding of God has
been passing on from generations to
Generations everywhere we some of us do
wonder what it really means some of us
do wonder if God is hidden why doesn't
he come out why can't we see it or why
can't we see the effect of God anywhere
I'll give you a simple example using
artificial intelligence machine learning
so when I was doing uh the course um and
when we were learning
about virtual reality and augmented
reality there was there was a discussion
of video games okay now come back to
the if you if you refer to the open
issues or if you refer to Vedas there
what they say about Maya and sansar or
this world it is sat as well as assat it
exists as well as it does not exist it
is reality as well as it is not a
reality you tell this to me or to any
Common Man it does not make sense we
just say okay fine I will pray to God
that's the
end but you take the example of a video
game a video game has a central player
character called as PC a player
character the the game is residing in
your computer or in your PlayStation or
in your mobile as a
code so that's
Maya the moment you or me as a central
character will play it it's manifested
that's reality there is another very
simple experiment you can find it on
YouTube you create a plastic pyramid and
look for a YouTube video where you
create that pyam keep that pyramid on
mobile and it will reflect the designs
on the mobile on the plastic pyramid
like a
hologram now please relate the virtual
reality the video game this example that
I'm giving and the explanation of Maya
sorbing sat and ass so as long as the
mobile while program is residing in your
program it's reality but it's not
playing and it's Maya when you run it
you are the central character you start
collecting the coins or you start
hitting people so and then you have
multiple lives also right so now that
program is manifested that is your
reality does it exist yes does it not
exist it exists as well as it does not
exist so with the help of virtual
reality augmented reality programs you
can help understand what is Maya what is
sonar op and the Doha of great Sufi Sons
like Kabir and babish very impressive
good people will find it first time
hearing about software programming and I
and Doha in the same breadth
right so uh I have so I'm coming up with
a book uh on Kabir where I have
translated poetry to poetry translation
of 100 Doha and I have picked up some of
these Arcane doas you know which are
otherwise complex and spiritual to
understand and tried to explain them
using AI ml quantum physics uh science
all those so I have actually taken
references from um articles where either
they have proven theories or proven
experiments of uh science from like
places like Harvard Stanford MIT and
given their references just to know
support the fact so one of these is
there is another very famous
ofab so what what he is saying is that
you are turning the rosary the beads are
going on and on but nothing has changed
your life is still the same so drop
those beads that you are turning and
turn the beads of mind okay so again
when we listen to it we probably think
that he is talking about thinking of God
praying to God he's actually talking
about a meditation
technique so uh that is something uh you
need to understand the these uh you know
great sufis and saints Saints where they
say something it really means a lot so
we have to look behind the meaning and
try to find out
