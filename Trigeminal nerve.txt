hi everyone so today's topic for the
India's finish line is on trigeminal
nerve and it's applied aspects so the
facial and the trigeminal nerve are
equally important they can be asked as
essays so the contents as I said they're
very important so first you have to
write these contents for this trigeminal
nerve so again under individual content
you can give a subheadings like for
example under anatomy you can give the
headings like ganglia on the branches
and the new clay of the trigeminal nerve
okay on it and again under examination
you can give the subheadings like the
history taking and the examination and
the physical examination like that you
can get and under the clinical aspects
what all the diseases that you are going
to cover for example the trigeminal
neuralgia so you can give the
subheadings like the clinical features
management so like that you can even
give this up headings but these are the
main contents that you have to cover so
coming to the trigeminal nerve if it
comes an essay so you can write the
other cranial nerves you can just name
the other cranial nerves followed by
which you can write the introduction for
the trigeminal nerve so we can call it
as a fifth cranial nerve which is one of
the largest and the trigeminal means
three so it has it has main three
branches or three major branches which
are the ophthalmic the maxillary and the
mandibular okay so coming to the next
heading that is a nuclei you have to
write the nucleus which commander or
which is the trigeminal nerve has so it
has three units that is a motor nucleus
the sensory mission cephalic nucleus and
the third one is a sensor nuclear
complex which is again divided as two
distinct nuclear that is the main
sensory nucleus and the nucleus of this
spinal tract so you can put this diagram
there but where it is showing the
missing cephalic nucleus and the primary
sensory nucleus
okay as shown in the picture so you can
put this diagram so diagrammatic
representation is very important and
even you can draw the spinal nucleus
which is it this rostral and you can see
so the blue thing is a spinal nucleus
even you can draw like that and the
death Syrian or the trigeminal ganglion
which is a crescent shaped structure you
can
showing the three main branches so you
can draw this small diagram it is like
scoring for you
okay so again coming to the individual
nuclear you can just give a bit of
description of the individual nuclei as
in the motor nuclei where the two
principal muscles have been involved
that the masseter and the temporal and
coming to the missing cephalic nuclei
where it consists of a missing cephalic
nucleus which is unipolar and most of
these are proprio or proprioceptive in
function with receptive terminals
responding to the stretch of the muscles
of mastication okay so you can give
slight description of these new clay as
given here so that to increase the bulk
of the answer if it comes as a twenty
marks question then you have to increase
the answer by giving extra points like
this the main thing is you have to give
good headings okay so these diagrams and
headings are equally important so coming
to the next part is a trigeminal route
this route again consists off like the
sensory and the motor divisions which
are seen as a separate routes as you can
see in the picture there are two
separate routes okay these are again
supplied by the group of vessels which
are called as a trigeminal arteries so
you can give this small diagram if you
want
so next coming to its gangly on the
ganglion for the trigeminal new nerve is
AG acid in Daniel and whereas for the
facial nerve is a geniculate ganglion
that is simple you have to remember so
this ganglion again you can give a
description for that that it is christen
shape it lies in the metal scape it lies
on the anterior posterior or sorry
anterior superior surface of the petrous
bone it is an expansion of the proximal
sensory artery or sensory route okay so
like that and it is surrounded by eric
annoyed and dura mater so all these
important points related to Brazilian
ganglion you can give because gasoline
Rangel alkane can be asked as a simple
very short answer so you have to put
this diagram you can give little
explanation again if you have if it
comes as very short also this small
thing is not enough then you have to add
the other important aspects of
trigeminal
so putting this diagram will be very
important and fetching for the very shot
so have a note of this
so especially you have to write this
part that it is surrounded by Eric nerd
and durometer as shown in the picture so
you can highlight that okay and also it
lies in the anti row superior surface of
the petrous bone
so all these points if you have to put
in there so coming to the main branches
it is trigeminal so it has three main
branches that is ophthalmic the
maxillary and the mandibular so after
writing the gasolene ganglion if the guy
sitting idle or individually comes as a
question then again you can write these
notes because you can write that this
ophthalmic nerve arises from the
anterior medial aspect of the gasoline
ganglion so like that you can extend
your answer so this point will be
fetching there again okay the branches
of the the branches of the ophthalmic
nerve are these three that is neck
lacrimal the frontal and the nasal
ciliary so this diagram you can put in
okay or tall diagrams you can draw from
your cherish a textbook all those
diagrams if we put in there it will be
very much fetching for the score okay so
anyways examiner will look how you have
presented well so it depends on how
nicely headings you have put and what
all diagrams you have included
especially like anatomy related
questions so you can write draw these
diagrams if you can
next time into the lacrimal nerve so you
have to write the cause of how it passes
and and again before entering to the
gland it has divided into two okay so
like that you can put so it supplies the
lacrimal gland again so next coming to
the frontal nerve
so the frontal nerve it gives off again
to main small branches that is super
trolly ER and supraorbital so like in
the middle of the orbit it gives these
two so as you can see in this diagram
okay
so that you can put in there next coming
to the nasal ciliary it is a nerve
further
sensory supply to the eye so it is for
the sensory supply okay
apart from that these branches are the
long end of the long and sensory road
the long ciliary nerves the
infrastructure nerve
nasal branches so the frontal nerve is
Supra trochlear but as infrared rock
layer comes under nasal ciliary so these
points you have to put in again so
individual branches of those individual
nerves of that particular division you
have to write you can simply end up with
ophthalmic division and you can you can
simply give those three branches and go
to the next division if you write again
the individual in a nice flow chart and
if you put a diagram there it will be
fetching okay next coming to the
maxillary it is a purely sensory
division it's completely sensory and it
arises from the frontal central portion
of the gasoline ganglion okay so that
point you have to highlight if you get a
question on gasoline ganglion again so
the most important branches is the
middle meningeal nerve as you can see so
it's a middle meningeal nerve is the
most this and again passes through the
foreign foramen rotundum so as we know
this was the important question in a PG
preparation so this passes through the
foramen rotundum
so again it has two other branches as i
grammatic nerve intern that is zygomatic
a facial and zygomatic or temporal so
these points you have to put in there
okay and the later you have to see that
it travels through the inferior orbital
fissure into the orbit which becomes a
inferior orbital nerve infraorbital
nerve which exits from the infraorbital
foramen so all the course if you write
it will be even more fetching if it
comes with twenty months so we are done
with ophthalmic and the maxillary nerve
so you have to write the detail course
so the points which have shown you can
just make a small notes of it that's
enough
so coming to the large division is a
mandibular it contains both sensory as
well as a motor okay so it is formed by
a large density root from the gasolene
ganglion that has passed inferiorly
through the motor root of the trigeminal
nerve these through pass through the
foramen ovale okay that one maxillary
passes through foramen rotundum here it
passes through foramen ovale okay again
it has anterior and the posterior
division so what all muscles and what
all the
things it or what are the structures it
in our ways we have to write so these
muscles which include that in the
anterior division are the branch to the
lateral pterygoid to the masseter to
deep temporal and the Bucks inators so
all these you have to write these are
the structures that have been innovated
by this nerve then the posterior
division again you have to give this or
Clos temporal the lingual and the
inferior alveolar nerve so these points
have to put in and again what are the
importance of the individual branch if
you write it was even more fetching okay
so so we know the lingual nerve and the
internal villain of it's a twin fellow a
laverna almost supplies all the teeth
and the of the lower jaw so again it
gives off through branches at the like
mental foramen mental nerve and again in
the incisive foramen it gives incisive
branches so all that in detail if you
describe that's more fetching okay so
oraculo temporal nerve you can see in
structures being innovated that is upper
part of lateral surface of the ear upper
part of the meters a tympanic membrane
the parotid gland and the skin off side
of the face okay the lingual nerve is
further sensation to the gums and the
anterior portion of the tongue whereas
in filler al-balad nerve it has three
branches that is the mylohyoid nerve
giving to the malahide muscle and the
anterior belly of digastric posterior
value of digastric is by facial nerve
okay next the inferior dental plexus
through the gums and the teeth of the
mandible where as a mental nerve is for
the skin of the chin and skin of the
mucous membrane of the lower lip and the
gum so all these innovations you have to
write so that it increases your answer
so coming to the examination so we have
done with the gazillion ganglion we have
done with a nuclei the trigeminal nerve
and the individual branches also
individual divisions along with the
individual branches and the structure is
being innovated by those branches so
half this is just outline I am giving so
these headings they have to fall in and
then you can give your own detailed
description along with the diagrams if
you give it is fetching so next coming
to the have you examined so based on the
history if the patient is having any
problem audience you can just see for
the sense of touch you can just use
small pin not the shock thing you can
just use a small pin like structure to
see for the sensations okay and also for
the Cornell sensations you can see next
with a motor function you can see the
strength of the muscles especially the
masseter the temporalis and the
pterygoid you can ask the patient to
open closed the mouth and give the
lateral exertion moments and all that by
that you can see the test for the motor
function so coming to the clinical
aspects so the most important disease or
the condition which is associated with
the trigeminal nerve which every
department student has to write as a
trigeminal neuralgia it is most
important applied aspect you have to
write irrespective of your department so
especially for oral medicine surgery and
or path it's equally important so write
this for sure so what the exact
condition you know you have to write the
definition which is given by the
International Association of the study
of pain which is highlighted in this box
so it's better you write that definition
okay and you have to write which of the
division is it was more commonly
involved you can say the v3 that is
mandibular division is more commonly in
word followed by the other divisions ok
the etiology could be anything so it is
actually unknown but it could be the
compression of the tri nerve root okay
so it could be either by the compression
caused by the superior cerebral artery
on the v2 and v3
whereas anterior inferior cerebral
artery on v1 okay
this if you right it's useful for the
etiology point of view next coming to
the other it could be the tumors or
veins or any at Raveena's malformations
can cause so the pathogenesis if there
is a compression then there will be
breakdown of the myelin which cause
abnormal depolarization and that results
in ectopic impulse is causing the pain
so this is a small pathogenesis which
you can put there coming to the clinical
features so you have to write these
clinical features we know the sudden
stabbing unilateral pain which just
triggered by anything it can be
triggered by even exposure to cold air
or washing the face or doing makeup or
whatever it is classically unilateral
sudden and stabbing type of pain it has
its own trigger Jones
okay so this are the important findings
that you have to write and then the
management the pharmacological
management the most important of
commonly given rap is a common
carbamazepine so that dosages if you
right it's okay or as you can give it's
major side effect
so carbamazepine has a main side effect
of causing a meteo suppression or a bone
marrow suppression that's the reason
next it's analog or it's more good
version is oxcarbazepine so though these
are anticonvulsant wrap they act on the
sodium voltage-gated sodium channels
because of which they have been given in
this regime in a neuralgia this has less
of bone marrow suppression so
oxcarbazepine is now more given when
compared to carbamazepine so now this is
more more commonly given as a rub of
choice so both are almost the same so
these are the dosages if the oral
medicine students can write it will be
useful for you you can just keep the
small box and write and coming to the
surgical aspects so all these surgical
aspects if you put in that's enough and
if you can individually describe if you
have time if you can describe that's
enough or else you can leave it it's
mean see basics paper they will mainly
ask about the basic knowledge you have
so you have to put in the anatomy and
the if they ask an admiral point of you
have to write an atomic point of view if
they ask in the physiological point of
you have tried the physiology point of
view like that so if you mainly put in
those points and applied aspects also do
count marks they have some fortify marks
for the applied aspects but the main
clinical features of her and the have
you examine and minimum thing of
management if you write you can fetch
those marks as well so that says
students and at the at the end if you
put it if you can
