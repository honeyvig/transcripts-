great I think we can get started so in
today's session we will go through
Market Basket analysis after that a
hands off live demo of Market Basket
analysis will be done using Python and
machine learning we will perform
different function and different python
libraries before we move on to the
programming part let's discuss what
Market Basket analysis first and proceed
further for the
same so what is Market Basket analysis
retailer utilize Market Basket analysis
a data mining approach to boost sales by
better understanding client B patterns
large data sets such as purchase
histories must be analyzed to identify
products groups and items that are most
likely to be bought together so dear

machine learning Java C C++ or python
15 seconds more which is the best
language for machine learning Java cc++
or python I cly ask that everyone take
part in this 5 Seconds
more Those Who provided the correct
response will receive a response and
those Who provided the incorrect
response will receive one now let's move
to our programming part to do Market
Basket analysis using
python so first we will open command
prom to write a command to open jupyter
notebook so here we will write Jupiter
notebook press
enter so this is the landing page of
jupyter notebook and here I will select
new python Z
file so this is the how the jupyter
notebook UI look like so at first we
will import some major libraries of
python which will help us in analyzing
the data so here I will write
import
numai s
NP and the second one
is
import
pandas
aspd and and the third one is
import cbone
as
SNS and the fourth one is
import M plot
Li do
PLT sorry do
pyplot as
PLT
PLT so n is for linear algebra and uh
pandas is for data
pre-processing and cbone required for
plotting and uh M plot lab also required
for
plotting so the first one numpy numai is
a python Library used for working with
arrays it also has function for working
in the domain of linear algebra and
matrices it is an open source project
and you can use it freely number stand
for numerical
python so the next library is pandas
Pand is a software Library written for
the Python programming language for data
manipulation and Analysis in particular
it offers data structure and operators
for manipulating numerical tables and
time
series and cbor an oper s python Library
based on M plot Li is called cbon it is
utilized for data exploration and data
visualization with data frames and the
Panda's Library cbor functions with ease
for Python and its numerical extension
numpy met plot Li is a crossplatform for
data visualization and GUI as a result
it represent a strong open source
suitable for metl
the apis for metrol allows programming
to incorporate graphs into GI
applications so after importing
libraries let's import data set for that
I will write here first I will rename
this
Market okay so here I will
write DF equals to
PD do read
underscore
CSU then file name here I will write
groceries underscore data
set do
CSV
okay and here I will write DF
dot
head then press enter yeah so here PD
for Panda's Library read is used for
reading the data set from the machine
and CSV is used for the type of file
which we want to read so then DF do head
if you want top five rows of your data
set you can use head and if you want
last five rows of your data set you can
use tail instead of head so here you can
see member number date and item
description okay so moving forward let's
check data type information for
validation purposes
so here I will write DF do
info okay then press
enter so pandas dataframe doino function
is used to get concise summary of the
data
frame it comes really handy when doing
explor analysis of the data to get a
quick overview of the data set we use
the data frame. info function so here
you can see column names no null count
and data types okay then you here you
can see the memory
usage so moving
forward let's check availability of I
repeat let's check availability of null
values for that we will write here DF
dot is
null DF dot is
none and brackets do
sum and Dot sort
values in ascending
order
ascending to
false okay then press enter so no null
values so sum calculates the sum of
elements for each row and column
since I repeat since some calculate as
2al to 1 and false equal to 0 you can
count the number of missing values in
each row and column by calling sum from
the result of is null You Can Count
missing values in each column by default
and in each row with X is equal to 1
okay then here you can see sort
values so sort values is used for sort
values in ascending or descending order
okay so moving forward let's do type
conversion
from object to data
type okay so here I will write
DF
date okay this is sorry
DF DF date equals to PD
dot to date
time okay
then again I have to write here
DF data sorry
date then press enter then again I will
write DF do
info and press
enter okay ignore These
Warnings
so so the type conversion is done so
moving forward let's do some schema
check for that we will write DF
dot
head okay all seems fine I hope you
understand till here if you have any
question or any queries regarding any
code or any question just put as in
comments our team will shortly provide
you the correct solution I'm repeating
again I hope you understand till here if
you have any question or any queries
regarding any quote or question just put
as in comments our team will shortly
provide you the correct solution
okay so moving forward let's create
distribution of item sold for
that I will write here item
item _
distribution equals to DF do group
by
then bys
to item description
okay dot
size then dot
reset underscore
index name equals
to
frequency okay I will write here do
sort
underscore
values
by equals
to
frequency
quency okay here f is also
Capital then in ascending
order sending equals to
false and here I will write dot
head
then here I will give
10 okay then
enter so now I will declare C some
variables so here I will write
bars equals
to item
underscore
distribution okay
then
item
description okay
then
height equals to
item underscore
distribution okay then
here's then X under score for position
equals to NP do
margin uh okay not margin I will write
here
arrange then length of bar
length of
bars so here I will
Define okay for better view I will do
here yeah that's
good okay so we will Define here figure
size so for that I will write PLT do
figure then figure size
= to
16a
9
okay so we will create bars so PLT
dot
bar
Exposition comma
height comma
color color equals to
yeah I will do
0.2 comma
0.3 comma
0.5
0.5
okay
so everything is done let me set the
title PLT do
title
like
top 10
item then X label PLT do X
label like item
name
names then for y
Lael like number of quantity
sold quantity
sold
okay so let me do PLT
dot like create names on the like x-axis
okay X
SES
then xcore position comma
bars okay then
PLT
do
show then press
enter okay NP arrange naai has no
attribute as
arrange okay here is spelling mistake so
sorry
yeah so here you can see the top 10 sold
item for whole make other vegetable
rolls and burns soda then
yogurt till the citrus fruit so these
are in descending order
okay moving forward let's set date as
index as index plotting purpose
okay for that I will write here DF
underscore
date thenal to
TF do set
index
date okay
DF
date then press
enter okay so here you can see all the
dates and the uh member number and the
item
description okay so date is
set so I hope you understand till here
like if you have any question or any
query regarding any code or question
just put as in comments our team will
shortly provide you the correct solution
okay I'm repeating again I hope you
understand till here if you have any
question or any doubt please comment
down the below our team will shortly
provide you the correct
solution so moving forward let's make a
graph again okay another graph so DF
uncore date
dot
resample
then here I will write medium
m then item
description item
description do
count Dot Plot
bigger
size equals
to 20 point 20 comma
8
okay so let me continue
here
to here I will write
grid equals
to through
then let me set the
title title equals
to okay number
of
number of
item sold by
month
okay then
comma set
let me do dot set
label X
label
to that's
good
date and VI
question number
of
item
sold
okay so code is looking okay so let me
run
this so press enter so yeah so here you
can see the number of of uh items sold
by a month uh okay so you can see the
graph so moving forward we will select
only required variable for modeling and
removing white space if any for that I
have to write
here I will write here
count sorry I will write
here customer
level equals to DF
okay
then remember
number
comma
item
description okay dot
sort
values
by equal
to
number WR
here member
number
okay then
comma
sendings
to false
then like
customer
level to not equals to this
time iton
description okay then equals to
level
then
item
description Str
dot
then C Level okay so press
enter so yeah okay s yeah so everything
is good and fine so let's move forward
and combine all the items in the list
format for each customer so for that I
will write here
transactions equals
to A
one
for like
item
description dot to
list okay so here I will write for a in
list then
11 dot Group
by then here I will write
member
number
okay then press enter
okay okay okay
sorry
forget yeah and press
enter so now let's import a PRI package
for the model
creation here I will write
from
PI
import
a AI okay
so so here I will write
rules equals
to a
PRI
transactions equals
to
transaction comma like minimum
support equals to 0.02
okay not
0.2 and
comma minimum confidence should
be = to
0.05 okay then minimum
lift = to
3 then minimum
length equals to
2 okay
so this is for the model creation press
enter okay
rules equals
to maybe you meant equals to instead
of okay
okay for
good here's the
thing to yeah
10% yeah so model creation is done so
moving forward let's store result in the
list format for better visuals and let's
see the results okay so here I will
write this result
s equal to
list of
rules and press
enter Then
results press
enter so it's
loading still loading this will take
some
time still loading taking some
time so let me restart and run
on so press enter yeah so here you can
see the results so L I repeat so like
kitchen towels like USD milk and potato
products beef meat spreads domatic XS so
these are the
some examples so moving forwards
creating user defined function for
arranging the results okay in proper
manner so obtain from model and readable
format so here I will write for
that
DF
inspect results
okay for
that LS equals
to
tle then
results then
two
zero then again zero
okay so here I will write zero
again for
result for result and
results then
rhs sorry
rhs equals
to let me copy from here
and I will make the
edits okay instead of zero I will put
here
one okay then
support equals
to so
results result
one
for result and
result so now
confidence
result
2
0 2
for
result in
results
and lips equals
to
result
2 then
0o 3
for
result and
results okay then lift is
complete then I will write
return
list
zip
LHS comma
rhs
comma supports
comma
confidence confidences comma
lift
lifts
okay then I will write here
result
results in data
frame go to PD
dot data
frame
results
comma column
left hand
side okay comma
then right hand
side okay then
comma
support then
comma uh confidence
confidences
comma
lift
okay press enter so now I will run
it so here like
[Music]
R in data
frame f is small
do n
largest n largest and N = to
10
comma columns =
to
lift
okay yeah so here you can see the the
best possible scenarios okay then
kitchen towels USD milk these are the
some recommendation when the customer
will buy this so these are the
recommendation that he or she also buy
this
okay so I hope you are understand till
