robotic process automation is the use of
software with artificial intelligence
and machine learning capabilities to
handle high volume repeated tasks that
were previously required humans to
perform
a very warm welcome to all our viewers
and in this video we will be looking at
the top 10 rpa projects
many businesses are looking rpa as a
solution to help them enhance
efficiencies and cut cost
rps is businesses across a wide range of
industries in completing a variety of
activities
there are plenty of excellent rpa
projects available
we will discuss the 10 most exciting
real-time rpa projects in this video
let's look at today's agenda
the 10 projects which we will be looking
at in this video are as follows
number one we will look at web scraping
crm upgrading
support sales and marketing
data generation
call center operations
onboarding of employees
payroll processing
claims processing
legal processing
and lastly data wiring for a healthcare
system
but before we begin if you love watching
tech videos then subscribe to our
youtube channel and make sure you hit
the bell icon to never miss an update
the first project is web scraping
it is also known as screen scraping web
harvesting web automation and web data
extraction because of its function
scraping is a method of extracting huge
amount of data from a website and saving
it to a local file or a database
businesses frequently search for
relevant information on a competitor's
or a specific website
however the data on the most websites
can only be read
there is no way to copy it for personal
use
as a result a time consuming action of
copying and pasting data is required
in a fraction of the time this can be
accomplished with robotic process
automation
the web scraping software is programmed
to load and extract the relevant data
automatically as a result you will save
energy and money
web scraping is used by a variety of
businesses from e-commerce stores to
stock dealers to obtain data
manual web scraping on the other hand
might be very costly
this is why business automate the
process
you can check out our video on uipath
web automation where we have explained
web automation in detail along with a
demo
the next project is crm upgrading
customer relationship management is a
set of techniques methods and
technologies for managing customer
interactions and data
crm is used to increase customer
interactions loyalty and sales across
the customer life cycle
employees in this field typically have
basic repetitive and rule-based work
with moderate or high volumes
making this a good choice for rpa where
a bot replaces human effort rpa systems
are designed to handle tasks like this
rpa can perform repetitive rule based
and high volume activities with ease
crm systems collect data about clients
from many channels and points of
interaction
the example of these channels are
company's website
phone
live chat mail and social media
rpa systems are already in use and
completely functional
they can accomplish any repetitive task
that a human undertakes in a smarter way
using cognitive technologies
due to significant costs and operations
management benefits provided by rpa a
significant shift in business process is
projected to occur very soon
the next project is support sales and
marketing
sales and marketing departments are
among the most revenue generating areas
in many businesses
you want to free up your sales team to
do what they do the best that is sell in
order to create leads and drive growth
businesses large or small are
discovering that removing the hurdles
that prevent sales and marketing workers
from executing their critical can help
them maximize their time
rpa automates tasks on behalf of
employees by combining software robots
with business rules it is well known
that the interface of marketing and
sales is frequently used to attract new
customers
while marketing has advanced
significantly in terms of automation
sales productivity still relies heavily
on human involvement
nonetheless there are variety of sales
related sub functions that can be
automated a few of them are as follows
sales strategy and long term planning
forecasting
labor planning resource allocation and
channel strategy are all things that
need to be considered lead
identification and qualification
pipeline management as well as planning
for new and existing clients
pricing and quotations setting bits
coming up with technological solutions
negotiating and contracting are all the
things that are done in pricing and
quotation
management of orders
credit checks invoicing and order
processing are all things that need to
be done
management of after sales services
monitoring follow-up and management of
post-sale request on a regular basis
assistive function reporting analysis
training administration and the
development of sales materials
data generation or data migration
the process of moving data from one
location to another from one format to
another or from one application to
another is known as data migration this
is usually the outcome of introducing a
new data system or location
one-time activities like data migration
and test data generation are frequently
overlooked despite the fact that rps
ability to seamlessly connect systems
without the need for time and cost
intensive programming of interfaces and
standalone applications may be
particularly useful for these purposes
one of the most difficult aspects of
data transfer is the range of source
systems and as a result the variety of
data formats
to tackle this problem complex mapping
tables
intermediate formats and data cleansing
are routinely used
these tasks not only increase migration
expenses but they also quickly escalate
to point where the complexity appears
unmanageable
rpa which automates typical process
provides a simple cost effective and
effective solution to all of these
issues
high adaptability at lower cost
rpa is used to work with an almost
limitless number of systems interfaces
and data types
this feature is built in all rps
software systems and is available out of
the box
any client specific customizing can be
done quickly and easily
high quality data
because rpa uses existing guis rather
than bespoke interfaces any
discrepancies or data quality issues are
quickly detected by the underlying
systems
as a result before your migration data
is delivered to the destination systems
it can be scanned and corrected needless
to mention rpa can also be used to
generate any quality of test data needed
to improve the quality of the routines
documentation
rps software flexibility allows it to
create practically any log file required
in a given situation
rpa may generate log files at any degree
of detail and in any file type like text
word excel pdf etc and then propagate
the results as needed
call center operation
when a customer contacts an agent the
agent must first identify them in the
system in order to obtain relevant data
such as order status order number order
location pending tickets and shipment id
this requires the agent interacting with
the customer while simultaneously moving
from one system to another the database
which contains the customer's
information and the other system which
contains additional information
customers must wait while the
representative is busy dealing with the
data sometimes asking for the
information that has already been
requested this tends to decrease
customer satisfaction and extends call
duration
rpa takes a user-friendly approach to
data integration and process management
the need to switch between direct
applications is eliminated by loading a
full customer profile from numerous
systems by automating actions such as
application launch mouse clicks field
entries and so on
when rpa is used in call centers it
drastically decreases the time it takes
to locate a customer in the system and
examine all information about them on a
single screen
as a result the customer does not have
to wait for the agent to load all the
information resulting in improved
customer service and shorter average
call length
onboarding of employees
hr is one of the departments that is
actively considering introducing rpa
into its working procedures with
particular focus on onboarding process
the onboarding process prepares new
employees for the new workplace by
providing them with essential knowledge
skills and behavior
this process usually begins before the
first day of work and is an important
aspect of integrating a newly hired
employee into the organization's payroll
and internal databases
employee onboarding sets the tone for a
new employee's career with your firm and
is crucial in preparing them to
contribute meaningfully
yet for the most part onboarding new
staff is still a tedious and wasteful
procedure
rpa improves hr procedures that are
still run on older system such as
onboarding by adding new functionality
decreasing human error and securing data
the organization was able to cut the
process time to 3-4 minutes per new
employee using a combination of rpa
robots
the greater accuracy of the automation
also reduced the time required for
examining and rectifying problems
previously
during high volume hiring periods the
system proved to be easily extendable
and the organization was able to
optimize data input resource allocation
and error handling by monitoring the
automated process
the tasks performed by rpf bots in
onboarding process are cleaning resumes
in process of new hire verify candidates
information
induction and training
employment management and send
notifications to the new employees
payroll processing
payroll processing is a critical company
operation that involves calculating
employees net pay after deducting
applicable taxes and deductions
payroll processing is one of the most
important but also one of the most time
consuming operations in any company
due to the importance of accuracy in
order to avoid stiff irs penalties
manually updating payroll system is
difficult and potentially costly
because of high level of risk and the
time consuming nature of manually
updating records
businesses have begun to turn to
automation to reduce mistakes and time
wasted consider a scenario
where in every month an hr service
provider manually processed 100 000
payroll change occurrences
it took around 60 hours and 6 full time
personals to complete the process
the operation was inefficient and
complex because it comprised numerous
departments and two essential desktop
apps
all payroll updates received through
email from customers are now handled by
an
rpa robot which automatically inputs
them into a sap system
in approximately few weeks the rpa
solution was up and running automating
90 percent of previous labor necessary
to process this request
claims processing
claims processing is at the core of
insurance industry
the insurance company satisfies its
commitment to its consumers establishes
service standards builds credibility and
performs its commitments at this stage
many insurers have already implemented
some kind of automation
whether it's simple task like scanning
pdf documents or more extensive workflow
automation
these solutions on the other hand are
different and each have their own set of
issues
actually they can further add to the
complexity and difficulty of processing
the quality of the output from this
automation is mostly determined by the
programming quality
every time a step in the process is
altered the enter software must be
written
this complicates the claims process
exposes it to errors and adds to the
expenses this is where robotic process
automation enters the picture as fully
integrated end-to-end automation
solution that overcomes the existing
issues
rpa operates at presentation layer
seamlessly interacting with all
applications and systems including the
older system
it is completely scalable to meet the
needs of the user and offers robotic
accuracy of up to 100
legal processing
in terms of legal and compliance
processes this means that your lawyers
and specialists will be able to respond
more swiftly to the rising client and
internal stakeholder demands
in-house legal departments and
independent law firms both can benefit
from ui path robotic process automation
solutions for legal
this frees up all your highly qualified
legal professionals to focus on what
matters most learning the law and
providing best legal advice possible to
your clients
rpa automates operations on top of
existing systems such as legal documents
apps
spreadsheets pdfs and websites
in simple editor you can quickly design
robots even lawyers and barristers have
the ability to develop their own
automation
the last project is data wiring for a
healthcare system
healthcare providers strive to provide
high quality care to as many people as
possible
however both providers and payers must
complete and handle a plenty of forms
documentation and data in order to do so
all of these data like patient records
provider information billing and payment
information is collected processed filed
and stored in a mess of segregated and
separate systems
healthcare has become confusing and
sluggish due to a plethora of process
and networks resulting in care that is
potentially more expensive slower and
ineffective for patients this also means
lower profitability for private
suppliers
robotic process automation is a tool
that aids in the digital transformation
process
in a nutshell it's the wiring that
connects all of the data in all of the
systems in a way that's faster more
accurate and more efficient than
traditional iit approaches like complex
business process management system
custom application program interfaces
and other
rpa when combined with artificial
intelligence can swiftly and accurately
push and draw a large amount of data
from one system to another
in addition to speeding up the system it
frees up humans to undertake more
value-added work by removing time
time-consuming low-value jobs from their
hands
