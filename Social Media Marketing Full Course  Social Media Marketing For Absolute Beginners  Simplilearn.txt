imagine it's the year
2004 this is Phil Phil's looking to
release a book and set up a Blog he's
sure that it'd be successful but he's
only worried about one thing he doesn't
know how to ensure that his book reaches
the right target audience who could
enjoy his book during that period of
time however there were only a few forms
of advertisement available like print
ads Billboards radio Direct Mail direct
sales and the television all of these
options were pretty expensive their
effectiveness couldn't be accurately
determined and they didn't let him
advertise his content to the appropriate
audience PHS book would never find the
audience it deserved now let's have a
look at the same scenario in the present
day alongside traditional forms of
advertising Phil would have access to
digital marketing a form of marketing
that's a lot more lucrative inexpensive
and configurable marketing that would
enable marketers to advertise Their
audience digitally using channels like
search engines websites social media
platforms emails Etc among these types
social media marketing caught Phil's eye
social media marketing would give Phil
the opportunity to take advantage of
social media platforms to advertise his
content to a highly targeted audience it
would help more people learn about his
book increase the interaction with his
audience it's relatively inexpensive
unless he goes into advertising and will
help him get Marketplace insights that
might help in understanding his audience
preferences better Phil started by
taking up a certification to learn about
social media marketing since he was
already familiar with the concept of
social media marketing his next step was
to learn about the different types of
content he could post on social media
some of the most common forms of content
that Phil could post would be images
text posts polls and videos but over
time Phil began to notice that not a lot
of people were being exposed to his
content Phil needed to advertise his
content for that he would need to use
the advertising options provided by the
social media platforms like Facebook
Instagram YouTube YouTube LinkedIn and
Twitter most advertising platforms offer
users with a number of different options
like image ads these ads involve the use
of single or multiple images that are
attractive and have the optimal amount
of text they also have a call to action
that encourages user interaction Phil
could use images from his book advertise
websites that sell his book and more
then there are text and post ads these
ads could advertise posts or excerpts
from Phil's blog or his book further
garnering interest from an interesting
audience he could also use video ads
Phil could use video ads that feature
favorable reviews and customer
testimonials to advertise his books Phil
could also use lead ads through which he
could collect information from users who
are interested in a Weekly Newsletter or
regular updates from his blog but that
wasn't the only thing Phil could do with
social media platforms he could create a
brand for himself and drive audience
interest to it engage with them create
an identity engage with content finding
content that works for him social media
platforms also allowed him the
opportunity to Target audiences based on
demographics like their age location
gender and much more and in time Phil
began to see an increase in the number
of viewers coming to his social media
page and by extension his blog he also
saw an increase in the number of people
who bought his book greatly increasing
his audience here are some things he
learned one to set goals that were
quantitative smart and follow a constant
deadline two to understand his audience
by engaging and connecting with them
three to set up a social media calendar
to plan competitions polls surveys
videos and more four using tools like
buzz Sumo ift buffer and more for lead
generation creating email lists setting
buyer personas and more five to perform
visual storytelling with the help of
images and videos okay so let's have a
look at what social media marketing
actually means what is it yeah and we
got to put this in the context of the
definition of
marketing yeah I studied Marketing in
the very early days in the 80s and um my
main sort of uh Guru in marketing was
Philip Cotler and over the years
marketing has sort of developed from
traditional marketing to online
marketing but the basic concept has not
changed if you look at the definition of
marketing it's the activity of creating
communicating delivering and exchanging
offerings that have value for
customers yeah so you supply you deliver
you exchange products or services that
have a value for your your
customers so two very important aspects
here there is value and there is
customer and that is what we capture in
the marketing concept you put the
customer at the core of what you do yeah
because when you do that you
automatically will look at what value
are we giving to the
customer yep so take social media
Marketing in that context then the
second part of the social media
marketing sort of term is the word
social media what is social media when I
explain social media I'm using the three
C's the three C's of social media
marketing and they are content they're
community and
campaigns content is the fuel of your
social media content is the um the
currency of social media if you have
really good content that you can share
on the
internet yeah using various multip
multiple social media channels like
Facebook like YouTube or like video or
like Instagram or blogging you name it
yeah people will engage with your
content
and then when people start engaging with
your content they may come back for more
contents that you supply and they will
then become part of your community so
Community is a very important aspect of
your social media definition with really
good content you can create
communities and then you can push that
process by running campaigns
yeah and a campaign makes it relevant
for
businesses because when you run a
campaign you have a goal for your
campaign you have an objective you have
a St date you have an end
date yep and that is what social media
marketing is it's all about running
campaigns to develop your communities
with really exciting
content and then you put it into the
marketing context you do that it with a
customer at in the core of what you
do yes so if I then take that to a
definition of social media
marketing is very basic it says the use
of social media to develop a company's
brand increase website traffic and boost
sales that is what we call social media
marketing yeah the most most important
aspect here is that you need to have an
outcome you need to have a result which
is customer
related and that is where the sales
element comes in you do this to get the
customer to do something and in the end
that is buying your product or your
service yeah so social media marketing
is not the
tactical combination of your social
media networks yeah to um to reach as
many people there needs to be a goal to
it and when we talk about marketing it
comes down to selling your product or
service with a
value yeah so that is the um kind of the
call to action as it were that comes out
of your social media marketing so keep
that in mind everything you do with your
social media marketing in the end comes
down to reaching your goals or achieving
your objectives of developing your
company's brand increasing website
traffic or growing your
sales now a big benefit that you're
getting these days in digital marketing
and social media marketing is data
is
intelligence is
knowledge in the early days of marketing
the biggest problem has always been how
to measure the success of your marketing
campaigns if I ran adverts in a magazine
how do I measure the effectiveness if I
do a PR campaign and they write about me
in the newspaper how do I measure the
effectiveness of that how can I track
that when somebody buys a product it
actually is as a result of the pr
campaign that I Ran So in the early pre-
interet days yeah we the only way to
measure customer engagement as it were
were through Loyalty cards or credit
cards yeah with a loyalty card you had
some basic customer data through credit
cards you could track transactions but
it's very difficult to Rel reled to your
marketing then the internet emerged and
all of a sudden I could track traffic to
my
website yeah I could see how many people
visit my website are these people that
visit my website for the first time are
they returning visitors what are the
most popular pages that they see how
long do they stay on my website and are
they actually buying my
product yeah so that was a major
advancement of Marketing in the early
2000s and then when social media emerged
it all of a sudden became possible to
measure
engagement how many people are having
conversations with us I could even
measure sentiments are people positive
about my brand are they negative about
my Brands I could track the
effectiveness of my marketing
campaigns I could measure the effective
of my advertising campaigns that I ran
online so today's reality is that we can
measure everything we can measure clicks
we can measure transactions we can
measure engagements we can measure
return on
investments yeah and we can now even
take that a step further through
artificial intelligence that we can
actually start making predictions how
people may respond to campaigns that
we're going to be running so is a very
important aspect of your digital uh your
social media
marketing so as I mentioned earlier
social media is a completely new way for
businesses to engage with their
customers yeah you can no longer go
without it it's a new channel to Market
it is a new channel for engagement with
your customers it is a new channel to
learn it's a new channel to listen to
find out what's happening in the market
so it's now it's it's it's there in
every aspect of your business and not
only for the marketing department it's
there for the sales department it's
there for Logistics it's there for the
customer service department it's there
for the HR department using social media
for your recruitment is a very important
element of social media marketing yes so
keep that in mind mind that social media
marketing is no not a fat it is there
and it's there to stay and it touches
every aspect of your
business now to summarize this there are
three areas where social media has
changed the way businesses operate first
of all there is the connection social
media is a new way to connect with your
stakeholders yeah and stakeholders in
this case can be customers they can be
prospects influencers your own employees
using social media for
internal and not only on a local scale
this happens nowadays on a global scale
the internet allows you to sell locally
to a global audience if you want to yeah
so you can you
can cover the world you can Target
specific audiences wherever they are so
the connection aspect the targeting
aspect yeah the the market where you
want to sell your product is opened up
through social media and that is a big
benefit for business the second area
where social media has changed
businesses fundamentally is in the
interaction site it's not just about
connecting with your stakeholders you
can also interact with them and they can
interact with you on their terms on
their preferred platform and remember in
social media land the customer is in the
driving seat if you're not interacting
with them on their terms you're going to
miss the train it's not about you don't
liking Facebook or
LinkedIn yeah as long as your customers
are on Facebook you better be on
Facebook otherwise you're going to miss
the
boat yeah because if you don't interact
with them they will move on to your
competitors who are very likely engaging
with
them yep so it's the connection aspect
it's the interaction aspect and then the
third part is the customer data aspect
all of this we what we talked about can
be done and you can track every aspect
of your social media marketing at AUST
customer level and it gives you the key
performance indicators like conversion
ratios sales ratios customer
satisfaction ratios and ultimately
return on
investment and there are tools nowaday
that let you manage and track all these
areas in one conglomerated system yeah
HubSpot is for instance a tool that you
can use for that and they integrate all
your marketing and customer customer
data and campaigns in one system that um
you can use for
that so now Having learned about these
sort of fundamentals of social media
marketing let's now have a look at how
do you put together your social media
marketing strategy how do you set it up
how do you develop it now with my over
40 years of experience in marketing
digital marketing and social media I
developed a simple fstep methodology to
set your business or to set up yourself
for social media and it's called
flirt yeah and flirt is an acronym flirt
the first letter the f is for
Focus yeah and in the Focus face what
you do you look at various things the
first thing you do in developing your
social media marketing strategy is look
at what is your
Niche what Market are you
targeting and the more you focus in your
Market your targeting your Niche the
easier it will be to reach them
yes so it's very important that you
focus on a very particular
Niche once you've identified that Niche
you look at your
positioning why should they buy from you
what is your unique value proposition
remember the definition of marketing
yeah the value for your customer is key
in this and you put it in what we call a
positioning
statement you also look at your
customers you create customer
personas where you look at your
customers and you kind of map their
interests their uh pain points the
typical questions that they would ask so
you get a good understanding of your um
your
customers yes so you look at your Niche
you look at your positioning you look at
your focus sorry you look at your
customers yep and then you're going to
ask yourself why am I going to use
social
media yeah am I going to use it to build
awareness am I going to use it to drive
traffic to my website am I going to use
it to generate
sales am I going to use it to improve
customer service am I going to use it to
recruit new staff am I going to use it
to communicate with my um my
employees yeah so lots of reasons why
you could use social media and it's your
challenge to identify one or two
objectives for your social
media and then a very important aspect
of your social media marketing strategy
even your overall digital marketing
strategy what are the keywords that you
will be focusing on in other words what
are the keywords that you want to be
recogn recognized for Google wants to
know Facebook wants to know LinkedIn
wants to know and it's all about
repetition the more often you use those
keywords the more those social media
platforms and Google will associate you
with those keywords when people search
for them they will then show you higher
up in the search results we call this
search engine optimization or search
engine
marketing yeah so keywords is like a
whole course in itself but it's very
important part of your social media
marketing strategy in the focus phase so
that is the F for Focus think about your
Niche your positioning who is your
customers why are you on social media
and what are your main
keywords the next is the L for
listen listen is so
important yeah we tend to talk too
much yeah where social
media can give you fantastic listening
opportunities and when I say listen I
mean
read articles
online listen on Facebook and on Twitter
on LinkedIn listen on
Google yeah watch videos listen to
podcasts there's dozens of ways that you
can listen online because when you
listen you learn and when you learn you
get better and you develop so what does
that mean from you some practical tips
when it comes to listening first you
need to listen to where your customers
hang out are your customers on Facebook
are they on Twitter are they on LinkedIn
and later in this session when we go
through the various social media
platforms I'll give you an overview of
what type of people are on the various
social media
platforms the next thing that you want
to know when you listen is who are your
top 10 bloggers or influencers in your
Niche do you know your top 10 bloggers
do you know your top Instagram
influences because you want to learn
from them but you may also want to build
relation with them to use them in your
marketing
Outreach you also want to look at the
trends in your Niche Google Trends is a
really useful tool that you can check to
find out what are the trends in your
Niche and you're looking at your
competitors and your customers what are
they doing what are they talking
about yes so a very important stage and
if you're doing it properly you would
actually set up a social media listening
dashboard where you bring all your
listening channels together in one
dashboard and then instead of having to
go to all those social media networks or
websites you let them come to you Ino
reader is a very good dashboard online
dashboard a free dashboard that you can
use for
this we're then looking at the I for
integration yes so you know your
strategy you know where your customers
are you know which social media Networks
you're going to focus on then you're
going to integrate them you're going to
set up your social media Networks you're
going to make sure the The Branding and
the profiles are consistent you're using
your keywords you're going to create
your content calendar and you're going
to set up your blog blogging is very
important in social media marketing
because it is the easiest way to start
creating content on your website and to
start sharing that content through your
social media channels that will then
drive people back to to your
website yes so that is part of the
integration stage and then once you've
got that all set up you're then going to
reach out it's very important that you
reach out because if you're not reaching
out then people won't find you people
won't see you yeah the whole essence of
social media marketing is that you
create as many touch points as possible
on the internet for people to find you
yeah where they start engaging with your
content going back to your website want
to know more about you want to know more
about your content and you start
building a relationship that may then
turn into a
sale so reaching out you're going to
start sharing your content you're going
to repurpose your content so turn your
blog post into a video or into a
carousel or turn your video into a
podcast or what have you yeah you you're
going to share other people's content
there's nothing wrong with sharing
content from other people and you're
going to run
campaigns campaigns to push your content
in the
channels yeah and campaigns nowadays are
no longer sort of just posts on social
media it is a combination of
organic posts yeah where you just share
your post on social media could be paid
like payperclick advertising or it could
be influencer marketing style um
reaching out yeah so very important is
the reaching out stage and then of
course tracking is the icing on the cake
as it were when you track you measure
your online reputation you measure your
conversions you measure your social
media activity and engagement you're
meshing your Roi and you plan for your
next
quarter okay time to talk about the
social media marketing platforms let's
have a look at some of the most relevant
ones out there now but before that let's
make sure that you understand the
essence of the social media marketing
platforms how do they work very simple
they all work according the same concept
what you do you create an account on the
social platform like Facebook for
instance you fill in your profile on
Facebook you put in a lot of data about
yourself on Twitter a little yeah so you
fill in your profile and once your
profile is ready you're going to connect
with friends or follow and be
followed there are some platforms when
you send somebody a connection request
or a friend request request when they
accept you're mutually connected like
Facebook and like LinkedIn other
platforms like Twitter and like
Instagram when you follow somebody
doesn't mean that that person follows
you yeah so we're talking about
followers and following as it were yep
and then when you've got that you're
going to start sharing updates and
you're going to check your news feed
where you will see the updates from your
friends now as a business every platform
enables you to create a Facebook page or
to create a page yeah and what you want
to do you create your page you put in
your company information you brand it to
your company branding guidelines and
then you get people to follow or like
your Facebook page or your LinkedIn page
yep and then you start sharing updates
and people that liked your page they may
see your company updates in their
feeds and this is what we call organic
reach so you do a post as a business and
then the people that follow you will see
your posts on their personal news
feed now in the early days of social
media this organic reach could be 40 to
50% which means that if you have
10,000 followers on Facebook so 10,000
people liked your Facebook page 5,000 of
those people would see your update on
their personal news feed which is
fantastic and that was in the early days
for social media many Brands they spent
lots of marketing building huge
communities because it was a fantastic
free way of reaching out to your Market
nowadays things have
changed Facebook has been driving this
yeah Facebook wants you to advertise on
Facebook all these social media
platforms they have to make money so
they have
advertising sort of on their platform
and they want you to use advertising so
over the years Facebook has lowered
organic reach to less than
3% so again if you have 10,000 people
that like your Facebook page fewer than
300 people may see your updates in their
feet and Facebook says hey that's the
way it is we offer you a fantastic
marketing environment and we need to
make money as well so hey yeah start
advertise on Facebook to reach your
entire audience and businesses Now
understand that they now know that
social media is pay to playay to your
audience it's no longer relying on
organic reach you have to pay to use
payer click advertising or PPC but we're
going to talk about that in the next
videos all right so it's very important
that you understand this concept of how
social media marketing platforms work so
let's start with the first one the
biggest one Facebook with 1.9 billion
active users
worldwide fact is that over the years
the younger generation has left
Facebook yeah why have they left
Facebook because it's not cool anymore
yeah and their parents are on it yeah so
if you want to reach the young teens ear
late teens early 20s don't go to
Facebook you want to be on social
networks like Snapchat or Tik Tok if
that's available in your market now
there's still markets where Facebook is
enormous yeah so they are the leading
social media Network in your Market if
that is the case then of course you have
to be on Facebook but in general we can
say that the audience for Facebook is
now a slightly older audience Generation
X or Millennials it's still a really
good Network to reach these people
particularly when you talk about
consumer type products now what does
Facebook offer you as a business to use
Facebook has the Facebook page that you
can create to reach your audience
nowadays Facebook really would like you
to use Facebook
groups Facebook groups is a fantastic
area in Facebook where you can get
really good and
engagement and as a business you can
offer a group to your customers as a VIP
area or a product knowledge area or a
pre-launch area or just for your
customers yeah lots of Reason lots of
areas where you can use a group to reach
your
customers then there's Facebook
Messenger of course that you can use for
your business where you can set a Bots
yeah so you can have sort of automated
conversations with your customers on
Facebook messenger and there is Facebook
live don't ignore Facebook live Facebook
loves you to use Facebook live the
beauty about using the Facebook live it
gives you sort of Buzz and engagement
before the event during the event and
after the
event yeah we call this tent pole
marketing you can build bu up excitement
leading up to the event and after the
event as
well and then finally of course Facebook
is betting heavily on the metaphors yes
so it's Mark Zuckerberg's Vision that
instead of engaging with your friends in
the news feed you engage with them in a
virtual world now the verdict is out if
this is going to work but fact is that
although we've been talking about
virtual and augmented reality for years
it is here here now yeah there's more
and more apps becoming available on your
mobile on your desktop that use
augmented
reality and virtual reality I can now
download Ikea place I think it's called
where you just open up the app you pick
a product from the catalog like a table
and then you can just position that
table in your living
room yeah and then you can move it
change the color of it or whatever yeah
using augmented reality through your um
your
camera okay so that is Facebook let's
look at the next one Instagram I love
Instagram yeah a lot of users from
Facebook have gone to
Instagram why because it is a visual
social media platform and it has
inherently higher engagement than
Facebook it's easier to reach the
audience
not just your
friends yeah so lots of cool features in
Instagram one of the coolest features is
the Instagram
stories yep and people now spend more
time on the stories than on the uh the
timeline where they see the posts so
Instagram started as a photo sharing app
very simple yeah you made a photo you
put a filter on top of it which almost
felt like you're a photographer and then
you share it with hashtags and you saw
immediately the likes coming in and
people loved it for its Simplicity and
now it has grown to a fully featured
social media Network that businesses can
use to make their brand come to life via
photos and Via
Stories the audience is slightly younger
than the Facebook um audience but a more
and more more mature audience is coming
on there as well and it's it initially
it has very much a business to Consumer
Focus but nowadays it's not just photos
that you can share you can share visuals
I can turn a blog post into a carousel
of five
visuals yep and um in that way share
really good
content so very powerful and very useful
for businesses to reach the audience
that hangs out on on
Instagram all right so that is Instagram
let's look at the next one and that is
YouTube now YouTube of course is not
just for watching video YouTube is a
fantastic social media platform to build
an audience of
followers yeah it's a great platform to
monetize your video as well by enabling
advertising to be shown before or during
your videos a lot of video creators they
do that yeah and YouTube has a program
for that if you qualify by um number of
views that you have on your video and
number of uh and and the size of your
audience you can participate in this
program and it is a really good way to
make money on you for many content
creators now check out our earlier check
out our earlier video on how to create a
YouTube channel to find out how you can
set up a YouTube channel and how you can
use YouTube as a social media
platform YouTube is great for brand
awareness and since it's owned by Google
it's also really helpful for your search
rankings both on YouTube
and on Google Google and there's lots of
different videos of course that you can
make yeah videos that do well are
typical videos like howto videos
unpacking videos Vlogs video blogs we
call them review videos live videos lots
and lots of ways to reach the video your
audience yeah on um with video on
YouTube so the typical audience that
uses YouTube are basically everybody
from young to old but very important to
understand with YouTube that people are
there for a reason they search for
something they may search for
entertainment they may also search for
answers to their questions which is
different than the videos you would have
on uh Facebook for instance yeah so
Facebook is very good for brand
awareness where YouTube videos are very
good for um for lead generation for
instance and for building relationship
with your your
audience good a very interesting social
media platform that emerged around 10
years ago is
Snapchat they have around 300 plus
million daily active users
and let me tell you a bit about the
history of Snapchat Snapchat was a
response to Facebook's problems about 10
years ago in
privacy and um not being cool anymore
and particularly the Privacy issue where
in those days a lot of people said who
is owning my photos on uh on Facebook
yeah um is it Facebook or is it myself
so a lot of people and that there has
always been a gray area yeah combined
with Facebook not being cool anymore and
you know how important being cool is for
the younger generation yep so fa so two
guys who came up with the idea of doing
something radically different and they
came up with a social media platform
Snapchat where posts would delete
themselves Within 24
hours they built a an a user interface
around this which was fairly difficult
to
use yeah but that was for a
reason kids they love to explain to each
other how it works and if it's
complicated enough then their parents
won't be able to get on it yeah so kids
love that idea it's too complicated to
use for my parents so I really really
have my own social media world yeah in
Snapchat that nobody else has access to
so particularly the teens the Generation
Z yeah was very uh keen and they were
very hot on the uh on Snapchat so it was
the new place for Facebook users to go
to and they grew ever since steadily not
huge but they are there and they are a
very powerful social network
particularly when you want to Target the
younger generation now there are two
major features that they sort of drove
into social media land which was the
stories and second the vertical videos
so you all know the concept of the story
it s the leads in 24 hours but it turned
um social media instead of sort of SC
rrolling through your news feed you
swipe from story to story much more
visual much more fun much more
engaging yep and you would swipe those
stories vertically and that
automatically led to using vertical
video and vertical video is a major
Trend in social media content yeah which
is picked up by um by Tik Tok as the
main format for uh for videos on Tik Tok
YouTube have shorts so all social media
now networks they now have stories and
they have vertical video as a key
element yeah so vertical video
particularly for short 10 12 second
videos which we call snackable content
is very important why would you tilt
your phone to watch a video why not just
use it vertical which is also a quite an
interesting um sort of form factor to
get a good engagement on your
videos finally Snapchat has very
Innovative advertising
features yeah they have lenses they have
stories they have filters you can put a
filter over your face BMW had a really
good campaign to launch a new car where
you could place the car through a lens
anywhere that you liked in augmented
reality and you could actually put a
filter where you gave yourself a golden
face yeah so very powerful advertising I
think the the WhatsApp advertising
platforms is one of the best advertising
platforms out there it's also probably
one of the most expensive um advertising
platforms of all social media
networks right so let's look at Twitter
I call Twitter SMS on steroids yeah it
was one of the first besides Facebook
one of the first social media platforms
that came out and it was a very exciting
platform when it launched and Twitter
relied heavily on C celebrities using it
to drive acceptance on a global scale
yeah and many music stars rock stars
actors they started using Twitter and
that drove the global adoption of the uh
the platform now what makes Twitter so
powerful there are three aspects on
Twitter first of all you can retweet a
tweet yes so when you send a tweet and I
follow you I receive your Tweet if I
just click on retweet it'll go to all my
followers yeah if somebody in my
follower base retweets that tweet your
Tweet can go viral without uh in in in
in minutes Y and there's various
examples of tweets that went viral um
within minutes yeah like the um which
was it the selfie tweet during the Oscar
ceremony a few years
ago yes so it is um so the retweeting is
very
powerful it also makes it instant yeah
because of this retweeting aspect news
goes on in on Twitter instantly and it
shares to a global audience instantly so
that makes it very very powerful for
news agencies as well and for businesses
a very powerful feature of Twitter is
the Twitter search each tweet is indexed
and you can
search in all the tweets you can search
for the very first tweet that was ever
sent yeah so that makes it very powerful
for Brands to find content so Twitter is
really really good for finding jobs for
instance because lots of businesses they
tweet about I'm looking for a marketing
manager or a web developer so if I
search for web developer # jobs that
tweet will show up in my search
results one problem that Twitter had is
that they did not keep up with the
developments in social media platform
functionality yeah so most celebrities
went to Instagram because Instagram was
much more visual much better place for
celebrities to engage with their their
fans so Twitter lagged behind and in the
last few years it clearly repositioned
itself so it now is seen as a great way
for businesses to use as a communication
and service Channel with their customers
and for media companies to share the
latest news so if you want to find out
what is happening in the world now or
what businesses are doing now or if you
have a problem with a product from a
business Twitter is the best place to be
and for you individual as I always say
you don't need to be on Twitter to tweet
but you must be on Twitter to find great
content to
search whether do you to search for jobs
or whether you're searching for
opportunities if you're a photographer
yeah and you in London for instance and
you go to Twitter and you search for
looking for wedding photographer London
you get a list of tweets of people who
are tweeting I'm looking for a wedding
photographer does anybody know
anybody yeah so extremely powerful to uh
to use for lead generation
right so what about Pinterest Pinterest
is a visual bookmarking
platform it's very cool the concept is
simple you see a photo on the website
that you like yeah what you can then do
you can pin that photo on Pinterest in a
board yeah and you're not copying the
photo you're just copying the link in
your board so by doing that you can
build fantastic collections of visuals
that you like and want to
organize so I bought a house in mares a
number of years ago in Morocco and we
needed to design the interior so we had
a board with Morocco design we had a
board with Morocco riads we had a board
with um tiling and what have you and we
just build up a whole collection of
ideas that we liked and then we got
people that helped us in making the
things that we wanted and we could just
share them the links on Pinterest of the
ideas that we had worked really
well now because you can save those
Boards of course you can then share them
as well yeah so everybody can access
your boards which means that it becomes
a great tool for getting ideas and
Inspirations from boards from other
people so if you want IDE ideas for home
design or your wedding or fashion
Pinterest is a fantastic place to get
inspiration another major benefit for
businesses is that you can put your
product catalog on Pinterest as visuals
organized in boards yep and then when
people find those products on in on
Pinterest and they click on them it will
take them to the catalog of your website
where they can buy your product so it's
a great way to drive additional traffic
to your website if you want to see a
good example for that go to the IKEA UK
um pinest page and look at their boards
you see boards for small living room
ideas back to school Christmas holiday
celebrations and then you get lots of
ideas with uh for instance for small
living rooms and then you click on some
of the products that you see and that
takes you to the page on the Ikea
catalog website where you can buy the
product now Pinterest is very popular
amongst women amongst Millennials and it
also has very powerful advertising
features and then LinkedIn LinkedIn is
serious yeah I call LinkedIn Facebook
with a tie
where Facebook is fun LinkedIn is
serious in Facebook you can get away
with a funny profile photo in LinkedIn
your photo needs to be
professional now if you go to
linkedin.com
SLS sales SL
SSI you get your Social selling index
and that is a score between one and 100
of how good you are on LinkedIn
and you will see in the score in the
summary that are four components that
contribute to your SSI score or four
components that contribute to how well
you do on LinkedIn so those four are
your
profile yeah your activity level in
connecting with
people how much content you share and
your activity level in building
relationships with people
yeah so the better you do in those four
areas the higher your score your profile
of course is very important make sure
that your LinkedIn profile is as
complete as possible now linkedin's
biggest challenge as I mentioned earlier
is to get people to engage and share
content so how does LinkedIn make money
very simple there are four areas where
they make money first of all they allow
people to upgrade their LinkedIn account
to a premium account where they get more
features there is a whole section in
LinkedIn specifically for
recruiters yeah so a recruiting version
of LinkedIn there is a whole area for
sales we call this sales
Navigator yeah if you run a sales team
that use LinkedIn of course you want to
keep the customer data so you're getting
a sort of customer relationship
management system within LinkedIn when
you sign up for sales Navigator and then
there is LinkedIn
advertising LinkedIn of course is best
for business to business and it's really
good for developing your personal online
profile as long as you share content
through publishing articles and sharing
uh sharing posts
so I've been operational on LinkedIn
from the very beginning and I shared
lots and lots of content and articles on
LinkedIn and I got lots of business
coming in through Linkedin yeah we're
talking about serious amounts of
business that I did by being on LinkedIn
so you got to be on LinkedIn if you are
in
business right now one thing that I will
not talk about here is uh is Tik Tok
yeah we haven't got a slide for that but
bear in mind Tik Tok although it's not
available in India um Tik Tok is a very
important social media Network these
days which thrives a whole new format of
uh of of engaging and communication but
more about that that
later right so let's look at the pros
and cons of social media what is good
and what is bad about it the biggest the
biggest advantage of social media
marketing is that it can lead you to new
audiences yeah wherever they are in the
world whatever type of business you are
you can reach them through organic paid
or influencer
Outreach yeah influencer Outreach has
become a very powerful element of your
social media marketing strategy it is
about collaborating with for instance
Instagram users with many followers to
Market your products or
services so there's the pros are there
and they are far better than the than
the cons but there are cons it's not all
positive you need to be aware that when
you are on social media you are opening
yourself up as a business people can see
what you do they can see how you do it
and they can also see when you're doing
things wrongly yeah when you're doing
things not the way it should be done
it's okay when things go well but it can
be disastrous when things go bad as we
say it takes years to build a brand but
on social media you can ruin it
overnight yeah there's lots of examples
of that um a really um big example was
the remember the Chinese passenger that
was dragged off a of a United Airlines
plane YouTube and Twitter were bombarded
with negative and cynical posts towards
United Airlines how they dealt with that
situation but hey those are the cons and
there's in any marketing channel that
you use there are cons but the pros far
outweigh the cons that are there it is
there it is a fantastic channel to reach
new audiences yeah and it is only going
to get bigger have you ever wondered why
companies like Coca-Cola spending a
whooping 4 billion annually on branding
can justify such a cost or why Pepsi at
2.4 billion a year invest heavily in
shaping their image it's not just about
catchy slogans or trendy logos it's
about a powerful tool called brand

glossia a well-known Beauty brand
started in 2014 as an Instagram account
run by Emily whs a beauty industry
influencer they didn't have a physical
store or even many products initially
the results glossier achieved a curlik
following and multi-million dollar
valuation within a few years all thanks

marketing approach they didn't have a
traditional marketing budget but by
strategically using social media
influencer marketing and content
creation they were able to build a loyal
customer base and become a major player
in the beauty industry glossier
wonderfully used the power of digital
marketing to grow their business so in
this video on what is digital marketing
we will be covering the basics of
digital marketing starting with with an
introduction to what it is how it is
different from traditional marketing we
will explore how digital marketing Works
breaking down the steps in easy to
understand terms you will also learn
about effective strategies you can use
to make the most out of digital
marketing for your business all right so
let's understand what is digital
marketing so digital marketing is the
art of using the internet to promote
products or services to people who might
be interested in them instead of relying
solely on traditional methods like
newspaper ads or Flyers digital
marketing takes advantage of online
platforms like website social media
emails and search engines did you know
that of whooping 89% of Americans go
online every day and about 31% are
online nearly all the time this means
it's super important to be online too by
having ads and stuff online you can make
your brand known give customers a great
experience and even get more people
interested in what you offer by using
digital channels like social media paper
click ads search engine optimization and
email marketing to connect with existing
customers and then you can measure your
success in numbers tracking websites
visits and social media engagement email
open rates and more are also used in
this this data helps you understand
what's working and what's not allowing
you to adjust your strategy to maximize
the results all right so this was about
digital marketing now let's understand
how is digital marketing different from
traditional marketing so digital
marketing and traditional marketing are
like two sides of a coin they both aim
to promote products or services but they
do it in different ways here's how it
works first traditional marketing
traditional marketing is like shouting
across the crowded playground to get
everyone's attention so in traditional
marketing let's say tv ads and
billboards think commercial and giant
posters trying to reach a lot of people
at once second example would be
newspapers and flyers spreading messages
through printed materials delivered to
homes or handed out to
streets and now let's talk about the
digital marketing aspect so digital
marketing however is like Whispering
directly in the ear of a person who
wants a particular product so let's say
online ads placing ads on websites or
search engines that people who are
already interested in your steps will
see next is social media connecting with
people on platforms like Facebook and
Instagram where you can show them why
your product is the best then another
example would be targeted emails sending
messages directly to people who might be
interested like offering a discount on
their first product purchase is another
benefit of digital marketing so
basically digital marketing is kind of
more specific and targeted marketing all
right now let's understand how it
actually works so how digital marketing
Works digital marketing works by
leveraging the power of the internet and
Technology to connect with the potential
customers this involves using online
tools to reach and engage with their
audience where they spend most of their
time that is the internet so let's have
a look at some first on the list is SE
so this helps your website show up in
higher search engine results making it
more likely for people to find you when
they search for something you offer for
example when someone in your area
searches for a freshly baked pastries se
you ensures that your Baker's website
appears at the top of the search results
this increases the chance of local
customer finding your bakery online when
they're looking for baked goods all
right so this was about the SEO now
coming to the next one which is content
marketing so this involves creating
useful and interesting content like
blogs videos and social media posts can
attract and retain customers for example
you could create engaging content such
as blog post about the history of
pastries tutorial videos on cake
decoration or photos of your latest
Creations on social media this content
not only not only showcases your
expertise but also keeps your audience
engaged and interested in what you offer
next on the list is social media
marketing so this social media marketing
involves using platforms like Facebook
Instagram and Twitter to connect with
your audience and share content that
encourages them to interact with the
brand for example you can use delicious
images of your bakery Goods interact
with customers by responding to comments
and messages and even run contest or
promotions to attract more people to
your tool that is the baker all right
coming to the next one which is email
marketing so email marketing is like
having a personal connection with your
customers it involves using email to
connect with potential and existing
customers it's essentially sending
commercial messages but with a
permission based approach people who
sign up for your email list are
essentially giving you the green light
to send them information for example you
can collect email address from your
customers who visits the bakery and you
can send them regular updates about new
pasty flavors special promotions or
upcoming events at your Bak this
personalized communication keeps your
brand top of mind and encourages to
repeat the business next is payer click
that is PPC advertising so payper click
or PPC advertising is an online
advertising model where advertisers pay
a fee each time their ad is clicked so
it's a way of buying visits to your
website rather than attempting to earn
those visits organically PPC ads
typically appear alongside search engine
results or on social media platforms and
advertisers bed on keyword to display
their ads to the relevant audiences so
example for this you could create ads
that appear when people search for terms
like best bakery in your town or Target
social media users based on their
interest in baking or deserts with PPC
you only pay when someone clicks on your
ad making it cost effective way to
attract potential customers to your B
website or social media profiles now
that we have discussed the types of
digital marketing strategies let us
understand how you can Implement each of
these strategies so first identify your
audience the first step is understanding
who you want to reach imagine them as
people who might be interested in your
product or services this is like
picturing the people who would love your
bakery are they busy professionals
looking for a quick breakfast pastry or
maybe families with Sweet Tooth
understanding your ideal customers help
you tailor your marketing efforts the
next is choose your channels next you
pick the online platforms where your
target audience hangs out think of these
as virtual stomping grounds like social
media sites or search engines think of
online platforms as virtual
neighborhoods if your target audience is
young families Instagram might be the
great place to Showcase your colorful
cupcake all right next one is creating
engaging content once you know where
your audience is you can create content
that will grab their attention this
could be informative blog post eye-
catching videos or even fun social media

right so let's first understand what are
ads and its purpose ads short for
advertisements are messages created by
companies organizations or individuals
to promote products services or ideas
these messages are designed to reach a
specific audience and persuade them to
take a particular action such such as
buying a product signing up for a
service or supporting a cause ads can be
found anywhere on TV radio website
social media platforms Billboards
newspapers and more the main purpose of
ad is to inform and influence people so
here are some key purposes of ads first
awareness so ads help create awareness
about a product service or idea when a
new product is launched companies use
ads to let people know it exist for
example if a new smartphone is released
ads will inform potential customers
about its features and
benefits then comes interest so ads aim
to spark interest in the target audience
by highlighting the unique selling
points and the benefits ads can make
people curious and eager to learn more
the interest can lead to further
research such as visiting a website or
reading
reviews then comes the desire so
effective ads create a desire for the
product or service they appeal to
emotions and show how the product can
solve problems or improve the customer's
life for example a car ad might
emphasize safety features making it
potential buyers feel that owning the
car will protect the
family then comes action so finally ads
encourage people to take action this
action could be making a purchase
signing up for a newsletter or visiting
a store Google ads have clear calls to
actions like buy now sign up today or
visit us so in summary ads are powerful
tools used by businesses to communicate
with their audience they create
awareness generate interest Foster
desire and encourage action by
understanding the purpose of ads we can
better appreciate how they influence our
decisions and behavior in our everyday's
life now with so much of our time spent
online advertising has taken a new form
let dive into Facebook ads a powerful
tool that leverages the massive audience
of Facebook to reach people exactly
where they scroll we will explore how
Facebook ads work and how they can be
used to Target specific demographics and
achieve your marketing
goals so what is Facebook ads and how it
works so Facebook ads are like online
Billboards that businesses create to
reach people using Facebook and its app
like Instagram and messenger so these
ads ads can pop up in different sports
such as your news feed where you see
post from Friends stories where shorts
temporary posts are there and the
marketplace where people buy and sell
items so businesses can choose from
different types of ads such as single
images videos carousal with multiple
images or videos slideshows and
collections of items to best fit their
goals like getting you to visit their
website or buy
something so businesses use these ads to
get your attention and encourage you to
do something like visit their website
buy a product or sign up for a service
because Facebook knows a lot about what
you like and do on its platforms it
helps businesses shows ads to the people
most likely to be interested in them
this way if you love Fitness you might
see ads for new workout gear and if
you're into cooking you might see ads
for the kitchen gadgets it's a way of
business to put their messages right
where you likely to see them while you
are spending time online making it easy
for you to discover and learn about the
new products and services that might
interest
you all right let's understand how
Facebook ads work so first targeting so
one of the standout features of Facebook
ads is their Advanced targeting
capabilities you can Define your
audience based on a wide range of
criteria such as demographics that is
age gender education lever job title
then location that is Target users in
specific cities regions or countries
then there is interest interest like
Hobbies favorite activities and interest
example sports music then comes the
behavior in Behavior there is purchase
Behavior device usage and other user
activities so this precise targeting
ensures that your ads are shown to the
people who are most likely to be
interested in your product or service
maximizing the efficiency of your ad
spent
then comes ad creation so creating a
Facebook ad involves designing the ad
content and selecting the format here
are some tips for Effective ad
Creations that is visuals use high
quality images or videos that capture
attention then message craft a clear and
compelling message that highlights the
benefits of your product or service then
there is call to action that is CTA
include a strong CTA like shop now sign
up or learn more to guide users on what
to do next then come next that is budget
and bidding so you set a budget for your
ad Campaign which can either be a daily
budget or how much you want to spend per
day or a lifetime budget that is the
total amount you want to spend over the
duration of the campaign so Facebook
uses a bidding system where you bid on
how much you are willing to pay for your
ad to be shown to your target audience
the platform that works to get the best
results within your budget so it works
like that then comes the ad placement so
you can choose where you want to put
your ads to appear so Facebook offers
automatic placements where it optimizes
your ad delivery across all its
platforms that is Facebook Instagram
messenger Audience Network or you can
manually select specific
placements so basically this ad
placement things works like that then
comes the performance tracking
so Facebook provides detailed analytics
and insights into how your ads are
performing you can track metrics such as
like Impressions how many times your ad
was shown then clicks how many times
people clicked on your ad then
conversions actions Takens by users
after seeing your ad then cost per
action that is CPA the average cost of a
desired action this data helps you
understand what's working and what is
not working allowing you to make
informed decisions about your ad
campaigns then comes the
optimization So based on performance
data you can make adjustments to improve
your ads this might include tweaking
your targeting criteria changing your ad
creative or adjusting your budget
continuous optimization is key to
maximize the effectiveness of your ads
and achieving the best return on
investment that is Roi all right now
let's understand this with the help of a
demo example all right so this is
basically the structure of Facebook ads
we have gone to the campaign and yeah
let me explain to you guys what all
things are there so first of all we have
this campaign tab so this section list
all of your ad campaigns then we have
this create Button as we can see so if
you click on this we basically click on
this to create a new campaign then there
is campaign list as we can see so this
uh shows the campaigns you have created
with columns for and as you can see
there is on and off toggle button is
there so this toggle is used to enable
or disable a campaign basically so this
is why it is used then this campaign
names that you have created you can name
your campaign as for your choice then
there is delivery status as we can see
so status of the campaign example
indraft or Etc is the delivery status
basically you can check that then comes
the bid strategy as we can see so uh it
basically tells us what bidding strategy
we have used and then comes the budget
as we can see so this budget is the this
is basically the budget settings for the
campaign that you have put and then
there is attribute setting attribution
setting is uh how conversions are
attributed so results reach Etc it
basically tells us performance metrics
of each campaign all right so this is
basically the structure now we'll click
on this to create a campaign create on
click on create as we can
see these all uh metrics are there
awareness this is basically an objective
so you can decide the objective and if
here we'll see this is account
informated so you can link your account
to
it then here we can see buying type
basically uh this is a method used to
bid for ad placements uh auction as we
can see auction here basically means
your ads compare with others for
placement based on your bid relevance so
it's like that now comes the campaign
objective so uh the purpose uh basically
of uh first we can see here is uh
awareness so for the awareness its
purpose is to make people aware of your
brand or product it is used best for new
businesses or products that need to
build recognition as you can see here it
is written as well
brand awareness so then comes the
traffic so uh the purpose of traffic is
to drive visitors to your website or app
and the uses basically it is used for uh
it works great for increasing website
visitors or getting people to download
your app so increasing the traffic
basically it helps all right then comes
the another one that is the engagement
so the purpose of Engagement is to get
people to engage with your content like
comments likes and shares and its use is
it's basically ideal for increasing
interactions with your post or growing
your page followers if you want to do
that you can go for engagement next is
as we can see leads so the purpose of
leads is to collect contact information
from potential
customers
so it is used by those who wants to get
the information from their customers and
then put the mails or generate some data
or just give some promotions to those
particular
individuals and it uses it's basically
useful for generating email signups form
submissions or you can say gathering
information about potential
customers then comes the ad promotions
as we can see so purpose of AD
promotions is to get more people to
install and use your app so its use is
it is more focused on on increasing app
downloads and user activity within the
app all right now there is sales so as
you can see so in sales its purpose is
to increase sales of your product or
Services as simple as that and its uses
it is basically it basically targets
people who are likely to purchase your
product aiming to boost your Revenue so
each objective helps you focus your
advertisement efforts on the specific
business goals ensuring your campaign is
aligned with what you want to achieve so
you can select among these objectives as
per your choice so in basically uh
Facebook ads there are two ways to buy
ads as you can see auction and
reservation so basically uh for auction
you compete with other advertisers by
bidding for ad spots so for this price
change based on the competition giving
the flexibility but not guaranteed costs
then other one is reservation so you pay
in reservations you basically pay a
fixed price for guaranteed AD Sports
making it predictable and stable it is
ideal for big
campaigns all right so in my suggestion
you must always start with the awareness
campaign so we click on
continue all right so the new layout for
you guys as you can
see so here as you can see this is the
new awareness campaign so this is the
main folder for your campaign inside the
basically inside this folder you can
have your ad sets and ads all right now
then there is new awareness ad set as we
can see so this is a subgroup within the
campaign here you define your target
audience budget and schedule then comes
the new awareness ad so this is the
actual advertisement that people will
see see so you must have the image
carousal or video ad before doing all
these things so you must have your ad in
hand because you have to do all the
things here then you have to add or
upload the ad basically all right now so
I've told you about all these three now
comes the main area that is the campaign
name so basically this is the campaign
name you can select your own campaign
name and you can name your campaign here
for example it's named like new
awareness campaign but you can change it
and make it any campaign name like that
so as per your choice then is there is
special ad categories as we can see so
uh the purpose of special ad categories
here is this section is where you
declare if your ad belongs to special
categories like credit employment
housing social issues elections or
politics so these categories have
specific rules because they are
selective topics all right so uh the
benefits are basically declaring your ad
category helps ensure your ad follows
Facebook rules preventing it from being
rejected so this is what special ed
categories is so basically this all
layout lets you set up the basic details
of your campaign now let's understand
about each one of them let's first name
this one as any random name we'll name
it uh K joggers
about anime
jogers so this is the template name
according to me let's
add campaign as
well all right now you can keep the rest
as it is like you don't have to change
anything else like you can change the uh
objective over here if you want to again
uh we can leave AB test and this as well
and we can just click on next
all
right so as we can see this is the new
layout for you
guys all right so this is new awareness
adets and this is AD set name so this is
where you can uh name your adet
basically uh let's name it
anime
joggers add
set one all right so uh like you can
name as per your choice the purpose
basically this is where your uh name you
put the name of your adset and uh you
can create a template to reuse the
settings for future headsets as you can
see create template if you want to
create a template to reuse the settings
for future then you can do this all
right now here is as we can see uh
performance goal under awareness so this
is where you set what you want to
achieve with this adset here it's set to
maximize the reach of ads meaning you
want as many people as possible to see
your ad so it is pretty simple as well
as we can see here we have they have
written in maximiz reach of ads will try
to show your ads to as many people as
possible then maximize number of
Impressions we try to show your ads to
people as many times as possible okay so
uh they can show people number of times
many times to a single person also they
can show
all right then there is maximize ad
recall Li so we'll try to show your ads
to people who are likely to remember
seeing them all right so you can select
this as per your choice it's your own
choice uh you can select so let it be
like this only for me maximize reach of
ads then comes the uh under Facebook
page as we can see here we have uh it is
written demo so here uh you select the
Facebook page that the app ads will be
associated with so in this case it's set
to demo one that I named my page for the
video purpose I've I've created a page
like demo one so it is naming that so if
you have more page like more than one
page then you can select from here all
right uh after that there is as we can
see cost per result gool as we can see
all right so this is optional yeah so
here you can uh basically uh set the
target cost for achieving your desired
result for example how much you are
willing to spend for every thousand
people who see your ad this helps
control your spending all right
now there is budget and schedule so here
is daily budget so uh you set how much
money you want to spend per day on your
ad here it's set for 200 per day and
this means Facebook will try to spend
200 rupees each day to show your ad to
people the maximum amount it might spend
in a day is 250 uh and the maximum
weekly spend is400 you can change as per
your choice and then there is what we
call schedule here you can see so uh the
date and the time when your add
campaigns will start here it's set to 11
June 2024 so you can CH you can change
it as we can see uh this is the date
that it is not selecting you can select
14 now it is not showing the error so
yeah so uh the date and time is when
your campaign will start here it's set
to like 14 June and the time is also
mentioned and the end date as you can
see set an end date you can click on it
you can choose to set an end date of
your campaign meaning uh when it will
stop running all right now as you can
see budget and scheduling here you can
see so it allows you to schedule when
you want your budget to increase during
specific times like holidays or special
season period so this feature helps you
allocate more money to your ad during
times when you expect high traffic or
sales optimizing your spending then
there is AD scheduling as we can see so
the purpose determines when your ads
will be shown here it sets to run ads
all the time so it's like that you can
choose to run your ads continuously or
only at certain times of the day all
right now there is audience controls as
we can see so it allows basically uh to
set criteria for where your ads should
be
shown so you can specify the locations
demographics and other details about who
should see your ads uh and here as we
can see the location is set to India you
can edit it as well as per your choice
so yeah we have set it to India you can
search for locations browse it the map
will open and like that then uh
Advantage Plus audience as we can see
so Facebook's technology automatically
find the best audience for your ad if
you provide an audience suggestion
Facebook will prioritize showing your ad
to people matching that profile before
expanding to others you can save the
audience for future use all right now
coming to the placement thing as you can
see advantages plus placements so here
it lets Facebook decide where to place
your ads for the best performance so
Facebook system will automatically place
your ads across different different
placements like Facebook Instagram Etc
based on where they are likely to
perform the best this helps optimize
your ad performance without you having
to manually select the
placements all right now let's try to
move on to new awareness
ad let's understand
it so here as you can see ad name here
you can give the name to your ad example
we'll give
anime
Jers add
one all right so you can name your ad
over here then there is create template
again you can create a template to reuse
the settings for future ads so here we
can see the partnership ad so it allows
you to run ads with other brands or
businesses featuring both identities in
the ad uh this is useful if you want to
collaborate with other companies or
creators
then under identity we can see uh the
name of our page that is demo one so
Facebook page basically uh over here it
selects the Facebook page that the ad
will represent our page name is demo one
so that is why it is showing demo one
this ensures this ad is lined to correct
business page all right now as we can
see uh Instagram account you can see uh
and AD setup is also there all right so
uh choose the Instagram account to
associate with the ad like you can
select your business profile on the
Instagram ad uh with it and you can
either use your Facebook page or connect
with a different Instagram account then
there is AD setup as we can see create
ad so choose to create a new ad all
right so uh select the structure of your
ad like single image or video one that
is one image or video carousal that is
the multiple images or videos that
people can s through then there is
collection that means a group of items
that open into a full screen experience
so it's like
that all right now after that there is
uh you can see add creative so uh it
selects the media that is the images or
videos and text for your ad then the
media placements are there as you can
see these are the media placements leads
and streams stories and reads Facebook
search results so
uh choose where your ad will appear
either it's feeds stories or search
results you can also you have the option
to add music to your ad depending on the
play Stream So as you can see add music
so you can select among these all right
then there is uh what we call primary
text and even details you can see
primary text so uh the main text that
appears in your ad you should put it
over here and and uh this text is what
people will read when they see your ad
basically it is recommended to keep it
under 125
character all right now event details
talking about the event details so uh
include the details about an event such
as the name date and time uh this helps
promote events and allows people to get
reminders all right then there is
languages and tracking this is the
language so uh language basically at
translations to reach people in more
languages this helps uh make I repeat so
this helps make your ad accessible to a
wider audience by providing it in
multiple
languages then comes the tracking all
right so as we can see tracking over
here so tracking basically tracks the
action of people take after seeing your
ad and type of events basically website
event like action people take on your
website then app events action people
take in your app then offline events
actions people take in your physical
stool and here the preview icons are

Market segmentation is a powerful
strategy that helps businesses achieve
this by breaking down a broad Market
into smaller more specific groups of
consumers who share familiar trads needs
or behaviors this approach isn't just
about knowing who your customers are
it's about understanding what's make
them tick by doing so companies can
create more Target and effective
marketing campaigns this Precision in
marketing efforts leads to higher
engagement and better results
profitability is a major benefit of
Market segmentation ban and Company
reports that 81% of Executives see
segmentations as essential for boosting
profits businesses with solid
segmentation strategies often see a 10%
higher profit over 5 years compared to
those that do not by focusing on the
unique needs of different marketing
segments companies can drive growth and
build stronger relationships with their
customers so marketing segmentation is a
strategy used to divide a broad target
market into smaller groups of consumers
with similar characteristics this allows
businesses to tailor their marketing
messages and products to resonate more
effectively with each specific group
companies take their broad audience and
break it down into smaller segments
based on shared characteristics these
characteristics could be anything from
age gender income level of Interest
buying behavior and lifestyle choices by
doing this businesses can tailor their
marketing efforts to meet the specific
needs and preferences of each segment
but why do this you ask because a
generic hey everyone by my stuff
approach really work these days people
responds better to messages that feel
like they are meant just for them with
segmentation businesses can craft
messages that resonate with each group
like Whispering secrets in right ears at
the party it's all about building
connections and making people feel seen
But segmentation isn't just about
talking it helps businesses understand
what each group truly wants and needs so
this was about marketing segmentation
now let's understand how does it work so
it's all about figuring out who you're
really trying to talk to segmentation
helps businesses acts like detectives
that is gathering tools data about their
target market so this data can be
anything from age and income to what
kind of websites people visit or how
they use a product once they have a good
understanding of the different groups
within their Market the business can
craft a message that are like laser
pointers targeting each segment with
pinpoint accuracy imagine talking a
different language to each group but in
a way that perfectly speaks to their
interest and needs this targeted
approach is a way more effective than
shouting generic messages into the void
by personalizing their marketing
business can grab people's attention
make them feel understood and ultimately
convince them to take actions whether
it's buying a product signing up a
service or simply learning more about
the brand so it's like having a onetoone
conversation with each potential
customer instead of just yelling at a
crowd so this was about marketing
segmentation and how it actually works
now coming to the next thing that is
types of marketing segmentation so
marketing segmentation can be
categorized into several types each
focusing on different characteristics of
consumer base the main type includes
geographical segmentation behavioral
segmentation psychographic segmentation
so each type offers unique insights and
benefits allowing businesses to create
more personalized and effective
marketing strategies by understanding
the different segmentation methods
companies can better identify and Target
their ideal customers uring that their
marketing efforts are both efficient and
impactful so let's understand each of
these marketing segmentations that is
your geographical one behavioral one and
psychographic one so let's start with
Geographic one so geographical
segmentation divides the market based on
location such as a country state region
City or even neighborhood this type of
segmentation is particularly useful for
businesses that serve diverse markets
with varing needs based on the climate
or you can say the culture language or
Regional preferences for example a
clothing brand might Market winter coats
in colder regions while promoting
lighter Apparel in warm areas so
geographical segmentations allows
companies to tailor their marketing
strategies to specific demands of
different location ensuring that their
products and messages are relevant and
appealing to the local consumers so this
was about geographical segmentation now
coming to the next one which is
behavioral segmentation so this
segmentation categorizes consumers based
on the interaction with a brand that is
including purchasing Behavior usage rate
loyalty and benefit sort so this
approach helps businesses understand how
customers behave differently at various
stages of the buying process and what
influences their decisions
for instance a tech company might
identify frequent buyers for their
latest gadgets and Target them with
exclusive offers or early access to new
products so by focusing on consumer
Behavior businesses can create more
effective marketing campaigns that
address the specific needs and
motivations of different customer
segments so this was about behavioral
segmentations coming to the next one
that is psychographic
segmentation so this segmentation
involves dividing the market based on
consumer Lifestyles values attitudes and
personalities this type of segmentations
goes beyond basic demographics to
understand the deeper psychological
factors that influence consumer behavior
for example a fitness brand might Target
Health Consciousness individuals who
value an active lifestyle and wellness
by aligning their marketing messages the
I repeat by aligning their marketing
messages with the values and interest of
Their audience businesses can create
stronger emotional connections and more
compelling brand experiences
psychographic segmentation enables
marketers to tap into the core
motivations of their customers for
string loyalty and long-term engagement
so all right so these were some of the
types of segmentations now let's have a
look at how to get started with the
segmentation now let's start to
understand how to actually get started
with segmentation so for that you need
to start with the step one which is
intelligence gathering first thing first
you got to do some detective work all
good segmentation starts with
understanding your target market so
listen up talk to your existing
customers through surveys and feedback
forms dive into website analytics to see
how people browse and interact basically
gather as much Intel as possible on
demographics what they do and even how
they
think and then the step two connecting
the dots now comes the fun part cracking
the code take all the data you collected
and analyze it like a puzzle for Pat
common threads that connect different
customers these patterns will help you
identify distinct group within your
market then comes the step three that is
the tailoring the message here's where
the magic happens with your segments
identified it's time to craft messages
that resonate with the each group
imagine having a bull horn but instead
of generic announcement you can speak
directly to each segment in a way that's
relevant to them then there is step four
which is testing and refining remember
this is an ongoing process just like any
good detective you got to keep an eye on
the results track how your targeted
messages perform gather feedback and be
ready to adjust your strategies as
needed so these were the steps to
Monitor and started with the
segmentation process you can go through
these steps again if you want to now
let's have a look at the limitations and
benefits of marketing segmentation so
let's start with limitations first so
first limitation is data challenge
gathering and analyzing detailed
consumer data can be complex and
expensive smaller businesses might
struggle with access or affordability
then the next one is Shifting Sands
consumer preferences evolve over time
segments need constant monitoring and
adaptation to stay relevant then the
next one is over segmentation can lead
to Tiny markets that aren't profitable
then limited data can lead to
stereotypes and inaccurate assumptions
about consumers careful analysis and
real world data validations are crucial
all right so these were some of the
limitations that you have to make sure
that it will not be there in when you
are doing the marketing segmentations
and it should be there so you have to
keep an eye on it so let's talk about
the benefits of Market segmentation so
it creates personalized and relevant
marketing messages that resonate with
specific groups leading to higher
engagement and conversions then it
allows for Focus marketing efforts on
the most profitable and receptive SE
ments then there is it helps businesses
understand and meet the unique needs of
their consumer enhancing satisfaction
and loyalty effective segmentation leads
to increased market share improved brand
reputation and higher profitability
through strategic and impactful
marketing it helps businesses understand
and meet the unique needs of their
customers enhancing satisfaction and
loyalty then the next one is effective

share improve brand reputation and
higher profitability through strategic

marketing segmentation so in today's
crowded Marketplace effectively

reals so are you ready for this let's
get started let's look at Instagram and
ads in digital marketing so let's talk
about Instagram ads and branding first
why is it so important to use Instagram
advertising for your branding well more
than 25 billion businesses use Instagram
to promote their services and
products yeah so when they are all
working on developing their brand
through Instagram so 90% of the
Instagram accounts they follow at least
one business on Instagram and 62% of
users say that they are more interested
in a brand after seeing them in an
Instagram story so it's a very important
platform for Brands to connect with
their users yeah and many Instagram
users they actually use Instagram to
research new products and services and
most Instagram users almost more than
80% they say they take an action after
seeing a product on
Instagram yes so no surprise that many
brands are active on Instagram yeah and
on average you can say that the brands
do about one and a half times posting
every day yeah so there's no doubt that
Instagram should be part of your
business yeah it is an effective tool
for advertisers to boost brand awareness
and increase engagement with their
followers and their customers and it's
not only a platform to Showcase your
brand but also a channel through which
you can interact with your followers and
build customer loyalty and then I'm not
even talking yet about the Ecommerce
opportunities you have on Instagram by
opening up a shop by promoting your
products on Instagram so a platform
where you definitely have to
be so it can act as a new channel for
your business which can extend your
online presence and when you are on
Instagram you can promote you can sell
you can increase sales of your business
yeah you can gain many many benefits
from being on Instagram and here are
just a few of them so you can keep up
with what's happening in the world so if
many people if every one yeah billions
of people are on Instagram why aren't
you so there is the new Instagram shop
feature that can help you and your brand
to get more sales so you can open up a
shop on Facebook you can then connect
that shop with your Instagram and you
can promote your products you can tag
your products in your Instagram posts
and that will lead to sales through your
um your Facebook and your e-commerce
shop it's fantastic for competitor
analysis what are your competitors doing
on Instagram what are they promoting
what are they advertising you can learn
a lot about what works and what doesn't
work in the the market Instagram is also
a place where you can connect with your
customers where you can deliver customer
service yeah so it's not just offline or
not just on Twitter but you can use that
on Instagram as well
so Instagram these days is a very normal
a very basic platforms and it's almost
like you're having your website
customers expect you to be on Instagram
as well these days so if you do that
properly it can help you in getting more
customers growing your online customer
base on Instagram and it can help you in
developing your brand to generate more
sales and to grow your online reputation
by setting the tone and the style of
your post you can immediately develop
and present an online sort of identity
that you can then transfer into your
online
reputation another powerful aspect of
that you have with Instagram is that you
can work with influencers yeah there's
many influencers many Instagram um users
with large followings they offer their
services to Brands to help them in
promoting their products and services so
that is not enough for you finally yeah
the virality on Instagram is very very
strong so if you have good content good
posts good stories Good reals you can go
very high and wide and far through the
uh the Instagram um the Instagram world
and many people will view your videos
and share your videos so so it's a
platform you can no longer ignore and
you definitely want to be
there so in 2020 a new style of post was
created which was called the Instagram
reals which is kind of the followup of
the igtv which was a kind of a vertical
video kind of YouTube channel that you
could get on um on on Instagram now it
is sort of an response of Instagram to
the growth of uh of Tik Tok and creators
on Instagram like Justin Bieber lizo
Stanley Tui they really helped to
transform this um feature uh from a
almost like a Tik Tok wannabe to a
fullblown competitor of Tik Tok they are
full screen vertical videos that can be
up to 90 seconds long
yeah they come with many unique editing
tools and an extensive library of audio
tracks as well so it's very easy to make
these short videos and to start sharing
them and you will see that the view and
the engagement that you get with these
Reals in in Instagram is extremely high
on top of the sounds real can include
multiple video clips filters captures
and in and Interactive active
backgrounds so you can add stickers all
the tools that you expect in that you
see in stories that you see in Tik Tok
you see that in the Instagram reals as
well now they're clearly different from
Instagram stories yeah Instagram story
they did disappear in 24 hours once you
post a real it is available on Instagram
until you delete it so they are also
favored by the Instagram algorith them
yeah which is more likely to recommend
them to people who don't follow you yes
so it is a very good tool to grow your
following but we'll talk about reals a
little later when we go into the uh
after we've gone into the advertising on
Instagram so let's look into um
advertising on Instagram here are some
interesting facts about Instagram
advertising each month there are 2
million advertisers active on
Instagram yeah so that is a big number
of people the estimated advertising
reach for Instagram users is
1.32 billion
users yeah so there and that is an
important one the Instagram advertising
reach has outpaced Facebook's
advertising reach in the last last year
so then did you know you can reach 22%
of the global population age 13 or older
in Instagram so a platform an
advertising platform that you cannot
ignore yeah and through Instagram reals
you can reach another potential audience
of close to a billion people
so and interesting fact to know is that
the split in female and male is about 45
and
55% on the advertising audience for the
uh Instagram
reals so how do you create Instagram um
ads through the Facebook advertising
manager yep and we've done a um a short
or a video about Facebook advertising in
the um in in earlier video of this
series but um so I'm not going to go
into this but I do want to show you
um a new feature in the Facebook and
Instagram advertising advertising setup
but before we go into this let's have a
quick look at Instagram and see if we
can find some ads so if I go out of here
and I go to um
Instagram yeah so here you see my mobile
let's log in and we're going to
Instagram yeah so by just by browsing
through your news feed you will already
come across ads yeah so let's see where
we see an ad popping
up so here you see one yes so Sahara
Services official and because it's an ad
you see it's a sponsored ad and here you
see the type of ad that we see here is a
photo add just one photo that they have
with a call to action in this case visit
the Instagram
profile so here you see an ad yeah which
is again is sponsored but here you see I
can flick through the photo so this is
what we call a carousel ad yeah so there
are multiple photos or in this case
videos so you could also see this as
kind of a video ad but this is a
combination of a video ad and a carousel
ad where you can flick through multiple
photos so what I've done I've saved a
few um a few ads yeah that is easier so
I don't have to browse so if I click
here on the saved and here you see some
ads yeah so here you see an example of a
photo ad but multiple photos and that's
why we also call this a c Carousel
ad okay here you see an example of this
another Carousel ad yeah so you can see
that it's an ad because it say sponsored
again multiple photos and a call to
action yeah here you have a photo ad
where it's just one photo and here you
see another Carousel ad with two
photos and here you see a video ad
yes so these are the ads that you see on
uh in the news feed besides that there
are ads in the stories and here at the
top you see the stories so let's go here
browse through the stories so here you
see and we immediately see here a
sponsored ad from Barcelona Tanger yeah
and this is a video ad yeah what I like
about the ads on the stories and that's
why they are so powerful they have a
very sort of natural blend with the
stories before and after them they don't
really look like ads and particularly if
you're making them full screen vertical
ads yeah they blend in very well with
the the with the news feed yeah of the
story feed yep so here you see another
ad
yeah with as a story so you can the call
to action are you looking for the click
on the more yeah and then you can have
different more information in the ad as
well so very
powerful yeah here you see another
ad okay so those are your ads on on the
on the stories and then here you see the
real
yeah now
um yeah but we'll come back to the reals
later and here in the reals you will be
will be able to see and to Showcase your
ads as
well okay so that is the uh those are
the ads on um uh on Instagram yeah so if
I summarize this
yeah if we look at the uh the Instagram
ads so the first ads that we saw were
the photo or the image ads yeah so
particularly for campaigns where there
is a very strong visual aspect yeah
strong visual information that you can
summarize in one single image they are
the best um for creating image ad these
pictures can be produced using your own
photographers or designs or
illustrations or you can even take an
existing post that you can promote or
that you can boost as an image ad as
well so very straightforward very simple
but the image ads are the simplest way
of um creating uh Instagram ads here you
have a story ad so a story ad multiple
visuals that go in a story engagement is
typically greater with story ads yeah
because it sort of gets the entire
Mobile screen and it's much more
engaging than ads in the uh in the news
feed yep so you see here there is not
really video in there but it is moving
kind of images moving text yeah and
audio in this ad from from Spotify so
story ads are extremely powerful one of
the most popular types of ads in
Instagram and again very easy to create
you then have the video ads so if you
want to give the viewers a more indepth
look of your brand your products your
services then run a video ad on
Instagram
so make them short you can make them
Square you can make some full uh full
sort of vertical full screen but the
important thing is try try to make the
content
engaging yep and that is where video ads
are so powerful and they can bring a
message across in a very powerful way
video ads on Instagram they are probably
the ads with the highest
conversions yeah for um for people that
view the ad and if you want them to take
an action so yep so those are the video
ads and then you have the reals ads so
intermix with reals you can have 30
second long ads that are sort of
comparable to story advertising so
they're full screen vertical videos and
again they properly merge with the
organic reels yep and they have feature
they have sound they feature Sound and
Music so very powerful ads where you can
get very good call to actions learn more
learn more buy now yeah different sort
of call to actions that can really lead
people either to drive them to your
website or drive them to your shop where
they can buy your
product yep and then we have the
carousel ads and the carousel ads is
what I showed you where you have a
collection of photos or videos that
people can swipe through yep so they can
particularly they work really well in
your Instagram feed and they are really
good for show showcasing multiple
products in your ad what you also see is
that people use Carousel ads where they
have one large sort of horizontal photo
that they split up in three sections so
it is almost like browsing through the
photo from left to right so very
powerful ads that you can get on um on
Google on Facebook and on Instagram
advertising okay now before we go into
the real
let's go to Facebook ads and show you
some a new feature on uh on the
advertising for the um for Instagram
advertising so here you see the Facebook
business manager yeah so it is the meta
business Suite which is sort of a new
integrated platform um which brings
together a number of functions it used
to be the Facebook business manager but
they now have brought it all under the
meta business Suite so if I go there for
my riat Foria page it takes you to
everything you need to do and to plan
and to manage and to track of your
Facebook or your Instagram account yeah
you see here I man can manage the
Facebook page and I can manage the
Instagram page now we're not going to go
into the whole of the meta business suit
I just want to show you the advertising
and a new feature here in advertising if
I click on all tools and then I click
here on
ADD yeah so this is kind of a quick
creation of ads I can automate my ads I
can choose a goal for my ads or I can
boost existing content and I just want
to show you how easy it is these days to
make an ad for your Instagram so if I
want to boost a post yeah or I can get
more leads or whatever I want to do yeah
boost an Instagram post or real let's go
into that yeah so content type I'm just
going to do a post for this sake yeah so
we're going to boost this
post yep and then here you will see how
the ad will look like in your Instagram
feed in this case yep and that's where
you can change the text of your ad so
it's a really good feature to quickly
launch an ad of an existing post post
make sure you've got your ad blocker
Switched Off to get access to this yeah
you can have other previews as well
let's see what that will give
us yeah so here you see the feed in
Instagram explore here would the
Instagram
feed here would how it looks in
Instagram stories
here is how it would look in Instagram
reals yes so really useful tool to
quickly see how your ads will show on
Instagram yeah for an existing post and
then of course you can have the same
facilities if you want to create a new
post okay so that's all I'm going to
share with you on Facebook and Instagram
advertising and how to create your uh
Instagram ads through the meta business
Suite right so let's go back to the
presentation and let's look at the
Instagram res
so yeah so where are the reals in
Instagram if I click here on Instagram
and then here is my home yeah if I click
at the bottom on the little icon here I
can then go to reals and this is exactly
like Tik Tok I can just flick up and
that takes me to the next
post okay so very useful and very simple
way of um of creating and sharing
content in very popular way and a lot of
people spend time on the reals to find
really cool content okay so here I can
go to the search and I can search for
items so I can search for instance look
at marketing how to yeah and here you
see books to master marketing which is
in a real format so this is how I can
then access posts in relation to
marketing yeah and um and other elements
yeah books to
read yeah so lots of stuff here on the
real that you can use to find content in
every topic that you're interested in
yep so uh here is more reals on on
Morocco yeah so very useful tool now how
do you create a real you click on the
plus icon and you basically select here
at the bottom post story real or live
you click real and then you see the four
op five options that you have here for
the audio the length of the video the
speed yeah the grid that you want to
change the scale and there's even a
timer so there's lots of functionality
that you can use here in your um in
developing your video Then by pressing
the center button you can start
recording the video yeah and there is
also opportunities to get um take for
instance do little characters dancing on
your desk yeah or on your keyboard you
can make them slightly
bigger yeah we lost a character where
was he and now we're recording we've
lost so here's our character I can blow
him up a bit yep and we then see him
dancing on our screen yeah happy with
that stop it do
next yeah I'm going to not not add a
sticker here is the video that we've
just created
yeah I can edit a clip if I want to I
click next and then I can share it to
reals I can write a caption I can add
stickers and all the standard stuff that
you can do on your uh on the reels yeah
so very cool very like tick to and this
the best thing about it it is so simple
to make is very
intuitive okay so that is a quick
introduction of the
reals so how do you fit reals into your
digital marketing strategy let's have a
look at that in a bit more um in a bit
more detail yes so it is a really good
way to give your audience a behind the
scenes overview yes so which works well
to get engagement and to get Trust on
your brand yes so look at the culture in
the company how you make your product
how hard people work look at the the
customer services how they work it's a
really good way to give people a
behindth scenes look of the company and
again to build this brand trust people
really appreciate that yeah so that is
one of the things that you can do with
Instagram reals another very powerful
aspect of Instagram reals is that you
can use it to generate what we call user
generated content why not ask your
customers or your users to create reals
around a topic that you work on yeah and
share it with with a hashtag yes so it's
a great way for people to getting to
know the company getting to know the
products start using
influencers yeah get competitions going
where you do photo contest um or maybe
video contests and you can turn those
into reals with the pictures or make
them uh actually let the user share the
the reals they created themselves yes so
sharing user generated content is a
second big benefit that you can get on
using Instagram reels now Instagram
reals because they're short people have
short attention span they're also really
good good to educate your customers yeah
or educate your audience they're a great
way to develop yourself as a as an
expert in your field by giving their
audience value yeah on how to use your
products how to
um to to answer questions about your
product yeah on how to do specific
things in uh in using your products so
get people to learn around product and
if you make that a recurring type of re
people will come back for them because
they want to learn more about your
products it's also good to see your
products in actions so combined with
user generated content why not ask your
audience yeah your customers to make
short reels on how they use your
products yes so but if you want to do it
yourself you can really try to highlight
what set you your product apart from
your
competition
so yeah use that to your advantage in
using Instagram reals to highlight your
products and to see your products in
action and of course it goes without
saying if you make it fun if you make it
more personalized yeah that is a
fantastic way to connect with your
audience yep and that is where children
work really well where pets cats dogs
work really well try to get casual try
to interact with your followers through
very sort of emotional casual content so
and often what you will see that these
type of reals will have very high number
of views because people just love to
browse through that type of content yeah
create your own challenge or create your
own Trends encourage your fans to
participate and use a special hashtag to
share the content they create yeah for
you so that's the big benefits that you
can get from the reals yeah so use that
to your advantage good so let's look at
some tips and tricks on Instagram
advertising now remember most people
watch content on their mobile Instagram
is a mobile app so make sure that you
design your ads with Mobile in mind make
sure that you optimize your ads for
mobile there's nothing worse than seeing
a um an Instagram story ads with a
horizontal video and then black above
and below yeah so optimize it for the
mobile and mobile is vertical so use
that vertical format because the
immersion is better but also it's much
easier to crop a vertical video to a 4x5
aspect R ratio or a square ratio than a
landscape video yeah so make sure you
design your ads for mobile first tip two
let the visuals speak for
themselves yeah make your ads less
worthy and use Font sizes that are
optimized use color yeah make to use
capitals make sure that it is optimized
for mobile devices use big fonts that
stand out use colors that stand out and
let the visuals speak for
themselves tip three yeah use animations
use Motion Graphics it is not just video
that you need to have but animated text
animated things happening on the screen
they are videos as well so let the
screen come to live either through video
or through animation and Motion
Graphics and of course very important
Keep The Branding keep the messaging
that you have keep it at the front yeah
and the first three seconds people will
decide if they want to watch the entire
ad or continue to scroll yeah so make
sure that in the first three SE seconds
you capture people's attention and
you've put your branding and your
message
across and then of course use sound yeah
you sound in your ads so although lot of
people they may want to watch it without
audio Yeah make it accessible by people
with muted volume use trendy soundtracks
to engage those who choose to listen to
your
videos yeah consider using captions as
well or text overlays that's very
important if you have somebody speaking
in your ads yeah always use captions or
overlay of text to make sure that if
people have the sound off that they can
still understand what the ad is all
about right so that is all on the
Instagram ads and the Instagram reals so
let's look at some of the questions that
I'm getting yeah from people when we
talk about Instagram reals and Instagram
advertising so one question I'm getting
a lot is if I do my reals
yeah I didn't get much engagement what
should I do to improve yeah so now first
of all in general Instagram reals have a
very high
engagement yes so they're probably the
part of Instagram with the highest
engagement that you will see and I will
show you yep so if I go to my Instagram
here on the of my my riat for Russia let
me close this
here yes
so save the draw
close yeah so I'm going to my Instagram
so this is my profile and here you see
my reals now if I post a video a normal
video I used to get maybe I could I get
some views but nothing like thousands or
thousands of views yes so since we've
been using Instagram
reals yeah we've now get views and place
on our videos here
1,244 here is a view
11,000 views of the
video Yeah here you see 6,000 views of
the video these were numbers we would
never get yeah on the Instagram news
feed or the Instagram stories so here
you see you do get the engagement of
your um of the reals on Instagram yeah
and it's one of the big reasons is that
Instagram favors the Instagram algorithm
favors Reals in your um yeah in sharing
your content okay so make sure that your
video content is up to scratch maybe the
music could be improved a really good
way is to look at what your competitors
are doing yeah and maybe they do things
that you're not doing so try to learn
from that okay question two how do I
choose to write soundtrack for my
Instagram reals good question yeah it's
very important that you get the right
sound for your Instagram reals now
Instagram has a whole library of sounds
that you can choose from in creating
your uh your reals Facebook has a huge
library of thousands and thousands of
sounds that you can download royaltyfree
and use in your uh in your posts in your
ads yes
so very important first of all is that
you look at what's trending in the world
yeah when it comes to picking a
soundtrack yeah so learn from that what
are the hits at the moment what are the
most popular sound music videos on
YouTube what's the most popular music on
the on Instagram learn from that yep and
then make your decision on what music
you want to use in your
video okay will reals get me organic
audience or do I need to promote them as
well so the beauty about digital
marketing is that you decide what you
want to do yeah whether you just want
organic or whether you want to advertise
yeah so just to be clear for everybody
when I say organic audience it means
that if I do a post without any
advertising how many people will see my
post how many people will see my video
my real and how many people may like it
or share it yeah and we know and as I
said earlier the reals have a
high fairly High organic reach from the
three areas in Instagram posts stories
and reals reals give you the highest
organic reach at the moment but we also
know these days and if you look at some
of my other videos that I posted on
YouTube on digital marketing that social
media is no longer a free right social
media these days is pay to playay yeah
so if you really want to use Instagram
and Instagram reals to grow your
business to find leads then you need to
combine organic marketing with paid
marketing yes so start looking into what
we call the pay-per-click advertising
and see how much wider and how much
bigger the audience is that you can
Target yep and then try to invest some
money in the payperclick advertising and
see what results you
get so always good to look into that
have your options open but the good
thing about digital marketing you decide
what you want to do Instagram is a
social media platform that needs no
introduction with nearly 1 billion
monthly active users and 500 million
daily active users Instagram is a
platform drive with marketing
potential more than7 billion Revenue has
been generated from Instagram mobile and
it's home to more than 2 million
advertisers
not only that marketing on Instagram has
the following advantages
too you have increased conversions
according to research more than onethird
of the people using the app have used it
to purchase products which means by
marketing your products on the app
there's a higher chance of
conversion you also have advanced
targeting options this is in part thanks
to Instagram's parent company Facebook
Instagram has access to just about all
advertising features offered by by
Facebook ads with this you can advertise
to People based on their age location
gender interests and much more you can
also build better brand follower
relationships you can stimulate
conversion with your followers and build
a connection with them you'll also get a
greater understanding of what your
followers like and dislike based on
their engagement this enables you to
make content they enjoy more and
increase the chance of converting a user
to a
consumer so let's have a look look at
how marketing is done on
Instagram let's start with number one
optimize your
bio your bio is the first thing people
notice when they get to your page that's
where they make the first impression of
your brand and that's why it's important
for your bio to be informative
captivating and
engaging use your bio to provide a brief
description of your brand or product the
type of content you would be posting
brand hashtags links to other social
media platforms and more your bio should
also include a URL to where you want to
drive traffic to be it your Brand's
website or a page for a particular
product make sure to track this link as
well to see how much traffic it brings
here's an example of how Samsung uses
its bio
effectively you can see it's a very
straightforward it's got a branded
hashtag it talks about all the services
Samsung offers there are links to other
pages and a link to the website as well
it's to the point and covers was
everything you need to know about it
next up at number two we have create a
Content
calendar now if you ask anyone who works
with social media one of the most
important things they'll tell you is to
have a Content
calendar a Content calendar enables you
to keep track of your posts it'll help
you plan ahead and automate the process
of publishing your posts when your
audience is most active a calendar helps
you decide what content caption hashtags
videos goes live on what day date or
time a consistent post schedule will
enable you to make the most out of
Instagram it'll also keep your audience
engaged and also give you access to
historical posts if you want to repost
your older
content next up we have number three get
greater reach with ads paid ads can
enable you to get more followers
engagement leads and
conversions the caveat here being that
you'll need to pay for it too the add
options are pretty similar to what you
have on Facebook like audience
segmentation based on likes interactions
buying habits and more you also have a
variety of AD formats to choose from
like story ads image ads video ads
collection ads and more moreover they
can also be set up from Facebook ads
manager here's an example from an ad
from body shop in which they're using a
single image ad the advertising works
because of its interesting creative and
attractive ad copy that attracts the
customer to interact with the post and
click on the link let's go to number
four have a visually consistent feed
Instagram is a platform in which people
gravitate towards aesthetically pleasing
content to authentic expressions and
diverse perspectives the objective is
that your feed needs to match with your
Brand's identity and must appeal to the
audience within your industry what works
nowadays are candid shots muted Earthly
tones with a low-key editing style your
content must feel down to earth and your
brand
approachable as you can see in the
images all of them have aesthetically
pleasing images and are somewhat blue or
underwater theme and that's the kind of
thing you should aim for your content
following an understandable and
interesting aesthetic depending on the
product you're trying to sell now for
number five tell a story the images
videos and stories you post need to tell
stories that can Captivate your audience
and establish a connection with them
this makes it more likely that they feel
closer to your brand and buy your
products your captions can tell stories
that can help your brand appear more
human and build deeper connections with
your
audience your content needs to align
with what your audience cares about or
solves problems they face here's an
example of how the page Patagonia talks
about forests in America each of their
posts tell stories about a different
issue that affects nature their brand on
Instagram revolves around bringing
awareness to such issues that's the kind
of kind of stories you should tell with
your
brand next up number six use the right
hashtags using the right hashtags can
make the difference between your post
showing up on the explore tab for
everyone to see and it getting lost in a
sea of
content your hashtags shouldn't be too
generic like hash New Year or hash style
since they'll have too much competition
instead mix up trending and Industry
specific keywords to connect with your
followers research on ESS F hashtags and
limit yourself to less than seven in
each post the more the hashtags in your
post the more likely it seems spammy
untargeted and
unprofessional find out what and how
many hashtags your competitors use and
how you can do something
similar you could also create a hashtag
for your brand these need to be short
easily memorable and involve your brand
name in some way let's now go to number
seven take advantage of ugc ugc or user
generated content gives your followers
to further involve themselves with your
brand ugc ALS by them as well regardless
of the field your brand belongs to ugc
can be used to convert followers into
Advocates of your brand here's an
example of how Starbucks uses user
generated content and takes advantages
of Their audience to advertise their
products in this post here they're
attracting customers with an image of
happy children dressed in products sto
at Starbucks
the post posted by another user would be
appreciated by the audience and improve
brand
loyalty next up number eight take
advantage of video ads most
instagrammers state that users have
visited websites searched or told a
friend after being influenced by posts
even though photo ads are still the more
popular form of advertising video
advertisements aren't too far behind
there are three key video formats when
it comes to Instagram ads single video
ads that can create 60-second ads
corosal are a combination of images and
videos and Instagram stories that enable
you to combine images and videos to
create visually attractive
ads here's an example of the brand Pizza
73 using story ads to advertise their
pizzas it's successful because you're
showing off the product they are
advertising with well-shot videos and
captions now for number nine partner up
with
influencers connecting with influ ERS
will enable you to connect with thought
leaders within the industry and enable
you to show off your brand to a larger
Audience by connecting with them your
brand will have greater authenticity and
Authority influencers need to be given
new tools resources and guidance to
carry out their role effectively and to
work together as
partners micro influencers are also
considered to be more affordable and
they have a closer connection with their
audience here we can see how Ralph
Lauren have collaborated with an
influencer to advertise their products
the influencer showing off the latest
Ralph Lauren has to offer this
encourages his interested followers to
check out the page and buy something for
themselves next for number 10 host
contests and giveaways contests enable
your audience to engage with your brand
with 3.5 times more likes and 64 times
the comments you can give away a product
or a service which enables you to boost
engagement and brand awareness contests
and giveaways need to be planned Brands
need to be partnered with Contest rules
need to be identified posts need to be
created and much more monitoring the
contest and then running it is also
really important you would need to track
your contest performance and promote the
results on other social media platforms
as well here's an example of a contest
run by Domino's Pizza which encourages
people to contribute their own short
stories and connect better with the
Brand number 11 take advantage of
stories and igtv stories enable you to
create a combination of photos and
videos that disappear after 24 hours
stories can greatly influence your reach
and engagement rates even giving your
story the chance to show up in the
explore section it can also help make
your brand SE more approachable and
authentic adding links to the Instagram

where we will be talking about YouTube
channels we're going to be talking about
what are YouTube channels how do you set

do you subscribe to them but before we
start let me quickly introduce myself I
am Mark campman I will be your digital
Navigator for this video and if you like

about in YouTube why is YouTube so
popular what makes it so special and why
do you need a YouTube channel well the
numbers they speak for themselves over 2
and a half billion people open YouTube
at least one a month that is onethird of
the world's
population YouTube generates around 30
billion of Revenue in 2021 that is $78
million a day these are extraordinary
amounts and this is primarily
advertising Revenue now 25% of global
mobile usage is for YouTube it's one of
the most popular mobile apps and YouTube
is the MJ source of video for 78% of its
users look at the younger generation
they don't watch the restal TV they
watch TV on YouTube so on the back of
this a whole community of video creators
have emerged people who go on YouTube to
present to share to discuss to debate to
invent to compare and become famous with
posting their videos we call them
YouTubers and I don't have to mention
people like kangam style Justin Bieber
sha Mendes Ariana Grande daa Lipa and
what about brands that made it big on
YouTube the Dollar Shave Club Blend Tech
with blend will it blend and it's the
YouTube channel they use as the social
platform for their videos a YouTube
channel serves as the homepage for a
user's account anyone can view YouTube
without having an account however you
need to create a YouTube channel if you
plan to upload videos add comments or
make playlists but more about how to do
this later businesses can also have a
YouTube channel these channels are
different from the personal channels
because they can have more than one
owner of
manager so how do businesses benefit
from YouTube well posting on YouTube
will help people find you on Google
remember Google owns YouTube by
consistently utilizing YouTube for your
business you can increase your chances
of showing up in the search results and
improving your own
rankings YouTube will also expose you to
a huge Global audience YouTube is
available in over 80 languages and it
receives more than 30 million visitors a
day who watch nearly five billion videos
it's the second biggest search engine
coming only after Google itself and the
YouTube app again as I said earlier is
one of the most popular apps in the
store YouTube gives you qualified
traffic people on YouTube often have a
question they search for and if your
video can answer the question they have
you will get a qualified lead it's much
like Google search but then it's
visual also video content is 12 times
more likelier to be watched than text to
read video can evoke emotion they can
make you think they can make you feel
and if they make you think and feel
you're not likely to forget those videos
and that's much more that can be said
for most other types of online
marketing video also helped to humanize
your brand they bring it to life taking
your messages from flat and static to
Dynamic and engaging videos help your
brand build trust and loyalty in a
unique way you can also use YouTube ads
to reach an even bigger audience YouTube
advertising runs on through the Google
ads platform and has some very powerful
features and more about these ads on
YouTube later videos can also be
repurposed across many other channels so
they can help you drive a additional
traffic to your website you can share
them on your social media channels you
can embed them on your own website or
you can include them in your email
marketing to summarize video marketing
is a must for your business and if
you're not on the video train you will
miss the next stop publishing regular
videos is key and YouTube offers you a
YouTube channel as your YouTube homepage
for all all your videos so here's a bit
more background information about the
you YouTube ecosystem it's important to
know that there are three players in the
YouTube
ecosystem there's you the viewer there's
the content creator or the people that
upload their videos and there are Brands
Brands who want to reach you to sell
their products and it's YouTube's
challenge to keep everybody happy in
this ecosystem to keep you happy to show
you the best videos keep content
creators Happy by enabling them to make
some money and to keep Brands Happy by
connecting them with the biggest
audience possible so how do Brands
connect with you very simple through
advertising showing your short video ads
before or during the videos you watch in
fact 84% of YouTube viewers bought from
Brands after watching videos or ads they
see on
YouTube and then how do content creators
make money very simple YouTube enables
them to earn ad revenue from ads that
run before or during their videos every
time an ad shows in front of or during
the video they get a percentage of the
ad revenue and I'm sure you've seen
those ads while you you are watching
YouTube videos but not every YouTube
content creator qualifies for this you
need to have at least 1,000 subscribers
to your channel and a minimum of 4,000
watch hours on your channel in other
words advertising in YouTube is the oil
of the YouTube ecosystem it keeps
everybody happy and there are a variety
of ads marketeers can choose from many
of them find pre-roll skippable ads the
most effective you know those ads that
you can skip after a few seconds just a
little side note Here YouTube ads on
mobile are the most effective for the
simple reasons that many people watch
videos on their mobile but also many
peoples have ad blockers on their
desktop so your ads will not be seen on
their
desktop YouTube has recognized the power
of mobile video and and mobile ads and
has announced that it will share 45% of
AD revenue on YouTube
shorts now what are YouTube Shorts
YouTube shorts are short vertical videos
and they are YouTube's response to the
phenomenal growth of Tik Tok and
vertical videos are key these days if
you want to boost engagement consider
you using vertical videos and here's why
it has a 90% higher completion rate
compared to Vertical videos about 80% of
consumers claim that the format is more
engaging and 65% of people find Brands
using vertical videos for their
advertising to be more
Innovative so enough of the theory let's
look at the yoube channels and look at
what you need and how to set up a un
YouTube
channel first of all you need a kit to
make videos whether it's your computer
your webcam a camera a smartphone and of
course you need video editing software
and very important you need an indoor or
outdoor environment to make your videos
and then of course you need to make the
video this will be a topic for another
simply learn video in its own right but
here are a few
tips what make people watch
videos people watch videos when they are
educational informational entertaining
funny controversial or shocking lots of
examples in these categories of videos
in YouTube now what type of videos do
people like to watch there's a whole
range of different types of videos but
if you want to look at the most popular
ones you talk about unpacking videos
review videos Challenge videos whole
videos parodies covers live videos howto
videos it's a whole range of styles of
video of topics of video that you can
create whether it's for Consumer videos
or for business
videos now what type of videos can you
make there's a whole range of different
types there's standard format video
which is horizontal there's the vertical
video which I talked about a little
earlier there are stop motion videos
yeah there are time-lapse videos you
could do 360 videos and the big growth
these days is in is in augmented reality
and virtual
reality yep and then what do you need to
think about when you shoot your video
there are three three very important
aspects of making your video think about
light think about sound and think about
having a stable camera
position yeah light is very important
there's no better light than outdoor
light and if you haven't got out if you
don't shoot outdoor but indoor make sure
you have a good lighting
setup sound can be very deceiving if
you're interviewing somebody on the
video outside side you think there is no
wind but then when you hear the video
back on your computer you hear the wind
it's it's quite an interesting uh
phenomenon but it's a fact so best is to
have a high quality microphone that you
use when you interview or when you
record your videos and think about a
tripod as well make sure your camera is
in a stable position so that's the
theory behind all this let's now look at
some YouTube channels and show you how
to make a YouTube channel and here is
the simply learn YouTube channel a very
clear Channel with lots of content for
people to learn about all topics in um
in technology so here you see the banner
yeah with some good messaging in there
you have your logo here you see the
number of subscribers
yep so you see it's a verified account
by YouTube and here is the Subscribe
button yep and when you are subscribed
to a video or to a channel they you get
um sort of personalized notifications or
you can switch off the notifications but
the beauty about people subscribing to
your channel is that they will receive a
notification when you publish a new
video then here you have a menu of
things that people can go to there's the
homepage for all your videos there is a
list of all your videos you can organize
your videos in playlists you can look at
the comments that you're getting in the
community section you can set up
different channels and you can group
those channels under your account and
here is the about page where you have
about information about the company yep
and this is you can optimize this with
keywords so Google will um Index this
for the for the search as well so let's
look at this homepage again and the um
The Branding yeah so here you see a
feature video and there are two elements
in this that are important here first of
all you saw just when I got on the page
before I subscribed you saw a different
video yep and then when you come back to
the page you can see another video so
basically you have a video that you can
put here for firsttime visitors where
you can promote your company or your
channel and then you can have another
video set up for um returning visitors
and then here you have all your videos
and you can organize them in playlists
and in a minute I'm going to show you
how to set this all up and how to create
your own
channel okay so this is simply learn
another example would be one of my
favorites on social media is social
media
examiner here is the social media
examiner YouTube channel way to grow
your following online yeah so here you
see the the featured video here you see
The Branding very good branding with
strong messages on there an industry
support that people can download you see
here you can put a few links to your
social media or your website or where
people can download for instance the
industry report here you see The
Branding the logo yeah again I can
subscribe to it and then here you have
the descriptions of the video and the
different channels the different um
playlists okay so then here you have the
group the different channels that they
have under their um their their main
channel the social media
examiner okay so you see coming back and
I see another video here so finally the
other one I want to show you is GoPro
GoPro they are very active on YouTube
very active on uh on having videos
having videos from their users from
their subscribers having very clear
playlists yes so so um and this could be
um different playlist from um users the
different products features and what
what have you what you also see here is
access to the
store yeah where they sell products and
if I click on this I can then go to the
GoPro website where I can buy this this
product so this is an overview of the
YouTube channel on the desktop but as we
all know most people and particularly
the younger generation they watch
YouTube videos on their mobile device so
whatever you do and in The Branding as
well on setting it up you need to make
sure that it looks well and it looks
good on the mobile as well so let's look
at these channels on the mobile device
yeah so here you see the mobile you see
see exactly the same um elements of it
you see your banner you see your uh your
your logo number of subscribers and your
feature video and then you have your
other
videos yeah so it's a lot easier to
navigate through one thing that you need
to be careful of is that the width of
the banner is not as wide as the width
on the uh on the desktop yeah so in your
design you need to take that into
consideration otherwise half of this
text will be chopped off yep so this is
simply learn if we're going to social
media
examiner yep so here is the social media
examiner page yeah their Channel again
the the banner and you have uh
subscribed yep and then here you see a
different color yeah will simply learn
it was brownish here it was greenish you
cannot change this color that is
something that YouTube will decide based
on the overall color it can pick it will
pick up on your um on your desktop on
your uh on your YouTube channel okay so
and again remember the banner how white
you go and then the other one was the
GoPro yep here the GoPro Channel same
look and feel here it is grayish yeah
with the banner the logo and then the um
the feature
video right time to have a look at how I
create a YouTube channel and how I
optimize it so I can grow my number of
subscribers to my channel here you see
the overall YouTube interface and it's
very very important that you get into
YouTube and that you sign in with your
Google account and once you have your
Google account set up and you're logged
into your Google account you can create
a YouTube channel so how do you create a
YouTube channel here you see a your user
yeah and here you see your user icon and
for me it's just why I haven't put any
visual there yet yeah and if you haven't
done anything on YouTube yet then this
is the screen that you will see yeah
here you see the videos that you can all
access the subscriptions how you can
explore and you can use YouTube without
having uploaded any video yourself or
without having created a channel if you
want to upload a video on YouTube you
click here on the plus of course
everything I'll show you
you can do on the mobile as well but my
experience if you are in admin mode and
you want to add text you want to add
your about you want to make different
selections then it's much easier to work
on the desktop so for demo purposes I'll
be showing it on the desktop okay so if
I click here on my user icon I get to
the menu of things I can do in my
account my Google account and my YouTube
account here you see create a channel I
can also go to YouTube studio and in
YouTube Studio I can edit all my videos
and optimize them I can check with
another I can switch to another account
I can look at my membership my data I
can look at the device theme I'm using
the language the restricted mode whether
you want certain videos not to have
presented to you your location keyboard
shortcuts Etc but what we're going to be
looking at is the create a channel so
I'll just click on create a channel and
here I'm going to add my name and my
name is basically I'm going to call it
Mark tube yeah so my channel is called
Mark Cube I can upload my picture here I
can also do that at a later stage so
let's create the Channel first and then
I'll show you how to do The Branding so
we'll click on Create
channel yep and then you will see that
your channel is ready so what I can do
now of course I can upload my first
video I'm not going to do that yet I'm
going to go straight into to customize
my channel and then once my channel has
been set up I'll show you how to upload
your first video so here is customizing
your
channel and there are three elements to
it there is the layout of your channel
there is The Branding of your channel
and there is the basic info of your
channel yeah so let's look at the
branding first but before yeah remember
we had the video Spotlight which was
your featured video so here you can
specify which two videos you want to
have in the featured section whether it
is a video for people who haven't
subscribed and then the feature video
for the people who come back and have
subscribed and then here you have your
featured
sections remember you can have the
videos you can have different sections
that you can add here like pop uploads
live past live streams upcoming live
stream the playlists subscriptions
feature channels all in the menu that I
showed you earlier but we'll come back
to that in a little bit Yeah here is
your menu on the left which is also
important yeah so and we'll come back to
that in a minute as well so first we're
going to do is look at the branding
yeah and here I can add my logo I can
add my banner image and I can add a
video Watermark which is standard
Watermark that will show in all your
videos so very simple we're going to
upload the images so here you see my I
created these in advance yeah so here
you see my YouTube logo yep so very
simple icon and I can now select okay
what section will I do I want and make
sure it fits within your image area and
you click done and you have your icon
your picture in set up here you see the
banner image you see at least 2048 by
1152 pixels and 6 megabytes or less if I
click upload I then have my banner image
I click open yeah and here remember what
you see on the desktop and what you see
on the mobile so here it is important
that you look at the text that you have
on your banner and make sure that it is
viewable on all devices I'm happy with
this so I click
done I'm not going to do the watermark
and then I'm going to click
publish yep so the changes have been
published so if I'm now going to look at
my channel view the channel on YouTube
you now see I have my banner I have my
uh my banner here I have my logo but of
course there's still a lot I have to do
I have to look at work on the about I
have to add maybe some other items in
the menu and of course I have to upload
a video so let's go back to the
customize the channel and what I'm going
to look now is to the basic info so
first of all I have my description so in
the description I'm going to tell people
what my channel is all about welcome to
my YouTube
channel a
place to learn
everything there is to
know about digital
marketing yeah and I can make this as
big as possible very I have a thousand
characters available and very important
think keywords here yeah if you follow
digital marketing courses keywords are
the Cornerstone of your digital
marketing strategy I can add a language
and here I have my channel URL and I can
change this if I want to yeah so it's a
standard web address for your channel it
includes your unique Channel ID yeah but
you can change this as
well yes so I can say here
Mark no actually I cannot change this I
will be able I think to change this
let's have a
look customize a customized URL is a
shorter easy to remember URL that you
can share with your audience and where
you have 100 or more subscribers you
have at least 30 days all of your
channel you have uploaded your branding
as well yeah so to
have your number to have your customized
URL you need to have these 100
subscribers and have a channel that's at
least 30 days old so I can't change this
right now and then here you can add the
links remember the links that you see on
your banner you can add a link yeah so
here I can say the link is um mark
campman or let's
say
simply
learn.com and I can say
https
simply
learn.com yeah and I can add a link I
can say um
Facebook and I can say
https
facebook.com/ SL simply learn and I'm
going to add uh
Instagram and I'm going to say
https
instagram.com SLS simply
learn okay yep and then here I can say
which links do I want to show on the
banner yeah I can add a whole load of
links here but then I can say just show
me the first three links on the banner
here's the contact info that is Mark at
Sly
learn.com yep so here is my about
section ready and then here I can click
publish and now I can go back to my
channel and what you see now my channel
is ready we have the banner we have the
home uh the logo and now here you see
simply learn.com the website the
Facebook and the Instagram it will
automatically pick up the logos from the
Facebook and the Instagram and the other
social networks that you want to add
here all right so the next thing is that
we need to look here at the uh the
topics that we want here yeah we have
home videos playlist channels and about
so I can add multiple channels if I want
but let's go back back to
customizing yes so we've done the layout
we've done we're going to look at the
layout now we've done The Branding we've
done the basic info so here is the
channel trailer we're going to do in a
minute when we've uploaded our first
videos so let's add a section and that
would be the created
playlists yep and we want to add a
section let's say uh popular uploads
okay and then I can say give me the
created playlist I want to the
top yeah I want um the uploaded videos
and then I have the shorts and I have
the popular uploads okay and again I'm
going to click publish I'm going back to
my
channel yep so and now you won't see the
order yet because I haven't put in any
vid any videos of course but you will
see as soon as we start adding videos
then you will can you can see that we um
uh that you get the order that we've
specified okay
so finally before we're going to upload
the video when we go into customizing
your channel you need to be aware here
of the features as well yeah the menu
items that you have so here is your
Channel
dashboard so in your channel dashboard
you see the videos that you uploaded and
it gives you basic Channel
analytics yeah and here you have some
news from YouTube um about new features
new training Etc here you see the
content so here you see a list of the
videos that you've uploaded their
visibility status is there a restriction
on the video what is the date that you
uploaded and you get some basic
analytics views comments and
likes okay here are your playlists that
you've created here you get your basic
YouTube channel
analytics yeah you're looking at your
comments that you get so here you can
sort of um review the comments you can
set some moderation guidelines here you
can also add subtitles to your videos
now we'll go into that in more detail
when we go into YouTube and uploading
videos and how to optimize your YouTube
videos but Google will
automatically subtitle your videos and
you can edit the um the subscri the
subtitles that Google will uh will do
yeah and very important to remember if
you use the Google Google subtitles for
your video it will not be indexed for
search for the simple reason that there
may be words that Google misinterpreted
in your video so you always need to edit
the video take the typos the um the
words that are misunderstood by Google
change those and then soon as you then
change the revised version of the
subtitles Google will then index the um
the transcrip typ file yeah for search
here is copyright information here is
monetization of your videos is important
we talked about this earlier yeah so
remember where you can have advertising
showing before or during your videos and
that is you will have to become part of
the YouTube Partner program and once
you're a member of the partner program
you'll be eligible to earn money from
your videos but you need to have a
minimum of 1,000 subscribers and a
minimum of 4,000 watch hours on your
videos you need to set up two-step
verification and you need to um um agree
to the community
guidelines okay here is customization of
your channel yeah we sort of went
through this earlier and then here is a
little nugget in YouTube that not many
people are aware of and that is the
audio library YouTube holds a huge audio
library of tracks and sound files yeah
and sound effects that you can actually
download and add to your videos you can
search the library so it is a huge
library that you can add for free to add
to all your
videos and then finally there is the
settings of your channel so you can
specify the conversion or the currency
for your channel that you'll be using
you can specify the basic info of your
channel yeah you can have the country of
residents in my case we can set that on
the United
Kingdom yep and it can add keyword which
is digital
marketing yeah and I can say
social media and I can say YouTube
Etc yep there is upload defaults so for
every video that you upload you can
specify a standard element in the title
standard element in the description
visibility you can specify and public
private or unlisted so P unlisted means
it will not show in the go in the
YouTube search
result there is advanced settings that
you can say you can also in your video
specify
chapters and you can spend those
chapters will then be sort of summarized
in the description of your video and
that will be noted in the timeline of
your video as well so it's really good
to structure your
videos there's permissions yeah and this
is where you can invite other people to
make changes or to edit your channel
there is your community that's where you
can set moderation guidelines and then
there are agreements yeah there's the
subject to the the terms of service okay
so those are your settings so very
important that you understand this menu
right so our channel is ready however we
haven't got any video in our Channel yet
so let's go and add a video so here to
add a video we click
plus okay and we're going to upload a
video or we can also go live yeah so
that's where we're going to do a live
broadcast or a live stream so upload a
video and here I'm going to Dr drag and
drop a video or I can select the file
and here is my about us short
infographic yep so here is the abouts
infographic that is the title of course
I can make that as exciting as possible
here I can tell the uh short
introduction
to our
company I can select a thumbnail of
course I have it hasn't selected a
thumbnail yet because it is still
uploading and optimizing the video yep
you can then say what playlist do you
want it to be part of what audience yeah
there is an automatic CH kids filter is
it made for kids or is it not made for
kids so it's like a a business type of
theme yeah here is PID promote motion is
that pay promotion in the video do you
want automatic chapters allow automatic
places you can add text this is all
about optimizing your video and that is
for a different video that we will be
talking about how to optimize your
YouTube videos okay and then it is going
okay so that is all done we're then
clicking
next yeah I can say do I want subtitles
do I want to add an end screen do I want
to add cards remember you see that on
videos where at the end of the video you
see two cards where you can click on uh
to go to another video again I'm not
going to do that for this video and I'm
going to click next yeah there is some
copyright checks on music and then we
click next and here is the video I can
then save and publish I want it to be

yet effective overview for you how to
set up your channel so
so that is it on the channel so let's
finish today's video with giving you
some tips on how to promote your YouTube
channel it is very important that you
promote your channel for the simple
reason you want to
get
subscribers yep remember your YouTube
channel is your so your YouTube social
media Network it is where you can
develop your brand it is where you can
get people excited it is where you can
build
relationships with people who watch your
videos so it's very important that you
do everything that's possible to promote
your uh your YouTube channel so how do
you go about promoting it first of all
very important in video marketing is the
title of your video yeah you see here
the about us infographics you see that
is the title of this video is pretty
boring if you look at most titles of
videos on YouTube yeah let's say let's
say if I search on YouTube for let's say
social media you immediately see the
titles that are powerful how social
media rewires your brain is social media
hurting your mental health yeah uh like
selfies and self-promotion the hidden
dangers of social media five crazy ways
social media is changing your brain
right away yeah here a bit more neutral
but still powerful how to develop a
social media strategy step by step these
are the type of things that people like
to uh to watch because those titles are
very engaging
yeah hand inand with the title is also
the thumbnail that you're using for your
videos yeah so here you see a good
example 365 days of journaling that's
the thumbnail that they uh they use yeah
if you go to social media examiner you
see good examples of
thumbnails yeah and they are all they
have the same color style they have the
same bold text bold titles they still
show people yeah so these are very
powerful thumbnails for your video and
look at yourself if you're doing a
search on YouTube yeah what videos will
you most likely watch videos where you
like the title and videos where you like
the thumbnail when they spring out when
they scream out of the search
results okay so very important that you
um that you look at that okay next thing
how do you optimize your channel is by
making sure that your videos are
optimized yeah so if I go to my videos
your videos and then here you have your
video and I go to edit the
details I can edit the title the
description remember keepy key wordss I
can edit the thumbnail I can edit tags
yeah I can edit um language lots of
stuff that you can optimize about your
videos another
important factor is make videos that
your audience wants to
see understand your audience yeah in
digital marketing terms
we um advise our clients to make
customer
personas and customer personas you
specify their pains their needs and
everything that is important for them
when they buy your your product yeah so
by understanding what your audience
wants you then can tailor the content of
your videos to their requirements
the next important aspect of your
YouTube uh channel is engaging with the
community yeah it's very important that
when people start adding comments in
your videos that you engage with
them yeah that is one place where you
sort of build your uh your community you
engage with people but you also engage
with YouTubers in your Market associate
with your Market yeah comment on other
people's videos so start
engaging with other content creators in
building your online YouTube reputation
as it where and start sharing your
videos yeah with them so that is an
important one another important aspect
of your uh channel is that you need to
cross promote your own videos Within
your videos yeah so it's very common if
I go to Simply learn yeah I go to their
Channel and I'm sure they have it on one
of the videos if I go to let's say here
um data
analytics yeah so it's a long course but
if I go to the end of the video I'm sure
you see that here at the
end yeah so you see here at the end the
next video that they promote so you
cross promote your other videos within
your video that you're showing it's a
very powerful aspect of um the uh
growing your YouTube channel cross
promoting your
video Yeah another one is very powerful
is what we call video
series yeah they are very very good in
driving traffic to your channel yeah why
because people want to if they like it
they will come back for the second
episode or if they jump in for instance
for the first time in the fourth episode
if they see the episode if they like the
episode then they say hey I want to
watch episode one two and three as well
so very important is to create series of
of videos a good example is social media
examiner yeah when you go to the social
media examiner YouTube page and you go
to the playlists here you see the
journey and the journey is a uh
basically a series of videos of the
history of the company yeah so you see
episode one episode 2 episode Three yeah
they even have multiple Seasons yeah of
this and this was very successful in uh
their their marketing promotion yeah so
create YouTube
series okay so back to my channel
another way of promoting your channel
and promoting your videos is to make
sure that your videos are outside
YouTube as well so if I click on the
video yeah and I click share instead of
just sharing the code here here yeah the
the URL I'm actually going to take the
embed code so the embed code gives you
an iframe which will actually show the
video on your website if you add this uh
I frame code to your web page yeah and
people will watch can watch the video on
your um your website but it will count
as a few on uh on YouTube yep and then
when people click on Youtube it'll take
them to your channel where they can um
where they can subscribe to your channel
yeah we talked about playlists very
important to promote your
channel yeah the playlists are important
and make sure you add calls to action to
your video at the end of the video get
people to do something to buy something
or to sign up or to register for an
event going live all always works in
promoting your channel yeah doing live
broadcast live behind the scenes or when
you're at an event do live broadcast
really good way to promote your channel
you can promote the event you can
announce the event it will lead to buzz
before the broadcast during the
broadcast and after the
broadcast yeah we talked about
collaboration with other creators with
other brands and then of course Very
powerful you can actually promote your
own ads by
advertising yeah so I can go to Google
ads I can create a video ad and at the
video ad is my short video and then that
video will show before and during um
videos that people watch yep and that
will drive views on your videos and
Views obviously will turn into
subscriptions to your channel as well
and then last but not least of course is
publishing your videos and your YouTube
content on social media channels as well
yeah Twitter of course is a very obvious
um place to promote your videos but uh
use it on um on other social channels as
well now Facebook doesn't necessarily
like it when you link to the YouTube
video because Facebook wants you to
upload the whole video yes so then
people will stay within YouTu within
Facebook to watch the video but there
are other social media channels where
you can promote your videos as
well okay well that concludes the
session on your YouTube
channels I hope you like this yeah so
remember a YouTube channel is your
social
media Network for your videos on Google
and on YouTube yep and it gives you a
fantastic tool to widen your reach to
reach a global audience and to start
building relationships with your uh
subscribers yep and help them in the
process of uh familiarizing themselves
with your products or your services
ultimately leading to them in buying
your product of your service YouTube
ideas for 2021 YouTube is the social
media platform that needs no
introduction launched back in the Year
2005 YouTube was a fresh breath of air
for the people who were slowly becoming
aware of the hype that surrounded the
internet several other platforms like
daily motion whme and VMO which
admittedly have their own fans have
tried to stand up against the bamoth
that is the YouTube and failed slowly
but surely Market began to realize the
enormous potential that YouTube offered
they could add small advertisements like
they do in the cable TV they could show
banner ads and do much more and all of
the thanks to the robust advertisement
features that Google already offered if
you're not already sold on why it's
important to advertise on YouTube here
are some facts that might change your
mind YouTube has more than 2 billion
users across the world a good fraction
of that audience could be shown your
product and could turn from users to
customer customers next important fact
is that eight out of 10 marketers
consider YouTube to be one of the best
platforms to advertise their products
and services followed by that people
watch one billionair of YouTube per day
as you watch this video you are
contributing to that number next 62% of
the business use YouTube to post content
this could be just videos on their
products tutorials event announcements
and much more 70% of the YouTube watch
time comes from mobile this means that
when you create an advertisement for
YouTube you keep the mobile users in
your mind and finally 90% of the people
say that they've discovered new products
or brands on YouTube which means that by
posting on YouTube your brand awareness
is highly likely to increase now let's
talk about the video
ideas the first one is behind thescene
videos these videos give you the
opportunity to show showcase your
audience how your business or brand
operates a creatively made video on the
inner workings of your business will
show off a more human side of your brand
and make you more relatable to your
audience it is also guaranteed to get
you loads of views and engagement here's
an example how Amazon showcases the
warehousing and distribution aspects of
its products it takes the viewers into
the factories and involves the various
people working there this shows to the
audience that even a large organiz
ization like Amazon how each individual
has an important role to play in the
overall
process next we have the company culture
a video that highlights your company
culture will tell the audience what your
business goals are what its values are
and why it exists it can also focus on
the various people who make sure the
company works in the way it does this
can help better connect with your
audience here's an example a company
culture video created by GoDaddy the
popular domain
register the video talks about how
GoDaddy creates a fun inclusive and
energetic environment for its employees
it includes interviews of employees
talking about why they enjoy working in
GoDaddy so much and this helps the
audience relate with the company and
could also catch up the interest with
some potential job Seekers next we have
the third idea that is the marketing
team a brand is nothing without the
people working behind it and that's
where these videos come in these videos
will help shine a light on the people
who create the products that the
audience knows and loves this helps
create a personal connection with the
audience these individuals can end up
becoming mascots for your brand here's
an example of Meet the team focusing on
Olympus group the video goes into the
history of mascot makers brand and the
people that make it a grand success the
light-hearted tone of the video also
greatly helps with making it more
relatable now we have number four
product showcase or announcement a
product Showcase Video aims to show the
features and benefits of the Brand's
latest offering to its audience these
short concise videos can inform the
audience about everything they need to
know about the new product or service a
product announcement video on the other
hand can be used to give the audience a
more detailed look into the product or
service than the product showcase it can
include comparisons to older versions or
competitors the aim of such video is to
show customers how the new product works
and why they need it now this video
needs no introduction Apple's iPhone

sleek and concise representations of
what the product would be like next at

videos these videos usually enable a
large amount of likes comments and
shares keyword research so basically
what we want to do is Center our
keywords just like our website we want
to Center our keywords around or content
around good keywords so the videos on
YouTube are no different than the web
pages on our website so if we have
somebody who states YouTube is the
world's second most well well-known
engine well it is because it's right
behind Google it's not a search engine
per se it's a video platform but if it
was a search engine it'd probably be
second right behind Google so YouTube is
pretty popular majority people use
YouTube search every day to watch videos
on a number of different topics so they
can find these videos in Google but
because YouTube's so powerful and so
popular people go directly right into
YouTube for their searches and so the
whole idea behind YouTube being the
second most well-known search engine is
centered around keywords so if you have
the right keywords for your video then
the chances of you ranking higher
increases on YouTube so we're going to
share with you a few easy ways to do
keyword research this is the most
important step in getting your videos to
rank on YouTube just like for those of
you who watched any of the SEO videos we
produced at at simply learn you know
that keyword research is so essential to
getting your web pages to rank on Google
well it's no different keyword research
and choosing the right keywords is just
as important for your videos as is for
your web pages so we're going to go into
a few things to do here to find the
right keywords so we have the search
suggestion you can look at your
competitors we have different tools we
can use some other factors involved in
Google itself so let's start talking
about some of these ways to really hone
in and do some good research on your
keywords to align them with your videos
so first thing is search suggest so
YouTube has a feature called
autocomplete so if you've done any
searches on Google it's very similar if
you're typing something into YouTube
search then YouTube is going to suggest
other related popular keywords so let's
take a look at that if we go back to
YouTube for a second and I just type in
machine learning YouTube is going to
populate on the autocomplete in the
search bar some other popular keywords
that we can potentially use or in this
case if I Choose You Know machine
learning tutorial I'm going to see a
video about machine learning tutorial so
here you can see simply learn rank
number number one for machine learning
tutorial but there are other videos that
show up in my search results so we want
to be able to use the search suggestion
box in the search box field so when
we're typing in something you know
YouTube just like on Google is going to
give us those suggestions so if we're
focusing uh a video on machine learning
then you know we have some ideas of some
other key wordss that we could center
around because these are are popular
keywords these are keywords that people
are using to search on YouTube so that's
one suggestion looking at competitors is
another suggestion so we could search
for keywords used by our competitors in
their video title and description so let
me talk a little bit about that what you
want to do is you want to go to that
particular channel of your competitor so
when you go to your particular
competitor's YouTube channel you want to
be able to click on the videos tab when
you click on the videos tab then you're
going to sort by most popular and then
what you could do is see a list of
videos and and then when you look at a
list of videos you're going to choose a
video and then what you're going to do
then is take a look at the keywords to
used in the title and description and
then once you do that you're going to
have a list of keywords that you can use
yourself for that video so for example
let's go back to YouTube so if I go to
type in simply learn here's their
Channel page just by clicking on simply
learn I click on videos ever wonder if
there's so now I can see all the videos
ever wonder if there's an easier way go
back so here I can see all the videos
sort by most popular once they do that
then I can choose a video this is the
most popular video right now for simply
learn if I click on that video it's
automatically going to start playing but
what I could do is simply just look at
you know the content description so just
by clicking show more I can see all the
content that align with this video
that's one way to do it is simply by
looking at your competitors now what you
get also do is look at the tags
associated with the particular video and
so what you want to do is you want to
look at the HTML and so that means
looking at the page source so just like
web pages what YouTube does is they look
at metatags so if you call from SEO in
order to get your pages to rank you need
to have a title tag and a metatag
description so videos are no different
what we're doing uh for YouTube is
aligning certain key words with the
video so if you take a look and do a
search for keywords by viewing the page
Source you're going to see all the
keywords
associated with a particular video so
for example if I go back to YouTube and
I look at the page source of a video
Let's just say this video here
Facebook's ad tutorial I'm going to pull
up the page source and all I need to do
isrl F and type in keywords and now for
that Facebook video I can see all the
keywords associated with the video so
you can see there's a lot of different
keywords we're aligning with this video
and so why do we want to do that because
we want you know our video to show up
for keywords that people may type in and
so if you use that YouTube autocomplete
it's going to give you those ideas there
most popular keywords so if they're
related align those keywords with the
video so here you can see Facebook
marketing Facebook ad strategy Facebook
ads for beginners so forth and so on so
there's a lot of keyw we've aligned here
with that particular video and again all
you need to do is look at the page
source so right clicking view page
Source do a contrl f for keywords and
you'll be able to see the keywords
aligned so you could do that for your
competitor's videos as well so you can
see what keywords your competitor is
using for a video that's most popular
for their Channel and is also ranking on
YouTube and on Google so using the
autocomplete gives you those keyword
ideas looking at your competitor's
videos also gives you some other ideas
for keywords that you can align with a
video that's relevant that you want to
rank for so let's look at uh some other
ideas here so you can install plugins
and there are plenty of plugins
available on the Chrome browser that
will help you see the video tags
associated with a particular video so a
couple of examples or vid IQ and tuddy
those are extensions that work in Chrome
and what they do is they give you the
exact tags that a particular video is
using so for example if I go back here
and I look at a video on YouTube let's
just say the machine learning Basics
video I have vid IQ installed on my
Chrome browser so just by clicking on
that vid IQ is going to give me a lot of
information about that video they're
just going to give me an overview of
their particular metrics they're going
to give me some other information
associated with Facebook some engagement
metric trick really what I'm interested
in is those keywords so if I scroll down
a bit here I can see the video tags
associated with the machine learning
Basics video so vid IQ is telling me is
these keywords are associated with this
video and not only does it show me what
keywords are associated I can also see
where they rank so for machine learning
Basics this particular video ranks
number one if I go down I can see what
is machine learning and how does it work
I can see it's rank number two here I
could see machine learning algorithms
it's rank number nine so I can get some
ideas of the types of keywords that are
being used as tags for that video
further down I can also see some Channel
tags but really this is the video tags
or the idea place I want to be able to
look to get an idea of the types of
keywords that are associated with the
video that are also ranking or not
ranking so that's another way for you to
really get an understanding of what key
words to use at the particular video so
autocomplete you can look at the page
source of a competitor's video or you
can use a Chrome extension in this case
I'm using vid IQ to give me some
information about the video tags for a
particular video so according to an
industry study using keywords and video
tags will help you rank well on YouTube
so you have to use keywords and video
tags if you want your video to rank
there's been a lot of studies YouTube is
so popular and videos are so prominent
in today's world where if you have
videos and you're going to upload them
to YouTube then associate the right
keywords with those videos so some
important factors when we look at
keywords what we want to do is look at
search volume we want to look at
competition we want to look at relevancy
we want to look at the primary and
secondary keywords that we want to use
so well chosen keywords will help you
rank so we just gave you some ideas on
how to do some keyword research again
those ideas were really to use the
autocomplete on YouTube or Google
they're going to give you some popular
keywords you can look what your
competitors are doing by looking at the
page source and just looking at the keyw
that are aligned with that video or you
can use a third party extension in
Chrome in my example I use vid IQ that
gave me the keywords associated with
that video so you have ways to get the
keywords so what we want to do is we
want to make sure we choose keywords
with high search volume they're going to
drive more traffic to your video however
we want to balance it out with keywords
that have low difficulty and are easier
to rank for so you don't want to choose
something very broad that's just going
to be very difficult to rank for and of
course we always want to go with
relevancy so if we're talking about
machine learning Basics then we want to
choose keywords associated with that and
that's where that autocomplete comes in
handy because what Google's going to do
and YouTube's going to do is give us
keywords that are very closely related
to the video that we're trying to
optimize for and so we have a number of
different keywords at our disposal that
are relevant that we can look to see if
they have good volume and low
competition and so the whole idea is we
want to choose a keyword that defines
the nature of the content and then what
we want to do is support that with
secondary keywords so we want keywords
that are highly relevant to the prim
primary keyword so that's the way to go
about aligning your keywords you want
keywords that are high volume low
competition are relevant and you want to
choose that one keyword that is really
what the content's about and then those
secondary keywords that support the
primary so if you have a machine
learning video you could choose your
primary keyword as in this case the
machine learning Basics video so well
chosen keywords help you rank well on
YouTube just like the machine learning
Basics so if I go back to our video our
machine learning Basics video if I just
type in machine learning Basics I'll be
able to pull it up and so here it is if
I click on it I'm going to go to YouTube
and so here I can see this keyword we
know humans learn from their is well
aligned because it's in the title it's
in the copy and it's aligned as a
keyword tagged with the video so we know
that that keyword has good volume low
competition is relevant because that's
what the video is about the basics of
machine learning learning it's an
introduction to machine learning so
instead of honing in on just
introduction to machine learning primary
key word is machine learning Basics and
then we supported that video with those
secondary keywords what is machine
learning because somebody who doesn't
know machine learning is probably going
to type in that keyword and then
introduction to machine learning is a
good secondary keyword because it's
explaining the basics of what machine
learning is all about so primary keyword
machine learning basic secondary keyword
words what is machine learning an
introduction to machine learning so
that's the whole idea behind choosing
keywords you want that keyword that
really is going to define the content
and then support that with those
secondary keywords so remember when
you're performing your keyword research
choose keywords for your videos that
Google shows on the video results page
so what I mean by that is your video can
get more views if you rank on Google as
well so the whole idea is not
necessarily to be found on YouTube
YouTube it's also to be found on Google
so if I go back to Google and I just
type in data science for beginners and I
type in videos then you could see we're
ranked number one so even if you're not
looking at the videos clicking on the
videos link on Google search you can
always just when you do a search what
Google's going to do is also put in the
videos here on part as part of the
search results so what they're going to
show you is the top videos that are
ranking for that particular keyword and
so we may not rank over we're all for
data science for beginners but we're
ranked number one in the videos category
and so if somebody's looking for a video
that's important and you can see here
that these first two are ads so what
Google is doing is they're saying hey
this is so relevant this particular
video for the keyword query data science
for beginners that we're going to show
it above the organic listings even
though it's a video so the whole idea is
to be found on YouTube and Google
because you're increasing your
visibility you're increasing your
chances of getting found on both search
platforms so according to backlinko
google Ranks videos with keywords like
how to tutorials so you know a lot of
the videos that you find on YouTube are
going to be instructional based and so
what Google's doing is they're saying
hey if somebody types in how to or
tutorial or an introduction to anything
that's going to signal to Google that
it's instructional it's going to help
you rank so when you search for machine
learning tutorial or how to become a
machine learning engineer you're going
to get results related to that because
if you look at these examples we have
machine learning tutorial in our title
or how to become a machine learning
engineer so keep that in mind if you're
creating a video and it's educational in
nature you know use those key terms like
how to and tutorials in the video title
because that will help you rank so let's
move over now to video title so we want
to use our Target keyword in the title
of the video and again we want to make
sure if it's educational to include that
keyword tutorial or how to so for every
video title YouTube has a limit of 100
characters so we really have to pick and
choose really wisely so if we look at
the video that we were focusing on a
couple of minutes ago so machine
learning Basics here we could see under
100 characters we have machine learning
Basics what is machine learning
introduction to machine learning and
then the brand name so that is the title
of this particular video so it takes
into account the primary keyword the
secondary keywords and the title and it
also includes that really that key term
that really Google and YouTube like and
that's what is machine learning so it's
helping us Rank by having our key words
in the title with that key phrase what
is okay so that's a a good tidbit on
creating a good video title is to align
it with the right keywords your primary
and your secondary and so we want to use
those catchy words and numbers to gain
High clickr rates just like you would on
the title tag of your web page we want
to do the same with our video title
because the video title is what's going
to show up in search so if I go back to
you know search here we could see you
know data science tutorial data science
for beginners so we want to make sure in
this case you can see data science in 5
minutes so that was purposely done so
that hey I don't have time to watch a
video I only have a couple minutes data
science and 5 minutes okay great I'm
going to click on the video and now I
have an opportunity to watch something
and learn something under five minutes
so choosing the right words in your
video title is going to help you get
that click your rate up remember click
the rate is clicks divided by
Impressions and an impression is how
many times your video shows up in the
search results on YouTube or Google so
we want to keep our click theough rate
high and in order to do that we want to
be able to write some really good title
tags for our video so use catchy words
like a number or how to or what is cu
that's going to resonate with people
when they're searching now for the
description what we want to do is we
want to use the target word at the
beginning of the description the title
and the tags itself so if I go back to
my video here machine learning Basics we
know it's in the video title and right
off the bat if I look at the description
of the video here I can see this machine
learning Basics video will help you
understand what is machine learning so
our primary keyword is in the first
sentence right in the introductory of
the description and so that's going to
bode well for optimizing our video the
description length is 5,000 characters
so we have a lot of characters to work
with so I go back to my video I click
show more we have a lot of characters to
really describe what the video is about
okay there's no shortage no shortage of
including keywords into the content so
you have 5,000 characters go ahead and
see if you can work in naturally your
keywords but one of the key tips here is
just make sure that first sentence
starts out with that keyword that's a
good tip of course you always want to
make it sound natural as possible you
don't want to stuff it with keywords at
the same time work them in naturally
work in your keywords naturally and then
include hashtags in your description to
help the audience find your video is
easily so if I go back here you know we
want to be able to include hashtags so
hashtags it's like anything else you
would use on social media it just
signals to the end user hey this is what
the video is all about and if I go ahead
and type in that keyword then it's our
video has a better chance cuz it's
aligned with that hashtag and then
there's Target keywords and LSI keywords
latent semantic indexing keywords we
want to be able to use those keywords as
Target keywords with our video so if you
recall the example I gave a few minutes
ago we used the Facebook ads tutorial as
our example here I can see all the
target keywords associated with that
particular video so don't be afraid to
use those LSI related keywords meaning
keywords that are related to the content
use them as Target keywords with the
video so between your LSI keywords
Target keywords and then using our
primary and secondary keyword in the
title tag using our primarying secondary
keyword in the description and then
using hashtags in the description the
combination of all of that if we chose
the right keyword then we should find
that our video will eventually rank on
YouTube so just doing these small
tidbits with our key words really help
get our video to rank so at the end of
the day we want to be able to use the
tools available to Us YouTube Itself by
looking at our competitors those
extensions like vid IQ the auto complete
to really find our good keywords and
then incorporating those keywords into
you know the title tag the description
as Target keywords hashtags we should
really be off running with our video on

also show you in a demo where to find
all the tools that you can use within
YouTube and within some of those tools
to optimize your videos for
SEO so let's start with explaining what
is YouTube SEO as mentioned earlier
YouTube is the second most popular
search search engine right after Google
in fact YouTube searches are actually
more in numbers than Microsoft Bing AOL
and ask.com combined so we're talking
about a very important part of your
search strategy YouTube as I mentioned
earlier has about 2.6 billion active
monthly users as of 2022 making it the
second biggest social media Network only
um preceded by uh by Facebook yeah so
now SE 62% of global consumers say they
use YouTube and since the creation of
YouTube its Mission has been to provide
fast and easy video access to users and
the ability to share videos frequently
and since then it has grown Beyond
expectations now with so many people
uploading videos on the one hand and
watching videos on the other hand how
you do you make sure that your video
features in the top of the YouTube
search results and that's where YouTube
SEO plays a vital
role so before I explain YouTube seo let
me give you a little bit of a history
about YouTube late 2004 an idea for a
website for users to upload video dating
profiles was born and in February 205
the website launched to a small subset
of users as I said earlier as a video
dating platform now based on feedback
from their subscribers in April 25 or
April 2005 YouTube turned into a free
video hosting platform where each clip
had a unique link in April 2005 the
first video ever was uploaded on the
website by one of the uh the Youtube
Founders and in May 2005 YouTube
launches its beta version to the public
for the first time and it became a
massive hit in a year later October 2006
Google acquired YouTube for the not too
small amount of 1.6 billion
US in 20 7 YouTube allowed YouTube
creators people who upload videos to
earn money from their content based on
ad Revenue yeah turning their hobby into
a career and that of course gave a
tremendous push of people getting into
YouTube creating content for YouTube
where they could link it to advertising
where they could make a substantial
income now in November 2008 YouTube
expans it ad offering to sponsored
videos and free pre-roll ads and in 2009
they launched a new music video service
called fivo in collaboration with Fendi
so it moved on in 2010 one of the most
famous YouTubers Felix kelberg joins
YouTube to create content under the
Channel's name
PDP and that is now one of the biggest
channels that you can find on YouTube in
April 2011 YouTube entered the broadcast
business launching YouTube live and in
August 2012 2012 it became the goto
place for presidential elections by
launching the YouTube elections Hub it
grew exponentially and by 2013 re
YouTube had reached over a billion
monthly
users some other interesting facts in
January 2016 the music video for Adele's
hello was the fastest video on YouTube
ever to hit 1 billion views and a very
strategic move for YouTube was in
November 2018 when they rolled out a
stories like feature YouTube shorts yep
where they would sort of relate to
Snapchat and Instagram stories where
videos are automatically deleted after a
day in November 2019 YouTube announced
that the service would phase out the
classic version of YouTube Studio yeah
and to all YouTube creators by Spring
20120 and I'll show you later what the
latest version of YouTube studio is all
about in July 2021 YouTube did a massive
cleanup of all unlisted videos prior to
2017 were set to be private making them
unplayable and in 2022 YouTube becomes
the second biggest social media Network
after Facebook so a whirlwind of a
development of a growth of an adoption
in the market it's being played and
being used all over the world and it is
the channel of choice for the younger
generation to watch TV and to watch
video so a spectacular development for a
fantastic channel so what is YouTube SEO
now YouTube SEO is a set of activities
that you need to do to enhance the
search rankings of your YouTube videos
and or your YouTube channel in other in
other words when a user does a query on
the YouTube search bar yeah which is
related to your videos what do you do
what do you need to do to make sure that
your video features higher in the
YouTube search rankings or in the
recommended videos based on that search
now many businesses of today they see
the power of search for YouTube yeah
showing up and the importance of showing
up higher in the search results it helps
them to reach more people because more
people will click on the uh the video
links it helps them in building and
promoting their brand it helps them in
creating customer engagements more
people will like the videos more people
will engage with the videos and it is a
great opportunity for brands to Showcase
their expertise so it is a no-brainer
for businesses to be on YouTube these
days and to put all the effort in place
to show up high in the search
rankings so as you know the engine of a
search engine is what we call the
algorithm so before we dive a bit deeper
in the YouTube SEO let's have a look at
this YouTube algorithm YouTube says in
their own documentation that the
algorithm is a feedback loop in real
time that recommends videos to
individual viewers according to their
different
interests now quality of the user
experience
wasn't that important at the initial
start of YouTube for the first seven
years YouTube rewarded videos that got
the highest number of clicks or views
yes so all based on number of clicks and
number of views but soon content
creators started to abuse the algorithm
approach and tricked people into getting
more views because of clickbait video
titles or catchy thumbnails so Google
had to do something about this and to
tackle this misuse of clicks and Views
and improve the user
experience they announced an update to
the algorithm in 20 12 they prioritized
considering videos that had higher
attention time a higher watch time a
longer watch time but still YouTube
wasn't able to provide what an
individual user was looking for so in
2016 they announced another update to
their algorithm and that's where they
announced to do to use machine learning
and deep neural networks for its
recommendation system comp completely
changing the user experience of a
YouTube user in other words YouTube is
focused on hooking users into valuable
addictive content based on their
interests yes so how does YouTube SEO
work let's dig a bit deeper into the
YouTube algorithm overall the YouTube
algorithm affects the search results and
the recommendation streams
so what do I mean with
that in response to a user's query the
YouTube's algorithm analyzes videos
across thousands and thousands of
channels to return a list of the most
relevant
videos and the YouTube search results
are highly affected by YouTube's
algorithm yeah and the factors that will
make your video pop up in a user search
are your video's comments the likes the
watch time you can call this
engagement your video's title the
description the keywords the tags we
call this the metadata that matches the
users's query yeah so a lot of reasons
yeah why the YouTube algorithm picks
your video to show up higher in the
search results now the algorithm go
through a two-fold process for
recommending videos to a
user yeah there is the search results
but the second part of this the SEO is
the recommending video to a user which
you see on the left side after your
search results first it ranks video
Based on data of their performance
analytics so for instance videos that
are trending they have a higher
priority second it matches videos based
on the user's history and the similar
content they may have watched earlier so
ultimately they would end up spending
more time on the platform going through
as many videos as possible automatically
watching as many ads as possible so now
you got an idea about the end goal of
YouTube's algorithm in 2022 and how it
works to create a better user
experience right now that you understand
the YouTube
algorithm how can you make this
algorithm work with you what I'm going
to do here I'm going to share 10 tips
with you on how to optimize your videos
for search so let's start with tip
number one tip number one is to make
sure that you conduct your keyword
research before you optimize your videos
make sure your keywords are relevant to
your
video because they allow YouTube to
determine the video topic and index the
content and relate it to the user
queries so here are five simple steps
for you to do to do your video keyword
research first start with topics that
you want to be in Authority for identify
them those topics and then for each of
these topics you generate keyword ideas
you find those keyword ideas by go going
on YouTube for the YouTube suggest um
and you can go to Google as well you go
to other video platforms you go to
keyword recommendation
tools yes so you generate keyword ideas
then for those keyword ideas you're
going to look for monthly search volumes
and the comp difficulty for those
keywords how difficult is it to get a
higher search ranking for those keywords
and there are tools that you can use to
find out about these keyword um metrics
you're then going to conduct a YouTube
Ser analysis so you're going to analyze
the search engine result page for your
keywords and find out what you can see
yeah serpent is is very important
because it helps you to determine the
types of keywords that are currently
ranking for that keyword or the type of
videos that are currently ranking for
that
video it helps you in determining the
quality of those videos and it also
helps you with determining the search
intent for those keywords why are people
searching for those words is it with a
buying intent is it with a learning
intent or is it with an informational
intent and the fifth tip on your keyword
research is to select those Target
keywords that are the most uh that have
the highest search volume have the the
the the the best competitive um
difficulty yeah so it's finding the
right balance and come up with a list of
keywords that you can start using for
your videos and then you're going to
assign those keywords to your video Yeah
and make sure that those keywords are
relevant to the content and that you
used them in the title that you used
them in the thumbnail that you used them
in the sub the the um the transcription
of the video and I'll tell you more a
bit about that in a little bit yes so it
is all about capturing the content of
the video make it unique and encouraging
viewers to watch your content so keyword
research is a very important
topic second is to make sure that you
use the right title for your videos
titles is critical there are two
elements of your video that will
decide whether people watch a video or
not it is the title of the video and it
is the thumbnail of the video and more
about a thumbnail later so get a good
catchy
title make sure your keywords are in
your title as well yeah so it's not only
about explaining the content of the
video in a very strong title but
also encouraging people to click on the
video link yeah so your keywords and
your title play a very important role in
this right let's look at the third tip
that is the description
of your video Yeah and for the algorithm
the description is very important the
algorithm uses the description to check
the topic of the video so make sure that
your description includes the keywords
as well so the video description is the
text below each of your videos and
viewers can read the YouTube video
description by clicking on the see more
button below the video yeah so these
descript ions usually include a short
explanation of what the video is about
including the relevant keywords links to
any resources mentioned in the video
maybe affiliate links website links
maybe social media
handles definitely ask the viewer to
subscribe and chapters and timestamps
and Google now has the feature to sort
of split up the content of your video in
timestamps and people can jump from
timestamp to time
stamp so YouTube descriptions including
all the right elements like the
informative text the links the buttons
they can help the viewer to discover
your video can help you to increase your
subscribers to increase your views and
to increase your watch
time so tip four is about
tags very important to add tags to your
video YouTube uses tags to effectively
index and search for videos but also to
suggest other videos you might be
interested in they help again the
YouTube algorithm to understand what
your content is all about and to serve
it to the right
users so here are some best practice
tips on using tags don't overdo them
don't use too many
tags use trending text yeah so find
trending topics with YouTube Auto
suggest yeah so and use those trending
texts be specific with your tags for
example a road trip is a tag that is
less Broad and has a higher chance of
ranking well in search engent than for
instance the word vacation because that
is too
generic also includes synonyms think
about the words your audience is likely
to use when describing the topic of your
video and and use those synonyms to
broaden the reach of your tags and if
you're you out of ideas use a tag
generator to identify related and
potentially trending tags a really good
tool for this is tune
pocket right let's move on let's go to
the next tip tip number five YouTube
creates transcriptions and captions for
your videos and you can create your own
transcription because the algorithm
can't interpret visual content only text
and code so if you can transform your
video in text through a transcription
that can really help in your search
Effectiveness so a transcription is the
translation of what is spoken in the
video and you can use this transcription
for subtitles in your video as well they
will also help you to generate captions
for your timestamps in your video now
very important YouTube will
automatically generate a transcription
file but be aware this transcription
file will not be indexed for search the
because the raw file may have typos or
wrong translations wrong interpretations
from the Google automatic
transcriber so what you need need to do
is that you edit the transcription file
and take out the typos and the mistakes
and once you've done that you've then
uploaded that transcription file up to
your video and once you've uploaded It
Again YouTube will then index the file
and use it for the
search so very important and I'll show
you later where you can find that trans
transcription
file tip number six think about the
length of your
videos focus on both the watch time and
the video
length and let's be realistic about it
if it takes 20 minutes to explain how to
do something yeah on your video then
make a 20 minute video if you can say it
in one minute then make a one minute
video Don't Waste people's time by
stretching out a Content just to hit a
certain number of minutes it's not about
about how long your video is it is about
when people stop watching your video if
you can keep watching if you can keep
people watching longer than average then
you'll get more views and eventually you
will get more
subscribers now YouTube wants to
recommend videos that people stay
engaged with or in other words watch
longer so if you can increase your watch
time for your videos then you YouTube
will reward you with better rankings in
search results and recommendations
across their site which ultimately leads
to more viewers so a good way to keep
people
engaged is to use screens and YouTube
cards and that is tip
six yeah so an end screen is the YouTube
feature that appears in the last 5 to 20
seconds of your video and you can use
use it to promote videos playlist
merchandise and external websites your
end screen can help you to get more
views more traffic and subscribers from
every
video YouTube cards are a bit more
flexible they are interactive cards that
you see throughout a video that let you
share clickable links to relevant
content throughout your video you can
use those cards to promote a related
video playlist to promote your YouTube
channel to encourage viewers to take a
call or to take a poll to direct
responses to a verified offsite location
like a specific landing page or to ask
viewers to donate to a charity this will
only work for the US by the way so non-
us um viewers cannot do those donations
to charity
right next tip next tip is making sure
that you increase audience engagement by
increasing the watch time of your
video yes so this is all about the
content of your video and be clever with
the content in your video try to use
elements of surprise in your video or
changing the pace of the music or ask
for audio participation for for instance
by adding a quiz in your video very
important to maintain people's
interests yeah and some other tips that
you can do to keep people's interest is
to make sure you have a strong video
opening yeah where you captures people's
initial interest to make sure that you
use chapters in your videos yeah because
that will give people a guideline of
what to look out for use pattern
interrupts as we call them like music
Pace different Graphics different camera
angles or use storytelling techniques
why are people so interested in stories
because stories use techniques like good
and bad yeah or one extreme to The Other
Extreme yeah to actually keep people
engaged in the um in the story maybe
create longer videos for a more targeted
audience where you know they have a
better interest in watching your videos
maybe look at developing a series of
videos yeah because then you build up
loyalty and you build up kind of a
viewer membership for your video series
and then obviously use the YouTube
insights the YouTube analytics to learn
about how effective your um your
interrupts in your video are finally
then there is tip number
eight tip number eight is an obvious one
make sure that in every video you upload
on YouTube that you promote your channel
and promote the likes the people to like
your video yeah at the beginning and at
the end of your video just like I did on
this video and I'm doing it now if you
like this video click the like button if
you want to subscribe to our video click
the Subscribe button or subscribe to our
Channel yeah very important that you do
that now a tip that is often overlooked
is the power of the
thumbnail yeah people make a decision as
I mentioned earlier to watch your video
based on the title of your video and the
thumbnail and the more exciting your
thumbnail the more likely people will
click yeah so now YouTube will create
thumbnails for you but if you don't like
them you can also upload your
own uh your own thumbnails so you can
design those on any tool um any creative
uh tool make sure that if you upload
your own videos that they accurately
represent your
videos include a shortened version of
the title of your video yeah make sure
that the text is large enough to read
Because particularly on mobile and
remember about 60% of people watch
YouTubes on their
mobile yeah so make sure that the text
is large enough to read use contrasting
colors to capture the attention make
sure that you pay attention to White
space between the images and create add
your brand logo to your thumbnail as
well the final tip it goes out it goes
without saying tip number 10 make sure
your video keeps your viewers
attention yeah your videos have to be
unique they have to be different they
have to be
engaging the best videos are
controversial educational funny or
shocking check your analytics your
YouTube analytics to see and to analyze
your viewing behaviors learn from that
and tailor your content to what you
learn in your
analytics okay so those are the 10
YouTube SEO tips and now let me show you
where to find all this in YouTube so if
you go to
YouTube yeah I'll show you here this is
of a company um and this is their
YouTube kind of Channel yeah if I go to
the channel of the company then here you
see the channel it is a shoe store and
here you see their videos now I'm not
going to explain the channels to you but
here you see if you go at the top right
there you see this little photo here
you're going to click I'm going to
switch the account I'm going to
my solution and I'm going to here have
the dashboard I'm going to look at the
content this
one how we made 2 and a half th000
African kids happy with a pair of shoes
so here you see the metadata of this
video okay so let me show share with you
the elements that we discussed first of
all there is your video title that you
can add
here right how we made 2 and a half
th000 African kids happy with a pair of
shoes then here you have your
description
remember keywords actually what I did
here I took the script of the video and
put it here in the description yeah you
have a lot of characters available here
I always start the description with the
HT with the website because that is
another free opportunity to get a link
to your
website yes so there is your title your
description then if I scroll down
then here you see your
thumbnail I've picked a thumbnail yeah
the one that YouTube created for me I
can also upload my own
thumbnail okay I'm not going to go into
the details I'm just focusing on the
elements that we discussed so here you
see show more and this is where I can go
to the automatic
chapters yeah so those are the chapters
that YouTube will create for you
and here you see the
tags so this is where you can add all
the tags for your
video
okay and then you have the language
recording date
Etc and then finally here you have the
visibility here you have the section for
subtitles or
transcriptions and your end screen and
your cards remember what we we talked
about so let's look at these
subtitles here you see the
file that YouTube created and that we
have updated as it were took out the
pilots YouTube does this automatic you
can download it and then you can edit
it so very useful very powerful tool and
this is by the way if you need to
transcribe any text for any particular
reason yeah just upload the text as a
video on YouTube and YouTube will
transcribe it for
you yep and then when you play the
video yeah you see here how the
text this is how she belongs to 40% of
the African population yeah so extremely
powerful feature of YouTube the uh the
transcriptions so close that and then
here you see your end screen that you
can pick so you could a video and a
subscribe you can put it at the bottom
you can put it at the top you can put it
in the middle or you can relate to two
videos and here you see the end of the
video where you can place those uh end
screens okay and the same with the
cards so here you see the type of card
do you want a video card and then you
can say which video do you want to
relate it to do you want a playlist do
you want to promote another Channel or
do you want to uh add a link but you
need to be part of the YouTube Partner
program in order to add links to your
cards right so that is all there is to
uploading your metadata to your videos a
very important part to your YouTube
SEO cool let's go on and let's close

what is Drop Shipping Drop Shipping is a
retail fulfillment method where a store
doesn't keep the products it sells in
stock instead it purchases the items
from a third party supplier and has them
shipped directly to the customer the
beauty of Drop Shipping lies in the
affordability in 2024 the minimal
upfront investment you can la launch
your online business without the burden
of warehouses and inventory management
this flexibility allows you to
experiment with different products and
scale your business up or down quickly
as needed the Drop Shipping model works
like this so the customer places an
order a customer visits your online
store and places an order basically then
order is processed it means the order is
automatically or manually forward to
your supplier then there is supplier
ships the products so the supplier
packages and ships the product directly
to the customer on your behalf then
customer receives the product the
customer receives the product without
knowing it came directly from the
supplier so this was about the Drop
Shipping now let's understand why Drop
Shipping is popular in 2024 so the first
reason for it is the e-commerce boom so
the e-commerce industry has been growing
rapidly and after covid-19 pandemic
accelerated this Trend consumers get
more comfortable shopping online leading
to increased demand for online retail
Solutions Drop Shipping fits perfectly
into this e-commerce landscape by

Shipping business to reach their target
audience social media platforms search
engines and email marketing offer cost
effective ways to attract and retain
customers entrepreneurs can leverage
these tools to create highly targeted

third one is advancements in technology
so the technological advancements have
made it easier to set up and manage a
Drop Shipping business e-commerce
platforms like Shopify W Commerce and
big Commerce offer userfriendly
interfaces and Integrations with Drop
Shipping apps like oo spocket and Ali

Drop Shipping is popular in
2024 all right so as we have understood
this now let's understand how to set up
your Drop Shipping
business all right so first of all the
first step in this thing is first of all
you'll have to select a niche so first
is choosing a niche so selecting the
right Niche is critical for your Drop
Shipping success focus on finding a
niche that interest you and has market
demand use tools like Google Trends and
keyword research to identify trending
products and niches with low competition
but in high demand for example if you
are interested in Fitness you might
choose a niche like home workout
equipment using Google Trends you see
that interest in home workouts has
spiked recently further keyword research
reveals High search volumes for items
like resistance bands and yoga mats with
moderate competition this Niche has good
potential because of the ongoing health
and fitness trend that is going on right
now all right then the next one is
finding reliable suppliers yes your
suppliers are the backbone of your Drop
Shipping business platforms like
AliExpress obalo and sales who can help
you find reputable suppliers ures your
suppliers have a good track record offer
competitive prices and provide reliable
shipping options various platforms that
are very popular connect you with a vast
network of suppliers these platforms
have user reviews and rating that can
help you Gage the reliability of
suppliers for example you find supplier
on AliExpress let's say who offers a
high quality yoga mats at a competitive
price the supplier has 95% positive
feedback rating and many positive
reviews after ordering a sample and
verifying the quality you decide to use
this supplier for your home workout
equip Niche all right so this was about
finding the reliable suppliers now
coming to the next one which is setting
up an e-commerce tool so yes creating an
attractive and userfriendly e-commerce
store is essential platforms like
Shopify woocommerce and big Commerce
offers easy to use tools to set your
store focus on a clean design easy
navigation and clear product
descriptions for example you decide to
use Shopify to set your home workout
equipment store you choose a clean
minimalist theme and customize it with
your brand colors and Logo your
navigation menu includes categories like
yoga mats resist Brands dumbles and each
product page features detailed
descriptions high quality images and
customer reviews so this way you can do
that so this was about setting up a
business that is the e-commerce tool now
let's understand the role of digital
marketing in
dropshipping so digital marketing plays
a important role in it so digital
marketing is the driving force behind
the success of any Drop Shipping
business it helps you reach the global
audience build brand awareness and drive
sales in 2024 staying updated with the
latest digital marketing Trends is
crucial for staying competive so first
is on page SEO strategies so optimize
your product pages and relevant keywords
high quality images and detail
descriptions I'm sure your website is
mobile friendly and has a fast loading
speed use SEO tools like OST SEO or ahfs
who analyze and improves your on page
suo then the next thing is off page suo
build back links from reputable websites
to improve your sit's Authority engage
in guest blogging influencer
collaborations and social media sharing
to boost your offage SEO efforts the
next one is utilizing Facebook and
Instagram so Facebook and Instagram are
powerful platforms for promoting your
Drop Shipping business create engaging
Post Run Target ads and use stories to
Showcase your products use Facebook and
Instagram shopping features to make it
easier for customers to purchase
directly from your posts
all right now coming to the next one
which is so common Drop Shipping
challenges so the first challenge in
this one is finding the reliable
suppliers so not all the suppliers are
trustworthy some may have poor
communication inconsistent product
quality or unreliable shipping times
this can lead to customer
dissatisfaction and harm your business
reputation so you must be careful in
finding the reliable suppliers next is
long shipping
times so since many Drop Shipping
suppliers are based in countries like
China shipping times can be quite long
customers today expect fast delivery and
long waight times can result in negative
reviews and loss sales so we have to
make sure that the time is not that long
then there is low profit margins so the
Drop Shipping typically has lower profit
margins compared to other retail models
because you are buying products
individually rather than in bul so this
can make it challenging to compete on
price and still make a profit so you
have to make sure about it as well all
right now it's the time to talk about
the effective Solutions and best
practices so while the challenges of
Drop Shipping are significant there are
effective Solutions and best practices
that can help you navigate them so the
first one is build strong relationship
with suppliers so research thoroughly
take the time to thoroughly vet your
suppliers look for those with high
rating and positive r
don't compromise in this thing then the
next one is order
samples so test products by ordering
samples to ensure they meet your quality
standards before selling them to your
customers all right coming to the third
one that is choose high margin products
so focus on ntial and products with
higher profit margins luxury or unique
items often allow for better pricing
Flex I repeat for better pricing
flexibility all right coming to the
fourth one which is upsell and cross
sell increase your average order value
by suggesting related products during
the shopping experience this can help
you gain more profit out of
it next one is build a strong brand so
invest in creating unique brand identity
a strong brand can differentiate you
from competitors and build customers
loyalty all right so these are the
effective Solutions and the best
practices that you you can take care of
while doing this Drop Shipping business
so in Drop Shipping in 2024 the key to
ecommer success it's a powerful tool but
remember building a thriving online

repeat also it is used for the awareness
of if you're launching a product people
use ebooks to firstly show the demo of
what that product is so you can use the
ebook in many ways so in this video
Let's understand how to create ebook for
that let's move on to the browser and
understand all right so now this is our
browser now let's understand how to
create the content of ebook using chat
gbt which is our AI tool so we'll go to
chat gbt so now here we will be writing
a prompt to write the content of ebook
now it's up to you on which content you
want to write it it can be in your
domain also and it can be something in
which you have the TR you have the
passion and you are good at it for
example let's say somebody's good at the
knowledge regarding cars or regarding
bikes or regarding anything he must he
or she must have the value to provide to
the audiences that content he should
write the ebook on for example so let's
take an example like I'm writing an
ebook on how to make money online right
so what should I write so I'll start
with writing the prompt just a second
there we go
write
an ebook
for
titled how to make money
online featuring the AI
generated images for each
chapter this
ebook will contain eight
pages and six
chapters divided into six chapters
all right so let's have a look what we
have written we have written is write an
ebook for people out there type titled
how to make money online in which we are
featuring the AI generated images of
each chapter for each chapter so that it
will be easy for people to understand it
now this ebook will contain eight pages
so I've instructed Char to create eight
pages divided into six chapters each
chapter will be explained in human-like
Manner and long paragraphs it should be
long paragraphs also use AI generated
images in between the chapter for the
better explanation so let's see
what the result it gives
us all
right chapter one is freelancing and we
can see it is not able to generate the
images we'll do something about it
definitely blogging and content creation
online service and market research
selling products online affiliate
marketing online tutoring and courses so
six chapters are there all right
so Chad GPT has given us all the
chapters that we have asked Chad GPT for
now we wanted the images also like AI
generated images also so let's write a
prompt for it as we are not able to see
the
images so I'm writing where are the a
generated images that I asked for
I'm not able to see those images all
right now let's see so here CH gbt is
giving us I believe it gives us chapter
wise images all right so it is giving us
chapter wise images here is the air
generated image for chapter one
freelancing let's proceed with generated
image for the remaining chapters all
right so it is showcasing the
freelancing people are doing freelancing
and online service and market research
okay though these people are doing
online research and market research
online service and this is blogging and
content creation as we can see these all
are a generated images that we asked for
and now we can use each of these images
in between the ebooks selling products
online affiliate products and online
tutoring and courses the images what I
think the images is pretty well that I
expected now you rebook how to make
online includes a images for each
chapter all right so what we asked for
chat gbt it gave us sometimes it happens
that what you ask it doesn't give at the
first time then you then you'll have to
write the another prompt for it as we
did right now all right now the thing is
we want all these images to be inside
this one in this doc not this doc but
this what we call ebook that we have
written so let's ask Chad gbt if it can
include it in between can
include these
images in between the
chapters
above and then show it to
me let's see if it can do that otherwise
we can also do that but let's ask chgb
first all right I don't think it is able
to do that we might have to write
another prompt for it but rather than
that let's just use this also also this
only we'll
use anyways we have got the links for we
have got the photos for each chapter so
we don't need to worry about that so
without worrying about this we'll move
on to the next step which is compile all
the tables chapters and images into a
file that we want so this file can be
PDF file also can be dog file also or in
any other format so let's just
write compile
all the
tables
chapters
properly
images properly into a document
file all
right I think Chad gbt is saying I'll
convert all the images to PNG format and
then add them to the document so let's
just add another prom let's just stop it
and just copy paste this one and we'll
be adding another prompt so that we can
tell chat gbt that use this format
instead of that one that it is
suggesting we can write that convert the
images into a specified format like we
can write
convert the images into jpeg
format now let's
see all right so as we can see chj has
given the answer I have compiled the
document with converted JP f is properly
integrated you can download the ewor
using the link below so you'll click on
this file to download it and as we can
see it is getting downloaded and let's
just open this
file as we go word automatically saved
images to the normal document template
do you want to load it yes let's
see okay so this is the ebook that check
GPT has created you guys must know that
anything that we have written inside it
is not on our own CH GPT helped does in
writing all of this content and we can
see how properly it is written the color
scheme and all and this is how to make
money online so now we can also make the
changes in between the profit of writing
the document in Word is that only we can
always convert this document into PDF by
going to various sites but let's just
create first in the document file so
that you can also do editing and changes
and if you want to add something then
also you can easily do that so that's
why we have created into the document
format so as we can see freelancing then
there is the image as we can see we can
also resize it all right as you can see
we have resized it so this way you can
also edit it and whatever you like I
mean it's up to you it's it's very
subjective to people what they want to
do for their ebook so it's up to to them
if they want to add something in more
detail or they can also Showcase with
the help of an example then they can
definitely do that and after all the
editing is done then they can you know
go for the PDF format it it is very easy
to convert doc into PDF by going to
various sites so as you can see we are
resizing the images and according to me
the images are well I mean what I
expected is it is better than that and
it is also you know showcasing what we
want what we what we are explaining over
there so yeah as you can see conclusion
is also there introduction is also there
so you don't need to worry about that as
well and another thing is let's say uh I
want to change it a bit like let's say
online service and market research is
there then there is blogging and content
creation is there but I think this
blogging and content creation content is
bit like not that explainable I want it
to elaborate more then what I do is
we'll simply copy paste it or you can
use from chat gbt also we have copied it
and now we'll go to chat GPT all right
now I'll write the prompt I want
you to
explain it in more
detail so
that people can
easily understand it
now I'll copy paste I'll paste the
content that I want to
more I want CH to more explain explain
it in an elaborated way so here it is
blogging apart to sharing earning
choosing your KNE setting up your blog
creating high quality content monetize
your blog and advertising sponsored post
everything everything there are various
points there are five points that CH gbt
has WR and now what I'll do is I'll just
simply copy it let's say I've copied it
now I'll go back to the doc this is the
doc and I'm just showing the example
right I'll just paste it now let's
see all right online
surveys and this is blogging and content
creation so automatically as we can see
number of points we have written and
this is the link that it has added and
basically we got the format basically
all these things are done so we don't
need to worry about that even we want to
make any changes it is very easy to do
that as we have just saw now the next
thing that we want to focus on is the
mockup or the cover photo or the mockup
photos for that basically we want to
Market this digital product this ebook
we want to Market it so what we'll do is
we'll have to create a cover or mockup
so there are many ways to do that
and as we told you that we will be
creating this free of cost how to do all
these things in free so we'll go to
canva all right now we'll write a prompt
uh what prompt should we write we write
create a AI
generated uh poster image let's write
create an AI
generated
poster image
for ebook that I can use
as a cover for
it all right this is how to make money
online
so okay we don't want the entire cover
photo but yeah so
don't give me
the entire cover
photo just generate AI
generated
image images for mockup for
ebook no we already have this kind of a
thing over
here create few more
only create image and not the
background is creating some more images
let's wait for
those give me the inside
image for the
last photo
so basically you have to manipulate chat
to give you the exact thing that you are
asking for so for that you have to write
multiple times The Prompt sometime it
happens so it's pretty normal so don't
just get frustrated with that
I think this one is better anyways it is
not getting us what we want can you
convert this
by mistake I wrote something else
downloadable I want to write I think it
is converting it all right so to create
a mockup now what we'll do is we'll
basically go to the mockups here we can
see this is the template this is apps
inside apps we'll go to mockups as we
can see we'll click on this
now we have to select the mockup we want
to create so let's have a look at it so
there are pro also there are normal one
also it's up to you which you want to
select let's select this one and let's
get started we'll select the image that
we just downloaded it so upload it I
believe this is the
image sorry this is the image
and it is
uploaded yeah but the size of the image
is bit small right so we'll have to make
it in portrait or
something let's see if something is
there code interpretor session expired I
believe we'll have to create create
another
one so let's say we want to download
this we'll have to make sure it is in
the JP EAS
format so it is downloaded now we'll go
over here and delete this one
select
upload I believe this will fit let's see
yeah it is looking bit good than the
previous one
and let's see save mockup so this is how
you can create a mockup for your digital
product your digital ebook and then you
can easily download it so once you have
downloaded it you can put it into use
now the next thing is how you can Market
it that is the next challenge for that
you have to go to the free websites that
can that lets you to upload all the your
ebooks and sell it there are many
websites some are paid and some are free
also but before moving there let me tell
you guys the version of chat gbt that
I'm using is chat gbd4 you can also do
the same thing with Chad gbt 3.5 also
but it doesn't give you the feature of
downloading all these images or
whatsoever you want so for that you
don't have to worry all you have to go
is to go on
canva and you click on it and now here
you can see there are many things now
the first thing you'll do is you have to
get the ebook template so you'll search
for ebook and you can select the ebook
template whatsoever you want you can
select as per your choice for example
let's see this one this one is free so
you can customize this template and then
you can copy paste from chat gbt as chat
gbt 3.5 doesn't give you the feature to
download all these things so all you
have to do is just copy all these the
all the content that we uh previously
done and just paste it over here and you
can also add page or something like that
so it is very easy you can you know edit
this so it'll be easy for you and then
you can download it so you don't have to
worry if you don't have the paid version
of chat gbt you can easily do that in
with the help of canva so you don't have
to worry about that now coming to the
part where we were explaining how to
Market it how to sell it and where to
sell it basically so for that we'll go
to a site in instam Mojo So it allows
you to you know create your own digital
product and sell it free of cost so for
that we'll log in it's pretty simple and
so once we have logged in so we have to
fill up the details so basic detailed it
is very easy you can easily fill up the
details as it is showing payment
collection is not enabled on your
account so I'm showing you the demo of
it so that's why I've not done that but
it is very easy and it's free of course
so it is very easy for you guys as well
so once you have done the sign up and
all as you can see shortcuts add a
product digital file even ticket manage
store categories there are many things
not only ebooks you can Market over here
there are many things you can do right
so for that what we'll do is we'll go to
add a product digital file so our
digital product is our ebook for that we
have created a mockup that we have
downloaded it from canva this one so now
we have the this option of adding a
product so you can see I'm a coffee like
this you can do you can set the price
and you can put in the account details
so people who are interested in can
easily buy the product from you so it is
very easy and it is also sh physical
product digital file even tickets others
so as we know in digital file it is
showing ebooks digital art software or
any file that can be downloadable we'll
click on this and then you can easily
upload the file so once we have uploaded
then we can here add the image product
image that is the our mockup that we
have
curated all right so now it is done and
once you have uploaded that you can also
product video YouTube videos are only
available on the growth plan then the
title of it the description of it the
price that you want to sell it for the
fixed price and discounted price that is
optional and limit the number of
downloads per buyer so you can easily do
all these things it is very easy you
don't have to worry about that and all
these features are there then in the end
you can just Market it so using chat gbt
you can easily create money and we have
showcased this with the help of a fine
example all you have to do is to just
implement the things that I suggested
you on your own and you have to add the
account details that I can't do you have
to do it yourself on the instam Mojo
where you can freely do that it is very
easy you have to put in your account
details and that is done and for the
people who are thinking that they don't
have the paid version of chat gbt you
don't have to worry about that as I told
you using the non-paid version of chat
GT also you can do the same thing that
I've done but you can't download the
content that I did previously for that
you can just copy paste the content and
put it into the canva so canva has the
this template of ebook all you have to
do is just paste it over there and then
download it from there and I have also
shown you how to create mockups and all
so you don't have to worry all the
things are there available for you all
you have to do is just put in the work
and do what you want to do so that was a
