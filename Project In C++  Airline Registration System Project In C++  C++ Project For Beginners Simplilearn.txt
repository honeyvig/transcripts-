hey guys welcome back to another video
by simply learn
in this session we will learn how to
make an airline reservation system in c
plus plus
this project will allow a user to book a
flight to a particular country and he or
she will receive the ticket by filling
in all the important details
different concepts of c plus will be
used in making this project which will
help you in understanding the concepts
of c plus in a practical manner
so now let's go ahead
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update
so now let's go to our code editor that
is dev c plus plus
so this is our code editor and now let's
create a new file
and let's start with it
so let's add some header files
hash include
iostream
now we will add another header file that
is f stream
for file handling operations
now hash include
i o manip
so this header file is used for floating
point values
so now we'll add the
standard namespace
now we'll write the main function
now inside this main function we will
create an object of a class
our class name is management
and
the object name would be
m obj
after that return 0
now we have to create this class
so we'll write
class
management
and inside this class
we will make a constructor because we
have created the object of this class so
constructor would be called and inside
that constructor we will call the
function
so let's do that first of all we'll
write the public scope
now under this public scope we'll write
management
so this is our constructor management
and inside this constructor we will call
a function let's say the name of the
function is main menu
all right
so
now the class ends so we'll write the
semicolon in the end
now inside this function
main menu we have to create a menu that
will display on the screen
and also we have to use this function
many times inside this
program so we have to declare this
function globally so we'll write
void
mean
menu
so this is the function prototype
now after that
we can create this function
so let's write
void
mean
menu
and
now we'll declare some variables
l choice
and s choice
and
another variable let's say back
now we have to create a layout or a
structure for a menu so let's do that
slash d
airlines
you can write any name as of your choice
now we will write main menu
write slash d
now again we'll add some space
for some lines
let's add slash d
now we'll create a structure in which
we'll ask the user to press a particular
button to open a particular
functionality like press one to open the
customer details press 2 for flight
registration press 3 for ticket and
charges
so let's do that
now i'll copy paste
i'll copy this part and paste it over
here
and second one we'll write press 2
for flight registration
so we are done with the layout now we'll
take the input from the user
so let's do that
now we'll write l choice the variable
that we have declared
now for all three of them we'll make a
separate classes that is for customer
details we'll make a detailed class for
flight registration we'll make a
registration class
for ticket and charges will make a
ticket class
and to
call the functions of these classes will
have to make the object of these classes
so let's do that
so we'll write
details
d
d is the object name
registration
r r is the object name
ticket is the class name t is the object
name so we have created these objects
d r and t
now we'll use a switch statement
a switch case statement
and now we'll
write l choice
now inside the switch case first of all
we'll create a case one
now inside this case we'll
have to call a function of detail class
so let's do that but before that we'll
write see out
customers
so that it looks nice now we'll call the
function let's say the name of the
function is information
and now
we'll ask the user
to press one to go back to the main menu
like if the user wants to go back to the
main menu
after filling the details or something
like that
then
he or she can click on this one button
all right now we'll take the input
back this is the variable that we have
declared
now
if
back equals one
then
we'll call the main menu function
that is the main menu will display
and also in else block will do the same
we'll call this function only
and here we'll write
press any
key to go back to main menu
now
here we'll do the break
case one ends
now we have to create a case 2
case 2 is for flight registration so
we'll simply
display a message and call the function
we'll write
book a
flight
using this system
all right after that we'll use slash n
and handle
all right now we'll call this function r
dot flights
r is the name of the object
and flights is the name of the function
that we will create afterwards
now we'll write
break
now we'll have to create case three
now case raise for ticket collection
now all we need to do is to display a
message saying that get your ticket
all right now we'll use slash n
now we'll call the function
t is the object name bill is the name of
the function
let's
say now
will display a message saying that your
ticket is printed
you can get it
or you can collect it
now we'll write press 1 to display your
ticket
we'll take the input and
if back equals to 1
then
inside if condition
will call this function
display
is the object name displays a function
now after that we'll display a message
press 1 to go back to main menu
or press any key to go back to main menu
so we'll write
press
ending key to go
back
to main menu
all right now after that we'll take the
input of this
and if back equals to
1
then we'll write
main menu that is we call this menu
function and in else
we gone
again we will call this menu function
to display the menu
right after this
break to end the case
closing bracket and now here is the
starting bracket
all right so now we have to create a
case for
inside case 4 first of all we will
display a message saying that see out
thank you because in case 4 as we can
see
press 4 to exit so
if a user press 4 will display a message
saying that
it's a slash installation and then again
a slash t
now
thank you message will be displayed
after that endl
no
now we'll write break
and after that
there would be a default case
now in this default case a message would
be displayed like
invalid input or something like that
all right
invalid input
please try
again
right after that we'll use slash n and
l
now
to go back to main menu
so that the user can try once again so
we'll call this function main menu
now after
that break
now we have to create classes like first
of all we have to create this
detail class in which we are calling the
information function
so this is the information function and
now let's create its class that is class
detail
so let's do it
class
details
now in the public scope
you will declare some variables
and
static
string
name
and let's say gender
both of these would be string
and
now after that let's create the variable
phone number
and
gender
not gender age
we have already created gender
now age would be integer
then there is
address will write add
then there is another variable
static and
customer id
so let's see
id now
an array we have to create
let's give it hundred
now let's create this function
information
so inside this information function
first of all we'll ask the user to enter
the customer id
so
slash n
enter the customer
id
after that
now the user will enter the customer id
c
i d
as you can see
now we'll ask the user
to enter the name
then the name variable
then will ask the user to enter the edge
then there is address
after that there would be
gender
now once the user has entered all these
details then we'll display a message
saying that
your details are saved with us
so right your details
are saved
with us
[Music]
all right so we have to end the class
over here so we'll use semicolon
now we'll create another class
now we will create the registration
class but before that we have to use
some of the variables of the detailed
class in the ticket class
so for that
we'll write in
detail scope resolution operator
c
id
this is the variable that we want to use
then the name variable
write string
name
then that variable gender
so write string
all right so now we can create this
class
so let's do this right class
registration
and now inside this class first of all
we'll declare some variables under the
public scope
we'll write
we'll declare a static variable
choice
then
another variable that is choice one
let's say
then
another variable back
then
a static float variable
named charges
all right
so these are the variables now we have
to create the function flights that we
have called from the main menu function
so this is the flight function now
inside this flight function
there is a character array
named flight n
now after that
inside this array we'll put the name of
the countries as the elements so let's
start
first of all is dubai
after that there is
canada
then let's say another one is
uk
then there is
usa
after that there would be australia
then let's say europe
all right now
using a for loop
we will display each of these countries
one by one
so
we'll write int a
a less than
[Music]
six
a plus plus
now inside this for loop
we'll write
a plus one
dot flight
two
so here what we are doing is
this a plus one that is zero plus one so
dubai will be displayed then one by one
canada uk us australia all of these will
get displayed and now after that we'll
write
flight n
and l
now
all these countries will be displayed to
the user
so now the user have to select a country
so first of all we'll write
welcome
to the
airlines
then
and
after that
will ask the user to press the number of
the country of which you want to book
the flight
so we'll write
press the number
so we'll take the input from the user
see in choice
now after that
we'll use switch statements we'll write
switch
inside we'll write
choice
and now i will make some cases
case one will be of dubai ks2 will be of
canada then uk us australia and then
europe
so let's start with dubai
so we'll display a message
we'll write welcome to dubai myricks
all right now slashing
now again we'll display a message saying
that
your comfort
is our priority
enjoy the journey
now
we'll display following are the flights
following
our
the flights
all right so
now
we'll display first flight so right
this is the name of the flight and now
and l and now we have to display also
that the timing and the date of the
flight and how many hours will it take
and the price
so let's do that
so here we'll write
slash
d
then we'll write
the date
after that the timing
there is 10 hours flight
group is 14 000 let's say
similarly
let's copy and paste
let's say there are three flights
that are going to
dubai and
let's change the model numbers
658
and the time
and the date also
all right
so these are the flights now we will
ask the user to select the flight
all right
select the flight you want to book
[Music]
see in choice one
now if
the user chooses one
then we have to create the condition
you can use the switch case or you can
do if else as well
so let's start if choice one
equals equals one
that is if the user or the customer
chooses the first flight flight then
charges
will assign
the
flight charges
like 14 000
and
display a message
saying that you have successfully booked
the flight
[Music]
you can go back to menu and take the
ticket
will display this message
so this is our if statement
now we have to create else if statement
as well
for the condition we'll write if choice
one
equals equals two
then what we'll do is
let's just copy and paste to save time
you can copy this part and paste it over
here
charges as we know the charges of this
flight is ten thousand
it will write ten thousand
and its number was
658
all right similarly
for the third flight as well we'll do
the same
the charges was 9000
so let's do that
the number was 498
we have to change this one
let's say 508
so that the flight numbers are unique
now in else block
we'll write
invalid input shifting to the previous
menu
so we'll simply display that
and then we will call the flights
function
after that
if the user wants to go back to the main
menu so we'll display a message for that
press any key to go back to the main
menu
[Music]
if the user chooses one that is if back
equals equals one
then the main menu function would be
called
and same otherwise
similarly we'll create case 2
so let's do that
in case two we'll just copy and paste
this one to save some time
all right the changes we have to do is
welcome to canadian
airlines
and now your comfort is our priority
it's all right following other flights
so
the motor number and number of flights
we have to change
let's say
and the timings like
and the dates and time
it's
2 pm
you can change that as per your choice
you can do whatsoever you want
20 hours
then select the flight you want to book
then similarly in the first flight was
of 24 000
ca198
and if you choose 2 then there would be
29 000.
forty thousand
the rest is all good shifting to the
previous menu as we have done previously
and now again
after this else
we can create
case three
so inside this case three we'll write
welcome to
uk airways so right
so now let's say to uk there are only
two flights
let's say there are only one flight
to uk
all right
uk
and its flight number is 798 let's say
and the timings are
and date is first of all 12
and the timing is 10 am
and it will take around 14 hours
14 hours
and 44 000
rupees
select the flight you want to book
this is same and here i have to change
44 000
all right so to uk there is only one
flight so we not need to create this
health if statements
so we can just cut it
and in else block the rest is same
so now after that
we have to create case three
sorry case four
and we can copy and paste this one as
well
so our fourth flight
was of
us that is u.s airbase
all right now we will change the name
right
us567
and
the dates
it's a choice
assign it 39 000 here and
there is 42 000
after this
now case 5 would be of australian
airlines so we'll write case
5.
and copy paste this part
and here we'll write
australian
airlines
so let's change we'll write
yes
and
698
timing date would be
18
9
44 000.
[Music]
so all right else everything is done in
this part
now we'll create k6
in case 6
all we need to change is
welcome to dubai my rates
and
we'll change it to european airlines
european airlines then we'll change its
name to
eu
498 instead of 198.98
and the date let's say two
time is 2 a.m
18 hours of flight and its price is 36
000.
thirty one thousand
10 am and
all right now we have to change its
model number as well
all right so eu
898
and its price is 36 000.
its price is thirty seven thousand
all right rest everything is done in
this part
now let's create the default case
all right
in the default case we will write
invalid input
please
no shifting to the main menu
and then we will call this main menu
function
now we'll write
break
and close the switch statements
all right so uh this registration
function is done
it's pretty long as we have created six
cases
of all the countries named
dubai canada uk us australia europe
now only one function is
for class is left that is ticket class
so let's create this ticket class
all right so now after this registration
class we'll have to use the semicolon
so
now before this ticket class
we need to know that we have to use some
variables of registration class
and the details class in this ticket
class so we will do the multiple
inheritance and before that
let's do the same thing as we did
earlier
float registration because we have to
use these variables
so we'll write
the class name then scope resolution
operator
charges
is the variable then another variable
would be
choice
both of these variables is of
registration class so that is why we are
doing this
all right now we will start with the
class ticket
we'll right class
ticket
then we have to inherit both of these
classes that is we have to use multiple
inheritance
right public
registration
and then details
so here we are using the multiple
inheritance because we have to use the
variables of both of these classes in
this class ticket
now in the public
scope we'll start with the function that
is bill
void bill
and now inside this function first of
all we'll
declare a variable name destination
and we left it like this because
we have to assign
it
a choice that is being made by the
person who wants to travel to the
country
so now off stream as we know
is used to create or write information
in the files
the object of is off stream is out f
we have created now
let's say the file is records.txt you
can name it as per your choice
in which the data
of the flights is being stored
now we will write inside this
records.txt file
so as we know
to write inside the file the object name
and
then
whatsoever we want to
show inside the file
xyz airlines
uh
details that is class name
scope resolution operator
c id
then
nl
similarly we'll do that for name and
gender as well
um
now
when it comes to destination as we have
left the empty space
now the user if the user will press
1 then it will go to dubai if if 2 then
canada 3 then uk 4 then usa so we will
have to do that as well
so we'll write if
registration as the class was
registration
scope resolution operator
choice equals equals one
then destination variable
equals
dubai
and
let's copy this part because we have to
use else if statements as well you can
just copy and paste all we need to do is
else if
now we can change it to choice 2
and name to canada
foreign
now after that
we'll simply print
or write the destination
so first of all we'll write destination
and then we'll print the
variable
let's do slash d to add some horizontal
space
now
destination variable
all right now
we'll write the flight cost
because it is a variable of registration
class
all right now
we have to close this
object or file out f dot
close
we have closed the file
now
we have to display the receipt as well
so for that we have to create another
function within this class only we'll
create void
disk build that is display bin
so inside this function
we will create an if stream class and
it's variable let's say would be ifs we
all know it if stream class is used to
read from the file
so we are actually reading here so
we'll write records.txt file
now we'll use the if condition
inside this
so we'll write if
not ifs that if it doesn't exist
then it should show an error that is
let's say
file error
now if the file is there then we'll use
while loop
and we'll check not ifs dot end of file
that is here we are checking the file
till the end that is every content of
the file will check
and ifs
dot
get line
array
100
here we have used get line to read the
content from the file and while loop
will help us in doing that after that
we'll
print
array and then handle
all right after that we have to close
this file as well
so we'll do that ifs dot close
now we have to close the class as well
semicolon
so yeah our code is pretty much done
after this
there was main menu and
the main function so now let's try to
run this one
before that let's save it
and let's name it
as
flight
dot cpp
all right now let's try to run this
there are a few errors
all right so
first error
is this one and
let's check them all
flight dot cpp
66 line 66 there's an error
all right
function name is wrong flight we missed
the t
then
line 466.
in line 466
[Music]
where it is out f
we forgot to write f we missed the f and
then
5 26
this one is associated with the previous
one error that is information error
let's go to 561
t dot display
all right so we wrote the wrong name it
was dis bill
all right now let's try to run this
again
semicolon we forgot now
as you can see xyz airlines main menu
press one to add the customer details
there's a little bit formatting error
you can figure it out yourself
press one to add customer details press
two for flight registration three for
ticket and charges and photo exit so
let's say a new customer i am so i'll
press one and i'll write customer id
one
now in the name of the customer let's
say raj
age of the customer is 23
and address is
all right
now gender is mail
now your details are saved with us
all right now press any key to go back
to the main menu we can press any key
two three one
then this is the main menu again
now i want to register a flight i'll
press two
so these are the flights fly to the by
canada uk usa we forgot to add some
space we must add some space over here
so these are the flights to dubai canada
uk us australia europe and welcome to
airlines they are asking
us to press the number of the country of
which you want to book the flight let's
say i want to go to usa
so
four
so these are the flights us567 u.s 658
us 508
and these are the timings and these are
the dates let's say i want to go to
658 us658 then i'll press 2.
so there's a mistake by us we forgot to
change the name of this flight we'll
change this later and now let's go back
to the main menu
now let's say
we know that we have booked this u.s 658
but there was some
writing error we by mistake forgot to
write us 658 over here instead we write
dub
now as we know that we have this flight
that is booked so we want to go for
ticket and charges so we'll click on
three
your ticket ticket is printed you can
collect it
all right plus one
to display your ticket
as you can see customer id1 customer
name raj mail description destination
usa flight course 39 000
as we know this is a 39 000 flight
so this is
how
you can build this
project
and now let's correct our mistake
let's go to
australia
us flight sorry so here it is
let's change it to
us
and now let's save it
so now it will work fine
so this was a project on airline
reservation system
you can also try this project on your
own
all right guys with that we have come to
