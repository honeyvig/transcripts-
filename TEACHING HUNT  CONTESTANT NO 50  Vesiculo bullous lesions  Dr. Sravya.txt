hi everyone i'm dr shavya today
i'm here to give an overview on the
vesicular bullas lesions
the speciality of this topic is probably
it has given nightmares
for all of us during the undergraduation
and for me
even during the post graduation time
main objective of this lecture is to
simplify this complexity
and make it easier to remember please to
watch the video till the end
to get a clear view about this topic
lecture goes under the following
headings introduction
it is important to know the basic
concepts to understand
the difference between the healthy and
diseased
so i start with basics that is
epithelium and its junctions
basic terminologies that come across the
discussion
followed by the classification of the
vesiculobullus lesions
since the topic is very vast and because
of the time constraint
i can't cover all the lesions in detail
so
i have chosen pemphigus and the
pemphigoid lesions
how to approach the diagnosis the
approach to mcq questions and finally
the conclusion
moving on to the topic the term
dermatology means the study of skin
diseases
this branch deals with the lesions that
primarily affect the skin
and also the systemic diseases showing
the cutaneous
manifestations being a dentist why are
we concerned about these skin diseases
because along with the involvement of
the skin
they also involve the mucous membrane
that is oral cavity
and the lesions occur much prior in the
oral cavity before the involvement of
skin
and sometimes the oral lesions are more
prominent
and helps in easy diagnosis so the
dentist
should be in a better position to
diagnose this conditions
much early before the involvement of the
skin
dermatosis is the general term used for
skin lesions
these dermatosis are categorized into
four groups
a group of lesions which has hereditary
or genetic onset
are grouped under genodomatosis and a
few genodermatosis has alterations in
the keratinization process
so they are grouped under geno keratosis
and then we have vesiculobullus lesions
and erosive or
ulcerative lesions so today we are
discussing about the
vesiculobullus lesions
a group of lesions characterized by
formation of vesicle
and bulla clinically are grouped under
these vesiculobullus lesions
so these lesions develop with cycles and
the bulla which often rupture and result
in formation of the erosions and
ulcers so these lesions involve both the
skin
and also the mucous membrane like oral
mucosa genital
mucosa etc and most of these vesicular
bullets lesions are immune mediated
and pathologic mechanism of these
involve
the auto antibodies binding to the
adhesive cell junctions
in order to understand these concepts
better i'll throw
some light on the layers of epithelium
and
the cell junctions the mois mucous
membrane lining the oral cavity is known
as oral mucous membrane
or oral mucosa and it has two major
components that is epithelium underlying
connective tissue stroma or lamina
propria
and interface between them is the
basement membrane
the type of epithelium in the oral
cavity is the stratified squamous
epithelium
and it has two major characteristics
that is the cells are tightly attached
to each other
and they are arranged in different uh
distinct layers or strata so this occurs
due to the proliferation and
differentiation of the cells
for example this is the basal cell and
this undergoes mitosis and produces two
daughter cells
among them the one cell retains the
mother
characteristics and retain the stemness
the other cell becomes the transient
amplification cell which undergoes
further
maturation and proliferation as it
proceeds further
the oral cavity is formed by three types
of mucosa among them
the masticatory mucosa and lining mucosa
so the masticator mucosa
is the one which is formed by the
keratinized epithelium
and the lining mucosa is formed by
non-keratinized epithelium
so the stratification differs in both
keratinized and non-keratinized
in keratinized we have stratum basil
stratum spinoza stratum granulosum and
stratum corneum
whereas in non-keratinized we have
stratum basale spinosum
stratum intermedium and stratum
superficial parabasal or supra basal
layer of cells is nothing but
above the base above the basal layer
the first two layers or the deepest
deeper most two layers of the stratum
spinosum forms the parabasal or supra
basal cells
which can undergo proliferation like the
basal layer
like how human body has skeleton for its
support
the same way each cell has its own
cytoskeleton
which helps in the formation of
structural framework it facilitates the
intracellular transport
it helps in formation of cell junctions
and even
helps in motility of the cell based on
the size
the components of the cytoskeleton are
categorized
as microfilaments intermediate filaments
and finally microtubules so
microfilaments are
actin filaments and intermediate
filaments are cytokines
so both of them play an important role
in the formation of the cell junctions
so here comes the intercellular
junctions one of the most
important topic in oral pathology and
frequently asked questions in the exam
so junctional complexes are the
structures which help
in holding the cells together and these
specialized structures are of three
types
so one is dark loading or tight
junctions adjust
junctions and the communicating
junctions so
if we see in this image coming from
apache
to the basal region so this direction
so the first common uh region is your
diet junction
followed by your adhesive cell to cell
junctions
and then you have your gap or
communicating junction
and finally the basal most area we have
hemi desmosome
which is also an adhesive junction
between the cell and underlying
connective tissue stroma
okay so coming to this tight junction or
zona zonula occludance as the name
suggests
this helps in attaching the cells
tightly forming
an impermeable layer and prevent the
leakage of
the materials through them so this is
zonular occludants zonula means it
covers
an entire circumference of the cell so
if we view in three dimensional so this
is how
the tight junction appears and then we
have the zonular adherence
so this zonular adherence zonula means
entire cell as i said
so this is present below the tight
junction and uh
the below this zonjula address we have
the desmosomes or
macular adherence so macular header and
macula means
it is a localized one so this is not
this does not cover entire cells so the
junction is present only in this
location
and then coming to your gap junction so
this
gap junction helps in the movement of
the ions and signaling molecules between
the
junction between the cells so this is
nothing but the communicating junction
and the last and important most is your
hemidesmosome
which is an adhesive junction which
connects the cell and underlying
connective tissue stroma
okay so we have here uh desmosome and
hemidesmosum understanding of these two
is very important to know the formation
of
vesicular bullets lesions in a better
way
and then these intercellular junctions
are formed by
three major components so that is your
transmembrane adhesive proteins
the cytoplasmic adapter proteins and
your cytoskeletal filaments
so imagine this is your cell and
this is your cell membrane so in the
same way we have an adjacent cell
and adjacent cell membrane so as the
name suggests transmembrane adhesive
proteins
so these are the proteins which are
present across the
cell so this is your transmembrane
protein
so one some part of it is present inside
the cell membrane
and the other part in your intercellular
space so this is your intercellular
space
in order to form a junction we need the
adjacent
transmembrane adhesive protein so the
outer portion of
the transmembrane that is a protein
joins
the opposite transmembrane adhesive
protein and results in formation of a
junction
so in order to stabilize this we need
the support from
internal aspect of the cell that is your
cytoskeletal
filaments so this in order to join these
we have the cytoplasmic adapter proteins
so these cytoplasmic adapter proteins
helps
so this is your cytoplasmic adaptive
proteins
so this cytoplasmic adapter protein
helps in joining your trans membrane
proteins with your internal cytoskeletal
filaments so thus we have
our transmembrane proteins we have our
cytoplasmic adapter proteins
and the cytoskeletal filaments combine
together
and result in formation of an
intercellular
junction moving on to the desmosomal
components
like every intercellular junction even
this
has this three major components so this
is your
cell showing the desmosome so this
dysposium on a higher power appears like
this
so this is your intercellular space and
these are your transmembrane proteins so
the transmembrane proteins of your desmo
of your uh desmosome are desmoglean
and your dysmore colon so that is your
desmoglean
and your dysmore choline very very
important and you have to remember
then you have an attachment plug
where these cytoplasmic adapter proteins
are present
so the cytoplasmic adapter proteins of
your desmosomes are
the desmo placin and then you have the
placo globulin
okay desmo pluckin and placo globulin
so these cytoskeletal adapter protein
helps in joining these
transmembrane proteins with the
cytoskeletal component that is your
cytokeratin the name keratinocyte for an
epithelium is derived
because of presence of these
cytokeratins and these cytokeratins
generally
differ in each strata for example
cytokeratin
in basal stratum basal is cytokinetin 5
and 14 which is replaced by the
cytokeratins one
and ten in your stratum spinosum okay so
here
these cytokeratins attach to the
attachment these attachment plaque in a
very peculiar manner so imagine this is
one of your cytokeratin filament which
is going inside the black and coming out
in a hair
pin bend so this helps in bearing the
shearing
forces of your cell okay
let us discuss about the hemidesmosome
now
under the light microscopy basement
membrane appears as a thin
line which separates the epithelium from
the underlying connective tissue stroma
but under electron microscopy this
basement membrane is not
just a single line but formed by many
layers
so imagine this is your electron
microscopic view of the basement
membrane
which is formed by the basal lamina plus
the reticular lamina
and basal lamina in turn formed by the
clear zone that is laminar lucida
and the denser zone that is laminar
densa
so basement membrane is equal to basal
lamina plus reticular lamina
in turn in basement membrane is equal to
laminar lucida plus laminar densa plus
reticular lamina now if coming to
hemidesmosomes
so this hemidesmosome is actually known
as half desmosome because
the integral component of the
hemidesmosome
represents like a desmosome so like
how desmosome has three components
even here they have three components
that is the
cytoskeletal filament which is nothing
but keratin and actin
the attachment plug containing
cytoplasmic adapter proteins
that is placo globulin plectin bullet
pemphigoid antigen 230
and trans membrane proteins uh that is
nothing but integrin and bullus
pemphigoid antigen
the differences are in desmosome
the cytoskeletal filament form a hairpin
bend
but in hemidesmosome the does not form
the cytoskeletal filament directly goes
and attaches to the
attachment plaque without a hairpin loop
and so this does not bear a
shearing forces and then the other
difference is
in desmosome the transmembrane protein
is attached to another transmembrane
protein and resulting in formation of
the junction
whereas in hemidesmosome this
transmembrane protein attaches with the
components of laminar ucida that is
nothing but the laminin
to have a clear view
the transmembrane proteins of desmosomes
are desmoclean
and there's no colon whereas the
transmembrane proteins in hemidesmosomes
are intriguing and
very very important to remember
because these are the components which
are repeated again
while discussing the pathophysiology of
these vesicular bullet lesions
so green means you should remember it is
a transmembrane protein of desmosome
and villus ampamphigoid antigen you
should remember it is transmembrane
protein of
hemi desmosome then
the cytoplasmic adapter proteins of
desmosomes are dysmoplakin
globulin whereas hemidesmosomes it is
placo globulin
plectin and pulus pemphigoid antigen
213.
then the components of laminar ucla is
laminin
the laminar densa is formed by collagen
4
which is coated with apparent sulphate
and the reticular lamina is formed by
collagen
3 and collagen 7.
so let me explain the same thing in the
picture
so this is your epithelium
this is your epithelium and the
underlying basement membrane
okay so this epithelium
this is your cytoskeletal filament which
is keratin filaments
and then you have the cytoplasmic
adapter proteins that is splinting
and bullish configured antigen 230 which
connects
these cytoskeletal filament with the
underlying transmembrane proteins
so then we have the transmembrane
proteins that is your integrin
and bullets pemphigoid antigen 180
so this pullus pemphigoid antigen 180
and integrin
combined with the components of the
laminal lucida that is
lamin and finally all these join
together result in formation of
an intercellular junction that is
hemidesmosome which helps in connecting
the cell with underlying connective
tissue stroma
now let us know about the common
terminologies used in this
lecture so macule it is a well
circumscribed flat
lesion which is differentiated from the
surrounding skin by its color change
so this can be of any color but commonly
it appears as reddish blackish or
brownish in color
so papule is a raised lesion which is
less than or equal to five millimeters
and plaque is also a raised lesion
but it has a flat top that means if we
see from the far this lesion generally
appears
like a flat lesion but actually it is a
raised lesion
so this can be of any size and it
generally appears either smooth
irregular
or uh or fissured so
the cycle and bula are nothing but uh
raised
fluid filled lesions so if it is less
than five millimeters this is known as
recycle
if it is greater than five millimeters
it is known as puller
sometimes the recycles coil is and
resultant formation of bulla
both recycle and bula together are known
as blisters
erosion is loss of superficial layers of
the epithelium
and clinically this appears at the
matters
and atrophy is thinning off for the
epithelium
rather loss of epithelium so even this
uh clinically appears
anything matters so ulcer is formed due
to discontinuity
or breakage in continuation of the
epithelium
and this cancer can be either
superficial or a
deeper so if we compare the erosion and
ulcer
so erosion is always loss of superficial
layers
whereas the epithelium is still
continuous whereas ulcer is complete
breakage in the continuity of the
epithelium coming to the microscopic
terminologies
the term acanthosis is used to describe
increased number of cells in the spinous
layer in other words
hypoplasia of spinous layer is known as
acanthosis
in the process of keratinization the
basal cell undergoes the sequential
differentiation and finally forms a
keratinized cell
so any abnormalities in this process
leads to
formation of a keratinized cell in any
part of the epithelium
whether it could be stratum basale or
stratum spinosum or stratum granulosum
so the process of abnormal
keratinization
of either an individual cell or group of
cells is known as
dyskeratosis while preparing the
histological sections
the tissue is subjected to many chemical
treatments
which cause the shrinkage of the
desmosomes are present around the cell
so this gives the appearance of the
spikes
projecting around the cell so because of
this appearance
so the layer of cells this layer of
cells is termed as
the prickle cell layer or the spinous
layer
so this is the normal epithelium of uh
showing this spinous cells so the cells
are very tightly attached with each
other
to because of the intercellular
junctions but
in certain pathologies there will be
disruption of these
desmosomes or intracellular junctions
resulting in loss of cohesion between
the cells
so in order to describe this laws of
cohesion we use the term
acantholysis so here in this normal
epithelium
the testosomes or intercellular
junctions are produced
very evenly but here if we observe
in between these desmosomes we can see
small gaps which has formed
so this is nothing but the intercellular
edema
so the development of intercellular
edema in between the cells is known as
pongiosis
now moving on to the actual topic of
vesicular bullets lesions
so these lesions are classified into
various groups based on
many things so first based on the onset
of symptoms these are classified as
acute diseases or chronic diseases
so acute diseases include the viral
group of
diseases which form blisters and
erythema multiforme
whereas uh chronic diseases are
generally associated
with the autoimmune diseases or
hereditary diseases
so the second classification is based on
etiology
so various factors result in formation
of these uh
vesicular bullets lesions starting from
a normal drama for example
the even heat or burn uh result in
formation of blisters so followed by
viral diseases autoimmunological
diseases and genetic or hereditary
diseases
so today we are discussing the
autoimmune diseases
which cause the formation of recycles or
bula in the oral cavity and also the
cutaneous lesions
one more important classification which
is required
for understanding the vesicular fabulous
lesions better
is based on the anatomic plane of
involvement
so according to this the vesicular
bullet lesions are categorized as
intra-epithelial lesions and
sub-epithelial lesions
so these intra-epithelial lesions are
further classified according to the
level
at which the blister formation occurs so
they are categorized
into four groups one is the involvement
of basal layer
supra basal spinous and granular
so again the sub epithelial lesions are
again further classified
we have discussed that basement membrane
is formed by different
layers like laminal lucida and laminar
densa
so the lesions which affect the laminal
lucida fall into this category
and lesions which further affect the
layer
below the laminal lucida that is laminar
densa fall into this category
so i will explain this classification in
detail when we are discussing the
pemphigus
lesions
now let us know about pemphigus and
pemphigoid lesions
and i'll talk about what these
conditions are how can we distinguish
them
some of the similarities and
dissimilarities between them
so let's start pemphigus is the word
derived from a greek word named pemfix
which means blister or bubble formation
and this is coined by richmond in 1791.
so pemphigus involves a group of lesions
characterized
by chronic autoimmune blistering
disorders
involving both skin and the mucous
membrane
so these blistering disorders are
classified
by liver into the true configures
and the pemphigoid so trope and figures
are the lesions which involves the
blister formation intro epithelially
whereas pemphigoid involves the blister
formation sub epithelially
so if we see the there are four uh
variants of pemphigus that is pemphigus
vulgaris femphigus vegetans foliacious
and erythematosus
and then other variants are
paraneoplastic pain figures feminine
benign figures or highly heli coming to
the sub-epithelial blister formation or
pemphigoid lesions we have sicatural
pemphigoid and pullus pemphicoid
to have a clear idea about the
distribution of lesions
let us correlate this with the
classification of vesicular bullet
stations according to the anatomic plane
so this is the image which shows the
distribution of lesions
according to the place where the blister
formation happens whether
intra-epithelially or sub-epithelially
so these are the lesions which form
sub-epithelial brister formation
and these are the lesions which involve
the intra-epithelial
blister formation so in epithelium let
us come from the
basal most layer so in this basal most
layer
if the disruption of the basement
membrane
happens and results in formation of
blister in that area
so these are the group of lesions which
form for example
lichen planus so if we see the supra
basal
or parabasal that is above the basal
layer the
lower most part of the spinous layer
pemphigus vulgaris is involved
if we see the uppermost part of the
spinous layer generally the
frictional blisters or viral blisters
are
formed in this area and if we see the
granular cell layer that is above the
spinous layer if the blister formation
happens
we can see the involvement of pemphigus
polyesters and erythematosus
so then coming to the sub epidermal or
the sub epithelial blister formation
here again
as i told basement membrane it is
further divided into laminar lucida and
laminar denser
so if blister formation happens in the
laminar lucida area
bullish configuration category etc has
been involved
and if the blister further forms in a
deeper area
epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica etc
are involved
so just remember supra basal
involvement is spam figures bulgaris
super basal involvement is pulgaris
and the granular cell layer involvement
is pemphigus foliations and pemphigus
erythematosus
and the laminar lucida we have bullets
pamphlet and sicatural benficoid
please remember this location it is very
very important and frequently asked in
the mcq
questions
pathogenesis of these lesions involve
the
autoimmune reactions which is when the
immune system produces the auto
antibodies
which are directed against the body's
own cells exact etiology of these
lesions
is obscure but many predisposing factors
like genetic involvement diet
excess garlic intake virus like herpes
group
drugs predominantly aca inhibitors
nsaids and anti-inflammatory drugs
miscellaneous factors like pregnancy
and pesticide exposure may trigger the
onset of these
lesions the general mechanism
of blister formation involves when auto
antibodies are directed against the
antigens
they activate the proteases which act on
intercellular junctions of the
epithelial cells
and they in turn inhibit the
communication between the cells
and result in loss of cell to cell
adhesion
and then this results in production of a
split
within the epithelium and finally the
blister formation in pemphigus
lesions the t helper cells recognize
these desmosomal epitopes
and further causes the b cell activation
which produces the antibody formation
so this antibody form formed will
activate
the proteases and further the procedure
goes on like this and finally the
blister formation happens
the antibody group of igg is predominant
in
the lesions but in pemphigoid lesions
the fab region of the antibody will
bind to the antigen and destroy them
on the other hand the fc region of the
antibody
activates the complement system when c1
binds to the fc region of the antibody
and then engages the other members of
the complement from
c2 to c9 few members of the complement
like c3ac5a
act as the chemotactic factors and
attract
the mast cells which degranulates
and releases interleukin the
in tumor necrotizing factor alpha
leukotrienes
and cytokines these further attract
the inflammatory cells like neutrophils
eosinophils
macrophages and t cells so these in turn
produces the
proteases and follows the same procedure
and finally results in the
blister formation here the antibodies
are igg and even the complement system
is
included in pemphigoid lesions
the antigens involved in
the pemphigus lesions are the desmoclean
one and desmoglin iii
whereas in bemphycoate the antigens
are the hemidesmosomes where it involves
the bullish pemphigoid antigen 180
bullish configured antigen 230 and
laminin 332
coming to the clinical features of
pemphigus lesions among the four
variants of 10 figures
pemvigas vulgaris is the most common
type this occurs in 50 to 60 decades of
life
with equal gender predilection this
involves both skin
and mucous membrane like oral mucosa and
genital mucosa
in oral cavity the symptoms appear as
much as
one year prior to development of skin
lesions
the clinical features generally appear
as
the arithmetic itchy areas which develop
into flaccid bulla
that often ruptures and result in
formation of erosions or ulcers
which range from few millimeters to
several centimeters
in oral cavity the frequent sites of
involvement is
tongue gingiva buccal mucosa and palette
on skin this involves
scalp face axilla and groin
so the patient complains of severe
painful erosions
and often complaining about discomfort
while eating or
drinking coming to pemphigus vegetans
this is a variant of pemphigus vulgaris
which involves both skin and mucous
membrane like pemphigus vulgaris
this generally appear as two forms that
is human form
which develop as bulla and erosions
whereas the second form is resulting in
formation of pustules
so that is pass filter raised
lesions so these two types subsequently
develop into
the vegetative plaques due to the
hypertrophic granulation tissue
formation at the periphery of the
lesions
so the pemphigus vegetans appears like
this
so in the oral cavity there is a
characteristic feature of this pemphigus
vegetans is
the presence of cribriform tongue
characterized by
the chirai and sulci which is seen on
dorsum of the
tongue the other two variants of the
pemphigus lesions are pemphigus
foliatious and pemphigus erythematosus
these two are similar type of lesions
because
they involve the superficial layers of
the epithelium
leaving the underlying epithelium
uninvolved
as discussed earlier these lesions
predominantly
involve only the skin very very rarely
it affects the oral cavity but this is
like
very rare coming to pemphigus foliatious
this is
also known as the superficial pemphigus
so this generally results in formation
of
a bulla which often dries up and
results in formation of masses of flakes
or scales
so this is how the pemphigus follicious
appears
the there will be presence of the masses
or scales
which is suggestive of exfoliative
dermatitis or
eczema and then there are six subtypes
of this pemphigus foliatious which we
have
to remember they are pemphigus
arithmatosis
pemphigus endemic pemphigus foliacious
hemino globulin pemphigus foliatious
paraneoplastic pemphigus foliatious and
drug induced pemphigus folly issues
so among them there is one more
important
feature about this pemphigus foliations
which we have to remember
is the endemic type of pemphigus which
is
also known as the brazilian pemphigus or
brazilian wildfire or fogo cell vagina
so this has a familial
origin which is generally associated
with the genetic relation
or some studies suggest that this occurs
uh because of
an insect bite that is because of the
black fly
insect bite could be a risk factor for
development of
this focal cell wagon so this insect
bite
act through a molecular mimicry in
generating the autoimmune reaction which
is similar in other bemficus
lesions so then this is how this
brazilian wildfire episome
and then we have the pemphigus
erythematosus
so this is generally termed as the
localized variant of
vigorous foliations which involves the
mala region
in formation of a butterfly eruptions on
the
skin so this is the butterfly eruptions
of the skin
are seen in pemphigus erythematosus
thus concluding in temp figures
different
sites of involvement is noted clinically
among
the four variants that is then pemphigus
vulgaris
and pemphigus vegetans it involves both
the skin
and the mucous membrane but in that also
60 percent of cases only involve
mucosa and rest of the 40 cases though
it involves skin
but the lesions appear much prior in the
oral cavity
compared to the skin almost one year
prior
and coming to the pemphigus foliations
it involves
the generalized areas of the skin
whereas pemphigus
erythematosus involves the localized
areas of the skin
like the butterfly malar rash
this can be explained by the desmoclean
compensation theory
so this desmoglein has three subtypes
that is one two
and three among them one and three are
very important here
now let us just see the distribution of
these one and three
in skin desmocline one is very prominent
and present over
entire epidermis whereas desmoglin 3 is
present only in the parabasal
and the suprabasal areas it is entirely
opposite in the oral mucosa where
desmoglin 3 is more prominent in present
entire epithelium
whereas desmoclean 1 is present only in
the superficial
area so so there is one more
characteristic feature of this desmoglin
one and three that is they compensate
for
the function of each other if desmoglin
three is not functioning
desmotlin one helps in attaching the
cells together
so now let us see in the vigorous
foliations if you see we have two
questions first one is why
it involves only skin and why the
blister formation is seen superficially
so
let us answer in pemphigus uh foliations
the antigen
targeted against only dysmoglin one
and no desmoglin iii involvement is same
so the first question is why no mucosal
lesions are involved
so in mucosa this desmoglin 3 is present
only in the superficial areas
whereas desmoglin 3 is present entire
epithelium so even if one is lost 3
compensates
and though helps in attaching the cells
together so no blister formation happens
so the second question is why the
superficial areas
the blister formation happens so if we
see in the skin
the smoking one is present entire
epidermis whereas
this three is present in the para and
supra basal so when one is affected
this three which is present in the lower
areas that is para supra basal areas
will help in attaching the cells
together so the
the loss of uh the attachment is seen
only in the superficial that is the
reason why blister formation is seen in
the superficial areas
so now coming to this pemphigus vulgaris
so again we have two questions why
only mucosal lesions are present and the
second
why the lesions appear prior in oral
cavity
and very much later in the skin so
coming to this pemphigus vulgaris we
have two varieties one is mucosal
dominant
and mucocutaneous lesions if we see
mucosal uh if we see in pemphigus
vulgaris the
main antigen is that the dysmoglin not
three
very by later this desmoglin one may be
affected
so in mucosal dominant only three is
affected and one
is not affected so since
the the question here is why
no skin lesions if three is affected but
one is there in entire epidermis to
compensate
so that is the reason why no blisters
are formed in the skin
so whereas in mucosal dominant oral
mucosa
is affected and the lesion is formed in
the
paran supra basal that is blisters is
formed here the reason is
the desmoglin 1 compensates for
desmoglin 3 in the superficial areas
so loss of the cells happen only in the
deeper
okay so now why this
lesions occur much prior in the oral
cavity because desmoglin 1
is affected very much later than
desmoglin
3. so when these both are affected so no
desmoglines are present to compensate
for the function
so both the skin and the mucosa are
involved
now moving on to the other variants the
paraneoplastic pemphigus
so this paraneoplastic memphis is
generally associated with the
malignancies
so what exactly happens is when the
tumor antigens produced by these
malignancies
evoke an immune response producing auto
antibodies against
the self antigens and result in an
autoimmune reaction finally resulting in
the formation of
they involve both the mucous membrane as
well as the cutaneous involvement
so mucous membranes like oral cavity as
well as the
eyes are affected this in eyes it
results in production of
the conjunctival ulcers and in the oral
cavity the lesions are
similar to stephen johnson syndrome
and the mortality rate of this
paraneoplastic pemphigus is very high
and
almost up to 90 percent of cases show
the death rate
and the commonly associated malignancy
is non-hodgkin's lymphoma
whereas it might also be associated with
the other
malignancies which are shown in this
table
coming to the pemphigoid lesions that is
a secaterial pemphigoid and bullus
pemphigoid let us discuss
by comparing both similarities and
dissimilarities between them
so coming to the similarities both of
these uh
lesions are similar to pemphigus
clinically
but they are different
histopathologically so both of them
produce
a thick recycles or bula which stay for
at least 24 to 48 hours
in the oral cavity but whereas in pem
figures they are
flaccid bulla which immediately rupture
the reason for this is
in this pemphigoid deletions the sub
epithelial blister is formed
that means the entire epithelium is
intact so this entire epithelium will
form
a thick border so this will uh these
blisters will stay for at least 24 to 48
hours
and later rupture and result in
formation of erosions and
ulcers coming to the dissimilarities the
sicatural pemphigoid
it commonly affects the mucous membrane
compared to
the skin it affects both oral mucosa
as well as the ocular mucosa
whereas the bullish pemphigoid it
predominantly affects the skin
and very very rarely it affects the oral
cavity
so the common sides of involvement in
the oral cavity is gingiva so it has a
very peculiar presentation that is uh
there is uh we can see the presence of
arithmetic areas around
the along the gingiva the giving an
appearance of a chronic disqualmate of
gingivitis
so these adidas areas will remain for
several
days and weeks even after the lesions
actually heal so in
ocular involvement they actually cause
initial conjunctivitis
which later produces an adhesion between
the palpebral
and the bular conjunctiva which will
result in formation of
obliteration and there will be an
opacity of
corneal which frequently leads to
complete blindness
so these lesions actually heal by
formation of scar whereas in bullets
pemphigoid
the common sides of involvement is limbs
and
very rarely oral cavity and in oral
cavity they
involve gingiva buccal mucosa palate
floor of the mouth
but no scarring is actually seen
this is the tabular column showing all
the auto antigens
involved in the bullets disorders with
the clinical signs
please have a look coming to the
diagnosis it is very
important to have an early and accurate
diagnosis
and this starts as early as from case
history taking
where the questions include how did the
lesion start
where did the lesion start whether skin
or mucosa presence or absence of any
systemic involvement
followed by thorough clinical
examination for
pemphigus type of lesions look for
nicole's case sign when you
apply the lateral pressure on the normal
appearing area next to the cycle this
results in formation of either
new bulla or erosions and this occur due
to
the perivesicular edema which weakens
the normal appearing cells adjacent to
the
lesion so second we look for the
asbo-hansen sign or indirect nicole's
case sign
or bula extinction sign if you apply
pressure from upwards on to the intact
blister
the blister will increase in its size
that is blister will
we can see the extension of the blister
into the adjacent normal
area and then the zang smear
is one more very simple and rapid
technique
so this is carried by collection of uh
the content
from intact blister and preparing this
mirror
often stained with leash months or jimsa
stain where we can identify the presence
of
zang cells so these are nothing but a
round
keratinocytes with hazy or
absent nucleoli and the nuclear
cytoplasmic ratio is
increased there will be presence of a
perinuclear halo that is this pale
area around the nucleus known as
perinuclear halo
so this occurs due to condensation of
the cytoplasm
around this area
following the cytological smear the next
step is biopsy
obtaining biopsy in patient with
vesicular bodyless eruptions
several factors should be considered and
obtaining a punch biopsy if the blister
is a small
whole blister should be taken along with
three to four mm of the normal skin
it is mandatory to collect uninvolved
perillational skin
or uh the unblistered skin adjacent to
the normal blister
so either two biopsies are taken or one
biopsy is
divided into two specimens and one
should be transported in normal
formulain for histopathological
examination
and the other should be ah carried out
uh in a special medium
that is michael's medium for further
molecular testing
so biopsy should be taken which is
further
divided for histopathological findings
and the molecular examination that is
direct and indirect immunofluorescence
techniques
crystal pathological appearance of the
pemphigus vulgaris
shows the involvement or the blister
formation in the suprabasal areas
leaving the parabasal cells attached to
the underlying basement membrane
so this appears as the rows of tombstone
so we can also see the presence of the
acanthologic cells that is the loss of
cohesion in the lower most part of the
spinous layer
and these are known as the zinc cells
that is the acantholytic cells are also
known as dances
whereas in pemphigus foliations the
blister formation is seen in the
superficial areas in the
stratum granulosum that is above the
stratum spinosum below the stratum
granulosum the
involvement of the lesion can be
appreciated
moving on to the histopathological
features of the paraneoplastic
pemfigures
this has few unique features compared to
pemphigus that is presence of the
epidermal necrosis and also
this involves the cleft formation both
supra basali as well as the sub basilar
clefting
and the reason for this i'll explain in
the further slides
and then we also have the presence of
dyskeratotic features all over the
epithelium
and predominant amount of lymphocytic
infiltration could also be one more
characteristic feature of this
paraneoplastic painfigures
histopathological appearance of the
both pemphycoid lesions generally show
the presence of sub epithelial split
so here and here we can see the presence
of sub epithelial split
compared to the cycal pemphigoid pullus
pemphigoid has
more amount of inflammatory infiltrate
in the underlying connective tissue
stroma
but that is not a diagnostic feature
since we have similar histopathological
features
further advanced diagnostic technologies
like
immunofluorescence helps in coming to a
diagnosis so moving on to the
immunofluorescence
technique immunofluorescence is
a very valuable adjuvant for clinical
and histopathological diagnosis
it act as a gold standard test
it helps in identifying a particular
molecule
instead of staining the whole tissue in
the histopathological section
so identifying a particular molecule
helps in noticing whether this molecule
is present
or absent and if it is present where
exactly it is located
so this works on the photoluminescence
principle
with the help of fluorochromosome
fluorochromes contain an electron
when irradiated with light of a
particular wavelength
it att it achieves an unstable high
state
and on returning to the ground state
they emit the light of a longer
wavelength
which can be captured and identified
under the special microscope that is
fluorescent microscope or ultraviolet
light microscope
there are two types of immunofluorescent
techniques that is direct and indirect
in direct immunofluorescence it is a
single step procedure
which demonstrates a antibody which is
bound to
antigen of skin or mucosa
so this is the biopsy specimen collected
from the patient
which contains antigen we generally
introduce an antibody
with the fluorochrome already attached
to it
so once the reaction happens there will
be
release of a particular light
and this can be visible under the
fluorescent microscope or ultraviolet
microscope
coming to indirect immunofluorescence
this is a two-step procedure
where the procedure helps
in identifying the circulating auto
antibodies in the
patient's blood that is patient serum in
particular
so what exactly happens is we'll collect
the patient's blood and from which the
patient's serum antibodies are collected
from the patient's serum
and they are directed against a suitable
substrate
for example in pemphigus vulgaris the
monkeys esophagus
so the reaction happens antigen and
antibody reaction happens
so to this primary antibody of
which is collected from the patient's
blood we are
directing a secondary antibody with the
presence of fluorochrome
so when this secondary antibody goes and
binds with the primary antibody
it emits the light which can be visible
under the fluorescent
microscope coming to the findings of
immunofluorescence um
in pemphigus vulgaris we can see the
appearance of chicken wire or fishnet
pattern
because of deposition of igg antibody
across the intercellular components
of the epithelium so coming to
paraneoplastic it involves both supra
basal
and also the supra sorry sub basal
cleft formation so in epithelium we can
see the patchy distribution of
igg with or without c complement whereas
uh at the turbo epidermal junction we
can say the granular deposition of our
igg
c complement and igm antibodies so in
secateur pemphigoid
the there will be presence of a
shoreline
appearance this is due to the deposition
of
igg and c and iga along the dermo
epidermal junction
and in bullets pemphigoid we can see the
linear
band of distribution of igg across the
derma epidermal junction
so both secretory pemphigoid and bullets
perfect we can see the
appearance of the fluorescence exactly
at the derma
epidermal junction
further the findings of direct and
indirect immunofluorescence are
tabulated here
so please have a look
the salt split technique is introduced
by cameron
and the main purpose of this technique
is
uh to diagnose the immunological lesions
which has
similar clinical histological and
immunofluorescence findings for example
bullish pemphigoid and epidermolysis
bullosa acousita
or bullus pemphigoid and sicatural
benficoid
so this technique actually involves the
artificial splitting
of the skin at the level of laminar
lucida
by incubating the tissue in one molar
solution of
the sodium
chloride for 24 hours so this is again
of two types one is direct
and indirect salt split technique so
generally the
results appear as either binding of
immunoreactance to
either roof or to
the floor or in some cases involvement
of
both so what is roof and what is flow
so if we see the epithelium and if we
see
this underlying basement uh membrane and
uh
think this is the underlying connective
tissue stroma so this basement membrane
has
the lamina lucida
and then as i told our lamina tensor
so there will be a split is caused
between the components of
the epithelium that is hemidesmosome
and the laminar lucida so whatever i'm
drawing with the
red line is the split so the whatever
immunoreactants
go and bind to the desmosomal component
form the roof
so whatever components go and bind with
either the
laminar lucida or the still deeper
lamina densa forms the floor
moving on to the findings of the soil
split technique for example
the secateur pemphigoid in secretary
pemphigoid the antigens
are bullish amphigoid antigen and
epilicorin
so when auto antibodies come and bind
with doulas configured antigen 2
or type 17 collagen
the epidermal roof is stained because it
is a component of hemi desmosome
whereas the auto antibodies bind to
epiligrin which is also known as laminin
5 which is a component of laminal ucida
the blister fluoresce stained in bullets
pemphigoid the antigens
and these both are the epithelial or
epidermal components
so obviously the staining is seen in the
roof of the epithelium
i would like to conclude that it is
essential to have an accurate diagnosis
to have a good prognosis
the diagnosis of the autoimmune
vesicular puller's lesion still remains
in dilemma
even with advancement of the molecular
technology
many newer techniques like
immunoprecipitation western plot
analysis eliza have evolved
but these are very complex expensive and
more time consuming so
now immunofluorescence still remains the
gold standard in diagnosing these
vesicular bullish lesions
so i hope further research in these
areas
should provide an opportunity for the
generation of
new treatment strategies which will
prevent the disease
occurrence in susceptible individuals
before ending my lecture i would like to
solve few mcq questions
and try to apply these concepts in
solving these questions so the first
question
please don't get scared by seeing such a
big questions actually the answer lies
in the question itself
we can if we read properly we can even
answer the question
without reading the options but don't do
that
here we'll see the question first so a
45 years old female
developed a recurrent oral lesions and
multiple flaccid bula on the trunk and
extremities
a zank smear showed acantholytic cells
and direct immunofluorescence showed
intercellular igg deposits in the
epidermis
so the most probable diagnosis is
so the i'll tell you the points which
help
to come to our diagnosis see a female
patient
four to fifth decades okay then we have
re
involvement of both oral as well as the
cutaneous lesions
and they also told flaccid bula that
means bula are rupturing very fast
that means intraepithelial lesions are
involved
because sub-epithelial the they are not
flaccid bulla
they stay for at least 24 to 48 hours
so this we have discussed previously and
then zhang smear showed acantholitic
cells
and direct immunofluorescence showed
intercellular igg deposits
this means it is an autoimmune disease
and acantholytic cells means disruption
in the intercellular desmosomes
so the answer is pemphigus vulgaris okay
so now we try to solve this in a reverse
manner by saying the options
so here we told flaccid that means
intraepithelial so let us see what are
the lesions which are given so bullets
pemphigoid it is
sub epithelial lesion stephen johnson
syndrome again
sub-epithelial blister formation so here
the doubt
arises between the herpes simplex
infection and your pemphigus
but here they told igg antibodies that
means it is an autoimmune
whereas this is a virus induced so the
answer is your pemphigus
vulgaris coming to the second question
in secaterial pemphigoid
which antigen is bound to igg
on the epidermal side of salt split
technique
okay so first when we see this first let
us think
what is secretarial pemphigoid and what
antigens are involved
so the antigens involved are bullish
pemphigoid
antigen 2 and then the
laminin okay then try to see
what is this salt split technique what
is salt split technique
the manual the splitting of
the epithelium from underlying the
connective tissue
at the hemi and the laminar used
junction okay so this is how this hap
the split is like we'll make the split
like this
so here they told bullets pemphigoid
antigen 2
that is your transmembrane protein which
is also known as collagen 17
so that will be bind to their hemi
desmosome
and the second antigen generally hit by
cicada pemphigoid is your
laminin so laminin is generally present
at the
dermal that is laminar lucida or
flour in the salt split technique so now
let us read the question again
in cicada plemphigoid which antigen is
bound to
ig bound by igg antibody
on the side of salt split technique so
in the epidermal side
what is the antigen bullus pemphigoid2
which is also known as bullus pemphigoid
antigen 180
which is also known as collagen 17.
so the options first option is
collagen 17. as i told it is also known
as bullets pemphigoid 2
or bullets amphigoid antigen 180
and epiligrin this is nothing but
laminin if they would have asked
the dermal side or floor then
this would be the correct option and the
other name for api like green is nothing
but your laminate five
and uh polish pemphigoid 192 these two
are involved in
the bullets pemphigoid lesion okay
so the answer is your collagen
17.
oral pathology is very vast subject but
also has
more weightage in your neet examination
it is not possible to memorize all the
topics in this subject
there are few topics like syndromes
where no option is left
but other topics if you understand and
apply the concept
in solving the mcqs the subject appears
like
much easier and thank you so much for
being with me till the end of the
presentation
