hey everyone i am weber kandalwal and i
welcome you all to simply learns youtube
channel
in this session we will discuss subset
sum problem we shall begin a session by
discussing the problem statement
then we will discuss the algorithmic
solution to the subset sum problem
finally we will implement the solution
to the subset sum problem in the code
editor
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon below so you
never miss an update from simply learn's
youtube channel
so without any further ado let's get
started with the problem statement
we will be given a set of non-negative
integers and a value of variable sum
and we must determine if there is a
subset of given set with a sum equal to
a given sum
now let's discuss the algorithmic
solution to the subset sum problem
first we will create a 2d array of size
arr size plus 1 multiplied by target
plus 1 for the type boolean
next the state dp i j will be true if
there is x there exists a subset of
elements from a from 0 to i
whether sum value equals to j
let's look at the pseudo code
here if the current element has a value
greater than the current sum value we
will copy the answer
for previous cases
and suppose the current sum value is
greater than the i-th element
in that case we will see if any of the
previous states have already experienced
the sum equals to j
or any previous states experience the
value j minus a a at the i value
which solves our purpose
we have now discussed problem statement
and algorithmic solution to subset some
problem
now let's implement this solution in the
code editor
we'll start with the boolean function is
subset sum
which will return true if there is a
subset of set
with the sum equal to the given sum
so
we'll
is
subset
sum
and
arr
comma
end
and
comma
and
sum
now the value of the subset subset i j
will be true if
there is a subset of set from 0 to j
minus 1 with sum equal to i
so
boy
upset
and plus one
two
sum
plus one
now if sum is equals to 0 then the
answer will be true so 4
and i equals to 0
i less than equals to n
i plus plus
subset
at i z i comma 0
is equals to true
now if sub is not 0 and set is empty
then we will answer false
so 4
and
i equals to 1
i
less than equals to sum
i plus plus
now in this case we will check at subset
0
comma 1
my
equals to false
now we will fill the subset table in
bottom up manner
so for
and
i equals to 1
i
less than equals to n
and i plus plus
we will add another for loop
and
j is equals to
1
j
less than equals to
sum
a plus plus
now if
j
is less than
arr
i
minus one
then
subset
i
comma j
will be equals to
subset
i minus 1
and j
now if
j is greater than equals to
ar
at i minus 1.
then
subset
at i comma j
will be equals to
subset
i minus 1
to j
or
subset
i
minus 1
to
j minus
a r
i minus 1.
now we will return
subset
at n comma
sum
now let's write the main block
so we will create and
set
which will be equals to
values like 3 comma 34
comma 4
comma 12
comma 5
comma 2
and so on
and we will have to
find a subset with the sum equals to
sum equals to
9
now let's find the size of this set so
int
n equals to
size of
that
divided by
size of
set at zeroth position
now if
is subserve
some with
with arguments as set
comma n
comma sum
is equals to
true
then
c out
found
a subset
with
given
some
else
see out
no
subset
with
given
some
is
found
basically if this is subset sum gives
true then we will print the found a
subset with given sum
otherwise we will print no subset with
given sum is found
now let's try to execute this
as you can see we are getting a found a
subset with given sum which means we
have found a set with the sum as 9 which
is 4 comma 5.
now let's get back to our slides
