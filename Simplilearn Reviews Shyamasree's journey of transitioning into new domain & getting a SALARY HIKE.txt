I have always believed in fighting
through every Challenge and adapting to
changes especially after the lessons
learned from covid-19 pandemic this
mindset has helped me grow both in my
work as well as in my personal
life simply learn has been a great
Learning Partner I have completed around
three courses from them taking on
additional responsibilities and
continuous learning is the only way to
grow in your career
since the pandemic till now their
courses have helped me achieve great
things in my professional Journey as a
flu years down the lane I am in a
leadership position
now hi I'm shamash halar and I am from
Kolkata I am an working it professional
I'm working with cogniz and Technology
solution as a senior
associate I have completed my masters in
master of computer
application I started my professional
Journey as a developer and from there I
transitioned into software

testing on my professional journey I
performed various roles as test manager
as business analyst as scrum Master as
well as now in project management so
once I Diversified into various roles I
also went certain certifications which
are certified scrum Master project
management professional from from PMI
and safe
agilist while raising in the ladder when
I landed up to project management role
then I thought that I must do my
learning on project management
professional from PMI so while doing
that before I start studying for PMP I
thought that as a stepping stone I must
do my scrum certification which is
certified scrum master so certified
scrum master was my first stepping stone
for pursuing my project manag mement
professional
certification so after I finished my PMP
and started implementing those rules and
regulations on my Carden projects then I
found that most of the projects and most
of the companies are nowadays shifting
to Agile
methodologies and then there I found
that in agile safe is one of the
methodology we must know and it will be
very beneficial for my day-to-day work
in my professional

Journey PMP course was also designed in
a way where they have emphasized on
agile methodologies so in a nutshell my
PMP certification when I started it was
started from scrum
[Music]
master I have heard about simply learn
from few of my ex- colleagues they have
finished their
certification so when I decided that I
will start doing my certification s or I
will start going forward with my studies
so I never thought of anybody else once
I decided with simply learn that's
it my learning experience was too good
with them so starting from my CSM I
always got good faculties who gave us
training they provided me some mockup
tests but while preparing I found that I
need some more mockups so I requested
them and without spending any time they
arranged that for me every time I called
them I I requested anything they're
always there and that is why my whole
journey was so easy with them they're so
cooperative and the guidance they
provided was immensely I'm fortunate
enough to have that and that is why I
also referred many of my friends and
colleagues to join simply learn to have
your certifications
as far as these courses are concerned I
can very well say that once you learn
these courses you can apply those
methodologies much much more efficiently
and effectively in your
projects well my hobes if I first
mention will be
reading it always makes me curious to
know new things new
technologies also my hobby includes
music
I'm learning music from my very
childhood to till
now I love traveling I love to go
anywhere whenever I'm getting time I
just pack my bag and move
out the only message I want to give that
be strong have faith in yourself be
dedicated in whatever you are doing and
be honest to yourself
