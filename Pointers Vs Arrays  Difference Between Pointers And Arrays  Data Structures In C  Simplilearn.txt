in today's video we're gonna be learning
all about Pointer versus a recency but
before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update so now
without any further delay let's get
started with the one point agenta that
is pointer versus adjacency
a pointer is a variable that holds the
address of another variable to be
executed which can be of data type int
care array Etc
a pointers are used to access the memory
location easily and it reduces the
storage space also helps to increase the
speed of a program execution
let's look at the syntax
so in asterisk symbol followed by the
name of the pointer variable where p is
a pointer variable holding address of
another variable of type integer
similarly a pointer variable can hold
the address of a variable type cat float
array Etc
so to understand in a better way let's
have a look at the memory representation
of a pointers
so basically when we declare a variable
memory is allocated and the value of a
variable is stored in that memory at
some address so in this example let's
consider the address to be 200.
similarly when a pointer variable is
declared memory space is allocated and
the values stored in that memory is the
address of a variable a
so now let's execute a program using a
pointer variable
so as you can see my screen
let's create a main function and inside
that let's
declare a variable
in a and assign a value 10. then
creating a pointer variable
and then we cannot assign EA here
so we have to give a reference of EA not
a variable e and then let's print the
value of a
so this this statement here printed
statement will print a value of e that
is 10 so let's execute it
so as you can see the value 10 is
printed successfully
and now if you want a reference of a
that means address
let's give you a reference
to know the address of a
and let's execute it
so here
is stored at the address this
and now
let's see uh print the a sorry print the
variable p
foreign
so as you can see what p is holding here
that is the address of a variable 10. so
as you can see the same address so here
this is the address where 10 is to and
this is the p p is holding the address
of a
and now let's see where p is stored at
so here
you can see but this is the variable 10
and this is the address where a is
stored at and this is what p is holding
the address of a and this is where p is
stored at at the address this
I hope it's clear
now we got some basic idea of how to use
pointers in C so moving ahead let's
understand what arrays in C is
an array is a homogeneous collection of
elements of the same data type similar
types of elements are stored and a one
name called an array name and also the
array of elements stored in a
consecutive block of memory suppose you
want to store 10 numbers in that case
you must create 10 variables separately
to hold the values instead you can use
arrays that contain more than one value
under a single RNA which becomes easy to
access the elements through the index
and also it avoids memory overflow array
syntax is data type followed by rename
and the array size
so now let's look at the memory
representation of an arrayancing
for example int as a data type A is an
array name and the size is 5. so here
array initialized to 10 20 30 40 and 50.
so as you can see the index starts from
0 to n minus 1 which is up to 4 and all
the five elements are allocated
consecutively in the memory so now let
us try to execute a simple program to
understand the array declaration
so here let's declare a variable that is
array
of 5 we are giving a size of Phi equal
to
and assign a values 10 20 30 40 and 50.
here we are giving a for Loop in order
to print the elements one by one so
let's give I also here
so for I is equal to 0
till I less than 5.
and I plus plus
print
the values
and here we are giving here I
thank you
okay so let's execute it
so as you can see the values are printed
10 20 30 40 and 50.
so here as you can see a of 0 so
initially I is equal to 0 and I up to
less than 5 so here as we know this is
index 0 1 2 3 and 4. so up to this up to
4 it will print all the values so
initially I is equal to 0 it checks
whether 0 is less than 5 if yes then it
will print the first value that is 10
then again go back to the for Loop
increment I by 1 so now I is equal to 1
so
it comes to the control comes to the
next position and checks whether one is
lesser than 5 if yes then prints the
second value and it goes up to I is less
than 5 that is 4 is less than 5 then it
will print the last value that is 50.
following let's say the basic comparison
between pointers and a recency
so first let's see the Declaration so in
pointers we have int asterisk pointer
that is the pointer variable and then in
arrays we have int as a data type A
array name and the size 5. then coming
to the working a pointer is a variable
that holds the address of another
variable to be executed and in arrays
the array is a collection of an element
having a similar data type
and storage of a pointer a pointer is
used to store the address of another
variable whereas arrays the arrays used
to store the value of a variable
so basically in pointers it only holds
the address of variable but whereas in
arrays it holds the value of a variable
and coming to the capacity of a pointer
a pointer can hold only one address of a
variable whereas arrays array can hold
or store n number of variable values
foreign
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on pointer versus rsnc I
hope this session was informative and
interesting until next time thank you
stay safe and keep learning
