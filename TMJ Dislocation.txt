hello guys this is dr. mama Patel from
Team MDS conquered in this video I'll be
talking about TMJ disorder TMJ
dislocation a dislocation of the entire
disk condyle complex beyond the
articular eminence combined with
inability to return passively into the
fossa but a subluxation and
overextension of the disk kondal complex
beyond the articular eminence but it has
ability to return passively into the
fossa the basic difference between
subluxation and dislocation is in
subluxation the condyle has the ability
to return passively into the fossa but
enjoying dislocation the condyle is
unable to return passively into the
falsi once it is out of the forceout
so basically the tissues which are
elastic like the capsules ligament and
structures which are holding the disk in
position like little difficult
anteriorly in the retro tusculum eine
posteriorly their elasticity has been
lost and the tissue has become relaxed
allowing the moment of the condyle out
of the fossa so etiology can be any
intrinsic trauma like overextension
injury during yawning vomiting wide
biting Chasseur disorders or any
extremes of trauma such as flexion
extension injury to the mandible or
while incubation or while endoscopy or
during extraction or forceful
hyperextension any connective tissue
disorders like hypermobility syndrome
earlier analyst syndrome Marfan syndrome
can also cause dislocation other causes
include internal derangement dis
synchronous muscle function control it
will intra articular obstruction or any
occlusal discrepancy some people may
have habitual dislocation as well drugs
like phenothiazine is known to induce
DNA dislocation classification of TMJ
dislocation placed on a Kim manatee
it shows the relationship of the condyle
with the articular eminence in type 1
the head of the condyle is directly
below the tip of the articular eminence
in type 2 the head of the condyle is in
front of the tip of the articular
eminence
in type three the head of the condyle is
high up in front of the base of the
articular eminence so you this location
can be unilateral by lectures clinical
features of unilateral dislocation
includes mandibles ones away from the
side of this location they will be open
bite on the contralateral side there
will be listing hollow in front of the
triggers on the ipsilateral side and the
occlusion is protocell bilateral
dislocation you have pain inability to
close mouth there will be tense
masticatory muscles difficulty with
speech excessive salivation a protruding
chin and and there open bite and distant
hello in front of the tethers
bilaterally sometimes the later pole of
the condyle produces characteristic for
true balance and here too and below the
articular eminence this is a 3d CBT City
showing the dislocation of the condi
this is the articular eminence this is
the glenoid fossa the condyle has mode
out of the four sound here in this
picture this is the glenoid fossa this
is the articular eminence the condyle
has more completely out of the force and
here to the articular eminence so
basically the elasticity of the tissue
has been lost and the tissue has become
relaxed which holds the disk in position
role of the treatment is to restrict the
mandibular translation to remove any
obstacle that's preventing the
mandibular dislocation in locking and
here to the articular eminence in this
picture this is the normal position of
the condyle in the glenoid fossa this is
the articular eminence the condyle moves
out of the fossa beyond the articular
eminence and really and gets logged here
due to the laxity of the tissue which is
holding the disc in its position in case
of acute dislocation and it was
immediate attention for the relief of
pain in anxiety to minimize damage to
the joint structure
reduction and immobilization for four
weeks will have allow the damaged
ligament capsules and this to heal
manual reduction of the join can be done
with two methods Dingman in-network
method and uranus method in this Dingman
and network method the operated stands
in front of the patient and the thumbs
are plays by literally onto the
mandibular molars and the mandible is
pushed downwards and backwards into the
foursome in this the operator stands
behind the patient and one hand is
placed on the condylar head and the
other hand goes on the lower surface of
the mandible holding the body of the
mandible pushing it downward and
backward into the fossa in the maxillary
fixation can be done with elastics or
Martin's bandage what is the purpose of
inter maxilla fixation if any damage or
injury to the elastic tissue which is
holding the articular disc in place has
been occurred immobilization causes it
to heal immobilization allows it to heal
ultrasound therapy it is an another
method by which we can promote collagen
synthesis by human fibroblasts therefore
this may help in stabilizing the joint
our intra articular injections of plus
platelet-rich plasma or biologically
active molecules or any drugs like
corticosteroids can induce fibrosis
inside the joint
chemicals capsulorrhaphy bicycles in the
year 1947 the principle was to induce
fibrosis and restrict the joint moment
he used three percent sodium dodecyl
sulfate sodium sai late immersion in oil
or sodium moderate surgical treatment
would include plication of the capsule
in ligament ligation is nothing but the
tissue has been lags so it has become
loose the loose tissue some part of
tissue we will be taking out ends so
sitting it back into the place to
increase the stiffness of the joint me
reg amin ectomy in 1951 Malaga's
proposed eminem again cause reaction in
the TMZ dislocation the here in the
specificity the articular eminence is
cut and removed so that when the condyle
moves out of the fore side it can
passively return into the for some
little pterygoid my ultimate is nothing
but
freeing of the disc with the little
kitty garden much muscle attachment
anteriorly which was given by boven this
is Daughtery zygomatic arch osteotomy
mayor's grafting technique on the
eminence which was given in the year
1933 here the zygomatic arch is
intentionally fractured and grafted to
the eminence to provide a mechanical
obstruction obstruction so that the
condyle does not move in front of the
articular eminence so this is about TMJ
distillation
I thank team MDS conquer for giving me
opportunity to speak on TMJ dislocation
thank you everyone
