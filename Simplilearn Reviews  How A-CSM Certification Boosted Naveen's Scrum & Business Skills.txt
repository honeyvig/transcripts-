only recently my organization adopted
the scrum methodology and being
certified as CSM and ACSM has given me
an upper hand of how the scrum Team
Works how the scrum methodology works
because I'm the first point of contact
for my customer where uh I take the
requirement from them and I'm
responsible for the deliveries as well
on time
hi I'm nain Yi I'm a regional operations
manager for Europe at plintron and this
is my
journey I basically grew up in trali
where I did my schooling and Engineering
my dad was employed in defense
manufacturing unit of ordinance Factory
Tali my mom was a history teacher but
she stopped working after a couple of
years because she wanted to spend more
time with family and
[Music]
kids I I'm an electrical engineer but I
joined a software company where my
experience was not strong with software
development because I was not a
developer or not nether I was an
implementation engineer but my major
strength was I can understand any
platform concept or a product in a
better manner my approach to life is
self-learning I have always been a
information seeking person even as a
child I was always looking into
information by watching scientific
videos through National Geography or
Discovery Channel this has given me
immense strength where I can give the
requirement to the engineering or the
software development team and I take the
product out from
them I started my journey with simply
learn in 20122 when my brother
introduced uh this to me I wanted to do
uh CSM and I also was exploring the
other
courses then I came across was ACSM
which was the advanced certified scrum
Master role I did not have any
background of what the CSM was about but
when I entered the class there were at
least like you know uh 20 other
students trainers would uh create this
kind of group discussions into different
groups before doing the CSM I was doing
the job but I wasn't doing in a proper
way I would say but after doing the CSM
and ACSM the technicality this is what I
have perfected now feel like I perfectly
fit uh where I am supposed to be if you
have to stay in the game we should
definitely upskill because the
Technologies are changing every now and
then and it is definitely required that
you keep yourself upskilled and
platforms like simply learn is a boon to
us and the knowledge is like widespread
you can gain out of it
