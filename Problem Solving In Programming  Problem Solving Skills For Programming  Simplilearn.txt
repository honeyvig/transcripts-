coding and programming skills hold a
significant role in implementing and
developing various technologies and
software they add more value to the
future and development these skills are
essential for every person to improve
problem solving skills so we brought you
this video on problem solving and
programming to help you learn and know
the importance of these skills in
today's world hey everyone welcome back
to yet another exciting video from
simply learn in this session we will be
discussing problem solving in
programming skills
before we begin let's have a look at the
agenda for today's session firstly we
shall begin with learning what exactly
problem solving is and after that we
will focus on learning how it impacts
your career then we will understand the
steps involved in problem solving after
that we shall understand learning steps
to improve problem solving in
programming and finally we will wind up
the session by discussing benefits of
problem solving in programming however
before we begin make sure that you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
don't forget to hit that bell icon so
you never miss an update from simply
learn
let's start with what is problem solving
in programming
computers are used to solve various
problems in day-to-day life problem
solving is an essential skill that helps
to solve problems in programming problem
solving is the process of transforming
the description of a problem into a
solution using the problem solving tools
strategies and techniques
computers act as help us to solve
problem solving and programming this
involves designing identifying and
implementing problems using specific
steps to develop a computer
now let's have a look at how problem
solving has an impact on a carrier many
companies look for candidates with
excellent problem-solving skills these
skills help people manage the work and
make candidates put more effort into the
work which results in finding solutions
for complex problems in an unexpected
situation
these skills also help to identify quick
solutions when they arise and are
identified and shown possible results
for complex problems
problem solving skills also improve
thinking and analytical skills which
make them much more successful
problem solving skills also help build
confidence in their career and work in
any kind of environment
now let's start with learning the steps
involved in problem solving in
programming before being ready to solve
a problem there are some steps and
procedures to be followed to find the
solution
now let's have a look at them
so these are basically divided into four
categories the first one is analyzing
the problem next is developing an
algorithm followed by that we have
coding and then we have testing and
debugging
let's walk through them in a deeper and
more detailed way the first one is
analyzing the problem every problem has
a perfect solution before we are ready
to solve a problem we must look over the
question and understand it by analyzing
it we can figure out the outputs and
inputs to be carried out before solving
if we are not ready with what we have to
solve then we end up with a question and
cannot find answer as expected and if
you know what you're solving then this
would help you to find a solution very
easily
the next step is developing the
algorithm before you're ready to solve a
problem it is required to decide a
solution before writing the program the
representation of the solution in
natural language is called as an
algorithm
we must design develop and decide the
final approach after several trials and
errors before actually writing the final
code on an algorithm before we write the
code
developing an algorithm captures and
refines all the aspects of the desired
solution and can solve the problems very
easily and the next step in the list is
coding
once we finalize the algorithm we must
convert the decided algorithm into code
once we are done with the algorithm we
have to code or program using a
dedicated programming language that the
computer understands to find the desired
solution
in this step a wide variety of
programming languages are used to
convert the algorithm into code
now let's have a look at the final step
in the list that is testing and
debugging
the designed and developed program
undergoes several rigorous tests based
on various real-life parameters and the
program undergoes various levels of
simulations
industries and many companies follow
some testing methods like system testing
component testing and acceptance testing
it should generate all expected outputs
to all the possible inputs
the program should also undergo bug
fixing and all possible exception
handling if it fails to show possible
results it should be checked for logical
errors
these are the four steps involved in
problem solving and programming now
let's have a look at the steps to
improve problem solving in programming
so following are the steps to improve
the problem solving and programming the
first one is the right mindset followed
by that we have making right decisions
next we have keeping ideas on track
followed by that we have
learning from the feedbacks and finally
we have asking questions let's discuss
each one of them in detail
the first one is right mindset the way
to approach problems is the key to
improving skills to find a solution the
positive mindset helps to solve problems
quickly if you think something is
impossible then it is very hard to
achieve
followed by that we have making right
decisions when we have to solve a
problem we must be clear with the
solution the perfect solution helps to
get success in a shorter period making
the right decisions in the right
situation helps people find perfect
solution quickly and efficiently
these skills also help to get more
command over the subject followed by
that we have the next step that is
keeping ideas on track ideas always help
much in improving the skills they also
help to gain more knowledge and more
command over things in problem solving
situations these ideas help much and
help to develop more skills
give opportunities for the mind and keep
on noting the ideas
next we have learning from feedbacks a
crucial part of learning is the feedback
mystics help you gain more knowledge and
have much growth when you have a
solution for a problem go for a feedback
from experienced or the professionals
who are seniors to you
the last one is asking questions
questions are incredible part of life
while searching for solutions there are
a lot of questions that arise in our
minds once you know the question
correctly then you can find answers
quickly in coding or programming we must
have a clear idea about the problem then
you can find the perfect solution for it
so these were some of the important
steps to improve problem solving skills
in programming now let's learn about
some important benefits of problem
solving and programming
so the first one is the major benefit of
problem solving is to gain more
knowledge over coding and programming
these problem solving techniques and
skills also improve the knowledge in a
person and build a promising carrier
their skills play an important role when
it comes to jobs most of the companies
are looking for people with good problem
solving skills and these play an
important role when it comes to job
opportunities
these skills also help to find the
solutions for critical and complex
problems in a perfect way and this was
all for today's session i hope now you
guys have got an idea of how important
problem solving is in these days
