hi everyone this is dr g saiti data team
mds conquer
so the next topic that i am going to
discuss is the radiographic
diagnosis okay so what exactly
do you mean by radiographic diagnosis
it's nothing but when a radiograph is
being given to you
you have to interpret the radiograph you
have to get your findings and you have
to give your diagnosis only based on the
findings that you get from your
radiograph
so that is nothing but the radiographic
findings it's not the final diagnosis
its just the diagnosis based on the
interpretation
and the findings that you get in your
radiograph okay
so anyways we have got a little idea of
the normal anatomical landmarks
in our iopa in our opj as well as little
knowledge we have gained about the
advanced imaging right so now how to
interpret the abnormality if you know
the
normal thing then only you can interpret
the abnormality okay
so the principles of radiographic
interpretation states that
the abnormalities which are present or
which are depicted
in a radiograph have to be interpreted
in a five different steps
okay so the first one being the
localize the abnormality okay so you
have to first know the position so first
step
being you have to whether see whether
the abnormality or whether something you
have find something is wrong with your
radiograph it is not normal
whether it is localized or whether it is
generalized okay whether it is single or
whether it is multiple
as well as you have to see the size of
the abnormality
and the position within the jaws is very
important the position so whether
the epicenter of the abnormality is in
relation with the tooth or it's not in
relation with the tooth so it means
whether it's odentogenic or whether it's
non-adrenogenic
or whether it is about the inferior
volatile or below the inferior alveolar
canal
okay and when if it occurs in the
maxilla then you have to see
the epicenter in relation with the
maxillary sinus as well
okay so the first and the foremost step
is you have to localize
abnormality and you have to find where
exactly it is located and you have to
know the size and you have to see
whether it is single or multiple or
whether it is involving
more than one areas like whether it's
multifocal or all that
okay so that is being the first very
first step
of interpreting the radiograph next
coming to the second step
is the asses the periphery and the shape
okay so whether the margins of the
abnormality is well defined or ill
defined
okay so if it is well defined again it
could be
radio opaque margin or a radiolucent
margin
okay if it is again radio opaque the
margin could be corticated or
sclerotic okay so the corticated margins
are usually thin
and uniform whereas clerotic margins is
nothing but they are wide
and they are not that uniform okay so
that is a major difference so
if it is thin and uniform it is
corticated and if it is wide and if it
is not that uniform then you call it as
sclerotic okay and then if it is a
radial loose and thin line
okay which like a thin black line around
a radio opacity or around an abnormality
if you find
it then it indicates most commonly it
indicates that it is a
soft tissue capsule okay so that capsule
usually is found with
odentomas or cementoblastomas and all
that you can find a
thin radiolucent line so that is nothing
but a soft tissue capsule so these are
nothing
but it comes under well defined margins
next thing is a ill-defined so
ill-defined or invasive margins commonly
seen with
severe or aggressive tumors and also it
can be seen with
malignancies okay so that is the second
step so second step
we assess the periphery and the shape
third step
we have to assess the internal structure
okay so internal structure
whether there are any septa present
where there is air present okay if it is
macular design is we have to see
it whether it's completely regulated or
not if there is haziness or if there is
some radio opacity then it indicates
that there is sinusitis
right so you have to look for conditions
like whether there is air present or
whether
this bony trabecular how are they
present whether they are any septa
present
okay the septae usually they can be if
it is a tumor
it can be as a honeycomb or soap bubble
right we will be discussing that
again in assistant tumors okay there is
a separate video based on image based
discussion on cysteine tumors you can go
ahead with that
okay and again you have to see whether
there is any tooth present within the
internal structure
or any other metal present within the
internal structure so metal will be very
much
opaque right so all that you have to see
within the internal
structure okay so that is regarding
the internal structure the third step
being the
internal structure of have you essence
right
so next thing is the
fourth step which
is the effect on the surrounding
structures so how
does it affect on the surrounding
structures the effect on the tooth the
effect on the roots of the tooth the
effect on the
internal or cavities or the
effect on the cortical plates of the
bone the effect
on the inferior canal okay so how does
it affect the adjacent structures
abnormality
even that you have to look for and the
final step is nothing but you have to
formulate your radiographic
interpretation and finally you have to
make your report
okay so the fifth step is nothing but
the formulation of your radiographic
interpretation so first step
localization
second step this is the periphery third
step internal structure fourth step
effect on the surrounding structures and
last is a
formulation of your radiographic
interpretation right
now let's discuss from the dental caries
so first
here if you see there is this radiograph
if you see there is
a proximal cavity
right so that this proximal cavity is
nothing but
the dental care so there is a proximal
caries
okay which is seen here so this if you
see there is a
already there is a filling or a
restoration there so below that you can
see
a regulation so this is nothing but the
proximal carries probably the secondary
carries
so this you have it's quite easy to
identify but what is actually confusing
is a
this condition as you can see it is
marked in with
an arrow it's nothing but a cervical
burn out
okay so cervical burnout
so it so you have to differentiate the
cervical burn out
with that of the proximal carry so
there is invagination of the proximal
root surfaces
which allow more of the x-rays to pass
through this area because of which there
will be a radiolucent appearance in the
radiograph
so that difference you need to find
whether it's a cervical burnout
or whether it is a proximal carry so
prop carries will be usually little
half azar it will not be well defined
like that but whereas cervical burnout
is usually ill
like well defined and you can easily
make it out that is cervical burnout
which is because of more of x-rays
absorption in that area because of the
invasion of the proximal root surfaces
there is more of x-rays that pass
through that area giving the
radiolucent appearance at that area okay
so that is nothing but the cervical
burnout
and at times you can even find such type
of
findings right so that is again even you
can see there is a radiolucent band here
this is
nothing but enamel hypoplasia and even
if you see here in this radiograph there
is a small
radiolucent line which mimics carries
but it is not caries
okay here this particular radiograph
it is very very important to underline
so cervical burnout and this radiograph
is very very important
why because here the shadow of the alola
bone
is fallen over the roots of the molars
which is being given
like a presentation has that showed a
radiolucency over the roots
which is nothing but match
band effect okay very important match
band effect
so it's the shadow of the alveolar roots
fall over the
roots of the molars having little
radiolucency over the molars which is
nothing but the match band effect
which again mimics carries okay so these
two
very very important the cervical burnout
which is again seen at the cervical area
and the match band effect so this is
the different aspects which actually
mimic carries but they are not carries
okay so these two do give a good glance
to the picture
and get the idea okay so that is
regarding the dental caries
next coming to the pedantal lesion which
is nothing but the aggressive pedontitis
if you see this picture
so now a radiograph is given to you how
will you
know whether it's aggressive credontitis
because
there is a bone loss or if you see there
is a defect that is seen
only at the molars right in aggressive
periodontitis usually anteriors and only
molars are involved whereas premolars
are normal
and of course the clinical case scenario
should say that the patient is young age
but if you just see the radiograph only
the molars are
involved right if you see all the four
molars are involved
which clearly says that it is aggressive
pedantitis
okay so the defect or the bone loss
is clearly depicted in the molar so that
goes in favor of aggressive
pedontitis okay so next
if this diagram if you see this is a
axial section of a cbct for the first
one
so you can see there are some extra
teeth which is nothing but supernumerary
teeth right so
these are nothing but the supernumerity
and similar presentation of the
supernumerary teeth is also seen with
the tomographic image of the
cbct okay you can see small identical
like
which is resembling the teeth right so
that is nothing but the supernumerary
teeth
okay so this is one of the commonly seen
dentin anomaly
so you can simply find it out next
coming to the
very important radiographic finding i
always
actually in your daily discussions we
have gone through this this is nothing
but
picket fence appearance which is seen
radiographically and that
is seen with the amylogenesis imperfecta
the hypoplastic type
because there is loss of enamel because
of which there will be loss of the
contact point so if you see the contact
points are not there
that is giving the picket fence
appearance and it is clearly appreciated
in the anterior mandible so if such a
radiograph is given
and you can see there is loss of contact
areas and there is very thin enamel
then you have to go for amylogenesis
imperfecta so you can
clearly see that the enamel is not at
all appreciated here so there is
no enamel because of which there is loss
of contact areas that is giving the
picket fence appearance
which goes for amelogenesis
imperfecta okay so this is again one of
the important dentin anomaly and a
radiographic finding that you need to
know
so do underline that next coming to the
abnormality here so if you this
radiograph is given to you and they'll
ask you to
identify what could it be so there is a
simple
radiolucent lesion which is surrounded
by a radopic border right
so it sees seems to be something which
is
abnormal but actually it is
a developmental salivary gland effect
okay
so it is a developmental salivary gland
effect and since it is not
about the infill alveolar canal it is
not odentogenic origin
it is below the infill alveolar canal so
as we have come across the cephany cyst
and all that right so if it is
abnormally increased in size then it
goes for an abnormality
or else it's nothing but a developmental
salivary gland defect
okay which occurs below the infill
alveolar canal and if it rapidly
increases
or if it is much bigger in size then it
will displace the
super alveolar canal oh sorry it
displays the inferior alveolar canal
superiorly
okay so if it increases like if it is a
bigger in size or if it increases in
size
then the canal will be displaced
superiorly
okay so that is regarding this
particular diagram so
you there is no much abnormality so you
have to simply go for a
developmental defect okay
now this diagram is given to you so
whether they can ask you what
is it identify it if now you see there
is something
seen with the mags within the maxillary
sinus and
whether it's ordentogenic or not okay so
if you see here
it is not orientogenic it is within the
maxillary sinus and there is
no particular corticated border which
can be appreciated so it is nothing but
a pseudocyst okay so it is a pseudocyst
which is found within
our maxillary sinus so just
what you have to see you have to
localize first the internal structure is
fine
and you can see there is no particular
like any border that is clearly
appreciated right
and also you have to see the epicenter
of the lesion so epicenter of the lesion
says that it is not odentogenic
so you have to go for a cyst or a
pseudocyst which occurs
or which is occurred here in the
maxillary
sinus okay now
now let's see this so here
if you see this radiograph there is some
abnormality that you can find right
so first we have seen the abnormality
first is you have to localize yes it is
localized and it is
in one surface of the or the posterior
it is starting from the anterior and it
is also involving the posterior
okay so it is in the mandible right so
that is number one
next what did we discuss we have to see
for the margins
so margins if you see there is some
radio opaque border which is like
scalloped
okay so the shape of this is scalloped
okay rex next we have to go for the
internal structure so internal structure
you can see some
septae with here and there multilocular
references there
right and fourth step as we discussed
is you have to see further effect on the
roots
or the effect or the adjacent structures
so effect on the edges and structures
not much of the effect is there
right so this goes in favor of
o k c okc very important findings is it
has this galloping
okay so very very important and also it
will not show any much or much of the
effect on the adjacent structures
so there will be not much resorption of
the roots okay
or there will be not much expansion of
the cortical plate especially the
bucco-lingual expansion will not be
there
only the anterolateral expansion will be
there okay so this goes in favor of okc
so if you see
the scalloped margins directly you can
go for okc it's a very important finding
for the
okc okay so it is scalloped right
so this is regarding the okc next coming
to the
one more finding now this radiograph is
given
first step localize so where is it
it is yeah it is near to the tooth but
if you
clearly observe it is with the
mandibular canal right so there is some
abnormality with the mandibular can
canal here
the first very step identifies that
it is within the canal okay so the canal
the finding is within the canal
so it is a neuroma or some abnormality
which is seen within the canal so the
question can be asked
if you see this particular picture so
because if it occurs
why it is you must have got a doubt of
why it is neuronal or why it is nervous
in origin why it is within the canal why
because if it
is cordentogenic the canal will be
displaced downwards
right if it is something developmental
salivary gland defect as we have seen
the other picture
the canal will be displaced superiorly
right here the canal is in its place
and that abnormality the radiolucency
which you have seen here
has originated from the canal right so
that
says that so the localization of the
abnormality takes its first place
why because epicenter of the lesion
itself decides
what exactly it is okay so this goes for
something abnormality which is
neural in audience so if i am an
examiner i can ask you a question
there is an abnormality with the
radiograph say its
epicenter or tell its origin so whether
it's orientogenic whether it's
salivary gland or whether it is
non-odynogenic or whether it's
nervous or neuronal origin then you have
to go for
the fourth option okay because it is or
it is seen with
associated with the mandibular canal
clear so this
is a important thing again okay
now next coming to the other abnormality
now if you see a radiograph that is
given to you
so almost the molars if you see
there is a radiolucency which is
surrounded by a half azad rate opacity
right so first localization yes
the molars almost the molars and the
premolars are involved
second again periphery periphery is
ill-defined it is not that well defined
third internal structure so if you see
it is more of
mixed type of thing right and again the
effect on the surrounding structures so
effect on the surrounding structures
if you go with the tooth you have to see
for the laminadura
you have to see for the pedantal
ligament space so if you see here there
is loss of laminar jura continuity there
is
widening of the pdl space and all that
right so
this goes in a favor of diagnosis which
is nothing but
it's a mixture of rarifying and
sclerosing ostitis okay so because it is
little haphazard it is not confined to
one tooth
so it goes in favor of mixed rarifying
and
sclerotic or sclerosis sclerosing
ostitis okay so rarifying and
sclerosing ostitis okay so this is
regarding
this particular radiograph okay
hope you are getting through this so
it's nothing it's quite simple whenever
your radiograph is given draw your four
steps
first one localizer like give your local
locality
second periphery third is internal
structure fourth is effect on the
surrounding structures if you see
why are all these four steps you can
simply arrive it to your diagnosis okay
next now if you see this particular
picture
it clearly shows this something with the
condyle so the condyle is supposed to be
like this
right but here it is like this as if
it is sharpened so first thing
localization so this is condyle second
periph shape periphery and shape this is
the periphery and shapes the shape is
not normal it appears to be
little sharpened right third internal
structure there's nothing much to know
in the internal structure
okay so here if you see with the second
step itself you can see that the shape
of the condyle is not normal
and it is like sharpened so sharpened
pencil appearance
it is clearly with rheumatoid arthritis
okay so they can
simply post a picture like this and ask
you to arrive at the diagnosis
radiographic diagnosis
then you have to go for rheumatoid
arthritis because of the sharpened
pencil appearance
you have to go for rheumatoid arthritis
okay so this is again related to tmj
which is again quite important
now next coming to the malignancies so
malignancies
is not like not that important
as per the radiograph because clinical
findings of the malignancies
play a very important role ok so
clinical findings have to be given
but besides that if you see the
radiograph also you can arrive at a
diagnosis
so for malignancies if you see there are
different types of presentation which is
given by malignancies
so the first one if you see okay this
one
they're ill-defined invasive borders so
there is
invasive borders causing bone
destruction again so this
is first second one
showing the destruction of the cortical
boundary
okay if you see there is destruction of
the
cortical boundary and also it is
invading into the soft tissue
so there are different findings which is
being given to how to identify
malignancies
so the first one ill ill-defined
invasive bodies
causing bone destruction second one
destruction of the cortical plate and
again perforating into the soft tissue
or means going into the soft tissue okay
so third one is invasion of the tumor
along the pedantal membrane space okay
causing irregular thickening of the
space
so if you see the third one it is
invasive into the pedantal ligament
space
and causing the irregular thickening of
this space
okay so it is actually that difficult it
means it's not that easy to
identify in a radiograph it is little
difficult so clinical findings are
actually important for malignancies
but yet these are the diff different
findings of malignancies in a radiograph
so i have posted all of them just for
your idea
the first one we have discussed second
one is perforation of the cortical plate
third one is the invasion or
the tumor will invade along the pedantal
membrane space causing the thickening of
the pedantal
space irregularly okay if you see the
fourth one now
there is multifocal lesions okay so
there is not only one lesion there are
multifocal lesions right
which are seen at the root a pisces okay
and also it is seen
around the developing crypt see if you
see there's a few teeth which are still
developing
right it's also seen with the developing
script and also you can see the
displacement of the developing tooth so
this is one of the
finding of the malignancies so there are
different findings or malignancies will
not have a
one particular or a peculiar picture
there it can be like
different types so all these have
discussed so first one
is like it can be simple invasive second
one it can
either like perforate the cortical plate
third one it can either
it can like invade into the pedental
ligament space and cause the irregular
thickening fourth one
it can have a multifocal appearance
displacing the
tooth okay and also
if you see now
the other so uh like this particular
picture
just i want to post you to show this one
okay so if you see here there is
complete
destruction and you can see the sun ray
appearance
so this picture it's clearly shows the
sun ray appearance
okay so the bone destruction around the
existing teeth and again it
produces a raised locus
like it produces like race okay if you
see the bone destruction
occurs and it shows this rays appearance
which is a sun ray appearance we know
this android appearance where do we see
will again show the picture regarding
that so this picture i've
posted only to say or to show the sun
ray appearance okay
and this picture if you see there is a
severe bone destruction
and the teeth appears to be floating
okay this is also one of the important
finding of a malignancy which occurs in
the jaw so there is severe bone
destruction
and the teeth appears to be floating
okay so it will be like a floating teeth
okay so all these are the different
findings of
a malignancies which can be depicted in
a radiograph so now
this is a radiograph that is given to
you now how
will you identify like whether it is a
malignancy or not
okay so the first step localize if you
see as it is occurring in the jaws
second periphery if you see it is very
very ill defined and there is a
sun ray appearance right third internal
structure it is so haphazard it is
mixed type right fourth s is
nothing but its adjacent structures its
effect on the adjacent structure so if
you see
the teeth are little displaced right and
since this is osteosarcoma there's sun
ray appearance the cortical plate
is here it appears to be normal but if
you see
the ct image there is little loss of the
cortical plate as well
okay so this goes in favor of
osteosarcoma so directly if you see this
radiograph because of the sun ray
appearance
it's pretty clear that it is
osteosarcoma
okay so this is how you have to
arrive at a diagnosis when a radiograph
is given to you
so it could be a simple dental caries
right or a pedantal lesion
or a tmj related region or a cyst or a
tumor
or a malignancy okay so
or a developmental anomaly so it could
be anything the abnormality could be
anything
or any of the diseases that you have
studied in your books okay so
just thing is you have to go in a
stepwise manner
if you go in a stepwise manner then
you can be pretty sure that you can
arrive at a good
radiographic diagnosis obviously you
have to again correlate
with your clinical findings to go for a
good diagnosis but yes
if a radiograph is given in order to
arrive at a
proper radiographic diagnosis this step
wise manner
of analysis of a radiograph or
interpretation of a radiograph
is quite important okay so after this
try to solve as many radiographs as you
can so go through the radiographs
wherever you find
and try to give your radiographic
diagnosis based on that
okay thank you
