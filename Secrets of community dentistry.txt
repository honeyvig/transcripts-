hi everyone now I'm going to discuss
about the plan of action for Community
Medicine and Dentistry in need PJ and
aims under flu so here I am going to
discuss about few important Seaton's
that you have to apply in your
preparation pattern to make your
community as the best subject so before
going in details most of us including me
when I was preparing we have a phobia
towards community I mean the only
clinical subject where most of the
people feel bored or boring or they have
a phobia that community is a very very
dry topic or a subject so here the team
of MDS conquer has decided to make it as
easy as possible to crack almost all the
MSHA cues that are going to come in your
final examinations okay so according to
the plan of action I have splitted and
identified the important topics that you
need to do from this particular subject
so apart from these topics there are few
other minor topics which will be
discussed on the group as a special
classes so here goes the topics okay so
before going into the topics the way it
is for this subject in need blueprint is
14 months which includes both community
dentistry as well as community medicine
few people call it as SPM for the
medical people social or preventive
medicine also okay you can call it as
social or preventive dentistry social
or medicine so taking the word prevent
to into consideration as you know that
we have an other waiters in your mid
blueprint that is read out on takes and
prevented industry okay a part of
communities again included in Peter so
community alone is going to carry
somewhere around fourteen arts core
whereas your preventive medicine or a
preventive dentistry has a waiter's of
three to four according to me by
analyzing the recent need sessions so
community is surely going to carry more
than eighteen to twenty marks in your
final net exam and it has great waiters
in the exams like Ames and PGA okay the
community questions from the new areas
or the bio static statistics related
questions or epidemiology related
application based questions are the most
common area of questions for you so
taking all these into consideration
I hope lip read some topics and some
sessions for you which are more than
sufficient to crack any sort of question
within our limitations as we are
approaching towards the midterm
preparation means you have less than six
months of the time officially if you
consider need in December second week as
every year you have 500 months from now
okay so taking all these into
consideration I have allocated 14 days
for community dentistry including
Community Medicine where I'm going to
discuss few other areas like preventive
dentistry is again a part of many other
subjects like speedo and your your
prevent orthodontics it can also be an
indirect question from community
medicine
okay so simultaneously we are going to
talk to topics of pedo which are a part
of preventive or few topics of medicine
which are part of preventive medicine or
even a vaccination
vaccination is also a preventive right
so vaccination is also a part of
community medicine according to many
many mgq books okay so the plan is 14
days plan of action including topics of
few other subjects so we're going to
make these 14 days as the best phase for
community medicine
the vendor industry so going into the
topics the first important topic I want
to stress is the flow rates okay if you
have a look
fluorides is at most important topic
okay for sure you will have two to three
questions only on fluorides in your
exams like aims or nits okay so how to
do fluorides and everything will be
discussed individually on their
particular tip so fluorides
and preventive dentistry i have given
two days even carries activities pit and
fissure sealants a traumatic registry to
treatment or preventive resin
registrations or all this part of your
preventive industry so how allocated
preventive part of dentistry which
includes other preventive areas like the
prevention for oral cancer of the
prevention for periodontal diseases or
prevention for many other things will be
discussed along with this in this
treatise so followed by our given one
day for epidemiology and screen so here
you can you can manipulate and use half
a day of twenty-fourth for this
epidemiology and preventive and one day
completely for screening so that you can
you have to manipulate your times and
schedules accordingly because I feel
like carry stress prevent to pit and
fissure sealants and this prevented
recent registrations are not going to
take much of your time whereas
epidemiology screening is going to take
much of your time because this topic we
are completely unaware so then we have
this all indexes and everything so both
we have medical as well as dental
indexes which are important for exam I
hope you are very familiar with dental
part and I'll make you more familiar
with the medical part with all the MCQs
and the classes so I have given one day
for indexes of dental and the medical
part so next comes I have allocated two
days for biostatistics want to learn
about the concepts second day to
practice the new miracles because you
have lots of mathematics related stuff
in biostatistics so first base is you
need to be very clear with the concepts
and the second one you need to practice
as many as problems as possible because
the
these are the areas where the purposes
of picking n number of questions in most
of the books as well as in the most of
the teaching patterns there are few
things which are clearly neglected from
community medicine as well as the
dentistry in dental student point of
view that is the school dental health
programs okay there few nephew programs
you need to know make a note about es
you need to make a note about their main
concern advantage disadvantage all these
are the most commonly asked questions
then we need to talk about the financial
finance in dentistry okay a small topic
in your Shogun paper manpower in
dentistry because I have seen a number
of questions even in the recent need
they have given question on the manpower
so you need to learn about these small
minor topics which are faded in almost
all the polls so coming to the concepts
of health and disease again a very very
important topic related to community
medicine
okay I'll given one day for it I'll be
guiding you what to be focused what to
be done and everything then comes the
and ornamental and health which is not
that important but there are areas where
there are asking questions related to
the inner element soil pollution they
are asking questions we like to hear
pollution they are asking questions
related to the noise pollution and
they're asking questions related to the
micronutrients macronutrients okay
vitamins and everything are a part of
this an ornamental and health I cannot
allocate one definite and that most
important thing is the recent health
schemes recent health schemes I mean
they may ask questions related to
epidemiology of KOed okay the statistics
related to the covert okay many aspects
relate to the cobalt can be asked
related to this community and the most
important aspect is the agencies okay if
they may ask you questions related to
whu-oh okay the most favorite question
for the need is the theme of w the
recent theme of WH folks but they may
ask you that 2020 what is the theme of
WH for 2010 what is the theme of WH for
the headquarters of WH was what are the
primary concerns and WH for their many
other health agencies where they are
going to ask you the headquarters year
of year in which it is established here
in which the new acts came into
existence all these
was scientist names are very very
important in community dentistry but
excluding the need 2020 question path
are related to the community of medicine
or dentistry rest all purpose okay if
you go back to the history and just have
a look most of the questions in the
community are memory based means they
may ask you the numbers they may ask you
the dates okay
DCI was formed on okay Dental Act came
into existence
copra came into existence in which year
Debray had first started in India in
which year so all these questions of the
numbers dates years scientist names are
the favorite choice of the most of the
purpose syrtis okay so all those things
whether it is a memory based on a
conceptual based or a numerical based or
a problematic mathematics relate based
everything will be discussed according
to the blueprint of according to the
blueprint in our discussions okay so I
have given one day for this Health
Agency's schemes on X Y Chad and I have
allocated three days two and half days
because fifth afternoon he is going to
be on exam I have allocated 200 days for
your revision where I am going to
discuss the topics or the questions
which are stressed in the recent 2017 18
19 and 2020 aims and need including the
recent paper of games which was given
five days back so this is what our plan
of action in which we are going to
discuss about the symbols because if you
talk about the diagram based questions
related to the Community Medicine the
most commonly asked diagram based
questions are the symbols the symbols of
agencies the health agencies the symbols
of the school dental health programs
symbols or there ambulams okay and most
other areas are the flowcharts okay you
have different types of data
representation so in such areas they can
ask you even the preventive part like
what are the preventive things that are
used they can ask you such questions all
this diagram based stuff will be
discussed on the group in the special
classes will have a special class on
diagram based off of community medicine
and community dentistry will have a
special class on the numbers will have a
special class on the dates and year
specific
Kelly will have a specialist on the
numerical based of there is mathematic
related stuff of biostatistics at loss
that most important thing and the most
phobic thing for most of the students is
the tests okay they are going to give a
condition they're going to give a study
and they're going to ask you which test
has to be given for this particular case
hope you have learned few tests like
t-test I square test okay
ANOVA test paid teeters unpaid t-test
there many other tests which are used
for quantitative and qualitative data is
again a most commonly asked question but
for this epidemiology as well as the
biostatistics you need to learn some
concepts then you need to have a
vigorous practice so concept is
something like a basement and practice
is going to give you more confidence to
handle the tough questions so there is a
rough plan of action okay I'm just going
to make an outline the subject is going
to carry 14 to 18 marks according to the
need blueprint and these are the topics
to be forecast and few secrets of
community will be discussed in your
respective classes ok the few topics
we'll try excluded which are very very
important out of which one is co 819
they're high chances that they will
definitely ask questions from this area
so all the things we let the co at 19 in
community as well as the general
medicine point of view will be discussed
right away in this 14 days so this is
what the plan and my preference books
are these books ok so I want you guys to
go ahead with these two books as a
reference
ok don't read these books okay you may
read this books for topics like dental
manpower ok finance in dentistry all
these topics has to be completely done
ok these two topics if there is any
other requirement I'm going to just
inform you on your respective groups as
a notification but these are the two
things that you have to do rest all this
book acts as a reference even the
preventive and Schwartzel medicine ok
that is part has to be a reference book
I don't want anyone to read these books
because we have a limited time for
community and we need to do our best so
reading these books is going to give you
knowledge but may not give you the exact
score what your reality is
okay so for me okay there are few
medical topics like for example you need
to do biostatistics you need to do
screening okay you you need to do
epidermal and an ornament and few other
topics which I'm going to clearly
mention on your respective groups from
this particular book of the wave chain
that is preventive and social medicine
which includes biostatistics it's
mandatory that everyone has to finish
this and the next preferred book
according to me is our book that is that
is power playbook okay you have your
community part it is well organized okay
each each concept is well explained and
also see eight only they have given the
problem and I have really a very
systemic way and most of the recent
questions in many examinations were
covered in this community but and I want
everyone to finish it as fast as
possible fur fur fur for more practice
you can do either dental pulse or
dentist as your preference like which
book is available the first preferred
book is dentist okay you can start with
the dentist community part if you don't
have dentist then you can start with the
dental pulse or any of these books is
fine as a reference for for making your
concepts more strong you can practice
more I'm secure so the practice purpose
you can use dental pulse and dentist and
rest all you need to follow the group
videos classes discussions and XY check
notices okay so I'm done for now okay I
hope you're very clear with the
community part and and I Q hundred
percentage assurance to make community
as simple as possible and I promise you
that we are going to do some extra stuff
okay maybe few topics in pharmacology
I'm not going to mention them but we are
going to do as an extra bonus in this 14
days few topics of pharmacology few
topics of Pido few topics of operator
dentistry few topics of dental materials
and few topics of other subjects like
miscellaneous we are going to cover few
things stay positive stay blessed stay
safe at home
