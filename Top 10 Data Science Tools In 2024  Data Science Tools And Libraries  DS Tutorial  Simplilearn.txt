for this guide unveils the top 10 Tools
in your data wrangling AR the first one
is power up for Big Data we have Apache
and hadu next we have K9 which is your
workflow visit R next you have see the
story on fold using the powerbi tblo
ggplot click view visualization tools
next ahead we have P then we have Chupa
followed by that we have some
programming languages which cover our
programming language and python next we
have mat plot lip followed by that we
have psychic learn next tens oflow and
lastly the 10th one Microsoft Excel now
we will go through each one of these so
the first one power up for Big Data
Apache spark and hu imagine a tsunami of
information that's big data thankfully
Apache spark and Hado are your life RS
spark excels at realtime processing
while Hado is a secure storage facility
allowing you to easily tackle massive
data sets next ahead we have the the
workflow vitry that is the K9 data
wrangling can feel like a maze K9 is
your arance thread offering a visual
interface to build data processing
workflows drag drop and connect K9
streamlines your data Journey next see
the story unfold using the powerful data
visualization tools like powerbi GG plot
click View and tab data can speak
volumes but sometimes it needs a trans
translator enter the visualization
Wizards Tableau click View powerbi and
GG plock tool these tools transform raw
data into captivating charts and graphs
making insights Crystal Clear next ahead
we have deep learnings Dynamic Doo which
is the py and tens flow let's discuss
about the py first Unleash the Power of
artificial intelligence with py this
data and deep learning framework is the
Picasso of data World allow you to build
intricate and powerful machine learning
models moving ahead we have the Jupiter
notebook which is the interactive
playground Jupiter notebook is your data
science playground this interactive
environment lets you combine code
visualizations and text fostering
exploration and experimentation a must
have for turning ideas into reality
moving ahead we have the both Titans of
the programming which are the python and
r programming languages the programming
powerhouses help you in data
manipulation data manipulation is the
foundation of data science Python and R
are the languages that Empower you
python with its versatility is a popular
choice while R shines and statistical
analysis mastering both equips you for
any data challenge next ahead we have
Matlab for complex numerical
computations Matlab is your sorceress
appentice this powerful tool tackles
challenging mathematical problems with
ease making it a valuable asset for data
scientist venturing into the realm of
advanced algorithms moving ahead we have
psychic Lear machine learning Made Easy
machine learning can feel intimidating
but psychic learn is your friendly
neighborhood guide this python Library
provides a comprehensive Su of
algorithms allowing you to build and
deploy machine learning models without
getting lost in the weeds moving ahead
we have tensor flow building the
brainiacs yes tens of flow made a second
appearance here but this time for a
different reason while it excels at
building complex models it also offers
tools to streamline the deployment
process consider it learning Visions to
life now the last one is the Microsoft
Excel Microsoft Excel is also considered
the unsung hero of data science don't
underestimate the power of good
spreadsheet Excel remains a valuable
tool for data cleaning manipulation and
initial analysis its familiarity and
ease of use make it a great starting
point especially for those new to data
science now the fal board your data
