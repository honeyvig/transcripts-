hey everyone welcome to another tutorial
by simply learn
in this tutorial we will learn about
typescript typescript has grown in
popularity in growing years microsoft
created and maintains the typescript
programming language it is a rigorous
syntactical superset of javascript with
the addition of optical static typing
typescript is a large-scale application
development language that compiles
javascript existing javascript programs
are also valid typescript programs
because typescript is superset of
javascript let's see what's in it for
you in this session we'll first start
with understanding what is typescript
then we will see why do we need
typescript
what led to the development of
typescript next we will see some of the
important and key features of typescript
followed by which we will look at the
advantages of typescript and
applications of typescript then
proceeding further we will see how to
set up the development environment what
are the necessary tools required for the
development of typescript then we will
see how variables data types functions
and loops are used in typescript but
before you begin if you love watching
tech videos then subscribe to our
youtube channel and make sure you have
press the bell icon so you never miss an
update from simply learn so without
wasting any further time let's get
started
what is typescript
typescript is object oriented and
strongly type programming language which
is a superset of javascript typescript
was designed by anders hegelsberg at
microsoft
the limitations of javascript for
developing large-scale applications at
microsoft and among its external
customers led to the creation of
typescript
because of the difficulty of working
with complicated javascript code there
was demand for custom tooling to make
developing javascript components easier
typescript code is converted to
javascript which can be executed
anywhere javascript is supported
in the browser on node.js and in your
application
typescript is javascript with some
additional features to support more
robust interaction with your editor
typescript adds additional syntax to
javascript
typescript is a scripting language that
understands javascript and uses type
inference to provide powerful
capabilities without additional code
why need typescript
now we'll see some of the reasons why we
need typescript
firstly we have compilation
javascript is an interpreted language
thus there is no need to compile it
as a result it must be run to ensure
authenticity if there is an error we
need to write the code only to find the
output as a result we will have to spend
hours looking for false in the code
error checking is provided via the
typescript transpiler if the typescript
detects any syntax mistakes it will
compile the code and generate the
compilation error this aids in detecting
errors before the execution of the
typescript
typescript provides an optional type
system for javascript code
when a client doesn't have a value for a
parameter he can personal optional
arguments are a feature of typescript
you can declare some optional arguments
in the function by utilizing optional
parameter features so the decline does
not need to supply a value to optional
parameters
strong static typing javascript does not
have a powerful static typing system
through the tls typescript comes with an
optional static typing and type
inference system the tls that is a
typescript language service can deduce
the type of variable defined with no
type based on its value
typescript supports object oriented
programming typescript supports classes
interfaces inheritance and other object
oriented programming principles
typescript supports type definition
existing javascript libraries can use
typescript type definitions
external typescript libraries are
defined in typescript definition files
as a result it can include these
libraries in typescript code features of
typescript
typescript supports other javascript
libraries
typescript is a new microsoft language
that is a highly typed superset of
javascript with the support for object
oriented programming and other current
features like decorators
because browsers and nodes comprehend
javascript typescript compiles
javascript
typescript is portable typescript is
cross browser cross device and cross
platform
it can run in any environment that
supports javascript
typescript unlike its computators does
not require a dedicated virtual machine
or a specific runtime environment to run
typescript is superset of javascript
it's a strong syntactical superset of
javascript with the addition of optional
static typing
typescript is a large scale application
development language that transcompiles
to javascript
existing javascript programs are also
valid typescript programs because
typescript is superset of javascript
typescript is static when a client
doesn't have a value for a parameter he
can pass null
optional arguments are a feature of
typescript
you can declare some arguments in the
function optional by utilizing optional
parameter features so that the client is
not necessary to supply a value to
optional parameters
object oriented programming when it
comes to object oriented programming
with javascript typescript shines
because of the class keyword it makes
object oriented programming look quite
similar to programming in other object
oriented languages like c sharp or java
applications of typescript
typescript can be used to create both
client-side and server-side javascript
applications
typescript can be deployed instead of
javascript language since it adds more
features and gives errors directly with
the code
typescript is used for building
large-scale applications for enterprises
now let us look at the advantages of
typescript
during development problems are
highlighted at compilation time
any browser or javascript engine can run
on typescript
by defining a module
it has a namespace concept
typescript supports strongly typed or
strongly typing typescript has the
advantages of being tightly typed or
allowing static typing it may confirm
type correctness at compile time because
of static typing
intellisense is the feature of
typescript that develops active tips as
you type setting up development
environment
firstly we need to go to node.js
official website and install node.js
after installing
go to command prompt and type the
function node space hyphen v to check if
the node is installed properly
to install typescript run the command
in pm note package manager install
globally type script in the command
prompt and this will install typescript
so let's jump to the browser and see the
installation of load.js and typescript
then we will go to visual studio and see
the different components like loops
variables data types with examples

simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more so to install
node.js come to the website nodejs.org
here come to the downloads and from here
you can install node.js
node is an open source server side
execution platform for javascript code
node is commonly used for real-time
applications like chat news feeds and
web push notifications
because it allows for a persistent
connection from browser to the server
node.js is a javascript runtime based on
v8 javascript engine from chrome
node.js is an asynchronous event-driven
javascript runtime for building scalable
network applications
to install for windows click on windows
if you have mac os
click on mac os to install
so i'll click on windows here we go
node.js is getting installed
since i have already installed in my
device i'll cancel it
so once the installation is complete and
you have installed the node.js
let's go to command prompt
in the command prompt run the command
node
hyphen v
to check if whether the nodejs is
installed properly
and here it shows the version of nodejs
installed in our device
so here we can see that node is
installed
properly next we need to install
typescript
to install typescript we need to run the
command npm node package manager
install
hyphen g globally typescript
if you run this command the typescript
will be installed
the typescript will be installed
worldwide with this command
this implies that each project you
create on your computer can use
typescript dependencies without having
to reinstall the typescript package
so after running this the typescript
will be installed since i have already
installed will clear this
so after installing typescript to check
if whether the typescript is installed
properly
to check if the compiler is installed
just type dsc typescript compiler space
hyphen version
and here you can see the typescript
compiler of version 4.5.4 is installed
now that we know how to install node.js
and
type script now we will go to visual
studio and
see the
examples
so let us see the different types of
variables available in typescript for
variable declaration typescript follows
the same rules as javascript variables
can be declared with the commands like
variable
or we have
let
and we have constant
const
so these are the three types of variable
declarations available in typescript
we'll see them one by one
variables can be declared in typescript
using the var keyword just like in
javascript the scoping rules are
identical to those in javascript
for example we can declare a variable
of parameter h
and it is of the type number
which is equal to say 45 something like
this
and similarly we have
let
so let is a ecmascript 6 introduce two
new types of variable declarations in
javascript using the keyword let and
const to solve the issues with variable
declarations
these additional sorts of variable
declarations are also supported by
typescript which is a superset of
javascript
for example we have let say employee
name
is equal to john
similarly we have constant
constant variables are declared in the
same way as variable and let variables
are
constant transforms are variable into a
constant whose value cannot be changed
the same scoping constraints apply to
constant variable as they do to the let
variables
for example we have constant
number
is equal to
100
something like this
next we will look at the different data
types in typescript
we have different data types like number
string boolean array etc
so number first we'll look at the number
just like javascript typescript supports
number data type
all numbers are stored as floating point
numbers these numbers can be a decimal
hexadecimal
for example
say let
first
number
one two three
so
let's second
the third number
is equal to this is of the type now we
will write octal
and don't forget to put colon otherwise
it will show an error
let fourth
now we'll declare the number of type
say binary
so typescript supports number data types
like the numbers can be stored in
floating point numbers
or decimal or hexadecimal octal or
binary
so this is basically a number
and this is
hexadecimal
[Music]
this is octal
and
this is binary these are the different
number methods in typescript
the method two exponential returns the
exponential notation in string format
two fixed returns the fixed point
notation in string format
to locate string converts a number into
a local specific representation of the
number
two precision returns a string
representation in exponential or fixed
point to be specified precision
tostring returns a string representation
of the number in the specified base
and value off returns a primitive value
of the number
next we have string then the data type
which we have is string string is an
another primitive data type that is used
to store text data
string values are surrounded by single
quotation marks or double quotation mark
for example
we say declare it let employee
name
string of the type string
is equal to
johnson
so this is of the type string
the different string methods in
typescript are
kept method character at returns the
character at the given index concatenate
returns a combination of two or more
specified strings
index off returns an index of first
occurrence of this specified substring
from a string and minus 1 if not found
the method replace replaces the matched
substring with a new substring
and the method split splits the string
into substrings and returns an array
two upper case converts all the
characters of the string into uppercase
two lowercase converts all the
characters of the string into the lower
case
the next type which we have is boolean
boolean values are supported by both
javascript and typescript and stored as
true or false
example for boolean is say let
here note that the boolean with small b
is different from the boolean capital b
so the upper case boolean is an object
type whereas the lowercase boolean is a
primitive type
it is always recommended to use the
primitive type boolean that is a
lowercase boolean in the code because
while javascript coerces an object to
its primitive type the typescript type
system does not the typescript treats it
like in the object type
the another data type is of the type
array
an array is a special type of data type
which can store multiple values of
different data types sequentially using
a special syntax
typescript supports array similar to
javascript there are two ways to declare
an array one is using the square
brackets and the other is using a
generic array type
example
this is one type to declare with the
square brackets
and the other type is to use
the generic array type
both methods produce the same output
arrays can contain elements of any data
types numbers strings or even objects
arrays can be declared and initialized
separately
these are the different array methods in
typescript
we have pop that removes the last
element of the array and returns that
element and push adds the new elements
to the array and returns the new array
length
sort sorts all the elements of the array
and similarly we have concat index of
copy within
fill
shift splice
and shift
includes join
last index of
that returns the last index of the
element in an array similarly we have
slice two string
and two locate string similarly we have
tuple
union any word and never as the data
types in typescript
next we'll look at the if statement in
typescript
an if statement can include one or more
expressions which return boolean if the
boolean expression evaluates to true
a set of statements is then executed and
in if-else condition an if-else
condition includes two blocks
if block and an else block if the if
condition evaluates to true then if
block is executed otherwise the else
block is executed
and we also have elsif
so the elsif statement can be used for
if statement next we will see loops in
typescript
typescript supports for loop the for
loop is used to execute a block of code
a given number of times which is
specified by a condition
so this is the for loop
the first expression is executed before
the for loop starts and the second
expression is the condition for the loop
to execute and the third expression is
executed after the execution of every
code block here in this example i is
equal to 0 declares and initializes a
variable the second condition i is less
than 3 checks whether the value of i is
less than 3 or not if it is less then it
exits the loop
the third statement
increases the value of i by one
this loop will execute the block three
times until the value of i becomes three
now that we have seen loops we'll see
the functions in typescript
functions are the primary blocks of any
program functions are the most important
part
since it is a functional programming
language with functions we can implement
the concepts of oops like classes
objects polymorphism and abstraction
functions ensure that the program is
maintainable and revisible and organized
into readable blocks while typescript
provides a concept of classes and module
functions still are integral part of the
language for example
we have function
sum
so this is the example of function
classes in typescript now let us look at
the classes in typescript
so in object oriented programming
classes are fundamental entities used to
create reusable components
typescript has been primarily a
functional programming language
where inheritance is prototype based
functions are used to build reusable
components
let us see an example for the classes
employee name
so we'll create a class employee
and
provide employee
id
employee name
so the typescript compiler
will convert the class to the javascript
code using the
closure and the constructor
is a special type of method which is
called when creating an object in
typescript the construction method is
always defined with the name constructor
so in this example the employee class
includes a constructor with the
parameter employee id
in the constructor members of the class
can be accessed using this keyword
example this dot employee id
it is not necessary for every class to
have a constructor
so far in this video we saw the
variables different data types
loops
functions classes
and constructors
so with that we have reached the end of
