hi traders this is Matt well compactors
and in the art of trading today's video
we're going to be covering trend and
market conditions such as consolidation
and trend reversals there are a few very
important fundamental concepts that you
must master before you can ever find
success as a trader such as how to reach
friend candlestick patterns and so on
today's particular video is going to
focus purely on trend it's very
important to have clear rules defining
exactly when and when you cannot act on
a market the purpose of these rules and
this systematic approach to trading is
so that you can develop consistency in
your process you can't improve what you
don't measure and is more true of
trading than of anything else that I've
ever experienced in my life of course
you can't remove all subjectivity in
trading it's impossible that's due to
the probabilistic nature of markets and
the inherent uncertainty that we are
confronted with every time we open our
charts but by having strict rules that
govern our behavior in the market we can
determine whether or not what we are
doing is working and before you can make
money as a trader you must be consistent
all profitable traders know this and all
unprofitable traders struggle with this
hopefully this video today will clear up
a lot of uncertainty you have around how
to read a trending market and I will
show you one of the best ways to
objectively determine the markets trend
which is a method that was passed down
to me from my own personal trading
mentor Steven ha let's start with a
blank chart here and I will draw out
what I consider to be a bullish trend
and a bearish trend and then I will
explain the concepts to you so I'll
start with a bullish trend the textbook
definition of a bullish trend is a
market that is making higher lows and
higher highs we've all heard that before
and it sounds good in theory but as you
will see later
we go over to live charts it's a lot
easier said than done to determine a
trending market but hopefully this
concept I'm about to teach you now will
help all bullish markets must begin with
a what we call a one two three move so
that looks like this on your charts
market makes an impulsive move higher
then it pulls back without breaking the
low of the initial impulsive move so we
can come all the way down to the
beginning of the move but I cannot close
lower than ax
so a typical trending market will look
something like this it'll pull back
somewhere within this impulsive move and
then once we get a second breaking close
higher above this high here we have the
beginnings of a potential bullish trend
we don't necessarily have a bullish
trend yet but this is the bare minimum
we need to see before we can determine
that a market is trending higher in
order to confirm that we have a bullish
trend
this next pullback can come all the way
down to the origin of this impulsive
move but again cannot close below it so
if we get a pullback all the way down to
here and then the market breaks higher
right now this scenario is a bullish
trend according to how most professional
traders read markets now this pullback
doesn't have to come all the way down
here of course it could and somewhere in
the middle of this impulsive move like
here for example this is still a valid
bullish trend quite often you will see
the market in a very strong bullish
trend it will pull back into previous
resistance before finding support and
moving higher now this is an ideal
bullish trend not all bullish trends
will look like this however so I will
show you examples later on where things
aren't quite as clear as this but there
right there you have a textbook bullish
trend and so long as this market
continues to make higher highs and
higher lows without taking out
previous low we have a bullish trend so
if this market were to start pulling
back anywhere within this range here
means that the market is still in a
bullish trend which means that it is
likely to continue heading higher in the
long term who is more likely to continue
heading higher in the long term than it
is to suddenly reverse what that means
to you as a trader is that any trading
opportunities you take on this timeframe
or any lower timeframe should have a
bullish directional bias any trading
opportunities that you take while this
is occurring that have you going short
should be considered counter trend
trading opportunities and treated as
such what that means is you shouldn't
expect to capture a massive amount of
profit in a counter trend move I don't
want to get too complicated with this so
I'm not going to explain counter trend
trading in this video I'm gonna stick
with trend continuation trading because
that's how I prefer to trade and it's my
specialty if you want to learn how to
counter trend trade there are many other
people out there who are far more
qualified than me to teach you that so
keep that in mind we're going to stick
to trend continuation and momentum
trading in this lesson so right there we
have a bullish trend
so just to recap each time this market
makes a low and then a new high the
bullish trend is considered intact until
one of these lows is closed below so you
can see here in this crude example that
none of these lures were taken out by it
price action by delete these lines and
we focus on this line here now I will
show you an example of a potential trend
reversal / rotation into consolidation
so if this market were to come up and
try to make a new high and say it double
tops up here fails to make a new high
and then it reverses and then it starts
to do something like this comes back
down to reach
this low right now we have a period of
consolidation what that means is that
although the trend is still to the
outside it has lost steam and it's now
going sideways
now if these loads aren't taken out
during this period of consolidation then
your buyers should still be to the
upside which means you could be taking
long trades down at these loads if your
strategy has an edge in doing so but
just as I mentioned earlier that if
you're taking counter trend trades
against a bullish trend your profit
potential is limited the same is true of
consolidation what I mean by that is if
you are going to trade consolidation
from these lows in this example so you
go long down here after getting a entry
reason you should be looking to take
profit before these highs because the
market is not showing that it wants to
move higher yet so what could happen
here and what is likely to happen here
is that this market will continue
consolidating and so if you were to go
along here and hold your position
waiting for a trend continuation move
after we've entered a period of
consolidation you're likely to see this
market come all the way back down and
stop you out either for breakeven or for
a loss so during consolidation it's best
to be conservative with your profit
targets so now that we've got an example
of consolidating market which is still
in a bullish trend because we still
haven't taken out these lows but what
happens if we do take out these lows
that would look something like this a
breaking close below these lows here
would signal that this consolidation
period may be entering a potential trend
reversal situation so what we're looking
for now just as we had this
one-two-three bullish move here that
signaled a potential beginnings of a
bullish trend but is not confirmed until
we have that third breaking close above
this high the same is true of a reversal
now that we've broken out of this period
of consolidation that does not mean that
we've immediately entered a bearish
trend what it does mean is that sell
are taking control of this market and
that if we find resistance somewhere
before these highs and then we roll over
into another low
we now have a bearish trend reversal and
have entered a bearish trend once we get
this one two three move we are now
anticipating price continuing lower
until price breaks and closes above this
high we have a bearish trend in market
so what that means now is that if this
market pulls back up and does not break
and close above this high here then we
are anticipating the market continuing
lower in a bearish trend so you can see
that according to this rules-based
method of determining trend it's
identical to the bullish trend just in
Reverse instead of waiting for the lows
to be broken and closed below in order
to signify a reversal and trend we are
waiting for the highs to be broken and
closed above so as long as this market
continues to make lower highs lower lows
without breaking and closing above this
previous high in the bearish trend then
we have an intact valid bearish trending
market so let's presume that this market
continues making lower highs and lower
lows without invalidating the trend then
let's say that instead of consolidating
here and making a low and then failing
to make a new lower low and then ranging
like we did up here before reversing
let's do an example of an immediate
trend reversal a v-shaped trend reversal
so say that this market makes a new low
and then immediately following that new
low it breaks and closes above this high
once this happens we have an invalidated
bearish trend it does not mean that we
now have a sudden bullish trend
keep that in mind what it does mean is
that the momentum to the downside has
been lost and Bulls have regained
control of this market at least for the
time being what this means
as a trend continuation trader is that
you should stop taking short trades
basically it doesn't mean you should
suddenly go long but it means that you
should stop taking short trades and wait
to see what the market does next your
bias now should be neutral until the
market forms a new clear trending
direction now what that would look like
is if the market went now to pull back
and make a new low that is higher than
this low and then break close above this
high now you have the beginnings of a
potential bullish trend and so during
this next pullback depending how
conservative you are or aggressive you
are you could begin looking for bullish
trading opportunities for long trades in
anticipation of a bullish trend reversal
but keep in mind that we do not have a
confirmed bullish trend until we get one
more breaking close above this high
because we have this impulsive move up
here there Pro structure putting us in
the consolidation potential
consolidation and invalidating the
bearish trend once we have this
situation here then the same rules that
applied here come into effect so until
this market breaks and closes below this
low then anything that happens in this
pullback is considered to be a bullish
trend in pullback meaning that we are
anticipating this market continuing into
new highs and therefore your bias should
be to the long side now keep in mind
that all of this is subjective according
to what time frame you're trading so if
you're trading the daily chart here for
example then when this pullback begins
to occur on lower timeframes
this pullback will look like a bearish
trend so on a 4 hour or 1 hour chart you
will see the market making lower highs
and lower lows that's why it's important
to have two timeframes that you trade
with and use one of those timeframes as
your higher time frame reference point
depending on what time frame you're
trading that could be the daily or the
4-hour or maybe the one-hour chart if
you're trading a 5-minute chart you
want to use the one-hour chart as your
reference timeframe the reason for that
is that a daily charts movements do not
have a lot of bearing on a five-minute
chart it does around structure but again
that's for another discussion another
day we're not talking about structure
today we're just talking about trends
but keep in mind that this analysis this
trend analysis that I'm showing you
should be performed on your higher time
frame so at the moment I'm a 4-hour
trader I trade the four hour time frame
and the one-hour time frame and I use
the daily chart as my high timeframe for
determining my trend bias and whatever
the daily trend bias is determines what
setups I'm looking for on the 4-hour and
one-hour chart so if the daily trend is
bullish then I'm looking for for our
bullish setups and of course the ideal
situation would be that your higher time
frame is trending to the upside or the
downside and your trading time frame is
also trending to the upside or the
downside if you have two time frames
trending in confluence that dramatically
increases the probability of your trade
being successful so that's a crude
illustration of the theory behind trend
analysis my trading mentor has been
using this method for many years now
with massive success if you want to
learn more of this stuff in detail I
highly recommend going and checking out
his course the EAP mentorship program
you can find that at the trading channel
dotnet now let's move on to some live
chart examples because the theory is all
well and good but I know all too well
but once we get into live charts it gets
a lot more difficult to see this stuff
so for simplicity sake going to focus on
just this part of the market going
forward okay so we're going to ignore
all the price action to the left here
sorry about the flickering here that
happens whenever I put my mouse over the
candles this black box is there to just
take your eyes off that we're just going
to look and pretend that the market
started where it is so I'm going to put
the replay tool lon to make this easier
gonna zoom in a little bit and I'm going
to play this back Bob
bah and we're going to analyze the trend
as it develops let's begin
okay we have our first impulsive move
lower here now you can see that we've
had a pretty substantial pullback now I
clasp a valid pullback in a trending
market as two large green candles in a
row at least two large green candles now
this is where a bit of subjectivity
comes into play in how large does a
candle have to be what about the wicks
does a doji count and so on I'm gonna
have to leave that up to you to
determine your own rules for deciding
that this video is going to be far too
long if I go into the nitty-gritty
details we have this scenario unfolding
right here and as I said in the theory
section if price does not break and
close above this high but it does break
and close below this low after this
pullback has occurred then we have our
first 1 2 3 move which signifies a
potential bearish rotation so let's play
this market forward a little longer and
there we have it we have a breaking
close below this low which gives us our
first bearish one-two-three
move let's continue forward we get
another significant pullback here as you
can see but during this pullback here
our bias should be to the downside we
are anticipating that this market will
more likely head lower than it will
suddenly reverse so we have our next
pullback here and until price breaks and
closes above this high up here we have a
potential bearish trend so let's roll
the market for and there we go now we
have a confirmed bearish trend we have
lower lows and lower highs coming in and
again until we break in close above this
high here we are expecting the market to
continue lower in this bearish trend it
doesn't matter what it does between this
low and this high so long as it doesn't
break in close above this high so long
as
happens we are anticipating the market
to continue lower so let's continue for
it another significant pullback very
interesting situation here you can see
the market came up to test this high it
broke through the high but did not close
above it what this typically signifies
is a stop-loss hunt and so market movers
know that people put their stop-loss
above highs and that is the importance
of waiting for the close of the candle
if you were to try to buy this breakout
here before this candle closed you'd be
trapped in this trade you don't want to
be the small fish getting caught in the
big guys net that's what this trend
analysis training is designed to help
you avoid this is a great example of a
bullish trend remaining intact after the
previous high was contested so you can
see the market came up tested as higher
did not breaking close above it and
we're starting to roll over so let's
play this market forward and continue
remember we are anticipating this low
down here being violated
until this market racing closes above
these highs up here closes not just
breaks but closes the candle must close
above these highs then we are
anticipating the market continuing lower
so let's see what happens so now we've
come down and we've tested these loads
we've failed to break through them which
is interesting to note and depending on
what happens next if we get a seat
another significant pullback after this
failure to make a new low then we have
entered a period of consolidation so
keep that in mind
there you have it we've entered a period
of consolidation so now between this
high and this low we've lost bearish
momentum and we're now consolidating
where the market is now going sideways
what that means is that if you're a
trend continuation trader depending on
your trading plan rules and what you
back-tested to find profitable give you
an edge of the markets you should stand
stop taking short trades until the
market makes a new low the reason for
that is that the problem the probability
of your short trade winning has now
dramatically decreased because the
markets going sideways now it's an
advanced topic I'm not going to get into
it in this video but during these
periods of consolidation
there are ways you can trade them but
that requires a different approach to
trend continuation and trend trading
such as advanced patterns consolidation
patterns range trading so selling at the
highs and buying at the lows mean
reversion trading so waiting for an
oscillator like the RSI to go overboard
or oversold within this consolidation
period to trade it there are many ways
to trade consolidation but that's
outside of the scope of this video so we
won't go over that now but let's just
play the market forward remember that
even though we're consolidating until we
break above these highs breaking close
above these highs we are anticipating
the market moving lower and making new
lows so that's what I'm expecting out of
this market and there we have it now
know this is hindsight bias we did look
at the chart before I did this analysis
but this stuff works in live markets
just as well so even though I cherry
picked this trend example I only did so
because it has such great examples of
these concepts but if you go out and try
this yourself test this yourself over
many years of historical price action
data or many months of forward testing
you'll find that it is very effective at
determining the direction of price
action
so we've now made a lower low from this
high and the bearish trend is back in
force so until we break and close above
this high we have a bearish trend so
let's play the market forward expecting
the market to roll over to the downside
and make a new low and we've entered
another period of consolidation we came
up made a high then we try to take out
these lows and enter into a bearish
trend continuation but we failed we
failed right at the lows
so now until we break above this high or
breaking close below this low we are in
a period of consolidation the market is
going sideways and your bias should be
neutral with a slight bent towards the
downside because we still do have a
bearish trend intact until this high is
closed above so keep that in mind let's
move on see what happens and there we
have it we have our first sign of a
potential bullish reversal with broken
and closed above this high and now we're
out of a bearish trend but still
technically in consolidation what we
need to see now is another pullback that
does not break in close below this low
and then an impulsive move higher the
price and closes above these highs in
order to have a bullish trend reversal
so right now we do not have a bullish
trend reversal but we have a potential
bullish rotation so keep that in mind I
notice a lot of concepts to juggle but
it will make sense with practice just
keep watching this video over and over
if this doesn't make sense to you but
let's play the market forward and see
what happens did we get a 1 to 3 move we
do so you can see the markets pulled
back made a low that was higher than
this low and then we've broken and
closed above these highs so now we have
a trend reversal situation occurring so
let's play the market forward and see
what happens
so you can see that this market after
making a one-two-three move has pulled
back but not closed below these lows
this is the last line of defense in this
bullish trend remember that we pulled
right down into that zone and failed to
close below it so depending how you
trade there may have been a trading
opportunity down at these lows if you
drop down to your four-hour chart and
look for price action patterns in this
zone so remember even though we're now
on the 4-hour chart and this is a
bearish trend happening we've got lower
highs and lower lows the daily trend is
just 10 bullish so let's play this
market forward a little bit
and so I don't really see any way to
have entered this initial bounce out of
this zone but here I see a hammer candle
with a long week to the downside and a
small body at the top so there's a
trading opportunity right there that I
can identify based on this analysis and
so how you would trade this is you would
have your stop-loss one ATR or whatever
you back test and find profitable below
this load and a target at at least a one
to one I would recommend if not higher
but in this case our one to one would
have given you a profitable trade out of
this structure zone in here and that is
how you would use this trend analysis to
identify trading opportunities and
develop a bias an intraday trading bias
or swing trading bias so just to recap
you can see that we had a bearish trend
occurring we had an impulsive move lower
here a pullback that did not break them
close above this high then another
impulsive move to did break and close
below this load and we had another
pullback they created a new high that
did not break and closed above this
previous high in the trend and then we
rolled over into a new low then we had
yet another pullback that tested the
previous high in the trend but did not
close above it we did not get a candle
close above this high so the bearish
trend was still intact at this point and
then we rolled over we went into a
period of consolidation a short period
of consolidation and then made a new low
once we made this new low we had a
pullback that did not break and closed
above this high so we had a bearish
trend still intact and then we tried to
roll over into a new low but failed and
we double bottom down here immediately
after this double bottom we had an
impulsive move higher the broke
structure to the upside and did in fact
close above this previous high during
this consolidation period once we had
this breaking close above this previous
high we had a pullback that did not
break and closed below this low and then
we had an impulsive move higher that did
break structure here now we have a
bullish trend and I just showed you how
you could take advantage of that on a
lower timeframe like a four-hour chart
or even a one-hour chart for go to a
one-hour chart you see
a nice clean double bottom in here and
somewhat of a head and shoulders pattern
in here you can see that we came down
made a left shoulder how to pull back
then broke through made our head pulled
back then made a right shoulder and then
we broke out of the neckline of this
head and shoulders pattern so you could
have gone long anywhere in here or on
this pullback here after the confirmed
break or even on this right shoulder
there are many opportunities here to get
long out of this zone and capture a
decent bounce out of this market on
these lower timeframes just using higher
timeframe trend analysis so that's a
really long-winded demonstration of
trend analysis I hope you found it
helpful I hope it wasn't too confusing
for you if you did find it very
confusing it may help to watch this
video over a few more times it took me a
while took me quite a long time actually
to grasp these concepts and I'm still
making mistakes occasionally if you're
skeptical or this didn't make sense to
you go to the trading channel net and
you can learn this stuff straight from
the man himself who taught me this
information
alright so before I leave you guys I
figure I should probably show you a
quick example of a bullish trend of
course you saw at the beginning in the
theory section the bullish trend is
basically the same as what I just showed
you except in the opposite direction
obviously but let me show you a
real-life price action example of
applying these techniques to your charts
so we're on the S&P 500 here as everyone
knows we should know this has been
trending to the upside for several years
now and this trend analysis works quite
well even on this market it's not a
forex market but it's a price it's a
market that exhibits price action and
price action is the same across the
majority of markets in existence
including crypto for that matter so let
me start out by replaying this market
from where it is you see we're in a
period of consolidation here but then we
get a break and close out of this
consolidation so we have our
first one two three move yep we have an
impulsive move higher pullback and then
another impulsive move higher out of
this period of consolidation and so if
we do not get a break and close below
this low before we get a break and close
above this high then we have a bullish
trend in market so let's continue and
see what happens
waiting for a significant haul back
there we go I'll cast that as a
significant pullback so we've made our
one-two-three move here and now we're
pulling back until this market breaks
and closes below this low we are
anticipating it
continuing higher and breaking and
closing above this high first so let's
see how that plays out
and that we have it we have a new
impulsive move higher we're waiting on a
significant pullback and then we can
start drawing out our next low and high
I'd class that as a significant pullback
sits three red candles in a row so the
way I draw this out is we have this one
two three move pullback we've made this
low we did not break and close below it
and then we had an impulsive move higher
the broken close above this high then we
had a pullback and then we made a new
high so let's continue the marker for
and see what happens here very
interesting you can see that we made a
new high from this low and then we had a
bit of a panic selling situation here it
looks like but look what happened here
we did not close below this previous low
see and just like that in the previous
example on euro dollar what we have
right here is an old-fashioned stop-loss
hunt the people have been trailing their
stops below this low market movers know
that they push the market below there to
absorb all the orders down here and now
until we get a close below this low the
market is likely to continue higher from
here so let's see what happens there we
go
we've got a new high formed so this
trending market is still intact
until we break and close below this low
so that we have our this I would
consider this a significant pull back
because we had to read candles in over
decent-size in the context of this move
and then we made a new high
so now until this market breaks and
closes below this load what are we
expecting that's right we're expecting
the market to continue higher I know I'm
repeating myself here but this is
trading and this is consistent
rules-based trading anyway it's not very
exciting I'll be the first to admit that
but clearly it works and if you want to
make money in the markets you've got to
forget about excitement focus on what
works and this works and that's what
should continue to work ok very
interesting there you go see we had a
few more stop-loss hunts but we did not
break in close below this low we had
some wicks tests there but none of these
candles closed below this load so the
bullish trend is still intact
we had our pullback into this low and
then what did we do we went into trend
continuation higher now we have another
significant pullback but until this
market can take out these lows and close
below them we have a bullish trend
so this pullback here let's see how this
unfolds there you have it we've
continued into new highs
we had a pullback that did not break and
close below these lows and then after
testing these lows the market continued
higher into trend continuation so you
can see there are multiple opportunities
to take advantage of this trend analysis
just on this chart alone and if you drop
down to a four-hour chart I'm sure that
there were several opportunities a
bullish engulfing candle right there
straight off this zone double bottom in
here off this previous low now here the
candles did close below the low but this
is on the 4-hour chart not the daily
chart remember that
so this occurred during the daily
session and we had a nice big wick
rejection with a bullish engulfing
kettle great long opportunity right
there to profit off all of the people
who were trapped short and follow the
big money who just wiped out everyone
stop losses below this low so there's
just a few examples how you can use this
trend analysis to identify training
opportunities
not to mention all of the opportunities
that occur within these swings so you've
got flag patterns that form that you can
trade breakouts up you've got pullback
setups such as this here you see you've
got a bullish engulfing candle now if I
throw on my ultimate pullback indicator
some of you watching this trial members
and paid users of my ultimate pullback
indicator this trend analysis that I'm
showing you is exactly how I trade this
pullback indicator I'm giving away a
little bit of secret sauce here for you
non-paying members but for paid members
of my pullback indicator I'm going to go
into great detail about how I pursue
trade this indicator profitably this is
a perfect example of a trading
opportunity that I would take based on
this daily analysis so I think that'll
do it for this video I think I've got
over enough examples here in situations
to give you a pretty firm understanding
of how I read trend you can see here
that once these higher timeframe trend
continuation swings begin kicking in
there's just so many ways to take
advantage of it flag patterns everywhere
you've got pullback opportunities wedges
all kinds of ways to take advantage of
this trend analysis using this trend
analysis to determine your intraday
trading bias your directional bias can
be an extremely effective way of trading
the markets with a high winrate high
probability high risk reward trades you
can capture some fantastic profits out
of these markets with very tight stop
losses in many cases this analysis
applies to all markets I trade all
currency pairs all time frames I hope
