hey everyone welcome to another video by
simply learn in this video we will be
discussing about raspberry pi projects
the raspberry pi has a wide range of
uses
the microcomputer has grown to
accomplish many odd activities in
addition to many standard tasks
raspberry pi was created with the intent
of allowing people to play with the
circuit board and to aid in the
development of new computing skills
the internet is huge amount of
information about the raspberry pi's
various applications and projects
as well as recommendations on how to
execute them
we will go over a few projects that
demonstrate the microcomputer's wide
range of capabilities
this video will show you the most
popular and useful projects but before
we begin make sure you have subscribed
to our youtube channel and clicked on
the bell icon so you never miss an
update from simple
so without any further ado let's get
started
the first project is web server
the raspberry pi serves as a web server
for multiple users
there are numerous web server packages
to choose from however in the most
circumstances the raspberry pi's
performance is insufficient for reliably
hosting large amount of dynamic online
content
instead the mini computer is
significantly better suited for local
testing environment simple static
websites with low visitor accounts on
the other hand might be hosted on
raspberry pi server
scanner server
setting up your raspberry pi as a
scanner server using same is a terrific
way to bring your old scanner up to date
instead of purchasing a wi-fi capable
scanner you can use a device like
raspberry pi 0 to provide that
capabilities scanner access now easy is
the acronym for same this program serves
as a standardized method of gaining
access to the scanners
xbox cloud gaming on raspberry pi
microsoft's xbox cloud gaming service
allows you to stream various video games
from their servers to another device
in this project we will be streaming
these games from the xbox cloud gaming
service to the raspberry pi
using the chromium web browser you can
broadcast xbox cloud gaming to your
raspberry pi in a reasonably simple
manner
this project will even show you how to
turn your raspberry pi into pure xbox
cloud gaming machine
the xbox cloud gaming service isn't the
only game streaming option for your
raspberry pi you can also broadcast
games to use pi using google's gaming
service
game console
we can turn your raspberry pi into a
retro gaming console also we can now
simulate practically any classic game
from 1970s to the 1990s using this
little computer
retropie a piece of software that solves
all of your emulation needs is now
available it's simple piece of software
to set up and it also offers a user
friendly interface
you may now play old games with retropie
you can use any raspberry pi model for
this project however the raspberry pi 4
model such as the raspberry pi model 4b
that is 4gb is strongly recommended
remote control 3d printer
octoprint which is one of the most well
known 3d printing program can also be
used on raspberry pi this software lets
you collect statistics and even monitor
your 3d printer from afar
this software lets you collect
statistics and even monitor your 3d
printer from afar
you can now control your 3d printer
remotely rather than using an sd card
aside from that you can connect a webcam
to a 3d printer to monitor the progress
of your printing
you will need a wi-fi adapter like the
model tl
wn725n to make your 3d printer work
because you will need to connect it to
the internet
language translator
this project necessitates some coding
and programming experience
we can utilize the google translate
library or any other python translating
tool to make this project much easier
you will need to know how to set up text
to speech speech recognition translation
apis and so on because this project has
many layers
overall it's still a worthwhile project
that you can do with your raspberry pi
and add to your achievements of
raspberry pi projects
security camera
you may have observed that different
raspberry pi models are compatible with
different camera modules
the raspberry pi 8 megapixel camera
module for example is only compatible
with raspberry pi 1 2 and 3 versions
you may now make your own security
camera for your home with this camera
model another advantage of this project
is that you can add whatever other
features you like
for example we can access video feeds
from afar and have them immediately
uploaded to a server for backup
a number of package or library
prerequisites are already available on
the internet on your raspberry pi you
can simply download or alter it
wi-fi extender
a wi-fi extender is another simple
project it's a low cost and effective
solution to increase wifi range
if you have a bad wifi signal in your
garden or even your room you may utilize
your raspberry pi to boost your signal
it's an excellent substitute for
commercial wi-fi repeater furthermore
because this is a diy project you can
always alter it and add new features
because this job has already been
completed by many people you can just
search the internet for the finest and
most convenient way to complete it
running android tv on raspberry pi
android tv is specialized version of
google's famous mobile operating system
it has a revised interface that better
accommodates the horizontal nature of
television screens
because the operating system is better
suited to white horizontal screens and
remote controls it's the best option for
connecting the pi to your tv the google
play store also gives you access to many
downloadable apps
the most significant difficulty with
running android tv on the raspberry pi
right now is that builds lack hardware
video decoding and encoding capabilities
the pi 4 mod will be pi 400 and the
compute module 4 are the only devices
that can run android tv
running zoom on the raspberry pi
we can utilize the feature to set up
meetings so that people can readily
connect with you
the individual hosting the meeting on
the other hand will need their own zoom
account
the person who creates the meeting has
the authority to determine who is
allowed to speak and share resources
such as the computer screen
with the free plan you can connect up to
100 additional individuals for total of
40 minutes because the raspberry pi does
not contain any arm binaries it is
difficult to run zoom on it
we will use a handy piece of software
called box 86 to get around this
box 86 is an emulation program that
transforms 86 instructions to arm
instruction set
which the raspberry pi recognizes
raspberry pi bluetooth speakers
you may greatly expand the capabilities
of your raspberry pi by connecting it to
a set of speakers
this project gives you the opportunity
to stream audio directly to any vintage
speakers or hi-fi system making them
more modern
we can add support for apple airplay
spotify connect and synchronize multiple
room audio to raspberry pi in addition
to bluetooth audio
we are going to utilize a ballina image
named balinas sound to bring all of this
extra capabilities to our raspberry pi
this instruction from balina greatly
simplifies the setup process and should
lessen the chances of making mistakes
home assistant using raspberry pi
home assistant is an open source home
automation program that was created
using raspberry pi based device the
software was created with the goal of
protecting your privacy and retaining
control in the hands of the user
you can monitor the status of all of
your devices in your house with the home
assistant you can even automate your
interactions with them
we can program home assistant to turn on
all of the lights automatically when it
gets dark and you're at home when you
cast a movie on your chromecast you can
even program it to dim the lights in
your giving room
raspberry pi is an excellent platform
for home automation it's compact
inexpensive has many networking
functions and consumes little power if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free

minecraft using raspberry pi
for this project we need to install a
custom version of minecraft designed
just for raspberry pi minecraft pi
edition is a name of this version of
minecraft
this version of minecraft is much older
than the current version it does however
have an advantage it is entirely free
additionally this version of minecraft
includes a python library for
interacting with the game environment
so with that we have reached the end of
