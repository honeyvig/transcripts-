navigating through being a tech
Enthusiast to a dynamic product manager
I have had my share of challenges but
the Zeal and thirst for knowledge and
drive to excel kept me
going my curiosity to learn and bring
out the Best in Me pushed me to upskill
which led me to take up the pspo
certification offered by
simply this not only enhanced my skills
further but changed my approach to
Leading projects thanks to doing this
certification which has allowed me to
blend my technical expertise with
customer Centric Innovation leading us
to launch different products
successfully after completing my pspo
certification I got to switch to a new
job my name is Aman Sunil rasurar I a
product manager and this is my
journey I am proud simply Anum and I
stay in gav Arana I was very fortunate
my childhoods were very good I was very
curious about science and technology I
used to take part in different kind of
alumia I'm an IT engineer from pun
University post that I did my pgdm from
Institute of rural management Anand and
from there I was selected at Care Health
insurance as a product manager it was a
campus placement and that is how my
product Journey started uh so I was a
complete fresher when I started my
career at a Care Health insurance as a
product manager so it took me almost 6
months to transition into the product
role but at some point of time I just
wanted to understand how the product
manage manager Works across the domain
so that is why I wanted to upscale and
that is why I was looking for a
certification for that to help me
understand in all these things and help
me upscale in that
areas a colleague of mine suggested
simply learn to me uh she has also let
me know that a senior of ours has done
the CL course from Simply learn as well
so I had a discussion with the person at
simply learn he had told me all the
different things that will be there in
the program I had a very detailed
conversation he has answered my question
as well at the initial level I did not
have any doubts about the program and
which has helped me a lot and I think it
was a very good first impression for me
and I zeroed in on the
course the first thing which I learned
from the program was agile and how
different organization have implemented
agile and modified agile to their own
will but the actual core fundamentals of
agile are actually missing from all
these organizations currently at the
time uh for the organization I was
working with so there we tried to find
out uh the current setup of aile that
was going on uh these things are helping
me a lot in doing all the things which a
product owner product manager should do
and the second thing I took from the
course was the roles and
responsibilities and the core area of
functioning for a product manager and
product owner so these two things have
stayed with me and is helping me today
as well in my previous organization also
the roles and responsibilities I was
handed over it was sort of a technical
product manager kind of a role and uh so
I did not have a very holistic
experience so the learning experience
was very good all the things which I
wanted to learn and that were present in
the brocher were taught to us it was
taught to us in a very simpler way so
that we can understand it and we can
grasp the concepts apart from the topics
that were in the syllabus we just had
the discussion about what is the current
industry scenario and all that and the
discussions were very good and uh I
think the teaching material which was
provided and the future references were
given to us for the reading purposes it
has helped me scor a very good score in
the final
examination after the certification I
was looking for a new job as well so
this certification has helped me in
switching out the job so it has also
helped me in the interview process so
all these things I think are the
takeaways for me from the uh
certification so someone who wants to
transition into a product role the one
advice that I would like to give them is
once you put down the efforts once you
start getting your headset once you
start understanding the things you'll
absolutely fail in love with the product
management domain I have fell in love
with the product management domain as
well so yeah I would like to work more
and more into it someone who wants to
come into this domain I would say come
with an open mind you would love it but
you'll have to put in the effort once
you put in the effort it will be very
easy for you
