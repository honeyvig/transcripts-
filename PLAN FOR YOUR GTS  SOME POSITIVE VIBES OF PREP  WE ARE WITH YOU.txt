okay right so clear with the faces so
now I'll be going to the schedule of
mock exams uh what to be done and I'm
not going to keep a heavy heavy tips I'm
going to keep it very simple very simple
tips for you how to approach how to
handle
okay
so uh so this year for your batch 2023
neat examination so we are planning to
have more than 25 25 GTS okay so more
than 25 GTS so as of now I have given
schedule for 25 GTS okay and today we
are done with 8th GT also so till Grand
examination 8 okay uh examination 8 I
have given in the brackets like what
subjects I have focused on a particular
on GT so gt123 you have everything and
clearly we have mentioned in the bracket
focused on biochemistry what are the
subjects which are included okay if you
are not done do it prepare some
customized schedule with some
modifications according to this do it
okay that is clear right you may you may
skipped out of eight you may skip some
three or four you may skip some two
because you have some personal stuff
issues on the on the particular day or
you may not be clear with the subjects
okay but make sure you do them in the
sequence because the grand examinations
are prepared in such a way to improve
your confidence and their link to one to
two to two to three three to four for
example eight to nine seven to eight
they are prepared in such Heaven it is
something like uh how you will learn the
basics of Dentistry and Medicine in the
first second years followed by the
application part in third and fourth
year can you can you directly uh jump
into final year without reading first
and second year subjects can you
understand finally or directly is it
possible
right and even the grand examinations of
MDS conqueror are prepared in such a way
okay because we take lots of time lots
of analysis lots of things to prepare or
come out with a grand examination it's
not like randomly uh picking something
doing something okay that's not what we
do because we have a clear-cut proper
analysis about uh why a question why we
are keeping a grant exam why you have to
keep Grand exam like this I have a
hundred percent analysis over this
because I sit hovers hours just to come
out with a proper analysis because that
is going to help you it is something
like how you read first second year
followed by third and fourth years okay
same I you are skipping three and four
and if you're giving five if you're
skipping six seven and two days eight
and you are giving nine your scores will
not improve they may improve but they
don't show drastic improvement if you're
following my comments at least from now
and give the examinations in a sequence
without skipping them without analyzing
them without following the command
suggestions given by me
okay given by me you may not show
extraordinary Improvement in the scores
you will state that uh at that mean
score but if you want to show some
extraordinary Improvement in this course
uh and confidence
you need to follow my suggestions and
you need to implement them and give
exams on time and analyze them properly
right this is this is a promise that you
are giving me right
can I take this promise
can I take this promise I want you to
respond
that this is something like a last
Warrior something like bahubali or last
war or something like have you seen 300
movie
English movie is the 300.
very small uh that is a very small
Kingdom very small Kingdom the
population is very very less yeah yeah
right Spartans so it's something like a
300 movie Do or Die
that's an extraordinary movie but they
will lose the war but with a pride okay
so that is the reason why I'm telling
it's it's like a final war no more
preparations again I don't want you to
come back conquer sir I will again next
year we will join that next next year we
will join after marriage I will join
after having two kids I will join no
stories this is the last Do or Die
finish it get ranks go join okay right
so this is the plan and I want okay so
so many of you have promised me and I
strongly believe that you will stand on
your words okay so now the plan is
we are already done with eight
examinations along with today's
examination
clear
in these eight examinations
four examinations
are module examinations
right so these are model examinations
means focusing on five subjects or six
subjects so four examinations are
focusing on five to six subjects each
and there is one examination focusing on
three subjects
you can see them I'll clearly mention
focusing on
and there is one examination focusing on
2021
2020 2000
19 2018 repeats
so how many are done four done five done
six done so the leftovers leftover two
exams are on all subjects
so whenever it is not mentioned in
Brackets anything means any question
from Any Corner can come in the exam so
are you clear about these eight exams
I'm this is very specifically I'm
talking uh addressing the people who are
not done with these eight exams
eight exams
four are model exams I'll give you uh
clearly mentioned in the in at the name
of the question paper what subjects are
included and one subject is on one exam
is on three subjects
and one subject is on only repeats of
2021 to 2018 and two two GTs are
including all the subjects okay right so
clear so now coming to GT from gt9 so
gt9 is exclusively on 2017 repeats
okay so this is day after tomorrow so
day after tomorrow you have gt9 so I
want every one of you after this class
go back and start 2017 repeats so 2017
is basically eight sessions
eight sessions are there okay so it is
the exam was done on eight days so you
have so many questions only here where
you have so many questions is 2017 2018
again 240 2019 240 2020 240 2021 240 20
to 240 2017 you have more questions so
it's a good good year to revise so many
things for example in every subject you
have minimum 50 to 60 Questions so you
are revising 50 to 60 Concepts it's a
good revision so either you can pick
2017 from near as bad one
or if you don't have nearest Bath one
you can do from Dental pulse so after
synopsis of every subject the first neat
repeat starts from
2017-2018 you have 40 50 questions do
them
so you will have a question paper on
exclusively 2017 meat repeats 2017 mean
repeats turns to be around thousand
questions so you are going to do the
Thousand questions after this class
followed by 20 second you are going to
do that is tomorrow and followed by 23rd
morning you are going to do give this
exam this exam will not take more time
because you're already very familiar
with the questions everything is a known
question
so clear with 23rd examination
I want your response so that I'll
explain what to be done for the next
exams
okay so 20
2017 repeats okay it's exclusively 2017
repeats okay then comes the next one
okay then comes the next one 20 sir once
you're done with exam on 23rd you have
24th
okay 23rd half day will be there
you have 24th is there 2050 is there 26
is there
okay and 27 okay so you have till 27.
you have two exams on same things that
is clinical
clinical marks clinical mark one
clinical Mark 2 that is your gt10 and GT
level
so it's only on the clinical subjects
what are the clinical subjects eight
subjects which are in the final year
plus your oral pathology because oral
pathology is integrated with oral
medicine some including oral pathology
as a clinical subject I'm not including
general medicine and general surgery
here
guys is it clear
so means after 23rd exam the next five
exams you have to focus exclusively on
the clinical questions all your final
year questions plus your oral pathology
done clear okay so logic here is Sir how
we can do that eight subjects sorry
eight subjects are there how we can do
so most of you are already done with
module four
so how many subjects are included in the
module for
you have your oral Radiology included in
the module for your perio is included in
the module for communities included in
the module for Arthur is included in the
model for pedo is included in the module
for so most of you are done with out of
this eight or nine subjects you are done
with one two three four five you're done
with half of the clinical subjects
recently only
clear is it clear you're done with half
of the clinical subjects recently only
so the left leftover half you have to do
in this upcoming uh four to five days
and along with this you have to give two
mock exams that is clinical mock one and
clinical mock two so
so here along with these two exams there
is one bonus exam
what is that bonus exam okay
just a second
in just a minute
hope the screen is visible
okay so apart from these two clinical
mock exams there is one more clinical
bonus mock exam which is present in your
mock exam folder in inict inict you have
one clinical mock okay so that you can
consider it as a practice not as uh
testing your knowledge you can consider
that as a practice something you can do
so you have one more clinical Mark okay
for practice so totally you have three
clinical marks three into 240 that's
going to turn around 720 questions for
your clinical exposure done so once
you're done with 27th exam and after the
exam you analyze the things you have 28
29 30 31 again you have four to five
days where you can focus on basics
you can focus on Basics so you have
Basics mach3 Basics mark four that can
be considered as gt12 and gt13 along
with this you have one more bonus exam
that is present in your inict that is
Basics inict mock examination so clear
with clear with them
clear with January
so we are starting February
so February we are basically jumping
into exclusively mock examinations
this mock examination is something like
go give exam analyze the questions where
you are going wrong okay learn something
move to the next one give analyze more
next one give analyze move it is
something like keep on flowing keep on
giving so you have 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25 and if you require more
I'll try to give you more okay so plan
here is
okay once you're done with Basics and
once you're done with the clinical marks
what to be done in the last one month is
completely customized it is completely
customized to you how it is completely
customized to you for example if you ask
me sir which which subject you are weak
at I will tell I am weak at General
Anatomy because I am not much focused
when I'm reading General Anatomy I never
complain that I'm going to week at pedo
foreign
among the clinical subjects uh I may be
weak at medicine not general surgery or
maybe weak at uh physiology not
biochemistry and maybe weak at uh
microbiology not General pathology and
maybe we get dental histology compared
to dental Anatomy something like that
you have to decide which subject you
have to be which subject you are
weakened okay so you have to give a
rating to your uh subjects and divide
the subjects into two part subjects
which you are strong at subjects which
you are weak at okay so there is two
methods of reading here like like for
example going to the I mean like reading
all these things
the wrong answers is one method okay and
what you are going to do on February 1st
so that you are going to give a mock
examination on February 2nd okay you are
going to give a mock exam February 2nd
what to be done on February 1st so in
this you have to pick some weak subject
which you really believe that you are
wicked so I I strongly recommend all of
you don't always go to pharmacology
don't tell pharmacology we get
pharmacology we could I'll read
pharmacology you keep on reading
pharmacology pharmacology will not give
scoring
so decide
a combination of subjects so every day
you have to touch
four subjects
so if you are for example reading 12
hours a day so split your day
into
Parts what are they three hours three
hours three hours three hours so make
sure you read one subject in three hours
one subject in three hours one subject
in three hours one subject in three
hours and make sure don't read entire
subject
sir how I can finish enter subject in
three hours I am asking you to read
where you are weakened
everything I can answer those questions
I am weak at classifications I am weak
at members so such things I am going to
identify and I'm going to read them
Dentistry I'm going to read something
like biochemistry I'm going to read PP
because go back revise the pp books and
come back and followed by giving gt14
that is your mock examination file mock
examination 5 is going to tell you where
your weekend it's going to point right
Baba you're weak at this place now two
or three questions came from anemia's
you lost so it is going to indirectly
tell you that go back after the exam
read anemius go back after the exam read
some part of general medicine that part
is anemia that part of physiology that
part is anemia so it's going to tell you
where your weak at means a topic you are
weak in a particular subject
or if you are not able to decide that
and if your scores are not really
extraordinary then you can go back to
checklist to be done
for that subject or
for a group of subjects clear
is it clear checklist we have already
discussed we have started the session
with the checklist itself
clear
I'm very happy I told 300 movie exactly
300 students are there online okay it's
wonderful hopefully we'll give a good
fight
this 2023 neet examination
okay so now if you you ask me so in this
session
uh this again the session will be
uploaded as a recorded version not on
the YouTube channel it will be uploaded
on the website okay in your quick
revision folder okay in in two video
sessions so what I have discussed in
this session first one is checklist to
be done if you are not on track and if
you are not scoring more than 500 still
fighting in 300s 400s okay not hitting
that 500 mark this is the checklist that
you are to finish first okay next one
how to solve these mock examinations
this is how you have to keep a book and
you have to solve the mock examinations
the third one what to be done the
principles for negative marking okay so
I have discussed about four principles
try to do that try to apply the four
principles next how many phases your
final exam has to be done or your
regular mock examinations has to be done
these are the two phases the third phase
is an accent accessory phase and this is
the schedule okay for your mock
examinations and everything now if you
have any doubts you you can ask me
I'll try to give a simple answer I don't
want to make things complicated because
we are already in a complicated
situation so I don't want to make I
don't want to add any more complications
so let's have a positive funny
stress-free talk for the next 15 to 20
minutes if you have anything in your
mind you're open to post it on the chat
on the chat box in personal or openly or
you can you can post it to my WhatsApp
don't
differentiate like that okay so whatever
you feel comfortable you proceed I don't
want to uh I don't want to Incline
myself to one one area because lastly I
was talking to the Toppers uh most of
the students from other institutes they
were telling that the part A is so
difficult
but MDS Congress students coming out and
telling that the party is so easy for
them because uh we focus more on part
here during the revision schedule so
they feel more comfortable with party so
I don't want to differentiate party and
Part B so whatever you comfort whatever
you are comfortable you can proceed you
can proceed with that particular part so
no uh particular discrimination I want
to give sir for today's exam what is
Optimum score uh the today's exam
Optimum score anything above 500 550 yes
it's good according to me basic mocks
are on other than the clinical subject
yes I told clinical subjects are all
eight subjects plus your oral pathology
so Basics are including on first year
second year and third year subjects of
general medicine and general surgery
where are the repeats of 2017 Dental
pulse Dental pulse after every subject
they have clearly mentioned neet repeats
2017-2018 every subject is having
how to mail DCA regarding the
internships
already completed
that is not question to be posted here
last few days should be revising
everything like image basis or some
Concepts focusing on the last five you
are doing repeats every day you are
doing repeats on the website so don't
specify yourself what to be done on a
process in this 38 days once you start
the preparation seriously the
preparation only will tell what to be
done so yesterday I have given you a
checklist of 15.
I have given a checklist of 50 okay I
don't know how many of you added few
more checklists to this so This
checklist has to be done in the last
five days
these checklists we keep on adding the
topics to the checklist and those has to
be done
what will be included in the basics
already covered
few days ago I'm told to split the day
and read strong and weak subjects
simultaneously till February 1st shall
we read what is necessary for GTS or
GTs are on Grant examinations means GTs
are going to cover all the subjects
whatever I'm told and whatever I told is
same GT means it's focusing on all the
subjects
so you have to read everything look the
methodology of reading is identifying
the weak topic and reading is one
methodology or identifying the assuming
that entire subject you are weak and
reading the entire subject is one
methodology so what I strongly believe
is no one is going to be weak in a
subject people are going to be weak in
it in a particular Topic in a particular
number of Topics in a subject no one is
weak in all the all the topics in all
the subjects here so you may be weak in
a particular topic or a particular
Concept in a particular subject so my
suggestion is writing rather than
reading the entire subject I'm asking
you to hold the topics be strong in the
topics
for example you have your room freshly
washed and there is some mink or some
something which is splitted at a
particular area now you are going to
clean the entire room or you are going
to clean that particular area only my
suggestion is clean that particular area
because we don't have time to clean the
entire room so identify those areas and
read them
I don't give previous mock examination
should I continue with upcoming mock or
should I start from the grand
examination one so my suggestion is you
you do you try to do the things
simultaneously you try to finish the
previous ones also in the alternative
days okay it's not about scoring it
about learning the concepts which are
important the concepts will be repeated
in the upcoming Grand examinations in a
different format okay thereby if you get
good scores in the grant examinations
your confidence will be increased so it
is going to indirectly play with the
concepts as well as your confidence so
that is the reason why the sequence is
important during this last 30 days
should I read the synopsis for every
subject as I'm not able to recollect it
I have given you the checklist to be
done okay
first you finish this checklist once
you're done with the checklist okay and
once you are fine with the checklist
we'll decide what to be done next first
I want you to finish this
where you will upload this recorded
version we'll discuss about that any
tips to revise Basics and how to be
accurate
revision is going every day revision is
growing on everything possible on the
group same checklist I want you to go to
the checklist how many mcqs should be
skipped minimum we don't have any such
Theory uh keep posting ranks so that we
can analyze where we are in the exam yes
of course but you you can in the website
you can check it you can check it your
rank what is your rank you cannot see
others rank but you know what is your
rank and you can know how many students
has attempted that particular question
at that time we should complete
untouched subjects first or just for CDs
how many years we are going to complete
untouched subjects untouched subjects
will be always untouched that's what I'm
telling there's nothing called as
untouched subjects there is something
called as untouched topics in a subject
so identify them and try to do them
is
can you please keep posting checklist
topics regularly
it helps to revise the topics that
sometimes we miss sure I will do that
can you please repeat the checklist part
which I have missed you have to check in
the recorded I cannot repeat it now
with the fear of less scoring don't want
to give
today's mock exam you don't want to give
only today's mock exam or you don't want
to give the final exam also Fear Factor
is there for everyone even I have Fear
Factor whether to keep an exam or not
for you so Fear Factor with keeping Fear
Factor and skipping the exam is a very
bad quality because this is not a final
exam if you have an option of skipping
the final exam everyone will skip the
final exam okay right so think about
this that's a bad quality which you need
to change
sure I'll post the checklist
you have to decide what is a bad score I
have given an Optimum score for this
paper 440 for your preparation if you
feel bad score then you should come and
talk with the mentors how to improve it
I have already told what to be done to
improve your scores on the videos
in the grand test how to keep an
ornament like manager
go go to a net center nearby and try to
give exam you try to give an exam uh
preferably in a new area then then you
are going to create that environment
your comfortable is sitting in your home
in your place in your Institute where
every day you're being exposed that you
cannot replicate the final exam in our
ornament should we read synopsis from
Dental pulse or from PP books both
whatever you have done previously try to
do that
sir will the basic exam include of basic
examines only basic subjects first year
second year subjects in third year
subjects you will have medicine and
surgery general surgery and general
medicine
do the checklist first do the checklist
anyone first do the checklist
how to avoid negative marking
already discussed on the video next
question
any questions you have message me on the
WhatsApp
yes I'll be with you don't worry
24 into 7 only one job here
no patience nothing no family no friends
only with you this 38 days are more
important for me rather than for you
because I'm very very serious about my
Student Success
I'm very very serious about that I don't
know how serious you are but I am so
serious
I have not given Grand examinations till
now shall I continue with ongoing this
question was already addressed
yes recorded version will be kept that
should not be a great doubt here
actually I'm getting afraid because I
did not touch seven subjects you have 38
days seven subjects is not a big deal
you can do it prepare a schedule prepare
a plan come out with a plan you can do
it
yes this is already addressed
anything I need to please post
checks before every GTS I'll I'll
definitely post the checklist
and I'll add this to the 50 to 50 topics
okay keep on adding uh to this 50 topics
list so that we can revise all these uh
checklists uh in the last five days
before the exam
I have been preparing it's not good but
as I'm confident in subjects and not at
all good in other subjects should I keep
focusing on subjects you split the day
split the day into maybe uh maybe 20 uh
2080 okay and try to focus 20 percentage
of time on the subjects which you are
not confident at and the rest of 80
percent is you can follow the group
schedule
what is the time limit we should
allocate
uh
each question there is no time limit
that's what I have discussed with the
questions in Phase One and phase two so
phase one questions will be done first
phase to phase three questions will take
time so no there is no time limit for
each and every question
most welcome motivation is enough for
Preparation yes yes I'll be there
it should be it should be like a
like a movie or like a bahubali or a kg
of part two or probably that is coming
we are going to rock I'm very confident
can I completely leave a community which
Community conquer Community you know you
should never leave a subject here this
is this requires a balanced preparation
and Community is one of the loving
subject why should you leave Community
coming it is easy you can do it
can you please repeat how to prepare for
mock exams again briefly there is a
network tissue recorded version will be
operated you can see that
it's okay to leave 40 questions in the
exam
I have discussed that how many questions
you have to leave basing upon your
preparation 40 questions to leave an
exam is not an open question that I
should answer addressing all the
students so it varies with the
preparation level I'm losing marks in
the wrong mcqs what should I do you have
to correct you have to revise and you
have to improve the right answers the
answer is there itself I'm losing marks
in wrong questions
right Mark them right so you'll get that
marks I have discussed about the
negative Market please do check it the
subjects which I did not finish should I
read from synopsis or learn from the
videos
both
what topics should be done microbial is
very simple yeah it comes sterilization
Immunology
uh and it contains bacteriology virology
mycology parasitologist so it's only
five topics so you decide uh the five
there will be like five eight bacteria
which are important four viruses which
are important three fungus which are
important three paracetology which are
important
foreign
you should answer it
you should answer it if you are not
answering even after revising there is
some problem with the preparation for
that you need to talk with your Mentor
personally can you please repeat how to
prepare for Math exams really
Aishwarya I am going to upload this
recorded version here
again I can't waste my time like 20 25
minutes I can't waste on repeating the
things which are already done
exclusively for you because of your
issue with the network I'll upload this
recorded version you check it off
