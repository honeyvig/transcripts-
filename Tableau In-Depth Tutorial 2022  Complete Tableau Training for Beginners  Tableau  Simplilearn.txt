foreign
in this session we will start with
certain exercises which we will perform
in Tableau in order to understand some
basic concepts
now in order to learn Tableau the basic
first step is to import a sample data so
in our case what we have done is we have
imported a sample Superstore which is in
Excel format a sample superstore.xl
which has three worksheets in it orders
people and returns so by importing this
data into Tableau first of all we will
create relationships between these
sheets in order to identify who all have
placed orders and how many people have
returned the orders we will do some
analysis on the orders placed by certain
set of people and Order returned by a
certain set of people
now as we have imported uh the sheet we
will make certain joins so the first
step is to drag the orders
table the order sheet on the
relationship canvas here okay and you
can see the data sample data the first
100 rows over here
okay then now we need to create an inner
join with people's table between order
and people okay so if you see
it has automatically detected the field
names on which the inner join has to be
created so on the order side you have
region and on the right hand side which
is the people data you have also a
region okay so both these columns are
common and that's how we have made a
join between orders and people data
so if I close this box and go and check
the people's data
open
so see the region and the person these
two columns from the people table have
now been
joined with the orders table right so it
means that these are the orders in a
particular region which has been placed
by
in this region
let me show you the sample Superstore
Excel file now this is the structure of
the file you have a sample list of
transactions basically the orders which
are placed by customers
across multiple regions
south west of USA South Region west
region then you have a list of order IDs
which have been returned so basically
the order ID in the returns sheet
matches with those orders in the order
table
and then you have the people uh sheet in
which you have region
and a person associated with that region
the sales person associated with that
region okay so basically when we are
combining joining orders with people we
are joining that
which orders
belongs to which region and who's the
sales person associated with it so what
we have done over here is we have made a
inner join means all the orders should
belong to a particular region and that
region is in the people's sheet
and then in the second step
now we will make a
left join between returns and orders
not inner join we'll make a left join
between returns and orders and we will
make a join using the
order ID
okay so just edit this
click on left
and
select order ID as the join column now
what does left join means left join mean
is that consider all the orders from the
orders table and only consider the
orders from the return statement which
have data means which are returned
otherwise show null for the order IDs
which are not returned so if you see
this is the these are the two columns
from the return statement and these are
null because this is relevant to the
order IDs which are not returned okay
which has been accepted by the customer
but these are the orders for which you
see data in the returned and Order ID
column it means that these have been
returned
now with these joins in place please
save your book and now we have our
relations created in the
um
in the Tableau now we are ready to
create certain reports and extract
certain kpis using this relationship
model
now we'll move to sheet1
okay
and first we will place
state
and person on the rose
sheet okay
then
I'll go to my
numbers and
put the profit or the super State per
person how much profit I am making as a
company okay this is my goal to check
Now sort by highest to lowest so
California is giving me the maximum
profit of 76 381 then New York then
Washington so this is the sorted order
in which I have
listed my profit in descending order
now I can also check what are the number
of orders
placed
and check the distinct count
foreign
out of the total orders of 127 okay so
this is the number of total number of
orders which have been returned for
California is 127.
it's 16 29 so the sorted order is as per
the revenue as per the profit and this
is the details of the orders which have
been returned per state
so if you see for connected for a Kansas
there are zero returns
so you can also extract data
foreign
ERS and identify new rows using order
date so as and when new data is being
added you can
refresh it now say extract
and now you can save this information
profit
by state
and click save so this is the extraction
of this particular report which is
possible in tableau
so this is the first exercise which we
have completed
for
reviewing and analyzing the profit per
state highest to lowest and within that
per state what are the number of orders
which have been returned by all the
customers the distinct count of order
IDs which have been returned
now let's start our second exercise on
creating calculated fields in tableau
now in this exercise we will be doing
certain
activities like we will be creating a
set to show the states which have more
than 100 customers then we will be
creating a calculated field to show an
average sales per customer okay then we
will create a calculated field to show
the sales goals and then show emerging
and developing stage so these are the
four kpis which we have to derive
now the first thing we have our sample
Superstore data already imported and the
relationships created in a join with
people and left join with returns
now we have our sheet 2 in which we will
create the states a list of states which
has more than 100 customers
so what we have to do is we have to
click right click on the customer name
and click create set
okay
now we have to give the name as states
with 100 plus customers
and then go to the condition tab
select by field
and then apply condition as
count of customer name
greater than equal to
100
and click
ok
now we have this set created states with
100 plus customers
now to determine average sales by
customer we have to now create a
calculated field
so go to the analysis and click on
create calculate field
okay
now name it as
average
sales per customer
and now we will say average
we will use a
okay so we are saying that per customer
we are using a level of definition
function include which means that per
customer what is my average sales right
we've already used a function aggregated
function called average so we are saying
per customer give me the total and then
give me the average per customer so
we're going to click ok
now create another calculated field you
can also create from here
and name is as name it as sales goal
now in this we are going to type the
formula if
minimum
States
with 100 plus customers equal to true
then
sum of
sales
into 1.3
else
average sales per customer into
100 so me we are saying that
if the customer belongs to the set of
states with 100 plus customers then the
sales Target should be
1.3 times the actual sales as of today
else it should be 100 of the average
sales per customer
now let's create another calculated
field which we call as
emerging
or developing state
if distinct count
of customer name
is greater than equal to 100
then
the state is tagged as developing state
else it is called as
emerging state
okay so we have now three calculated
Fields average sales per customer
emerging or developing State and sales
goals
now we will use this in our
reporting
so we will drag sales goal under the
columns
and then I'll drop my state
so now this is the statewise sales goal
depending whether the state has 100 plus
customers or not
then add your customer name
make the measure as count distinct
and make it as discrete
okay so if you see this
we have the count of customers per state
and the
the sales goal
for that particular state
and now
I'll put my sum of sales the total sales
which I want
which is there per state
now go to show me and select
this particular chart
bullet graph
now to bring sales goals to column right
click on the sales access and select
swap reference line fields
now from your left hand panel drag and
drop emerging or developing State on the
color panel
okay so a merging state is the orange
one and the developing state is the blue
one
and save the sheet as
developing and the emerging States
so if you see this it's an emerging
State because its count is less than the
customer count is less than 100
its sales goal is
57384 but the actual sales is one nine
five one one okay
so now this is a developing State its
count is greater than equal to 100 and
its sales goal and its sales is exactly
the same it matches so that's why you
are saying the bar and the blue bar is
ending exactly where the vertical bar is
so what we are trying to depict is that
whether the state is going Beyond its
Target sales goal or it's behind it
and you can see that using this
particular vertical bar like for example
Michigan its sales goal is 71 952 but
its actual sales is seven six seven two
seven zero average sales so that's why
it is be above its Target
and it's a developing state
because it has more than 100 customers
so you can even sort
by the count of the uh customers higher
to lower so all your developing state
will grow from at the top and the
emerging States Will Group at the bottom
or you can sort by
the sales goal
so the orange bar is the sales goal or
the blue bar so depending what sales
goal
has been
derived for each state
hello and welcome to this new session on
tableau
now in this session we will talk about
how to prepare dashboards and how to
Interlink reports within the dashboard
so in order to start this session we
will first create couple of reports and
then include them in the dashboard and
then link them together
so for this session
as usual we are using the sample
Superstore data set for our
example
now first we will create a report where
we are gonna
show profit by region per region
so first we will drag the region
in the rows column and we will get all
the regions and
state
so we have all the states per region in
our report now and then we will drag
sales
and profit
so now we have our sales and profit
measures the column level
now just also drag now the region to the
color section so now we have each region
colored
the entire sales and profit per region
is distinguished by the different colors
Central is south and west
now
click on the
colors
now we want to show the labels using the
marks card okay so we want to show the
region
okay so we need to include the show the
marks labels just a second
foreign
so enable the labels
say show Mark labels
okay
so you have on the left this is the
profit and this is the total sales now
rename
this sheet as region and state analysis
report
okay
now let's create another worksheet
now in this sheet just drag the state
on the
marks card now automatically Tableau
will detect that you know you have
dropped a particular State and we have
the states of United States so it has
identified the state names and showed
you the identifiers of the states on the
map and automatically
identified the latitude and longitudes
which are generated by Tableau and given
you the markers on each and every state
now drag the sales measure to the color
panel
okay so now this is sales per state in
the color scheme with the color scheming
then now Drag The Profit to the size
so now each state you have the color the
profit and the sales
now you can edit the colors and you can
select
a particular scheme of colors and say
apply and okay so now you are able to
distinguish
the colors on the state
now after this
just rename the sheet as
profit by state
report
now create let's create another report
now in this report drag the subcategory
to the column section
and sales and profit measures in the
rows
okay
now click on the right click on the sum
profit pill and check dual access
now click right click on the profit
access and say synchronize access
now select some sales from the card
marks card and change the notation as
bar
and for profit change the notation as
line
so now this is a fair display of
sub category wise
sales and profit representation that
these are the sales and what is the
profit
now go to the marks all marks and drag
the category section
the
category section as the tooltip
okay so for each and every bar or line
item you should now see the category
also
save your report
and rename this now report as
sales
by and profit by sub category report
now let's create a new dashboard
now the reports which we have just now
created first our dashboard size let's
make it as automatic
okay then
let's show the dashboard title click
click on the dashboard title
now drag the reports which you have
created
profit by state
sales and subcategory Report
and region and
okay so you have all your three reports
in a single dashboard now
profit by state sales and profit by
subcategory and region by and state
analysis report now we will link these
reports so go to dashboard
click on actions
add an action called new filter
select Source sheet in the source sheet
dashboard to
only select region and state analysis
report
and in the Target sheet just deselect
region and state analysis
on the source sheet keep the Run action
on select and
click
ok
now whatever state you select over here
that particular state will be used as a
filter across both these reports so it
means in North Dakota you have all these
category sub categories being sold and
their Associated profit and on the map
profit by Straight report you can see
the North Dakota State being highlighted
or only selected and the relevant profit
and sales
okay so here is the total profit and
sales in the profit by state report and
in this sales and profit by sub category
report you have the breakup of the
profit and sales across the categories
similarly you can select any other state
and automatically the
filters will get applied automatically
see this Marine Main
okay
so with this we cover our example of how
to create multiple reports and then
connect them
or encapsulate them in a single
dashboard for a single view across all
these reports
