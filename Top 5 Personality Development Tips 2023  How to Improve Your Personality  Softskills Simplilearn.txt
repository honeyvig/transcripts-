to be a better listener
listening is an essential part of
communication which will help you see
the situation from the others
perspective most people do not listen
with the intent to understand they
listen with the intent to reply for
example if a student is eager to answer
a question but does not listen to them

them

you to share what you know and to
exchange your views with them like this
you can impress them or like this you
can impress them and get a good idea
about yourself then the third is develop
a positive attitude
start your day with some positivity such
as I love myself and I can do it I'm
healthy and I'm happy about it as 90 of
my emotions are decided by the way we
talk to ourselves throughout the day
since you have power over your facial
expressions you should always have a
happy attitude
because one bad morning might spoil your
entire day and the fourth one is have an
opinion the most boring thing in the
world is talking to someone with no
opinions if there is nothing to say
conversation will end straight away for

out in a conference room when your
manager is looking for your opinion your
personality might be affected by this
type of action don't be shy to put your
opinion forward you appear more
interesting and unique if you have a
unique idea or opinion and at the end we
will discuss be yourself
attempting to be a carbon copy of
someone else not only false black but
also reveals the lack of honesty so be
yourself since each of us is unique
expressing that uniqueness is what makes
us interesting with this we have reached
