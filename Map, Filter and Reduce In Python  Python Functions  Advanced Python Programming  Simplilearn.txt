hello and welcome to this session of
python today we are going to talk about
very specific functions which are very
popular in python programming language
map filter and reduce
so what's in it for you today let's
quickly take a glance
we're going to talk about map function
filter function and reduce function
we're going to see
the syntax which are applicable to these
functions and what benefits these
functions bring for us
during the programming in python so
we're going to see the syntax and we're
going to run certain examples for each
of these functions
so let me first just give you a
brief of what are the
syntax for these functions what are the
signatures what are the input parameters
required and then we will jump into the
jupyter notebook and run some examples
so what is a map function the map
function takes another function as an
input and the second input is a sequence
of iterables it could be a list it could
be a set it could be an array or
anything you want and it returns the
output after executing the function
which you have pass as a parameter on
each of the element of that iterable so
the function could add the values could
multiply could divide or any
mathematical operation you want to do or
even you can perform certain string
operations which we will take a look in
the examples but the idea is that you
want to apply the function on each and
every iterable item individually so the
map function helps you achieve that
also in our examples we will take a look
that you don't need to explicitly define
a function you can also use lambda
functions which are inline functions uh
so you don't need to
increase the line of code you can reduce
the lines of code by just writing the
function in line and that way it will
make it more simple
[Applause]
[Music]
the next function which we are going to
talk about is the filter function
now what is the purpose the purpose of
the filter function is to reduce the
size of the iterables based on the
condition which you will pass to the
filter function
so syntactically it is very similar to
map function but the only difference is
that you need to pass a function which
carries a condition for example you have
a set of iterables one two three four
five six seven eight nine and you want
the function to return values which are
greater than phi
so
your filter function should have a
condition which says
that the iterables
greater than 5 should only be returned
by this function
so that's why you have to make sure that
the filter function always have a
condition which is either true or false
so based on whatever condition matches
as true
the filter function will only return
those values as an output so we will
take a look
and the same
concept applies either you can make a
explicit function or you can apply
lambda function inline
the third function
which we are going to talk about is the
reduce function
the only difference between reduce
function and the other functions which
we talked about uh
the map and filter is that reduce
function always returns a single value
so it combines all the
values in the iterable your list your
array your set and returns a single
value so you can apply the mathematical
functions like for example you want to
add all the values in your write table
or you want to multiply so it will
multiply sequentially and give you the
output
and the same
concept applies over here you can have
lambda functions or explicit functions
also with one thing which you need to
remember is
that you need to use function tools
module
to to import the reduce function
so we will take a look at that while we
will be running certain examples
okay
so here we have so we will start by
running our examples so first we will
start with map
so let's start by
defining a very simple function
which adds
two values
right and returns you the added value
right
so in the next step
we will define a
list of iterables so here we have taken
an iterable list of
four items four six eight nine numbers
now
in this step
we will apply the map function now
please notice that we are sending two
parameters to this map function one is
the
function name which is add and the
list which is numbers
okay
now i'll print
the out
but it's an object so right it's not in
a readable format so i need to convert
the out object back to a list
and now i'll be able to print
and here is my expected output so i had
four numbers in my list which is four
six eight time and the map function have
has added the numbers to itself four
plus four six plus six eight plus eight
nine plus nine and so that's how you're
getting the output as expected
[Music]
now let's take a look at another example
we're going to redefine our list
and we are going to use now a lambda
function
instead of an explicit function which is
going to multiply
the numbers in my list within with
themselves
and we're gonna
print my out object
convert it back to a list
and then i'll print my
converted list object
and here you go this is my output 4
multiplied by 4 6 multiplied by 6 8
multiplied by 8 and 9 multiplied by 9
okay
so here in this example we have seen
about lambda function
now
we have been up performing mathematical
operation as i mentioned earlier we can
also perform certain string operations
so let's take an example
what i'm doing in this example is i'm
creating a map
and i'm just converting all my lowercase
strings to uppercase
and i'm just printing my list now
after
conversion so such kind of you know
string operations are also possible
let's take another example where we are
going to print the length
of each of the
string which is there in my list
and i'm using lambda function
and here it is
so now you can see the list
the length of each and every string
variable is three five six and seven
okay
so now these were the examples of map
object
map function now we will
talk about
filter
so let's start with a simple example so
as i mentioned the filter function
should help always have a condition
so let's create a
function which has a condition saying if
a is greater than 5 then return a
it means that you need
to only return numbers which are greater
than 5 in my list
so now i'm going to call this in my
filter function
so if you see the syntax here please
notice filter you pass the fill and the
list
and then you print the out object after
converting into the list
and only the numbers which are greater
than 5 are printed
now let's take a look at
a lambda function example rather than an
explicit function
the same example but now instead i'm
using a lambda function
and i'm going to print it
output should be the same
okay
so the
the only change is in the syntax of the
function definition here we have
explicit function and here we have a
lambda function output is the same
now let's take an example of
a string operation string filter what
kind of string filtering we can do
so
i have an example over here
so
what i'm going to do is i'm going to
have a list of string arrays
which is going to return me only those
strings which have e in them occurrence
of e okay
so i've created a function veggies with
e
and within this list of veggies peas
garlic ginger beetroot carrot i will
only get those string variable values
which have e in it
okay so i've got the result p is ginger
and beetroot
right and garlic and carrot have been
discarded
now let's run this similar example with
lambda function
where i'm saying that okay give me those
vegetables which have r in it so i'm
just gonna run this
and print my
mac
[Music]
okay and here is my expected output
garlic ginger beet root and carrot
so what have we noticed is that similar
to map filter function of course the
only difference is the function should
have a condition
which should return a true or false and
based on that the iterable list get
filters out
now
let's talk about
reduce
now as i mentioned
the first important thing is that
we
import the reduce function from function
tools okay
and then
we apply a
lambda function so we're going to start
off with just taking an example of
lambda so here is my list of four
elements 10 35 50 and 20 and i'm adding
the numbers in this list okay so so the
map function is not gonna the reduce
function is not going to add the numbers
to itself but to the subsequent number
in the list right
so what is the expected output right
expected output is 10
plus 35 45
plus 50 95 plus 20 115 so
what the reduce function has done is it
has added the numbers in the list
amongst themselves right in the orderly
fashion
now let's take another example instead
of addition we'll do a multiplication
okay
so here what we have done is we have
multiplied 9 by into 7 into 23 into 4
and we've got this answer
so this is another way of doing it
now instead of lambda function i'm just
going to show you a simple
um adding the numbers
and define a function where you add the
first and second number
and then
you pass the function name
to reduce so custom sum and the list
similar to what we had done for map and
filter
and now you can print the result
one thing to notice is that this result
is a single number you don't need to
convert it back to a list so you don't
need to do that transformation you just
simply print the result
and here it is 68 3 plus 4 plus 6
plus 9 plus 34 plus 12.
okay
so i think with these examples and the
basic understanding of these three
functions i hope you had a great
learning experience and i look forward
to connect with you guys again thank you
