data science is an interdisciplinary
field that uses scientific methods
processes algorithms and systems to
extract knowledge and insights from
noisy structured and unstructured data
and apply knowledge and actionable
insights from data across a broad range
of application domains data science is
related to data mining machine learning
and big data data science is a concept
to unify statistics data analysis
informatics and related methods in order
to understand and analyze actual
phenomena with data it uses techniques
and theorems drawn from many fields
within the context of mathematics
statistics computer science information
science and domain knowledge however
data science is different from computer
science and information science so we
bought you this video to get better
understanding of reader science hey
everyone welcome to yet another exciting
video from simply learn in this session
we will be discussing top 10 reasons to
learn data science in 2022 but before we
begin let me tell you guys that we have
daily updates on multiple technologies
so if you're a tech geek in a continuous
hunt for latest technological trends
then consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn so without further ado
let's get started with the session and
the first reason on the list is great
career opportunities
data scientists can work in a variety of
industries including i.t healthcare and
security and can have a variety of
professions and functions depending on
your skills you can work as a data
engineer data scientist or a big data
manager data science is a prominent
career option in today's data driven
environment since data scientists may
provide economic outputs for enterprises
data science provides a variety of
networking opportunities because it has
become one of the most popular careers
in recent years with many companies
actively recruiting data scientists and
the second reason is
great organizations
there are a lot of different positions
and roles available for data scientists
in various fields such as ide healthcare
and security you can work with great
organizations as a data engineer data
analyst or a data science manager
according to your qualifications in the
current data-driven world data science
is a popular carrier option since data
scientists can produce profitable output
for businesses data science offers you
various networking opportunities
since it has been one of the most
favorable jobs in the recent years with
many organizations actively recruiting
data science professionals
now let's go into the third reason
and the third reason is multiple jobs
data science is a never growing field of
study so while there are many practicing
data scientists in the field there is
still more demand than there is
competition it is still a growing job
when compared to other traditional i.t
positions therefore there is less
competition in data science that gives
you a chance to become prominent in a
short time
as can be inferred from the current
situation there is a gap between demand
and supply of data scientists since the
number of data science professionals is
still low
there are a lot of job opportunities
like working as a data scientist data
analyst big data engineer data analytics
professional and many more
now let's go into the fourth reason
the fourth reason on the list is
business optimization learning data
science is a fantastic way to gain the
technical abilities you will need to
make significant contribution to
company's improvement because data
science is such an important topic of
study for companies development data
scientists with specific knowledge and
expertise can expect to advance quickly
in their careers
now we have our fifth reason and the
fifth reason on the list is flexible
learning you don't really need
face-to-face schooling if you want to

regardless of what where and when you
want to take them
taking a data science course allows you
to push and reinvent yourself through a
self-paced core curriculum that helps
you learn data science at your own pace
now we have our sixth reason
it is cutting-edge technology
being a data science specialist entails
a set of technical abilities including
the application of cutting-edge
technology that are necessary for
ultimate data analytics success a
qualified data scientist has well versed
in data analytics computer science
foundations communications and the
visualization of data driven insights as
a result data science fosters technical
proficiency and encourages people to
learn about emerging technologies like
artificial intelligence and machine
learning
and the seventh reason on the list is
high salary salary varies by position
and it is influenced by a variety of
factors such as industry location and
services provided
using data analysis methodologies data
scientists add a lot of value to brand
building data science specialist pay is
determined on the value they bring to
their employees for instance if you
increase your analytic skills through
online classes you can provide better
help to firms and potentially earn more
money each year
now we have our eighth reason eighth
reason is
great future data is driving force
behind many companies success data
science as promising career path for
anyone interested in learning more about
