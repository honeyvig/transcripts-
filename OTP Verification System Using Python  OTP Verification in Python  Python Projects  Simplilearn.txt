[Music]
hi everyone I'm amarja and welcome to
the simply Lear YouTube channel in this
session we will create an OTP
verification GUI using python but before
we begin if you love watching Tech
videos subscribe to our Channel like the
tutorial and hit the Bell icon to now
miss an update and before we start I
hope the screen is clearly visible and
the audio is fine if yes please type in
yes and if there is any issue do let us
know in the chat
section and let us have a simple
question to brush up on our knowledge
and please answer in the comment section
below and we will update the correct
answer in the P comment and your
question is how is a code block
indicated in
Python and your options are brackets
indentation key or none of these you can
pause the video give it a thought and
answer in the comment section moving on
first we'll see what's a project and how
it looks like
so we will save it and run the
program you can see that the Tinker
window has appeared and this is our
project and this is what we're going to
make in this video so using too I have
received the OTP on my mobile phone and
that is
4601 and if I submit
it I can see the show info window that
says that the verification is
successful and we have one more window
for you
guys if you
want you can also make it uh we will
also discuss this in this video
so you can see this is the first window
we will create and after we click on the
generate OTP
button it will redirect to the second
window that is verify OTP and there you
could just type in the OTP you get on
your mobile phone and the OTP I code is
6709 and I will just click on the submit
button it will show that the
verification is
successful there's a recent OTP button
and there's a timer as the quo tokens
they are default available for 10
minutes only so I have set up an timer
for 10 minutes if you want you can also
make the timer else you could just go
with the verify OTP GUI and the recent
button it will
just make that will you send the OTP
again to our mobile phones if there's
any difficulty in reaching the OTP to us
so moving on now we will start with our
project that is first we will create a
folder and name it as OTP verification
and
inside we will open the command
prompt and now we'll open the editor I
will be using the visual studio code you
could choose any editor as you like or
you have the hands on any
edor so for that I will write the
command code space period and press
enter so here
we
will create the name of the file as
program 2.
py and now we should install and import
the modules uh for T Ander we don't have
to install it like T is a python module
that is used to develop GUI that is
graphical user interface there's no need
to install any module as T module is a
part of the standard python library and
here we need to install
too so for
that we will open the command prompt and
write the
command pip
install too and press
enter as it states that the requirement
is already satisfied I have already
installed the too module and used it in
the project so you just have to write
the command and press enter in the
command prom or in the terminal of your
editor
and the rest would be done for
you so moving
on we
will import the
modules so from take
enter we will import all the classes and
files and from to
video we import the client
class and to generate the OTP we will
use the random module and generate the
OTP with the Rand function so we import
random and uh we would also using the
message box but here we will see it
later
on so now we'll we create a class in the
T
inter so in order to initialize the
class we use the uncore uncore init
function this creates a method that runs
itself when we form an object from the
class so we will make a
class and name it as OTP verifier _
verifier and inside we will pass
TK
colon and as I said we
will make
the in
it and pass self in
it so we will create a root window and
display it on the screen for that we
will just run window. main Loop to out
the ti into
window and for
that and before we will just
write the
super yeah
T provides many methods and one of them
is the geometry method this method is
used to set the dimensions of the D
enter window and is used to set the
positions of the main window on the
users text door so for that we will use
the geometry function and write the
command self not
geometry and inside the C PES uh sorry
Circle
bases we'll set the Y
AIS as th000 CL
xais with
580
and you would make it shift with 200
dimensions and Y
AIS and 80 dimensions in the x-axis
now we will configure the window so we
will use the config function so config
and configure function they both are
same and they can be used on any widget
to change settings that you may have
applied earlier or haven't applied yet
so for that we'll write the command
self.
configure and inside we will set the
background color
as white only for the T enter
window and use the hexa code for the
colors you go use hexa code or just
write white so for white
we
have 6fs you can search for the code the
XA code or you could just write the
white color now we will use the
resizable function so this method is
used to allow T root window to change
its size according to the user's need as
well as we can Pro the resizing of the
tendle window so basically if you want
to create a fix size window this method
can be used in resizable method user can
pass either positive integer or true to
make the window resizable if you want to
prohibit the resizing of the window you
could just pass false or zero so we
would just prohibit it uh will write the
command self do p
sizable so we have prohibited our
window and
now before executing code python
interpreter read source file and Define
few special variables or Global
variables if the python interpreter is
running the source file as the main
program it sets the special variable
that would be the underscore
uncore name variable as value equal to
main that
value would be equal toore
uncore Main if this file is being
imported from another module so the name
variable will be set to the module's
name module's name is available as value
to name variable that is the global
variable so to execute it we'll write
the
command if name equal to Main and
that would be the inverted
commas here first we will
Class Window equal to
verore
verifier and
now I'll write a command to run the main
L that is the main thing to get a window
popped up so we'll save the file and run
it
so we got to Arrow
here so is Du to the
spaces we
don't have Make spaces in the geometry
method and now we'll save it and run it
you can see that the T window has poed
up now we will make its GUI and before
that we will see the too so this is the
too console you have to log into that
and that would be your account S ID your
token and the phone number from which
you will get the
OTP so I will show you the demo for
that you can just visit the to
website so to is an American company
that is based in the San Francisco which
provides programmable communication
tools for making and receiving phone
calls sending and receiving text
messages and Performing other
communication functions using it web
service
apis so this is the website here you can
just go sign
up as I have the account already I will
just log in in it you will just write
the first name last name email and
password that should be 16 plus
characters and after that you will
accept it and start your free trial it
doesn't need any credit card or
something you can just use it without
any payment mode and after that it will
ask you to get your phone number
assigned or it will ask first it will
ask you like what purpose are you
serving the TW so you could just make it
that uh you want want to run it for your
project or any code purpose and after
that you have to generate the phone
number from which you will get the
SMS so I have my console already I have
logged
in so mov to the code part now we'll use
toio to get our OTP on our mobile
FS
so for that we'll write the
command in the class only that is RB
verifier we will use the Cent function
for that we will create a variable self.
client and that is equal to
and use the client
function and inside we'll pass two
parameters that would be from the
console that would be the account S ID
we will copy
that and we'll paste it in the inverted
commas and the next parameter will pass
is the authorized token that would be
unique for
you we will paste this and that would
also B the inverted commas
only and next you'll write the command
self. client.
messages that is we'll use the variable
above that was the client
variable and we'll create the
messages and here we will write our
phone
number
that yeah two and equal to and
inside the brackets we will write the
contact number you want to receive the
message so here I'm writing my contact
number
and not highlight
it as
it as I can get the Spam messages or
spam call so I would not highlight it
and we will write the contact number
that we have got from Theo
and that contact number is M your phone
number we will copy
that and write
from so from
underscore and here
that will your phone
number comma and then the body what body
we want to receive as a text message
from this number so the body we want to
receive
ANP so for that we will use the random
module and generate an
OTP so first we will create a variable
store it in a variable
n for that we should use the random
module to generate the OTP for that we
will just make a function and name it as
OTP
only and inside we will pass
self and and in this function we will
return thep and that will generate with
the rant range
function and pass the
range so this function will choose any
number from this range and return to us
so we will ask this function to generate
a four number OTP
yeah so we have made the function for
the OTP and now we will assign it to the
variable we have declared
above so in this variable the we want
that the OTP should be passed as a
string because body would take as number
as a string only so with that we'll
write the command s
strr s
OTP in the body will get the variable
and
only for that we'll write the command
self
now we
will save
it and run
it
so is an issue
here and
it code successfully executed so
sometimes it takes time
okay and now we'll start with the GI GUI
and for that we'll create a function so
that we can store all the widgets
there and we will name the function as
labels
and first thing we will create would be
the canos widget the canos widget lets
us display various graphics on the
application it can be used to draw
simple shapes to complicated graphs we
can also display various kinds of custom
widgets according to our needs so first
we will create a
variable and name it as
C and inside
we will make the canvas
widget and now we set it background
color and that I will use the hexa code
only you could just
see that's the three
color you could use the hexa code or you
can just write the name of the color or
if you want you can just search on the
web you would get the hexa codes and you
would get the variations of all the
colors in hexa code and now set the
width for the canvas and width would be
equal to 400 as you can see that it is
in the
comments we have to put the hexa code in
the inverted
commas yeah so we have set the width and
now we will set the height
that is
280 and
now we will place this canvas for that
we will use the place function and that
place function allows you explicitly set
the position and size of a window either
in absolute terms or relative to another
window so for that we'll write the
command self. C do place
and the X Dimension would be equal to
290 and Y Dimension will be equal to
120 and
now we'll just save
this and run the
file so we have to call the labels
function
also we'll save it and run it
again you could see that this is the
canvas the gray canvas and moving on now
we will create a
frame and that would also be in the
labels function so frame is a
rectangular region on this screen and
that can also be used as a foundation
class to implement complex widgets it is
used to organize a group of widgets so
we will create a upper frame and inside
that we will place a small image for
thep verification and the
heading that would be to verify the
OTP so for that first we'll create a
variable and we will name it as upper
uncore frame
and inside we will create a
frame
and the f is capital for the frame
widget and inside we will pass
self and set the background
color equal to Blue and that would be
the D blue and I will use the hexa code
for that hexa code is
46 82 P4
that yeah this is the color you can see
here and now we'll set its width and
before that we
will get this into the inverted commas
and we will set the
width width would be equal to
1500 and now we'll set its
height height should be equal to
130 and now now we will place it so we
should be in the tier window for that
we'll use the place
function write the command self
doore
frame dot
Place
yeah so we will place it at xal to0
and Y = to0
only so I'll save the file and run it
for you so you can see the output side
by
side yeah you can see that this is the
frame and we have set the color as blue
and it we have placed it at X = to0 and
yal to 0 we have created the
canvas so now moving
on we'll use the labels
and in the labels only first we will
place the image in the
frame for that
uh first I will choose the image uh as
I've already made the project I have
chose the images and I have pasted it in
the
folder that is piix
and
these and we paste it in
our project folder so first I will be
using the password one image and I will
set it in the frame only and in take
enter like some widgets can display an
image such as label and button and we
would be using label to display this
image and for buttons also I have
created the images as you have seen in
the
folder so I will show you how to use
these images and show them as a button
so these widgets take an image argument
that allows them to display an image so
for that we will create a variable and
name it as
picture and the widget is photo
image and inside you have to pass the
location of the file where the image is
stored so we have just placed it in the
same folder so we will just write the
name of the image and that
was
password
one there was no spaces and that was the
PNG
file yeah after creating a photo image
object you can use it it will you can
use it with other widgets that except an
image argument the image object is
returned by the photo image function
that we have used and it's that easy to
display a picture in Python however the
photo image class only supports the GF
and PGM PPM formats which is a concern
jpeg jpg and PNG are the formats that
are most often
[Music]
used so
now we will
place the image in the
frame for
that first create a label for that and
we will create a variable and name it is
K and create a label
widget and teer label is a widget that
is used to implement display boxes where
you can place text or images so here we
will be first placing the image and then
the text so inside the label
widget pass the argument that was the
variable for the upper frame and then
the image object
that isal to
S
picture and set the
background as the same as of the frame
for that we will write
BG equal to and the hexa code that is
same that is 4682 B4
and now we will place
it so write the command here only that
is
dot
place and
X would be equal to
200
20 and Y =
35 and
we will save this and run the
file you can see that the image has been
placed here so now we will write verify
OTP and we'll also create the label for
that first use
the now inside the label function
only we will create another label
for the text and first we'll create a
variable and name it as
J and inside we will create a label
widget
and inside the upper
frame write a
text that could be verify OTP
set the font for
it that would be than New
Roman you could also set the size as 38
and make them bold
and now we'll set the background color
for
that that would be in the inverted
commas and that would be the blue only
for that we'll write the hexa
code that was
4682
B4 and now we will set the foreground
color that would be the text color as
white and here we will not use the
hexapod I would write the name name of
the color for that we WR the command
foreground
color that is equal to
White and now we will place this
label
X
place at 220 so we is at around 270
and why would be
same and that would be 35
only now we save this and run the
file we have get the label verify OTP
but they both are inside in so we will
just change the coordinates for this
label and we'll set
as
320
300 we save the file close the previous
T enter
window save the file and run it
just go so you can see that it has shown
the verify OTP but still it's not in the
center so we just again change the x
coordinate for that and that would be
400 we will save the
file and run
it could see
that now it is in the
center place it accordingly like I would
be creating the GUI and if you want
Perfection you can do that by
own and now moving on we will place a
simply learn image
just on the file and show you like where
we we place the simply lar
image we place it just uh at the bottom
right so for that we will create the
label again and first we'll use the
photo image to create the photo object
photo image object and first we'll
create the
variable and name it is
simply underscore
logo and inside we'll use the photo
image and write the name of the file as
you have to write the location of the
file as we have the files in the folder
only
and we have the simply Lear file with
the name simply Lear space
logo so we just use the file
name just want to check that is the
yeah that's
it
file
simply
space
logo and the extension of the file is
PNG
and now we will create a label for the
photo image
object for that we will create another
variable and name it as
D and use the label
widget I will pass self and image equal
to self
do simply
Lear
space
logo and we'll set the foreground
color equal to White and for that we use
the hexa code for white color
and now we will place this
label at X = to 8
70 that would be the bottom right and 5
= 530
show an
ER okay we have used the image name here
we have to use the
variable that is simply underscore
logo so
now save this and close the
previous take
window and run the
file
okay that
is
okay
spelling for the image file now I'll run
it and save it
save it and then run
it takes time to R
up you can see that the simply Lear logo
has been placed at the bottom right now
moving on okay I will show you what we
will execute next
so we will place an text widget here in
which we can just enter the OTP and
after that we will make the buttons
verify OTP and the recent OTP first we
will make the text in which we will
write the
OTP so for
that we won't make it in the labels
function with that we will create
another
function and name it as
entry we will enter thep
there and we
will make a variable that would be
username and use the text widget so text
widget is used where I use user wants to
insert multi-line text Fields this
widget can be used for a variety of
applications where the multi-line text
is required such as messaging sending
information or displaying information
and many other tasks we can insert media
files such as images and links also in
the text
widget and for
that for to enter the OTP we will create
the text widget
and write text and inside
self and now we'll set the font size in
which we would enter thep and it would
set it as
calib and the size for the font would be
20 and now we'll set the Border
width for the
text so it should have a border width so
we could see on that
canvas and we'll use W so if the word
with the text it exceeds the width of
the text widget it would just wrap it
and send it to the next line and that
we'll write
word and set the
width equal to
23 and height
equal to
one and now we will place
it and we'll place it in the canvas that
was of the gray color so that we'll
write the command self do the variable
name user
underscore name and we'll place
it X =
330 and Y =
200 save the file and run it and see
whether text widget has been created
successfully or not and before that we
have to run this
function entry
save this and from the
file that
you it's window
it's appear
here okay an eror
okay and we
not the
font so F equal to calib we'll save this
and run
again yeah it has appeared so this is
the text widget in which we will write
our OTP and verify it now we'll make the
submit button and the recent OTP buttton
and write the functionalities for
it so the button widget is used to add
various types of buttons to the python
application python allows us to
configure the look of the button
according to our requirements and for
that we'll create a
function buttons and we'll write all the
buttons here that would be two buttons
only that is submit and check note
submit only will check the OTP the
second but would be desend
OTP and first we will create a variable
for the submit button image we'll create
the submit button
first we'll create a variable and name
it as submit
button and first we
will assign the image to that button
we already have the submit image in our
folder we will use this
image call the photo
image
sorry so we call the photo
image and inside we will pass the
file address and
I
submit and
now the photo image object has been
created so we'll create the submit
button we'll create a
variable as the name of submit button
only
and to make a button we'll use the
button widget and inside we first pass
self and then the image that should be
appeared and that would be equal to the
variable name that is submit button
image
okay and now we'll set the command so
command is used to call the function so
what function does this button do that
would be stored in the
command and that would be equal to we
will name the function as check OTP as
submit Buton would check the OTP
only we'll create this function after
this pattern only
and now we will set the
border and we won't make the B we will
set it at
zero now we will place the submit
button for that we'll write the command
self to submit button
place and X would be equal to
440 and yal to
330 and now we will start with the
recent button recent OTP button and
after that we will create the check OTP
function so for the recent OTP button
first we will create the photo image
object that we will write a
variable we
send
OTP that
be name ascp
image and pass the file name
so
onlyp
PNG now we'll create the button for that
we'll write the command self to desent
OTP variable
and use the button
widget and inside pass self and then the
image that would be set as the button
image that would be equal to the
variable name of the photo image object
that is
resent OTP image
[Music]
add
image okay
Mr
coma
yeah now we'll set the command and that
would be the
function that will store the
functionalities that this button will
do and we'll name the function as we
send OTP only
and to call that would also use self as
pass the self there and that could be
applicable to check OTP
also and now let's set the order equal
to zero for the recent
OTP image and now we will past it
and we'll place it at 420a
430 so that will'll write the command
self do pend
OTP
place and set X =
420 and Y = 430
so both the buttons have been
made
here
buttons save the file and run it
so it's saying that the check OTP that's
not the attribute here so first we'll
create those functions only check OTP
and the recent
OTP yeah so first we will create the
recent OTP function
so
it and
inside we will paste the same as we just
write the commands to get the
OTP these are the
commands get it pasted
so this is the recent OTP function now
we'll create the check OTP
function so that
we'll
write function name that is check
OTP and pass self to
that and
inside we use
try so if any exception occurs we would
get it easily
solved and here we will create the
variable with the name user
input and get it stored an integer
value so it will convert the text that
was string which have passed as the body
so it
will take the text and convert it into
integer
and it
would take that value from the user
underscore
name would be writing the OTP there
only yeah
now we will write some conditions to
check if thep is correct so we will get
the message box poed
out and for that we'll write the command
if s to user
input is equal to equal
to integer value of self to 10
then we will make the message spoked out
and we will import the message box class
also as we have already imported all the
classes from the Tak but again we will
import
it and if this condition goes
true we want a message
[Music]
box to show info
and inside we have to pass the show
info and we will make it as verification
successful or you could write anything
like the is verified
write verification
successful and now if self to
and we to done
so thep would be done there
else else also pop out the message box
and for that we'll write the command
message
box don't Jo
for and inside we will pass the
variables show info and we will get the
indication as wrong
OTP no
we will make the exception here as we
have used the tri BL we have to use the
accept BL also and here also we will use
the message
only show for inside pass
it would tell us invalid
OTP and here we will import the message
box
class for that we'll write the command
from teer import message box
as you can see that we have created both
the functions that is check orp and
desent
OTP now I will save the file and run it
s of TR
okay now we'll save the file and run
it as you can see that the T window has
popped up and I have received the OTP on
my mobile phone that is
1856 and I will click on the submit
button so it's showing
fromp okay we will desend
it I WR the new OTP as
[Music]
2851 click on the submit button it says
that the verification is successful so
so we have made the verification OTP GUI
successfully and you could add the timer
also in
it for that I will just copy paste the
code for the
timer uh I will also provide the source
file in the description if you want you
can see there or if you want to know how
the timer is made you could just see our
another video in the description or on
the I button
just copy paste the
code so this is the runtime of function
so you can see that the timer has
started and it's for the 10 minutes as
Duo default tokens are valid only for 10
minutes and received another OTP we will
resend it
again and it's
7848 you'll click on the submit button
it says that the verification is
successful and if you want to make the
first page you can see the source
code I will make it available for you
guys
I will make file that would be program.
py name it as program 1.
py and inside you can see that we have
imported the teer class and imported the
program to module and we have installed
the module sub processes and we are
calling the import
class and here we have made the class
generate OTP and inside we have set the
geometry and configured the color as
white for the first window and we have
made
it that the window could not be
resizable that's why we pass the false
and false arguments to the
resizable
function and here we have created the
labels as you would see in the first
window and the button generate
OTP so we will save the file and run
it first P this
now we'll save it and run the file
ER for the simply learn
logo so the file name is simply learn
logo I will replace
that save it and run it again see the
first window that is OTP verification
and is Val for 10 minutes and click on
the generate OTP button generate OTP we
click on generate OTP button and it
would redirect to the second page that
is verify OTP so we have done with our
