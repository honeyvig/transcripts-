hey guys and welcome to simply learn in
today's video we'll be creating a basic
ecommerce website with the help of php
mysql html css and bootstrap
now let me show you a glimpse of the
website we'll be creating which is
called techbyte.com
but you can obviously create a website
for the product of your choice
so let me just go to the browser
type in
localhost website and this is the
website that we'll be creating this is a
very basic website for e-commerce
services but as you can see we have
displayed the top products on the front
page of a website and here from the drop
down menu you can see laptops
and phones
so without wasting much time
let's get started
now before we begin let me tell you that
we'll be using visual studio code as the
ide our code editor
and
zam as the web server solutions package
which will be hosting a local server
server for the website
now
another thing that we need to do before
beginning
is we need to go to a browser
and type in
bootstrap
download
go to this website
and from here
download the bootstrap
file
this will be a compressed file you can
download it from here and i'll tell you
later what we're going to do with it
now let's go and set up a coding
environment
so let me just close this
go to see
exam folder
locate htdocs folder in it and
create
any name for your project
i'll be writing website
and inside this website what you're
going to do is
go to your downloads
now this bootstrap folder that we just
downloaded we are going to extract it
inside
that
website folder
so
let's just go back
so
we
need them outside
delete this
so as you can see we have got a css and
js folder and we will be using this in a
website
now
let us begin
our code
so right click
open with code
now this is our visual studio code and
as you can see
our website folder is visible here and
from here we can create a new file so
our first file would be
index dot php
now let's start a code
type in exclamation mark
and hit enter and you can see
this block of code
will be visible here
now we need to add a few things
well not a few quite a lot
first would be
title
the title would be
well
since my website is take by i'm going to
keep the title of stick by
next what we're going to do is we are
going to add
some links
to this index.php
so these are the links for the css files
present inside this folder that we just
downloaded from bootstrap
and we'll be linking some of the files
from this folder onto
our website so that the website looks
good yeah
now the reference would be
css this is the folder and
the file is bootstrap
dot m i n dot css
so this is the first file that we're
going to be linking
next
let's add
a script here
so this is a pretty popular script and
you can find it on the internet easily
jacks
well yeah
this ends a script here
let me just recheck if i typed
it correctly
yeah seems fine
now moving on
we are going to be adding another script
that would be
javascript
and
it will include boots
jquery
sorry bootstrap
i'm just going to find it
bootstrap.man.js
here this ends a second script
now let us just
end
this title
and move on to the
body part of the
code
now
what do we need to produce or create
first
now the first thing that we need is a
navigation bar
so
to create a navigation bar i'll give you
a pretty easy way to do that instead of
writing a hefty big code you need to go
to your browser
since we are using bootstrap why not
take the best out of it
now type in bootstrap
navbar
go to this link navbar bootstrap
and as you can see this bootstrap
this navbar can be
accessed using this
code just copy it go back and paste it
in your body
now we'll be making a few changes to a
navigation bar according to our
e-commerce website but before that
we need to check if this navigation bar
is visible correctly on the web page now
to do that
first
let's open a zam control panel
start our apache server
and go to a browser
now to see the result of your code to
see if this code that you've just
written
is
how does it look on a web page we need
to type in localhost followed by the
name of the folder that you created for
your project since the name of my folder
is website i've written website here
click on enter
and well our navigation bar looks a bit
weird
there's no designing to it now let me go
back to
the code and see what i did wrong
well yeah
we don't need this bootstrap reboot.
reboot.min.css instead
we need
just bootstrap.min.css
let's
save it go back and reload
well our navigation bar is visible
let's go back to the code
and start making some for changes
the first change that i'm going to be
making is
i will change the
color theme of this navigation bar
and
yeah looks much better
now let me remove
some things
first
let's change the name to
techbuy.com
well
second
let us let it be home
so this is the drop down i will be
changing it to
products
the first product is
laptop
the second one
owns
we don't need this here
and
let me put the divider
in between
we don't need this
disabled part
either
and
neither do we need the search form
now i want to make a few changes to the
navigation bar
so this navigation bar seems a little
thin
let me add
just a little bit of breath to it
yep
looks good
and as you can see
laptops phones and this dividing line
now what we need to do create a front
page that is the top featured content on
the front page that will be visible on
our e-commerce website so to do that
create a div class
let us name it
and
this will be a column
div inside this
another div class
this will be for the row
and now
just a second
yes
this will also need a class since we
want our
text
in the center of the page
and
top
products
okay
let me
just add some spaces
well
before adding those
images and the products onto a page we
need to prepare a little bit more so
before that let us just save this piece
of code and
see how does it look so it displays top
products in the center of the page
looks great
now what we need to do before we can
display the products on this
page is we need to create a database in
where
we are going to store all the
information regarding our products and
we will fetch that data from the
database and displayed on our website
now to create the database just go back
to the xampp control panel and start the
mysql server too now
here
type in localhost
php
myadmin
and you can see you
are now redirected to the php my admin
control panel
where you can create
different databases
so as you can see i've already created a
database named tech by
under which i have got
another table that is products
with some data here
now
i'll show you how to create a database
from scratch
now to do that we need to go to this new
part now since we already have a tech by
database let us name it something
different
e-commerce
and
create
now
we have created a database named
e-commerce and inside the e-commerce
what we need to do is we need to create
a table
let us create the table and name it
products
now our table with will mainly consists
of around
six or seven
columns and let us keep it seven
the first would be id of course and it
will be auto incremented
the second
title of the product
which will be a variable character
to 55
price of the product
since
prices can be
in decimal
let us keep this decimal
and
the values would be 10 comma 2
next is brand name
this is variable character
100 would do
image now this
column here will
contain the location of the image on our
server or
on a system since our system is the
local server so
this will also be a variable character
255
next would be description
this will be a text since a description
can be long
and
last could be featured
all right
let us save this table
and we have a products table here
in our new database that is e-commerce
now we need some images for this
image file for our products
now i've already downloaded some images
let me just
copy them
now go back to a c drive zam
what we're going to do is we're going
back to our website folder
and
we'll be creating a new folder inside
the website folder and let us name it
images
and paste your
images here
let me go back to
this visual studio code and as you can
see
our images are visible here we'll be
using them very soon
let us go back to
this
and let me add an entry here
so we'll be working
with one product and once you understand
the concept you can add
many more products later on
so
the title would be
google
pixel 5
the
price extra 5000
brand name goes google
image
now to add the path of your image
what you need to do is you need to go
back here
images now the path would be inside
website
and inside images folder so
website
images
and then followed by the name of the
image since the name for my
google phone is g pixel
i'll be writing g
pixel dot png
make sure you do not make a mistake
while writing a name
and in the description
well i've copied some description from
the internet i will be posting
the same here
google pixel 5 5g 8gb ram 128 gb
space now
inside the featured part
we'll be numbering it one and click on
go so go back to browse
and you can see
your field that you just created visible
here
so now that we have the entry
for our image for our product that is
google pixel 5 phone in our database let
us go back to the code to see how to
retrieve this
information from this database into a
code and display it on our screen
let's go back to our code
and in our code
let's go back to the top
and
here
we are going to be creating a
php
script
and inside that script
i will be
accessing the database
now
let us create a connection to the
database using mysqli
connect
and inside this what we're going to do
is we will be writing the name of
loop the server since the server is
localhost
and then
this
next would be
root now
again
mysqli
now here select
db database
and inside this
we'll be selecting a database from
the my admin panel
so what we need to do is we need to
write the variable name followed by the
name of the database that we need
information from so our the name of our
database
was
e-commerce
yep
so
e-commerce
so here we have created a connection
with the database now
let us create another file sql
so
for this this variable will be accessing
all the information stored in our table
products so
we'll be writing some
sql commands
select star that is all the details from
name of our table
products let me just recheck
products yep
and
the
featured
is equals to one
so remember that
while
creating a
entry we put this featured value as one
so
this part of the code is done
now
let us go back down
where we stopped last and
write
our
php
script
so
here
what we are going to do is we will be
creating a while loop
now inside the while loop
we will create another
variable
as products
which will be equals to
my
sqli and this function is used to fetch
the data from the database
and feature
well there's something that we missed
we did not create the variable featured
here
and
well it would have given an error
so
what featured would do is featured would
use the connection
to query
the
sql command
now
go back
here
what this while loop will be doing is
this while loop
will be fetching
the data
from our table under the category of
featured number one
so
next what we're going to do is next we
will create another
div class
which would be
inside this edge for
another
php
script
is equals to product
now
inside this
we are since this will be the title we
will be displaying the title from here
so what we need to do is
we need to add the title
and
close the
php script here
next
we need to display
the image
so
here in this
image src we don't need to write the
path of the image since we have already
entered that into the database what we
need to do is we need to specify
the path
from where we need to fetch the image
from the database
so
it's pretty simple
again
the same thing
product
and as you
would have guessed it it will
be
image was it image or images
let me just recheck
it was image
close this close the file
and
here we have retrieved our image
now
product
inside this product what we are going to
get is
the price
title so that if one would hover over
here it will display the title of the
product
and
that's it
we need to close it
set
[Music]
okay
so
[Music]
yeah
looks good
next
we will display
the price of the product
to do that
we will create a class
let us name it
price
close it
rupees
we're doing it again product
and
here
what we need to do is we need to get the
price and close this
similarly
whatever details that we need to display
here from the database we are going to
be accessing them
through
this script with changing the name of
the column that we need to access
so
now that we have all this
let us
also create a reference page
and
i'll be creating another file
details.php
which will display the details of the
product
but
before that let me create a button
type button
class
button success
now the name of the button would be more
and
well
this ends here
also what we need to do is we need to
let me
just see what we need to do is we need
to end this
while loop
and while
here
and
just
close it
so
this
div
and this div
everything's good
save
let's go back
and see if it's working
and voila
we have our first product
displayed here
on the front page of our ecommerce
website google pixel 5 the phone the
more button does not work yet
but we'll be working on it but
it feels good doesn't it
now let us go back to the code
and
see
how to create this details.php file
first
details.php and inside this file what
we're going to do is we are going to
just copy paste some part of the code
here
and
also
this part of the code
okay
and
we don't need it
now we need
one or two more things to be displayed
here so
just copy this
paste it
and paste it again let's go back to
[Music]
our localhost and what we need to
display here is
so we have already displayed the title
the price
and the image
so the things that we're left with is
the description
and the brand name
so let's go back
price is already here
just add this script
and
brand name
was it brand name
yep brand name
description
that's good
change
class name here
okay
so
what we're going to do is we will be
refreshing this page and clicking on
more
and
well yes good the details of our product
are visible here
now let's go back and
make a little changes
so the first change would be
this
so
this would be
product
details
and
save
click
and there's still
a big gap
yes looks better
now
let me just
you can add some
bold or
italics
or whatever you like
in this code
um what did i do
so i've added bold in the title
let's see if it works
i'm not sure if it does
okay since it's already a heading
my bad
let me
add it here
okay
save it so this is the price
and yes price is in bold now so you can
make a few changes so look make
your description look better
and let us go back to the main page and
what we're going to do is we are going
to
create two new files for this laptops
and phones to display them separately
when we click on any drop down menu
since they don't work yet
now let me show you an example to create
a file for this product laptops
and
you can create
the rest yourself so
first thing that we need to do is we
need to go back to this database
into a table
and
create another entry
so the title would be
associated laptop
price would be
1 lakh 20 000 brand name asus
image so the image is website
images
and the name of the image is
broke asus
dot png
bro
start png
and
i've copied some description for the
from the internet
and
now the one thing that you need to
notice is we are going to be keeping
this featured part as
2 instead of 1
and go back to browse and you can see
the detail that we just created with the
feature number two so now go back to our
code
and create another file let us name it
product
laptops dot php
let me just see
yep
i have
so yeah i may have skipped this part so
in the drop down menu when we created a
navigation bar here it was written
this
so we need to replace this reference
with the name of the
php file that we just created that is
product dash laptops dot php so pro
duct dash laptops dot php
and inside this
first thing that we need to do is copy
this code paste it here
now here change it to
two
and
drop down
top products everything looks
fine
save it
since the feature number will be 2
let us go back
refresh
click on laptops
and here you can see the asus rogue
laptop visible
now let me
add another product on our feature page
that is a front page to show you how do
we display more than one product with
the same code so
go back to this database and create
another entry
let's say
hp laptop
price would be
80 000
okay i think i just
created an entry
let me delete it
go back
hp laptop
price
80 000
brand name hp
image
website
images
name of the image
that is hp underscore laptop dot png
hp underscore laptop dot png
and the description which i have copied
from the internet
and in this feature we are going to be
writing one
since we are displaying this on the
front page of our website
go back to browse here are the details
now let's get back
we don't need to change anything just
save it
go back and refresh
and
as you can see we have our hp laptop
visible here and similarly
we can just re add products into a
database and this single piece of code
is enough to display them all
on a web page
so guys these are some of the basics of
an e-commerce website you can add more
products choices more detailed
descriptions and add more designing
using css bootstrap cards
and
buy sell
sections on your website
just play along with the code and start
making your own web pages
