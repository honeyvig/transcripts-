uh this is dr srikanth from team mds
conquer
and this video is as per the students
demand
so of course we are approaching towards
the examinations
and hardly the need is less than two
months
and the aims is in and around like 30
days
of course you can call the recent aims
as i
n i c e d okay whatever it is
so the main important aspect that is
required as of now
is i mean like most of the like if you
take out the success stories of most of
the
students of mds conquer all my name okay
there are two
things which are really required in this
last
two months okay so the two aspects are
one is stealing time okay you have to
steal as much time as possible
and you have to invest that time into
preparation
so people who read more
in this last phase has high chances to
be
successful or their performance will be
better than what
they're expecting okay time stealing
time is
one of the important aspects so stealing
time is a
is the biggest thing as of now the
second one is
never repeat the mistake okay
so never repeat the mistakes like this
is a phase where
you have to go for more practice so more
mcq is getting more mcqs being exposed
on the group
or getting more mcqs being exposed on
the website or in the mock exams in the
module exams whatever it is like
whenever you you are wrong in a
particular aspect for example
uh i was giving an exam today on perio
and
i i went wrong in two mcqs related to
flaps
so your weakest area in perio is going
to be flap so
you have to read flaps in such a way
that either you can cover flaps from the
from the discussion part either you can
cover the flaps from the video based
discussions either you can cover flaps
from your
power play books or from karan's or from
any mcq books that is available for you
so you read so many things
so you can cover flaps from any of these
areas but make sure
if a question is coming from flaps again
again
either in your mocks or either you know
on your group or
anywhere anywhere make sure 99
is you have to go for the right answer
if you are successful in these two
principles
okay so i mean like basing upon the
exposure that we have planned for you
this upcoming 55 to 58 days to take your
final exam
neet if you follow these two steal as
much time as you can
invest them on the preparation or on the
tasks of the group
and the second one is never repeat the
mistake from the same topic
if you maintain these two there are high
chances that your performance is going
to be
better than what you expect so you keep
your target something so definitely
you're going to
get something better than what you
expect so straight away we'll go into
the
quick recap of few aspects of perio as
per
the students demand so the first
important aspect that you have to make
and not questions there are many
questions on immunoglobulins of course
we have learned immunoglobulins
at our best during our microbiology go
back and watch the immunoglobulins video
where you can answer any number of
questions but right away the question is
immunoglobulin which is
present in saliva or immunoglobulin
which is present in gcf okay this is the
most commonly asked question
so the predominant immunoglobulin that
is present in saliva
is you can make a node that is iga
and the predominant immunoglobulin that
is present in
gcf is igg okay so these are the two
important points
this is predominant the question is as
predominant then you have to go for iga
regularly your gcf and your saliva will
have
all these immunoglobulins igg iga
and igm but predominant in
saliva is a and predominant in gcf is
the gene okay so apart from this one
more immunoglobulin based question
okay down syndrome patient okay you have
your down syndrome right
so down syndrome patient has
less cares he has less cares
the reason why he has less keras is
because he has
more iga immunoglobulins compared to a
normal individual if you compare the
serum levels of immunoglobulins in
downs and normal individual iga are more
in downs patient that is the reason why
the downs patient will have
less cares okay so these are the
questions which moves around
the next question is antibacterial
action in saliva is mainly due to
so antibacterial action cell is mainly
due to these three components
that is iga which controls the bacterial
colonization lysozyme this lysozyme is
also present in your
tear drops that is that helps in
breaking the saliva
i mean breaking the bacterial walls and
lactoperoxidase that helps in the
oxidation you have oxidized that helps
in the oxidation
of oxidation by which it causes the
lysis of bacteria so these three
components
are primarily responsible for occurrence
of antibacterial action
in the case of your saliva all other
functions are important okay
so because there are few questions which
are previously asked that is the
questions on
lubrication lubrication is basically due
to the lubrication is basically due to
the
glycoproteins and mucoids okay and
buffering action of saliva is primarily
due to the three
components which we have discussed out
of which the predominant component is
the bicarbonate okay so all these
all this this table is very very
important just do make a note of the
table i am going to the next question
that is anti anti-biotics which can be
detected
in gcf there's a most commonly asked
pharmacology question
the answer goes is your tetracyclines
and the second one is your
metronidation so these two are
predominantly can be detected in your
gcf the next question the question is a
question that is given in the need
previously is predominant cells in
established lesion of
gingiva so these are the stages of
gingival lesion that is the initial
lesion which is two to four days
at early lesion four to seven days
establish this two to three weeks
right the question is the predominant
cells in established
establish the predominant cells of the
plasma cells initially you will have
this acute cells that is
polymorphosis in the initial stage but
once it is converted into the acute
stress these
polymorph nucleosides in the next level
the second level they
are going to replace by lymphocytes in
the third level they are going to
replace by the plasma cells which are
also called as the memory cells
right so they can ask you the clinical
features like
gingival fluid flow will be high in
stage one
uh the change in the size structure and
the color can be appreciated in the
established lesion
so all these are interlinked questions
can be asked okay so blood status is
can be seen in the case of stage three
so that's about the stages make a note
of stages days
and the vascular changes changes in the
junction epithelium and circular
epithelium predominant cells
is of course the most commonly asked
question and they can link it with that
other clinical features
okay it's very good next moves to the
next question that is called as
co-adhesion and co-aggregation so what
is the difference between
co-adhesion and co-aggregation
co-adhesion
is is the is simply it's like bond
between
the tooth and the bacteria
whereas co aggregation is the bond
between the bacteria and bacteria
so the next question that is asked
co-aggregation is predominantly seen in
which type of bacteria option a
positive positive option b
negative negative option c
positive negative option d all of the
above so this is the most commonly
asked question so co aggregation is seen
in
the question is co-aggregation is seen
in
seen in which are the following is the
question the answer
is all of them co-aggregation the same
question is predominantly seen in
predominantly a word added if
predominantly is added then you have to
go for a negative negative
so co aggregation is a bond or an
affection between bacteria and bacteria
which is predominantly seen in negative
and negative but which can be seen in
any sort of combination
it is seen in all the combinations but
it is well or predominantly seen in the
case of negative negative combination so
that's
an important thing that you have to make
and what the next question is the
question
of primary and secondary colonizers
questions which were repeated in 2018
neet exam 2019 neet exam 2018 aims exam
of course 2019 they have given the same
exam
in in in the pga okay so just ask you to
identify which of the following is a
primary colonizer
so these are the list of colonizers that
you have to make a note which are the
following is a primary or early and
which of the following is
secondary so simple you have to make a
note about the names it's difficult but
they are asking questions so make a note
each of the following is a primary all
of the following are primary accept
which are the following is a secondary
so everything is very very important a
simple logic i can give you
is all your strepto related stuff that
comes at
the primary okay so you can you can just
try to come up with some ideas and just
try to remember it
and second thing of course the
colonization okay the the complexes are
very very important we have a video
on different types of color coding in
which we have discussed the complexes
you have a video on microbiology
of perio and the dental care is in which
we have discussed about the complexes
but make a note
early complexes are your yellow and
purple
whereas your secondary colonizers are
the rest
others that is the green orange and red
and red is basically associated with the
bleeding on probing which of the
following complex
is basically associated with the
bleeding and probing and of course it's
the most commonly asked questions which
bacteria
comes under which complex is a regularly
asked question and it revolves
around your mcq boots so please do make
a note as of now when you're watching
this video
so done with primary and secondary
colonizers done with the complexes make
a node complexes
and their examples are very very
important in examination point of view
okay done for now we'll be coming up
with one more video related to
this quick recap on students demand
