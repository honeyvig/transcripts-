hi vness this is Dr strian from Team MDS
conquer now in this video I'll be
discussing about the modifications that
are done in inic pattern so the next
examination is on November 5th 2023 you
have four days for the examination so
there are few modifications that are
done in inic to improve the standards of
examination okay so almost the replica
of inbd if you check out the
modifications that are done in inic in
the last few years they're almost trying
to replica the international board
examinations that is
IMBD the second important thing is your
examination is being splitted into four
parts and each part is going to carry 50
questions and with a time limit of 45
minutes okay so it is 50 into 4 so
you'll be having 200 questions in total
it is 45 into 4 then it will be 180
minutes in total so that is 3 hours and
coming to the scoring the scorings which
are given in the previous update are
slightly different from the present
update the present update is very simple
okay the right answer is going to carry
a plus one score whereas the wrong
answer is going to carry minus 1/3 score
question that is not attempted or
question that is in the review will not
be given any score so it will be
zero check out this this is how the
color coding in the final exam will be
okay green color will be answered and
red color is not answered and uh a white
plain color is not visited it okay and
uh purple color is marked for review
okay and purple color with a tick mark
is answered and marked for a review but
make sure both the purple color as well
as your purple color with a tick mark as
well as your white colored as well as
your not answered will not be considered
for marking okay please be very very
clear okay very clear about these things
these four color codings will not be con
considered as a score will not be
considered as a
answer yeah I'm done for now stay tuned
to MDS conquer for more such updates and
strategies related to upcoming inic and
