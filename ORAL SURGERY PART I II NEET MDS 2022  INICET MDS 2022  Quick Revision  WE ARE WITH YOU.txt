happiness this is dr shree khan from
team mds conquer
now i am here to give a quick
glance of subject oral surgery
so before going into the discussion
there are few important aspects that
i need to focus on okay so oral surgery
is more of an
uh logical based or a concept based
subject when compared to many other
uh subjects like your general anatomy
biochemistry
physiology general medicine or your
community your dental materials
and few other areas like has to be
revised because
they have more of a memory based stuff
so oral surgery is more often a concert
based and i hope most of you are very
strong and familiar with
oral surgery i hope like most of you can
handle the things well in the
examination hall
so that's the first thing that i want to
stress on so you can just have a glance
over the
video that's going to help you to focus
more on the memory based stuff for the
important aspects
the second important thing is i mean
like most of you are
tensed most of you were tensed or
depressed or
like all sorts of feelings are running
in your mind and of course this is a
time where
the things will be like this you hardly
have like five to six days from now
and please stick on to your basic fund
or basic protocols that what we have
been doing
from past few months okay so we have
planned in such a way that
how we are going to be in the last seven
days what you are going to do in the
last seven days so that's what our plan
is on the day one
uh in the orientation session i hope
like most of you i remember that
orientation day like last 15 days plan
should be started from day one
and i hope most of you were well
organized and please just
go with the basic requirement so the
basic fund of
the last 15 days or the seven days or
one week plan okay don't change
any plan don't don't go or don't take
suggestions from any side regarding
the change of plan okay so whatever
you're doing you're on the
right track you're on the right way and
just stick on to that
so we are very happy for the toppers of
andhra and telangana
most of the students were right now in
the good places in well gdc's
in good departments let's start the
classification of
local anesthesia so local anesthesia is
basically divided into esters and amides
basically
so your esters are again divided into
two types
they are the benzoic acid derivatives
and the para benzenoic acid derivatives
so in the benzenolic acid derivatives
these are the things which will be
and in parabenic acid derivatives you
will have a word like pro you can easily
identify them with the word pro
so the regularly your amides amites
will have two eyes in the numbering okay
so you can just identify the amide with
two eggs
the only stir with two eyes is this okay
this is this is an exception just
remember that exception part
then you can see there might most of the
image you can have two eyes two eyes two
eyes two eyes two eyes two eyes two eyes
two s
so i might say two s so please do add a
note of this this is again regularly and
most commonly asked
question so time to reach the peak value
is very less in the case of iv iv you
have the bioavailability of
100 percentage so before this okay iv
before the iv
okay there is one more method which with
the peak values reach
in a very very less duration of time
when compared to the iv
that is endotracheal
incubation okay so that is the first one
followed by the iv second one topical
third one
okay and intramuscular and subcutaneous
and do make a note about the half-lives
half-lives is least for
half-life is maximum fun okay so that's
the reason why these are more toxic
because most cardiotoxic
is a drug of choice for hot tick
of course if they ask which is the most
toxic or which of the following has most
half-life
if you have diabetes you can go for that
then followed by
now it is the used drug which has most
half-life is will be working your toxic
levels and everything will be more for
you okay and make a note about these
absolute contraindications
rest all are relative these are absolute
contraindications
and please do learn about this if you
are not if
if you are not clear with this please do
learn this table this table is very very
important
what is amola so definition most of you
are familiar with this it's a
mix of lidocaine and trilocat
and one more is biological side
classification so basically upon which
a b c d classes are divided
it is a receptor present on the membrane
and this is receptor present on the
internal
internal receptor this is independent
this is receptor
dependent and independent most of your
clinical ls will comes under
the class four that is class d okay your
benzene will comes under
the class c and uh
and your i mean like your scorpion comes
under the class b
your biotoxins will comes under the
class a
this is one more classification basing
upon the duration short acting is 30
minutes
intermediate acting is 60 minutes long
acting is 90 minutes so bupiva kind is a
long acting one
the next comes the pka values of most of
the things pka value is least for
benzoic and
maximum for this okay so they're gonna
ask you the pk values of this area
because these are the most commonly used
lidocaine trilocan arctic and they have
a range of 7.7
do make a note about benji can that is
8.1
and of course this this these things are
very very basic
they can ask you a diagram based
question over this area by giving
a b c d and i ask you to identify what
you say what is b please do go through
go through this these are all are
important very basic questions but they
are important
so what is pka value how does it is
going to affect its going to affect the
onset
okay and coming next to this lipid
solubility it is going to cause the
anesthetic potency will be determined
protein binding capacity is going to
cause the duration so please go through
this this
table is very very important in the
conceptual questions related to local
anesthesia
of course anti-convolution blood levels
of lidocaine is a regular last question
and this is most common tonal clonic
scissors
are seen above 7.5 mu gram per ml
next comes comes with this particular
classification what are direct acting
what are indirect acting what are mixed
acting so please go through this
and what are the signs that are seen in
the case of a mild to moderate overdoses
okay so what are the signs and symptoms
i hope most of you are very familiar
with this
if not just have a glance because they
can give a case-based question
by telling you these are the signs and
features are seen upon
upon giving a local anesthetic and they
can interrelate with the case-based
thing
burning sensation upon injection is
basically due to the ph of the drug
or maybe the cataracts may be
contaminated with alcohol or may be
overheated or maybe
containing the vasopress and coming to
the
food and drug okay lactation categories
what is s what is s question mark what
is s dot what is ms
and i mean like what are the most of
your local anesthetics used comes under
b
and c okay b is leader and comes under b
okay and your prilogan comes under b
okay so please do make a note about this
lactation categories related to the
local anesthesia
and i hope you're well aware of this
full mouth extraction
the first teeth to be extracted is the
maxillary posterior teeth
and the last teeth to be extracted is
the mandibular cannon so please do
make a note about the sequence i hope
you are good at this because this was
discussed so many times on the group
next comes this is again a very
important try as categories by
color giving okay what is red color what
is yellow color what is green color and
what is black color
most of i mean like this two to three
questions given
on this in 2017 session of neet
examination
of course questions are given in 2020
question is given in
2018 you should not miss this malapactic
classification do make a note of this
okay what is this class 1 what is class
2 what is class 3 what is class 4
and how it is the next goes is there is
something called as uh mental higher
distance
and something called as an thyro
thyromental distance okay so this is
they can give you a labeling they can
ask you what is a what is b so please do
make a note of these values
and when you're talking about this
particular test that is the
measuring the distance between the
thyromental distance if the distance is
6.5 millimeters no problem for
laryngoscopy if it is 6 to 6.5 there is
a difficulty but you can try if it is
less than 6 it is very difficult so this
stress
indirectly is going to give you an idea
that uh the accessibility of
laryngoscopic so please do make a note
about the laryngoscopy diagrams because
they are regular last
your emergency general surgery and oral
surgery emergency equipments and the
devices which are used in the emergency
are regularly asked questions from 2017
neet examination
and most of them are discussed well on
the group so please do finish that
coming to the pregnancy okay so
pregnancy generally in the first and the
third time instance you are going to
avoid any
uh procedures which are going to create
the stress so most of the procedures
will be done in the
second trimester and the i mean like
what's going to happen there is
something called as a
supine hypotension syndrome of pregnancy
that
really occurs in the case of your late
third trimester
when the woman is in the supine position
for more than three to seven minutes
there will be signs or symptoms of
cinco this is basically due to the
compression of
gravity uterus gravity prograde is
compression which decreases the returns
to the
inferior vena cava thereby decreasing
the venous returns
so what you have to do you have to keep
the woman under lateral position of the
standing position
[Music]
as standing position is not possible on
the dental chair so we will ask the
woman to turn
to the lateral side so left lateral side
you have more questions on pregnancy the
left lateral side
position of pregnant women is left
lateral side okay it can be a standing
side but not possible on the dental
chair
ah then comes is with hemoglobin what is
the treatment option that is the
administration of 100
days of oxygen sometimes may not improve
the situation so in such
conditions you are going to give a slow
iv please do make a note
iv it is iv administration of one
percentage of
with methyl blue that is 1.5 milligrams
per kg or 0.7 milligrams
per lpa repeated every four hours if the
cyanosis persists or returns
the other thing that you can use in this
particular situation is
giving vitamin c okay you can give the
patient vitamin c that is administration
of
you can see this uh you can you can
this is im that is iv this is im
administration of ascor because it does
nothing but vitamin c that is hundred to
two hundred milligrams per day
this accelerates the metabolic pathway
through which the ferrous is going to
produce so federic to ferrous
transformation is the main issue
that occurs in the case of hemoglobin so
you are going to reverse it back by
using either
methyl blue or by using the vitamin c
ascorbic acid
so relatively contraindicated is preload
and flilokin is mainly concerned with
this particular
abnormality so please do make a note of
this okay diagram based question
okay what is this little people
what is this big people
and uh okay they can ask your diagram
based question by giving this
ammonium okay that is called as an
aromatic ammonia
ah which is a respiratory stimulant okay
we have many controversies whether it's
a respiratory retenter stimulant
it is a respiratory stimulant if you
don't have respiratory stimulant then
you have to go for a respiratory
irritant as an
option okay they're gonna ask you
there's 11 number blade which is useful
for the stab incision or abscess you can
see a pointed tip the next one is it's
the most commonly used blade that is the
15 number plate in the oral surgery
department
so angulations of injections 90 degrees
is intramuscular
to 45 is subcutaneous 25 is iv
and 10 to 15 is intra abdominal
parts of metallic syringe please do make
a note of this okay the parts of
metallic fringe they can ask you in the
sequence 2017
neat examination question what is
helen's tissue forceps
what is backhaug tissue forceps okay you
can see like this
the next one what is endotracheal tubes
this is cuffed right so cupped
endotracheal tube
the next comes is the contraindications
make a note about absolute
contraindications so these are absolute
contraindications of extraction
and these are relatable
contraindications where you can go with
the procedures
by taking some precautions and of course
this question was given in 2020 neet
examination
when you have a notch like this what is
mainly it's mainly due to the no bundle
that is passing through
so what you have to do how you have to
do you have to go for a split technique
for these things
so you have to split the teeth or break
the teeth into multiple pieces then you
have to extract
so this is again a familiar question
that is asked which what is this
the only landmark uh that is mental
foramen which can be diagnosed by
radiography you can take two different
angles of radiograph
and you can diagnose this mental foramen
and i hope most of you are familiar with
these classifications that is
a b okay c
and followed by the rammus relationship
that is class 1 class 2 class 3 and
these are the different
winter's classification positions of
molars
the next comes are the difficulty index
for the removal of the
impacted lower third molars okay so
so easiest is going to be difficulty is
going to be distributed
easiest is going to be a difficult is
going to be c easiest is going to be 1
difficulty is going to be 3 so basic
upon the calculation of these three
you're going to come to a difficult
index if it ranges from 7 to 10 that is
very difficult 5 to 7
that is moderately difficult three to
four that is minimal difficult
and i hope most of you are familiar with
this war lines or winter lines and i
don't want to discuss much but i'm going
to keep this
literature to be please do make a note
so white line is an occlusion reference
okay and the amber line represents the
level of the bone
and when a perpendicular is dropped from
the amber line to the imaginary place
where the elevator is applied that is
called as a red line
so red line is going to give an idea
that the amount of the bone
that should be removed before you take
the procedure
so please do make a note of all these
last lines which are very very important
to
convert into question what is this intra
ligamentary injection
so coming to intra alignment injection
is a solar type of injection for
a single teeth anesthesia and how it is
given where it is given so please do
make a note of these values
this is one more classification of
cartridges basing up on the color code
so what is gold that is arctic so please
do make a note of all these things
okay the next comes is the composition
of local anesthesia most of you are
familiar with so please do go with the
components and their functions when
you're talking about plane la
so all these are absent in the plane
area so they can ask you a question
which of the following are absent in the
case of plain ld
so please do make another methyl paraben
is a bacteriostatic agent
and sodium metabisulfite is an
antioxidant the next comes are the
needles
needle sizes that are used very peculiar
thing is something called a static
so this is a this is a block where a 30
gauge needle is used
rest all you can go for 27's
and here you go for either 25 or 27's
okay so when to go for like whenever
you're using 25s 27s
the blocks you're going for a long uh
long needle
long lengthy needle and rest all you are
going for a short needle
to make a note this is this is the
needle breakers okay
so uh the suggestion is like
in any any of the blocks like except in
the particle anesthesia in any blocks
you should not bend the needle for your
convenience
because whenever you bend the needle and
whenever it is penetrating more than
five millimeters in the soft tissue
there are high chances that the needle
breakers can occur so now the advantages
of a larger needle or the shorter needle
so please do make a note of this
and i hope most of you are familiar with
this that is a band or a
sta that is a single teeth anesthesia
which is a complete
uh which is a computer controlled
anesthesia
so please do please do add a note of
this literature what is a dynamic
pressure sensing technology so all these
are very very important new
things uh questions can be asked
the next comes is this is a
needle free injector what is yet
okay so please do make a note of this
okay they can ask you questions this is
pressure
syringe designed for the periodontal
ligament okay so they can ask you a
question over this particular area
where nowadays they're trying to find
some typical
typical typical diagrams to ask you
questions so these are the different
types of needles
so please do add a node second
generation needle for the periodontal
ligament injection
and all these just just have a glance
coming to the cleft flute and cleft
palate
so first thing that you have to make a
note is about the rule of ten which is
also called as millard's rule of ten
what is that 10 pounds 10 grams
10 000 count and less than 10 weeks
so the few other things that you have to
make about when i'm talking about the
clef the first important
lots of controversy regarding most of
these questions but i request all of you
to stick
on to this cleft lift is basically due
to the non-fusion of
medial nasal process plus
lateral maxillary process
and coming to the next one that is
pallet
pallet is basically due to the
non-fusion between the
two lateral
pallet process okay so nowadays
questions on is of
the repair are regularly asked so please
do add a note of this
lip clef lip is six months
cleft palate you can have hard and hard
and soft
okay hard hard palate and soft palate
soft palate you can go for six months
hard palate you have to go for double
that is six
12 to 18 months okay and when they give
a combination
that is combination of both that is lip
and palette combination so lip and
palette combination can be done in stage
one
stage one that is a uh can be done at
six months
or can be done at stage two that is when
you have a hard palate
then you have to go for 12 to 8 months
so it's mostly it moves around like
either six or 12 to eight months okay so
they can ask
rhinoplasty also rhinoplasty is once the
inter growth is done so rhinoplasty is
done after
16 to 18 years after the growth of the
segment
of the organ is complete
i hope you're done with this right
you're clear with this
good so the next important things i just
want to add few more important stuff
related to your preparation
one such important aspect that i want to
focus on is guys you just go back and
see all the instruments that are used in
your oral surgery departments which are
posted as pdfs on your groups please do
go through go through all the
instruments because those are the
regularly asked questions
uh in the examination point of view the
next comes is
the other important aspect that i want
to stress on uh
the first important aspect is okay uh
your fractures coming to the factors
that is you have your leaf hoods
so please go with the leafford fracture
uh
diagrams which were shared on the group
like how the
uh how the transfers of the fracture
line in the leaf would one leaf or two
are leaf or three
leaf one is also called as in a low
level fracture or urine
fracture or a horizontal fracture or a
telescopic fracture
whereas coming to the left to the left
is a pyramidal fracture
okay you can see a pyramidal like
structure in the diagram
okay that is also called as an infra
zygomatic fracture coming to the leaf
wood three fracture the leaf or three
fracture is a high level fracture
and it is also called as a supra
supra zygomatic fracture so so please do
look about this uh
bloat fracture and blowing fracture of
the orbit okay regularly asked questions
you can and i hope you can manage this
by seeing the diagrams and what are the
tests that are used
you know you can they can use the hess
test okay the one is the
s test and the second one is the forced
induction test they can be used and
they can ask you the questions related
to the maxillary sinus sinus when it is
formed 10 weeks
split is formed in 12 weeks what is the
lining of the maxillary sinuses by
and what is the surgery card will look
where you are going to give the
insertion and everything so please do
make your
diagram based off and everything when to
go for an incision when to go for just a
uh just a suture and a follow-up and
what to be done what are the tests to be
done because that's the question given
in
2020 need what are the signs for acute
or inter fistula and chronic horizontal
fistula okay so i hope your
acute is is by uh five years whereas
your chronic is by five piece and i hope
you are well familiar with that
please do go back your pp books and just
have a glance over
the factors and the recent recent like
lag screws how they are
your battle sign okay there are many
signs like your battle sign
most common uh fracture most common
fracture of the mandible is condyle
fracture and the least common factor is
coronite fracture condyle please do this
is a controversy again so go with
condyle is the most common fracture of
the
mandible and the least common fracture
is
fracture okay do do make a note of this
and the most common fracture in the head
and neck area is the
nasal bone the second most common
fracture is the
mandible okay if they are asking second
most common
mid facial fracture that is zygoma
mid facial is first is nasal second is
diagonal oral head neck
first is nice and second is mandela
so do make a note okay the next one is
the stages of anaesthesia
okay stages of anesthesia again what is
stage one what is stage two
what is stage three what is what is uh
what is the stage four okay and you have
a different planes in the case of your
stage three that is plane one
plane two plane three plane four what
occurs in each stays
and all these things are very very
important in examination
point of view then you i want you to
make a note about the levels of lymph
nodes
every year they're asking questions
levels of lymph nodes i want you to go
with the diagram also because they can
shade the particular level or grade of
lymph nodes and they can ask you which
level it is
so levels of lymph nodes are again
important what is i
1a what is 1b 1a is
submental 1b is
submandibular 2 is
a particular three is
middle jiggler okay so all these are
there in your
pp books this is a 20 20 neet question
third one
middle jiggler what is fourth lower
jupiter
so jugular are they starts from two to
three and four the next one is 45
level five level five is posterior
triangle
what is level six level six is anterior
compartmental
or central compartment what is level
seven
that is superior
mediastinal okay so
do do make a note about all these terms
like what is radical negation
okay what is extended radical neck
decision what is bilateral radical
negation
what is modified radical negative
session and in that what is
modified radical neck
dissection so in this so body fat
radical negation is something like
you have type 1 type 2 and type 3 in it
so type 1 where you are going to
pressure only spinal accessory now
type you are going to preserve both
spinal accessory now and internal
jugular vein and type three are going to
preserve
spinal accessory now internal jugular
vein and sternocleidomastoid muscle
okay so what is selective neck decisions
okay
so all these are discussed for you what
is supra higher neck decision what is
extended
supra iron next decision what is
posterior lateral neck decision what is
central compartmental neck decision all
these are important and please do make a
note
simultaneously what are the surgical
procedures which are done for the
uh cleft lip repair and the cleft palate
what are the surgical names okay please
do make a
note about the surgical names
and the next important areas to be
focused on when you're talking about
this
is your uh diagram based stuff okay so i
want you to go back
have a look over the diagram by stuff uh
related to this
okay and and i was talking like what is
this
acute acute uh oro and
fistula is identified by five e's right
i was talking about
what is this five is one is the escape
of fluid second one is ap status that is
bleeding from nose
escape of air and enhanced column of air
and you will have exaggerating pain and
coming to the chronic
the difference between acute and chronic
is 14 days
okay so when it is called as chronic
you'll have the 14 days
so you'll have five p's here what are
they one is pain
second one is persistence pleural
discharge
that is foul smell or unilateral nasal
discharge is
there the next piece post national drip
will be there the next phase possible
sequel of
general systemic illness or systemic
symptoms will be there
and the most common route that goes into
this maxillary sinus is parallel root
and the most common teeth which is very
close is maxillary first molar
and the distance between the floor and
the roots of the maxillary posterior
teeth is somewhere around like one to
one point five centimeters
and maxillary sinus grows to its maximum
size by 18 years
okay so these are the things that you
have to make and what i'm talking about
the maxillary
sinus okay so i mean like i just want to
add a few words about this
like ankylosis so in gap arthroplasty
the minimum gap required to prevent
re-ankylosis is one sentiment one
centimeter is a gap that is required
in the treatment of acute dislocation of
mandible the mandible should be more
downward and backward direction this is
how you're going to
solve that immobilization should be
carried for
a duration of one to two weeks not more
than that because more than that leads
to ankylosis
during the procedure of reduction of
acute tempo mandibular joint
ankylosis dislocation few drops of la
local anesthesia are deposited in the
case of your glenoid fossa
and during your treatment procedures
that is uh when you're planning to go
for the treatment procedures
so where do you where you're going to
inject the inject the solutions or
inject this
steroids or anything because steroids
acts as an anti-inflammatory
okay so these steroids are regularly
given the case of an osteoarthritis
or in the case of any any sort of
inflammatory diseases related to the
temperamental joint
they should be given in the superior
superior space of the
joint you have both superior as well as
inferior so you want to given the
superior space of the joint
the next comes go go with all the
diagrams which are there in your oral
surgery part
uh in your pp book volume four it's very
very very very important which cannot be
missed at
any cost your suturing techniques your
fracture lines your fractures
your incisions and your instrumentations
all these are very very important which
cannot be neglected
at any cost okay so i
again the same goes your maximum doses
of local anesthesia given the maximum
doses of
epinephrine that is given in a normal
individual and in the case of your
cardiac patient
all these are important which cannot be
negative the first local anesthesia is
cocaine colloquia which has a
vasoconstrictor activity is again the
cocaine
okay so all these like bio uh where does
the biological transformation of each
and every
things takes place and thanks next
question is uh
structures which are encountered during
the lumbar puncture where lumbar
puncture is given
okay so spinal anesthesia can be
performed safely
uh between l2 to l3
that is interpretable space in the
adults this is a this is a place
and where a case of children it is l4 to
l5 okay so these are the areas where you
are going to
do this the next comes the next comes
out the structures which are which are
involved in the
lumbar puncture are again this is a
question that is given in the
aims examination that is skin followed
by
subcutaneous tissue
followed by supraspinous
ligament followed by intra spinous
ligament followed by
ligamentous flavium followed by
dura mater followed by arachnoid space
so finally you're going to reach that
uh arcanoid space okay so these are the
important things
that you have to make you know just go
with your pp books final anesthesia
notes
notes of three or four four pages what
is uh
what is beats block okay what is beats
block and uh
i mean like few questions like what is
ring block uh all these are
uh well well organized and well given so
please do go with that content
which is very very important examination
point of view
okay so done for uh done from my point
of view related to the oral surgery
and uh please do well study well
okay so try to be confident that's
really required so if you're getting
panic
it is something like you're losing your
own score okay so
like if you feel like depressed if you
feel like panic if you if you're not
able to finish the things off
so all these negative signs will
definitely decrease your score
like whatever you can do in these five
days just go do
go under the examination hall with all
the confidence levels and just
give your best shot this is what maximum
a
an aspirant can do in the last five to
six days very smart like
don't get depressive if you get
depressed it's simple logic that
you are spoiling your scores so what
best we can do
just give it that's what you i everyone
here are to do okay signing off dr
