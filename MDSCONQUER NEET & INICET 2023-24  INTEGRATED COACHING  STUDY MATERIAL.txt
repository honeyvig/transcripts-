for Success that
the credit I wanted to give for MDS

their
weekly schedules helped me a lot I would
like to thank team mba's conquers which
has helped me throughout my preparation
for the juniors who are preparing your
joint a team which is well planned and
organized and all you have to do is just
study
you have to know your priorities and
your limitations and success will be
behind you a small amount of quality
preparation since day one is more
important than sternous depression
during the last four months MDS conquer
family makes you to be consistent
day-to-day updates and everything which
we need to learn in the BDS in my view
PP books are very important uh follow
them I would request all the Juniors to
continue to work hard and may you get
all the success you have to be very
clear about your goals know your
priorities know your limitations and
then be patient persevere that's it
throughout my preparation there are many
ups and downs but search motivation and
timely guidance but
