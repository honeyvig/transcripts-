hi awareness
i'm back here
to give some brief idea about your
schedule and managing the time
so i hope most of the dates are fixed
i mean the chances are very very less
that your exam can be postponed so you
can consider these dates as the
final dates for now so your
i c i need simply considered as ames
because you have only aim seats
that is going to be on 20th november
and the next one is the big day that is
going to be neat on 16th december
so first of all if you just consider the
difference between the dates
okay if you consider the difference
between the 20th november
and the 16th december it is hardly
24 days okay so make a note
you will not have much time lap between
aims and need
and of course the neat result will be
out probably
a week or 10 days
after the exam so the result will be
mostly will be on the end of november or
maybe the initial days of december so
whatever may be the result whether it's
a good result or a bad result
anything just prepare your mind that you
will be
psychologically a bit disturbed by
seeing your scores or
by seeing your performance so we have
some expectations
we may or may not reach the expectations
but you will be psychologically deviated
can be positive can be negative so i
want you guys to get prepared for that
okay so there is going to be a day
in between 20th november 2020 to 16th
december 2020
where your aims result is going to be up
so get prepared for that okay that's the
first important thing
because i have seen so many students in
the last few years
suffering a lot after the ames result
they don't keep aims as a target but
they suffer
after seeing the result so that is a
normal psychology of an
of every individual we aim very high we
don't aim
but we feel like we aim for that okay so
people are getting disturbed after the
result
so i don't want people who really don't
aim for aims
don't get psychological even if you're
aiming for aims then
okay your disturbance can be taken into
consideration so that's the first
important thing
and my special consideration for each
and every one
to apply for this examination and make
sure you give this exam
so you can ask me the reason i always
says your aims or
now it is called as i ici and et is
going to be the trailer version of your
need
so once you give this exam in the
initial exam you'll get to know that
where you are lagging
and how you are psychologically well or
strong in the examination few people
they do their performance at the best
when it is
an examination on a mobile or on a
laptop in a room
but once they see the crowd they may get
psychologically disturbed once they
are going through a traffic in a
metropolitan city like hyderabad
or any other city like mumbai or
bangalore
okay so what happens is when you're
going through
that traffic on the day you may get
deviated you may get disturbed
okay so that disturbance can cause some
sort of effect on the examination
we but we are not aware of that but the
aims exam is going to give such
awareness
so many of the people were not on time
at the examination hall
miss the exam so that's a precaution
that you have to take for the need
because if you want to give neet by
skipping this you have to wait for one
more year
right so similarly few people they have
some uh
phobia towards the examination hauler
towards the
crowd okay so they get panic and few
people
okay like you i mean like most of you
were studying in your hometowns now that
you have to move to give examination to
the metropolitan cities
stay stay in a in a place for overnight
and then give the exam
so they have some some problems or
overnight stay okay so all these has to
be taken into consideration once you
give aims
you'll get an idea okay this is where
i'm lagging this is the way
i mean all these what i have discussed
are very very minor things which are
nowhere related to your preparation
but they're going to affect your result
so all these can be
prevented so prevention is important
right so prevented by giving aims you'll
get to know so many new things that okay
so these are the precautions that i have
to take these are the things that i have
to focus on
so apart from the subject wise there are
many other aspects where you are going
to get benefited if you give aim so i
personally request
each and every student of mds conquer
make sure
you give aims examination which is going
to be the trailer of your
original need so
yes perfect so the next important aspect
like before i'm talking about the things
what you need to do how you need to
organize
make sure each and every one okay
whether you have started preparation now
whether you have started preparation
long back
make sure you try to give your best from
this point
i don't want to make a general uh make a
vague statement of
about the generalized preparation but
whatever may be
your levels of preparation because
everyone has their limitations in the
preparation
that's what i analyzed in the past seven
years few people they can work only up
to five hours few people they can work
only up to two hours few people they can
work
only when their kids are on the bed okay
so these are the different things okay
so i don't want to
uh like judge your preparation but my
strong belief is as much as you invest
your time on the preparation the better
the outcomes are
so for example if i am considering 15
hours
per day as your preparation time
make sure you split this 15 hours
into five parts okay part one
part two part three part four
part five so each part you are going to
carry
three hours
if you are not well strong with the
present
topic of discussion on the day okay
make sure you drop two parts if you are
not good at
two parts means six hours to present
subject
but if you are good at for example if
you are already done with this
you drop just one part only one part
means three hours for revision of the
topic which is on the tip
if you are not good or if you are not
very confident make it two parts that's
going to be six hours
so what you are going to do in the next
rest of the nine hours
okay so what you are going to do in the
rest of the nine hours its very clear
that i told you
there is a packet there is a pack or a
bunch of subjects which are completely
memory based
what are their first year subjects
anatomy which is included in this
in this round okay then the second
subject biochemistry
okay then coming to the second year
subject pharmacology
your microbiology
then coming to the general medicine plus
physiology
okay and if you want to include you can
include dental materials
dental anatomy plus dental histology
again dental anatomy dental histology
are a part of this combo okay
so these are two will be covered as of
now but this pack of subjects are
solidly memory based
and out of which 100 days memory based
with less concepts is going to be your
pharmacology maybe there may be few
concepts related to your
pharmacokinetics and dynamics but most
of your pharmacology is memory based
so make sure you give importance to this
combination
along with oral path oral medicine and
radiology
every day three hours so keep it every
day three hours it can be your pp books
for example you're doing the same
subjects in the pp books okay consider
it as three hours
so from now every day three hours has to
be given to these subjects what are they
anatomy which is going to carry 14 marks
for neet
biochemistry which is going to carry
seven marks pharmacology which is going
to carry 14
micro which is going to carry 14 general
medicine physio which is going to carry
21
dental materials is going to be 14
dental anatomy dental histology 14
oral pathology is 14 oral medicine and
radiology is 14.
so there are decent number of scores
which are included in this
bulk of subjects which are going to drop
three hours per day
as you are covering anatomy and dental
anatomy dental astrology in this
combination
okay you can give rest all subjects
rest all subjects you can recently are
done with pharmacology microbiology
okay general medicine and physio so you
give more importance to keep
dm or biochem and this oral path oral
medicine combination in this
three hours per day so every day three
hours for example if a person is able to
study only ten hours
so every day give two hours if you are
able to study 15 15 plus
every day give three hours for this
combination of subjects which are
solidly
memory based so what you are going to do
in this three hours so in the left over
three hours
make sure you give one end of our time
for exam every day
do one or other exam exam which is
already done just go through the
question and answer as an explanation
or we are going we are planning to
upload as number of exams as possible
from now
so do some sort of examination and make
sure as
our first examination is going to be
aimed so make sure make sure you try to
be active in the morning
nine to 12 so don't don't get up late
okay
make sure you you you habituate the
habit of get upping
like waking up at seven six or seven
because on the exam day again you have
to get up early because
uh you need to be one hour uh one one
hour before the examination
okay so you need to be as they have
given nine you have to be there at eight
so from your place you have to travel
okay it may take one hour minimum
roughly we take one hour so you need to
start from your place
minimum at seven so you need to get up
have your breakfast
you need to you need to have your bath
so so on the day you're going you you
make sure that you have to get up at
least at five o'clock
at least at five o'clock so so from now
make sure you
you just try to wake up at at least six
or seven
so that your you should be active and
make your adrenal levels should be
active by nine
so that you can perform well on the day
of examination that you have to
uh practice from now right so make sure
you you try to utilize this nine to 12
the time between nine o'clock to eleven
o'clock uh use one
at least try to give some sort of
examination or try to
make me try to give some like to try to
see the laptop
with high resolution so that your eyes
will get strained and you will get
you will get adapted to the system so
the next one and half hour
okay you can keep for your pp books
you can keep for your short notices
so now we are going to start 32 series
okay starting to serious videos you can
you can drop those 32 series videos in
this
apart from that we are planning to start
new video series
which is going to focus on the important
aspects of aims and
need very specific to the examination so
you can give such the crime for this
and of course we are going to uh drop
some
energy energy shots okay so so we are
planning to drop some
energy shots uh that are going to be a
pdf containing few
uh important mcqs or single liners uh
mostly memory based so all that extra
things you you have to keep
for your for your conquer discussion
what's up discussions and everything
so what you are going to do in this left
over three hours is
your wish
if you if you have any backlogs cover
them
or if you feel like you're bad at a
particular subject cover them
or if you feel like apart from the
material of mds conquer you need to do
something extra few people
have that they collect information from
all the sources okay i'm missing this i
want to come
okay you do whatever you wish you do
okay your backlogs or your revision or
if you are not able to manage in six
hours extend here
if you are not able to manage this three
hours extend here if you're not able to
manage this three hours extend here
so this is a time or three hours is a
time where you have to manage the things
so i hope very clear
right you have to split it into five
parts two parts give to the present
subject
one part due to this pack of memory
based subjects
okay and the next part okay what is the
next part one part
you try to cover the examination and try
to cover
all these things and the left four part
is the managing okay for example
i feel like i need to revise into three
hours you give three hours into
so you three give three hours and try to
finish and
next day try to manage operative three
hours
if you're not able to finish okay make
it two days and two days operator
so in a week you can cover two days
operator three hours three hours
two days into three hours three hours
and followed by three days
prosthetics three hours three hours so
totally six hours of windows six hours
of operating and nine hours of
prosthetics you're going to cover the
pack of endo
conservative and the prosthetics of
course you're covering dental metals
here every day
so you're going to cover that entire
pack of subjects which are
which are which are strongly related to
one another so this is how
you have to organize yourself to make
your preparation better
right so of course there is a slight
difference between
the mode of examination of aims and need
but overall the subject what you have to
prepare for is common for
both exams right so aims and need we
have slight difference
right so but the subject is
same so don't come with the conclusion
that what i have to read for aims what i
have to read for me
it's same okay the subject what you
prepare is same
but you may get exposed to few repeats
the repeats will be
updated very soon on the group so
simultaneously
on one side you can start doing the
repeats
and we'll have some special video based
discussions on the
recent question papers of both aims as
well as neat
don't worry about that okay so once the
prospectives are clearly
out i am going to update a video over
the ames
uh i i and i ct preparation
so as of now we will talk what we are
going to do
in this upcoming days okay so now you
have splitted
what how you have splitted your 15 hours
is being splitted into three
three three three
and three right so in this three hours
we have present subject
in this three hours memory based subject
in this one and half hour you're going
to include pp books all extra stuff
of mds conquer in this you are going to
plan your daily examinations or do some
examinations
okay so finally
the leftover three hours is managing all
or you can do whatever you want your
wish
right so what you are going to do in
this three hours now i am going to
explain six hours i am going to explain
now
okay so first of all from tomorrow we
will be covering oral surgery
so started with oral surgery why i have
selected oral surgeries
oral surgery is the easiest among the
list of subjects
easy it's more often a clinical based so
first a day exert onshare exodus
is not going to eat your time it's
hardly going to take
four hours of your time but i have given
six hours you can cover it in four hours
okay so what you are going to cover in
exodus is very simple that exodus
uh you need to cover the indications
contraindications
absolute contraindications relatively
contraindications
may cannot try to cover the
complications of extraction
or exodus particularly dry socket is
very very important
common at which teeth how much
percentages of
particular teeth will get affected by
dry socket all these are important
things theories of dry socket
okay management of dry socket all these
are
then extraction coming to extraction the
order of extraction
which teeth will get will be first
extracted in a full mouth extraction
which is lost similarly when you are
talking about
your impaction okay so what are the
different types of impaction techniques
what we use what are the instruments
that are used
what what are the suturing material that
are used most common type of impactions
in maxilla most common type of
impactions in the mandible
okay what is the relationship between
your mandible or third molar roots to
that of the mandibular canal or inferior
alveolar canal
okay so all these are most complications
of your
impaction okay the suturing techniques
that you follow
during the impaction all these are
important aspects that you have to focus
when we are talking specifically related
to exodus this is a
strong area and a area where they can
ask you questions
so particularly you need to learn about
your uh
steroid therapy during uh during this
minor surgeries and
uh extraction okay make a note about
that steroid therapy
and here you have to make a note about
your um
antibiotics which are given okay so
antibiotics which are given
and followed by the anesthetes which are
given so you can relate it to your
pharmacology over there
and for example you need to make a note
about the contraindication procedures
which are contraindicated in the case of
infective endocarditis what are the
dental procedures
and what is the prophylactic treatment
that you are going to give what is the
prophylaxis
antibiotic reflex is what you are going
to give all those iv ratios
percentages what is the percentage in
the children what is the percentage in
that
all these are important which comes
under the medical management of oral
surgery so
your all emergency procedures will be
covered over here so
everything was clearly detailedly
covered as a single videos
uh in your medical emergencies okay
so please do finish those videos that is
more than sufficient so part of general
anesthesia in general
uh uh local
to your anaesthesia pharmacology part
open open
open your pharmacology smart videos if
you're not done with this please try to
finish off this local anesthesia general
anesthesia part
which is very very very important so the
first important aspect is
this is very very important i'll give
three star out of three
medical emergencies is three star out of
three and followed by the general and
local anesthesia is three out of three
so rest over i can i can drop
two two ratings okay so you have your
tempo mandible or joint disorders
maxillary sinus and its complications
system tumor surgical part
because the clinical part is already
done in oral path normal medicine
and of course the max official trauma
i'm going to give it three starts among
the rest
so orthognathic surgeries cleft flute
craft palette is going to be three stars
you need to
learn each and every corner
pre-prosthetic surgery nowadays fabric
for the most of the paper setters that
is a three-star and facial
neuropathy malignancies and the recent
advances i'm going to drop to start so
this is how
you have to finish the things by
following the
group so individually i'm going to help
you like what to be done on that
particular day
the next comes is we need to handle the
general surgery
okay so general surgery the major
content of general surgery is going to
be this
particular aspect this one this one
and this one major okay
so all these are i'll drop three stars
and most of these are not covered
anywhere your av
avd disorders are not covered anywhere
of course the swellings of neck and head
are covered
uh in your oral pattern oral medicine
but c sulcus
all these areas are very very important
your burns is very very important you
can see the recent need there are
questions on burns there are questions
on
replacement fluid replacement okay so
all these are
like you need to cover well most of
these are very well
uh linked with the smart video session
okay so
it's going to be easy for you to finish
the things fast don't worry about this
just try to follow the group uh i feel
like hard
it's going to take six hours to maximum
seven to eight for few topics
per day to complete this topics
at the best okay so this is how what we
planned for
the general surgery so the next comes is
perio so
most of the perio aspects are
interlinked with your dental histology
so so on 17th we are planning to cover
calculus gingivitis gingival enlargement
and how all this ginger is in general
is going to hardly take two hours your
calculus is going to take one hour so
it's going to be just three to four hour
schedule
where you can cover in six hours the
defense mechanism
different types of periodontitis
prognosis and all these are you are very
very good at this
so it's very easy to finish off when i'm
talking about the pocket different types
of pocket true pocket false pocket
complex pocket simple pocket compound
pocket
so you're different like patterns of
bone loss trauma from occlusion
so all the clinical features everything
has to be coordinated instruments
is of course uh a three-star one that
you have to make you know
plaque control okay your flap surgeries
is again a three-star one
they have given a question on focation
treatment of grades you you need to link
your grades
with the diagram based questions and
followed by which you have to link with
the treatment plan so so i'm going to
give three star for this so these are
the
important things that you have to make
when you're talking about perio
so then comes is the dental anatomy and
dental histology
so this is going to be the toughest part
of
an autumn dental anatomy which is well
well covered on the videos so just watch
the videos and try to solve the mcqs
so that's going to be more than
sufficient and
calcification direction sequences are
very very important
so that's the main content of dental
anatomy so dental anatomy is morally a
memory based so that you have to cover
on every day every daily basis
like you have to take a single teeth and
you have to talk
talk about the single teeth so you
should be very strong related to the
anatomical
aspects of all the teeth okay so the
next comes is when you're moving to
histology histology is something like a
reading a newspaper
you feel happy when you read but
you may be saturated or you may be you
may feel like this is this is going to
be volatile once you're done with this
but
i'm going to prepare a proper sequence
for this so that you can finish it fast
and you can return it for longer
duration of time so all the soft tissues
you're going to cover with the enamel
indented in one day
and occlusion is the thing you have to
give up most importance if you're not
done well with this
in your prosthetics or in your ortho so
a forensic codonology i have given one
day so which is going to be more than
sufficient i have dropped an extra two
days over here
to complete any backlogs if you have
so so taking this schedule as a base and
you
have to prepare your own schedule
according to your convenience or
according to your commitments maybe you
may have some event
in your family in the upcoming a week or
or after after a 10 days so
you have to allocate your subject basing
upon your convenience
so the next or the last is your general
anatomy
with histology and embryology so
histology and embryology have given up
most importance
because most of us we ignore these two
topics so osteology and everything will
be done well by most of us but we
neglect this so i'm going to prepare
videos over this
i mean most of them are already covered
in the video based discussions but i'm
going to
prepare an exclusive videos over general
embryology and histology
to make it simple because recent need
has given some
sort of diagram based questions related
to general histology so it's it's our
it's at most important that you have to
learn
more and you have to work hard on all
the diagrams also
so followed by third and fourth we are
going to have the revision
and followed by the fifth is going to
your exam and from fifth
to your number twentieth so it's going
to be two weeks
you're going to have your final
examination of from here
in 24 days you're going to have your
neat exam
so i'm going to update the schedules
once the dates are locked
okay once the dates are locked we will
try to
modify and update the schedule so i'm
just going to go back
so what i told you is every day you need
to drop
some time for other subjects one is
all memory based subjects so what are
all memory based subjects your
pharmacology
your anatomy
your biochemistry your physiology
your dental materials
your microbiology
your dental anatomy dental histology
your general medicine so these are the
memory based subjects which i told you
to do
every day three hours so
left over you have schedule of three
hours every day
so what my suggestion is along with
ortho
along with ortho i request you to do
ortho and pedo
so along with oral surgery i request you
to do the revision of arthur and peter
so you can keep artha and peter ortha
and peter
you can keep artha and pedo
arthur because there's some important
common topics you can see
your uh orthogonal surgery is common
topic
cleft lift cleft palate is a common
topic okay
so you can you can just overlap them so
that's the main reason why i'm including
here
right so this day you can do general
anesthesia organisation which is a
common topic for pharmacology you can
finish it off
pre-prosthetic surgery here you can do
prostho on the
here you can do prostho on this day so
this is how you have to manage this
three hours so what you're doing one
two three four so four threes you're
giving 12 hours of revision time
for ortho and feed up and you're doing
your oral surgery so you give three
hours of
revision time for prosthetics along with
the pre-prosthetic surgery one topic is
common for both these subjects
so next comes is the general surgery so
along with this my suggestion is
along with this thyroid learn the
anatomy of thyroid also here
learn some general surgery general
medicine related endocrine parts
endocrinology finish endocrinology of
you you try to revise the physiology
general medicine endocrinology here
because you are talking about the
diseases of endocrine
your parathyroid thyroid adrenal gland
all these are diseases right
so you just try to cover that subject
along with this in this particular day
giving the three hours
okay so diseases of surgery diseases of
oral
salivary glands and infections you try
to cover your overall path in oral
medicine three hours on this day
here also you try to cover oral path
oral medicine three hours
or else you can keep some sort of end
endo three hours end or three hours you
can cover operator here
so once you're done with this with the
period
you can cover other subjects like
prostho you can cover three hours
make sure you try to touch each and
every subject in the last 30 days so
this
plan of like 30 odd days or 20 or 8 odd
days make sure
you prepare a schedule which you are
weak at and make sure you try to cover
all the subjects apart from the things
which are we plan to discuss or we plan
according to the schedule so you can
keep our
we are done with orthopedic we are done
with endo so you can keep conservative
over here
so dental materials anyway you are doing
every day three hours in the memory
based
memory based aspect according to your
schedule you prepare your own schedule
okay so we are done with we are done
with the most of the subjects in the
in the previous modules okay so you can
keep some community for two days
community day one community day two okay
followed by you can keep your radiology
you can cover on one day
one day two days radiology
and then at the last phase i feel like
you need to you need to balance like you
need to i mean
we are planning to drop so many videos
on general discussions of uh the topics
the minor topics and everything and try
to cope up like prepare your
own you okay and try to try to
make sure that you try your best to
cover the schedule
so keeping your target is good no one is
