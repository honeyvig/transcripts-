yeah hi venus uh very very good morning
one and all uh hope you're doing good
fine and ongoing with your preparation
okay
i hope you're done with your mark 10
today
okay so
a few important things i feel like i
need to discuss with you first of all my
question for all of you
are you happy
with a notification that was released by
nbe people
uh yesterday
on the website
it's a mixed feeling right it's a mixed
feeling but what i can tell from my side
is
i am so happy for this damn happy for
this because i have seen
uh the pain of the students who has been
disqualified for this exam
uh short by 10 days 10 15 days so many
people throughout the country
were disqualified for this exam because
of the internship dates
okay so i am very very happy for the
individuals because
finally with the gods grace or some
magic okay regularly
we are now eligible for exam and i hope
like most of you who are in touch with
me
who are on our respective groups are
reading so hard without taking a break
even if they are disqualified for this
exam that sounds very great and
extraordinary i i because
the thing is your ideology
and your hard work
okay and the most what you take during
the difficult situations
is going to be the outcome of an
individual okay tough situations will
come for every individual and how you
behave in a tough situation is what you
are is what the success is going to be
people call it as success but it's not
success is something like a refined
product that comes out when you're
heated to a high temperatures above your
limitations regularly that we discuss in
your dental materials right it's almost
the same people face so tough situations
particularly the people who are not
eligible for this exam but they are a
category of individuals who has never
left the home who are moving along with
their preparation so those people will
have an extra edge when compared to
others
okay i am very glad to see uh such
category of people in our list
okay the next important thing i want to
focus on is the few important aspects
first of all there is lots of confusions
okay there's lots of confusions among
the list the most important thing i want
to stress is the point number two okay
so in this point number two the very
important thing is because i got so many
uh calls and so many messages
uh from the past two days telling that
the exam will be in the month of july
no no no be clear okay read things clear
okay don't blindly follow the contents
which are being shared on the google or
which are being shared on the social
media or which are being shared on
different different groups
with their uh prospective or anything
okay but do read this okay your
internship is being clearly read this
the completion of internship
for the purpose of eligibility of neet
mds
2022 is being extended to
3107.2022 this is extension of
internship not the date of exam the date
of exam is not still at out
okay
probably within a couple of days they
are going to release
uh
the application form again because there
are few people who has missed the
application okay because of their
personal reasons we have so many such
people in the list okay so don't miss
this time and of course the
interns who are not eligible for the
exam now their eligibility criteria has
been included so now you have to fill
the forms so during the form
form the the portal for the form is open
okay they are going to tell you the
dates of exam and probably the dates of
exam are going to hit
in and around uh may
second or third week probably may second
or third week that's going to be the
same i mean these dates were already
released for the medical students so
your exam will be one month one week
before the medical exam or one week
after the medical exam 99 percentage and
do make a note you have your ini seat
next round in the same month okay so now
neat and ironic ct are overlapping so
the competition will be heavy for imic
previously may session we used to have a
little bit less competition but now
you'll have a powerful computation for
uh
cd also so what we'll do is we'll try to
try to manage both and we'll try to do
at the best right so this is one
important thing which is very very
important in the notification that was
being released yesterday okay
clear internship is being extended
3107.2022
and i hope your juniors are back to the
pavilion they're they
they're in their colleges and i don't
want any any of the interns now to
extend their
uh
now now to finish their internship
basically you can take you can take a
break okay it's a peak time you can take
a break nothing wrong because your
internship dates now been extended for
30 107 202 to anyone after finishing
their exam in may you have june july
time decent time to finish your
internship and
to get yourself into this particular
eligibility criteria i hope this is very
clear right okay right so the next
important thing i want to focus on is
now
okay many of you okay you you're very
good at the preparation phase okay uh
you you're doing good in the mock exams
uh with a little bit of disability with
a little bit of
uh in confidence or little bit of
vacuums here and there now luckily god's
grace okay okay you have to take these
things
in a positive direction okay in a
positive way that your vacuums your uh
i mean the areas
the backlogs and everything you have it
you have a time not not a very huge time
hardly like i can i can i can tell you
like one day for
short subjects extra or two days for uh
long subjects we have discussed like
open subjects and close subjects so
close subjects you can keep one more day
extra you can solve more questions you
can just go with the contents checklist
which i'm going to post further in the
next video probably within one or two
days okay so please uh stay tuned to the
group and stay tuned to the youtube
channel for the people who are following
mds funker so you can check it off the
checklist that are mandatory for both
ironic as well as need that you have to
do from your site and uh now what my uh
my prospective is now you need to plan
well
you need to plan plan is very important
a goal without a plan is just a wish
show you got a few more days added to
your preparation few more hours added to
the preparation a few more mock exams
added to the preparation because as of
now previously we had uh 10 uh inice and
followed by 15 neet mock exams 25 now i
may extend it up to five more okay and i
don't want to change the schedule uh so
we'll we'll
we'll try to pop up and go with the same
schedule
and we'll do some modifications here and
there to make your preparation more easy
comfortable and more accurate okay i
hope you're very very clear about
the contents uh which i am
uh focusing on right so the next
important thing uh what to be done now
it's the biggest question okay so my
suggestion for every one of you is
first of all don't get relaxed
i'm seeing so many students uh
previously once the exam
has been shifted from december to may i
have seen so many of you
uh being relaxed
i can see offline students going back to
the home to the vacation
no one is responding on the group no one
is giving exam all the time no that's
not right that's that's a bad attitude
okay
the thing is uh it's very simple if the
exam is being postponed means
in a race track okay you have one more
lap that is being added previously if
you assume lab 1 lab 2 and lab 3 where
we thought like our exam is going to be
done by uh
march 6th and we are being prepared for
this okay because we are just short of
two weeks for this and now what happened
is suddenly uh there is one more lap is
added four clap is added 30 30 more days
are added to the preparation it doesn't
mean that you need to take a break no
one is going to take a break on a race
track so now you are on a race track and
i don't want anyone to break anyone to
take a break or
to take a uh to take a nap
on the preparation track on the race
track now the only thing is just one
more lap is being added and how well you
finish this lap is going to be important
so as always i always discuss like
in in a restoration in a composite
registration or an amalgam registration
whatever you do the most important step
of course cavity preparation the initial
kick okay but
the patients and everything the most
important is finishing and polishing
that is the last one and of course you
watch a movie the climax is very very
important climax is going to get
similarly
the last lap is very very important on a
race track now we thought previously the
the lab three is the last one but now uh
because of some uh changes and
modifications lab four is being added so
the importance of lab three now is being
shifted to lab four
i hope you you you you're not missing
the logic here lives life always moves
on logic success always moves on logic
but most of us
we we ignore the logics okay so now
fourth lap is very important
fourth lap is how much important
how much important is an mds seat for
you
how much important is a government
dental college seat for
how much important is dentistry
how much important is dentistry for you
is that much important is the lab for
so i want everyone to give
hundred percentage in this lab for
without any complaints okay because
every day when i used to talk with you
when i when i when i see your messages
when i attend your calls okay
when i meet you in the offline centers
or when i meet you in the interactions
in your respective colleges because i i
met few of you in
bhubal few of you throughout the costly
area in the last 10 days every one every
senior is coming and feeling bad for
their preparation that they have done
this they have done that god's grace you
got 30 more days added to your
preparation roughly
and use them wise
use them wise you got some gift from the
god and it has to be used in the best
way to get the best outcome
okay right so what to be done and
everything will be
will be discussed on your respective
groups and i'm going to give you
checklist so you can prepare your
customized schedules and everything okay
and there will be slight modification in
our mock exams as i said like we are all
already done with 10 and i'm going to
add 10 more okay and few more ini cd
stuff and let's work hard to make the
things simple easy and to hit that uh uh
the border of success okay right so
we'll work hard uh i have some plans
from my side but i need one or two days
for the plans to be displayed in the
most uh
i mean organized way to you so that we
can do well with this okay right i hope
that things are clear the most important
thing
the reason why is first of all feel
happy
for your friends who are disqualified
for the exam now they're being qualified
because
losing an ear
losing an ear in a professional life
just because of the negligency
of few individuals okay it's going to be
so so painful you don't have any
involvement here okay you have not
quitted your exams covered is not uh
not i mean the covert is not created by
you okay right so your mistake is not
there but even if you
if you if if one year of your
disturbance in your professional life is
going to create a major impact so we
have to feel very very happy for this
call the second thing i'm i'm a bit
bit sorry i don't know why they give uh
they release the notification for
medical students ahead
and they don't bother about the dental
students uh i don't know this this is
happening from
tickets to decades okay so i'm not much
interested bothered to probe this
discuss about this but i feel like
they should give some most important to
the dentistry because
let it be being a doctor or being a
dentist okay whatever the classification
and criteria they don't have i don't
mind about that but we are individuals
we are individuals we are humans we have
emotions
and
we are working some something good to
our profession to the society but
every year every time this happens i
still remember
the 2012 neet examination when i was
preparing for my entrance for the first
time and same goes okay so it irritates
the
preparation phase because what i
strongly believe is internship or final
year handling eight subjects internship
roaming around all the departments
handling so many things and followed by
post internship where the opportunities
are low okay so dentistry and dentists
they go through lots of stress
of course i i'm not comparing with a
medical medical student okay everyone
has their equal importance that what my
my my thought process is very clear
everyone has an equal importance
and
the professional respect should be equal
to everyone at every level and i also
want you to
inculcate the same
how you handle your uh
js resistant
how you handle your junior doctor
how you handle
that your colleagues your juniors is how
your seniors are going to handle you is
how the higher authorities are going to
handle you so how what you give it's
going to come back so all my students
and all the followers so please try to
inculcate this in your habit like then
you will get your professional value in
the society but i felt very sorry for
all the people who are involved in this
taken so much of time this is going to
break the heads of the students do this
do that jump
whether to start whether to go ahead
whether to plan for the next year it's
always eating
eating the
peace which is really required for any
individual any human peace is more
important happiness is more important so
it's a purposeless we thought of its
december then they came with july then
they said that it's march then they said
it four to six weeks
i don't know what is happening with
these people okay
they're sound enough to
have that common sense
anyway
i'm i'm i'm not much interested to talk
about this
nonsense over here but what i can say
whatever it is just take the things to a
positive note that our friends
our colleagues
okay uh
cousin i mean they have not done any
mistakes so they should not get punished
okay so this is a good call late but
okay it's a good call and we all should
feel happy for this the only suggestion
from my side is
don't
relax
stay
focused
and work hard because you are on the lab
for
and if you relax
the people going to run ahead of you
keep these words in the mind okay let's
meet in the next video with the
checklist of all the subjects
and
we'll come out with few more rapid
revision videos
of course now we got so many requests
about
plan some
rapid revision or this i'm not very sure
because the schedule was so packed
but if it's any anything
that we are planning to make your
preparation more comfortable i'll let
you know in a couple of days
yeah as of now uh thank you signing off
dr srikanth from team mds bunker uh
yes do subscribe the channel for the
further updates and do like the video so
that it will reach the people who really
requires this okay so the next video we
are planning is on the checklists on the
checklist of
uh
uh section
b subjects so i'll be focusing first on
section b followed by the video on
checklist of section here and i hope you
know the difference between section here
and section b according to the neat
blueprint that is being given by nb
people
bye take care
