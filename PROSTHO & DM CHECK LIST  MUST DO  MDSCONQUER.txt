yeah hi winners hope you're doing good
so the next subject
we are going to start is prosto
integrated with dental materials
so as already discussed to you that DM
uh in my schedule is being splitted into
different different parts the major
parts uh are going to be to one is
integrated with prostheim
and second integrated with operate
so apart from that like uh Ortho related
DM will be done during orthopath pedo
related DM will be done during pedo part
and Endo related DM will be done during
endopath but uh it is it is very very
minimal okay so most of your TM is
basically integrated with prosthetics
and operative Dentistry okay so now as
we are doing Pros though the few areas
of DM will be integrated with
prosthetics so this is not the plan so
coming to uh the targeting areas and
most of you are preparing for need
followed by ini CET
okay so neat blueprint has clearly given
that the prosto is going to carry 14
marks okay and inict the number ranges
from uh 10 to 20. okay it varies okay
sometimes you get more closer questions
uh and sometimes you get a very minimal
across the questions but it ranges from
10 to 14 and you can keep it the average
15 as a limitation for it
so as most of you are inclined towards
these two examinations okay so uh your
scoring will be like 14 to 15 approach
the part and I can keep like out of 14
uh marks of dental materials uh so
integrated part of integrated part of DM
towards the pros though uh will be
somewhere around like five to six marks
so so in this upcoming uh
two two end of weeks so we are going to
cover 14 uh Prosthetics marks
and few areas of like five to six marks
of DM so totally it's going to be around
20 plus marks we are going to cover
integrated like whenever it is required
most of your prosthetic part will be
integrated with other subjects like like
for example you take pre-prosthetic
surgeries which are part of your uh oral
search again will be done in this
particular subject okay so there's
something like dangerous stomatitis some
clinical complications okay like for
example like simple like dangerous
stomatitis which is again integrated
with your oral path and normal medicine
so there are many such things which we
are going to do in the upcoming few days
okay so I want you to be more aggressive
and this is a completely a dental
subject completely a clinical subject
and most of you are very very familiar
because most of you have done this
subject uh in the last one or two years
in your final year okay right so uh this
is a brief glance like the topics uh to
be done or the topics to be given more
importance I have given you the schedule
so just have a quick glance on the
schedule
so this is going to start from June 22nd
and ends on June July 9th so July 9th
you are going to have your exam on this
integrated part it's going to be for 240
marks like I feel like more than like
160 to 180 uh will be from prosto and
the leftover questions will be from the
dental materials integrated with other
subjects these are a blueprint of your
examination which is going to be on July
9th so the first few days I have
allocated for DM integrated with the
Prosthetics that is your physical
properties of dental materials which is
a very common topic or which is a common
topic that cannot be uh like allocated
in any of the prosthetic or operative
part so it is a common topic and you
have a smart video covering all the
concepts graphs and everything required
for the examination I want you to finish
that okay so 20 second I want you to
finish the physical properties of your
dental is our first chapter in your
dental Phillips and the next one is more
of an impression a game that is your
impression materials
okay that can be our agar alginate your
elastomeric impression materials your
gypsum products Investments and all are
going to come come in this particular
aspect so followed by then we will be
jumping into the uh the lab Lab related
aspects that is on the third day so the
Metallurgy Dental Ceramics dye materials
your soldering welding your casting
temperatures uh all this is going to
come and the last one is an extension of
a lab materials that is your dental
waxes casting casting defense casting
procedures and your investment materials
so these are the four days schedule of
DM which is integrated to your
Prosthetics so once we are done with
that then we'll be jumping into the real
Prosthetics that is the first four days
of ProStar we are going to focus on
complete denture in combination with
maxillofacial process and it's a known
thing that most of your McQ books
whatever you're preparing okay so they
will definitely ignore max official
Prosthetics which is a very very
important topic and a subject to be done
both from the dental materials aspect as
well as from the prosthetic aspect so
what I have done we have we have Smart
videos we made a number of smart videos
on this particular area and you will
have a special examinations on this
because mcqs are missing in the the
books what we are regularly referring
so the next three days uh we'll be
focusing more on fpd fixed partial
Denture Plus the implants implantology
the prostate related implantology and
everything will be done during Prosper
itself and followed by the next three
days we'll be focusing on removable
partial dentures and of course sixth
seventh
and eighth will be your revision and
Ninth
uh ninth morning I want I want repeaters
to take exam on Ninth morning
whereas interns to take exam on Ninth
evening so I have allocated like three
three end of days for your revision time
for this particular subject and I want
every one of you to segregate this
subject properly so that during the
revision demo during the second round
the things are going to be easy and
smooth so this is an outline of what we
are going to do in the upcoming a few
days okay right so the next important
aspect that I want to stretch on is what
to be done and where to be done and how
to be done okay so coming to the DM part
okay so the dental Metals part with
first four days
so most of the topics what I have listed
out you are having a smart video so I
want you to start with
the smart videos
which are available on the website for
almost all these topics okay so DM is
more often a memory based means they'll
ask you to remember the numbers they'll
ask you to remember the classifications
they ask you to remember the
compositions okay so everything is
related to the number and some logic
okay which were properly covered in the
smart videos so I want you to spend a
quality of time with the smart videos
okay write up good running notes finish
it fast then try to jump into the McQ
part okay and few of these smart videos
like few of these topics which I have
listed out there is a little bit of
running summary synopsis okay so
synopsis
okay you can keep dental pulse synopsis
of your dental materials of your dental
material subject that is more often a
summary it's not covered top to bottom
but it's covering the summary so few
areas like classifications numbers
compositions small small a little bit of
like half page or one page notes was
given like once you're done with a
particular topic of smart video just
have a quick glance over this summary
synopsis which is there in your dental
materials then once you're done with
that the third step what you need to do
is solve mcqs
okay don't go into the website website
is I want you to take website McQ a
website mcqs whatever that are present
on the dental materials folder as an
exams but before that I want you to
solve mcqs the sources can be either
Dental pulse or dentist basing upon the
book available for you so this
particular topic whatever you have done
smart videos I want you to jump into uh
jump into the summary synopsis then try
to solve the mcqs of both uh any of
these books like both are available and
if you're a repeater and if you have
time there's nothing wrong in doing both
the mcqs of both these books so once you
are done with the McQ solving okay then
I want you to cut the mcqs okay wherever
you're going wrong Wherever You Feel
Like A New Concept which is not being
covered previously I want you to learn
the explanation part
so do the explanation part after solving
the mcqs then I want you to attend the
evening activity
so evening from 6 30 to 7 o'clock you
will be having 7 7 15 you will be having
uh the activity on on your WhatsApp
groups okay uh where we are going to do
uh some sort of revision of the entire
Topic in the form of a question and
answer I want you to attend it if you if
you find something new which is not uh
covered in the previous Parts I want you
to add it to the notes if not revise it
and just move on so the suggestion is uh
by the time you start the next day in
the morning hours in the morning hours I
want you to queue the exam
give example of the previous topic don't
give exam on the same day this is just
an opinion from my side because as you
read the contents definitely you'll go
for the right answer so you can give
exam after one or two days after
finishing a particular topic for example
like you finish all the four days of DM
and on the fifth day you can give all
the exams that is the or on the fourth
day last day of DM before you start
Prosthetics you can give exam exam like
that that's going to be more uh that's
going to be more useful and that's going
to tell you like where you are weak at
where you need to revise it where you're
good at where you're bad at and all
these opinions will be given by this
particular examination which is going to
be done on the fourth day this is just a
suggestion like if you if you have a
plan of giving the exam on the same day
it's okay okay if you if you feel like
that's a that's a good methodology which
is working out for you you can go with
the same procedure if not you can try
this you can try this for this
particular two or three weeks and see
how it's going to work out and how it's
going to help you out
so this is all about the DM for the
first four days then I want you to jump
into uh the prosthetic part okay so as
most of you are well familiar uh your
Pros though is simply splitted and
divided according to the need blueprint
into complete denture
fixed partial denture
removable partial denture
maxofacial processes and implants
a topic which is very frequently
repeated in the examinations is
definitely implants allowed for implants
it's a it's it's a the Ang I mean like
the Modern Dentistry is moving around
and definitely they'll ask questions on
implants and Mags of facial process like
if you see your postcode complication
that is your myocoromycosis so there are
lots of cases of maxophageal processing
most of the colleges throughout the
country so definitely Max the facial
process has some weight is nowadays
they're inclined to ask questions on
that which is I mean these two two
topics are very commonly ignored in most
of the McQ books because these are the
modern topics so let's give a little bit
of importance for these two topics when
compared to the complete danger fixed
partial lecture and removal partial
tension
so coming to the checklist I want you to
First finish the smart videos okay
you have Smart videos available on the
website so I want you to finish the
smart videos uh the tricky Concepts also
being well uh well organized and well
explained by Dr Akshay okay so uh curves
graphs uh syndromes okay lots of things
being very important for the examination
a little bit of confusion lack of
concept so everything was properly
organized and well covered in the smart
video so I want you to spend some
quality of time in doing the smart
videos and basically basic mode of smart
videos is definite it's going to improve
your scores but my primary motor of
smart videos is to brush your Basics
okay it's going to pressure Basics it's
going to recap everything whatever you
have done in the final year long back or
maybe a few days back or a few few years
back so it's going to give you the brief
glance of whatever uh you have done
previously
so then I want you to keep the summary
synopsis so if you open your dental
pulse again Dental pulse has like five
to six pages of synopsis of complete
denture followed by some five to six
pages of synopsis of fpd like totally
it's having a 15 to 20 phases of
synopsis covering all these three major
topics that is complete danger fixed
partial dentures
beauty of this
these things is like I mean like
according to my analysis uh CD and RPD
CD and fpd are going to be easy and RPD
is going to take some time clasps uh the
connectors major connectors minor
connectors and all these are going to
take some time but fpd and CD are going
to be smooth FPS is definitely easy but
coming to the complete danger complete
danger most of the steps in the complete
danger were done by you as a final year
practical so I hope you can manage the
complete denture and do at your best so
the next important aspect is like after
finishing the smart videos the brief
glance I'll be providing the template of
the notes of the smart video so that you
can finish the notes making part very
fast this is going to start or Implement
from the processor okay from the
Prosthetics which will be explained
clearly on your WhatsApp groups uh when
the process is going to start the next
important aspect is I want you to check
out the
synopsis of your dental pulse then the
third important aspect that I want you
to start I want you to give a solve
themselves
for this you can keep dentists
or dental pulse as a priority then I
want you to check out the explanation
part wherever it is required wherever
you are not clear wherever you are not
up to Mark then I want you to attend the
evening activity on the WhatsApp
okay uh that's going to exchange some
energy give some motivation give some
boosting then I want you to take the
exam on this particular topic which is
available on the website as a topic
specific exam
okay right so this is the outline and
the plan of action for the ProStar
integrated with the dental materials for
the upcoming few days so integrated with
this particular schedule of DM and Pros
so so DM we are planning to have uh like
we are planning to have one class
one class for the pro-life students I
don't know how many of you have picked
the pro-life plan so pro-life students
combining these four uh days you're
going to have one pro live class which
will be handled by gauri Sir
gauri Shankar sir is going to handle the
processor class and it's going to be for
two and a half hours
and this is for the pro-life students
and for offline students offline
students of Hyderabad so I'll be taking
the class on all these four topics
integrated with some part of Prosthetics
okay so this class is going to be four
hours okay so this is how we are going
to finish DM for the plan Pro students
and offline students and followed by
next the prosthetic part you will be
having three sessions one on complete
denture with max official process one on
fpd with implants and one on RPD so
three sessions each of two two and a
half hours which will be taken by Dr
Akshay okay from GDC uh I mean from GDC
Mumbai uh Pro surrounded she's going to
take I hope like most of you are
familiar with Akshay
so Akshay is going to take and followed
by this is for the pro line so prolife
students are going to have three classes
in the first round of cross the and the
same Akshay is going to come to
Hyderabad and he's going to take two
classes
each of five hours like five plus five
so we are planning
a 10 hours 10 to 12 hours
of session uh on on the Saturday and
Sunday uh by Dr Akshay covering all the
Prosthetics and we'll be here spending
some one hour of quality time on showing
you the instruments uh articulators and
all this like whatever those are
available clinically we try to show all
those things as a one hour part of a
diagram based questions okay so this is
an outline of Prosthetics and I hope
like most of you are familiar about the
website so I'll show a few important
things on the website uh for example
like
uh if you're checking out okay so this
is your browse the folder so where you
have the multiple uh things like for
example like you have complete denture
uh split it into six parts and fpd is
splitted into five parts okay so you
have RPD splitted into four parts apart
from this like uh implants are there
like uh concepts are there for example
like mandibular moments is one of the
topic okay about the uh classification
of mandibular movements based on the
extent of mandibular movements
station so if we
so you you house the contents like that
okay so this is how it's going to cover
you and once you're done with this like
I told you like there's something called
as an uh topic specific examination so I
want you know to go to take exams uh
then your folder is going to be uh your
neat and ionizing so once you jump into
neat and inact uh then I want you to
open the Prosthetics folder so once you
open the prostate folder you have n
number of exams on on the ProStar part
so which you can uh
which you can cover okay right
similarly you jump into the dental
materials part so so jumping into the
dental materials part so you have a
video on physical properties you have
video on impression materials you have a
quick recap video on impression
materials you have gypsum products you
have dental waxes Metallurgy finishing
and polishing dye materials denture base
like whatever most of the stuff were
covered Okay so
so this is this is an outline just so I
just want to show how the website is
going to be okay so I want you to
focus on right take the exams again you
have subject specific exams you have
topic specific exams so everything
whatever that is required for the
examination point of view okay
so this is the outline here of your pro
store and DM that's going to start from
tomorrow all the best study well okay so
the entire team is available for you all
the times so whenever you want you can
message us
you can call us you can interact with us
okay so because we are extending the uh
interactive integration between the
student and the teacher uh by keeping
multiple teachers at multi-level way so
you're always welcome to talk with us
because one way of making yourself
better in the preparation or making
yourself better in the Dentistry is a
proper teacher Mentor interaction and
which we are working on so gaurisa is
there like is there petition mom is
there
uh in the next in the next two to three
days I'll announce you and we'll be
having an interaction similarly we are
planning to organize these types of
interactions uh I mean previously we
used to do it in the offline like we
used to move to the places and we used
to convert these offline interactions
but now we are taking it to the next
level okay making the students more
convenient and we are doing this online
so last week we had interaction with all
Andhra students and probably this week
we are planning with the
Telangana and Maharashtra and tamilnadu
students okay uh uh with your with your
specific oriented mentors who can speak
your local languages uh to make that
intimacy and to improve your scores to
improve your performance in the exam so
that you are going to end up with good
ranks which will yield you the best
departments and the best colleges so
it's always conquer is trying to move
towards uh towards the student to make
preparation and life in dentistry better
by providing whatever we can do within
our limitations okay so bye take care
study well any doubts and any confusions
uh you're always open to
um
open to pingas
and uh and particularly uh I mean maybe
this this video may be uploaded in the
YouTube uh uh YouTube like uh I mean
it's going to be difficult for us to uh
reply to the messages on the YouTube
okay as well as on the Instagram so
there's so many students who are pinging
on Instagram so it's going to be
difficult for us for the main mentors to
uh respond and talk as most of you are
having our uh uh like let it be a
professional number or related to a
personal number so the accessible number
is there okay so we are not hiding our
accessible numbers okay so uh basing
upon the emergency and the importance
okay we don't mind like even if you call
or even if you message any any of us
like any of the member of the team MDS
conquer Let It Be gauri Shankar sir
which is having 26 years plus experience
we're having like six to eight years
experience or let it be anyone like
16 plus here we'd always love to
interact with the students uh at 11 but
may not be so comfortable in the social
media but we'll try to make that
interface also in a better way but you
most of you have our personal numbers
so if our presence or our opinion is
really required at any circumstances
you're always open to callers you're
always open to pingers you may or may
not be as to a student of MDS conquer
