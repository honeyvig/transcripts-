hi Traders welcome back to another video
today I want to start a new YouTube
series and this series is going to be
kind of a strategy development
investigation kind of process where I'm
going to go and find strategy ideas out
on the web on the internet I know how
dangerous that sounds but don't worry
we're going to vet these ideas using
code and running trading ideas through
the strategy tester and the whole
purpose of this series series is one I'm
doing it anyway it's something that I do
in my spare time anyway but two
hopefully it will give me a good
opportunity to show you guys demonstrate
to you guys some coding practices
techniques Concepts um that are
practical that we can build on and
hopefully this series these videos that
I'm going to start creating over the
months and probably years to come will
help inspire you guys and motivate you
guys to go and find your own trading
ideas convert them in the code adapt
them to suit your personality your
personal trading style and we can all
become better Traders together now as
mushy as that sounds that's the whole
purpose of my YouTube channel and what I
do here I'm a Trader I want to get
better at trading why not share the
journey with you guys and we can all get
better together and so without further
Ado let's get into today's video it's
going to be a bit of a longer one
compared to the recent videos I've done
but I think it's going to be extremely
valuable recently I've been going
through a mentorship program with Nick
he's an Australian Trader quite well
known if you haven't heard of him go and
check out his chat with Traders podcast
episodes they're brilliant they have
some really really powerful trading
ideas and lessons included in them I'll
leave links Below in the description
this morning I was just going through
the Forum here and reading up on um some
trading system articles that Nick Raj
particularly has posted there's other
students that post strategy ideas but
I'm always very interested in what Nick
Raj finds interesting
because he is such a great Trader I like
to try to emulate his thought process in
the markets I have very similar
philosophy on the markets to him he's
obviously far far more experienced than
I am he's been trading for decades I've
been trading for maybe 5 years actively
but this post here caught my eye this
morning so Nick posted this video here
by um JB marwood the YouTube channel JB
marwood um now I don't know anything
about Joe but I did watch this video
today and and I was really impressed by
the concepts here and so today I wanted
to convert some of these ideas into Pine
script show you guys how to build out a
simple strategy script to test an idea a
trading idea in Pine so before I get
started hopefully Joe doesn't mind me
doing this um I'm obviously giving a
shout out to his channel go and check it
out there's some really cool trading
ideas here some really powerful
stuff um today I want to go over his
simple pullback trading strategy and
convert the idea the rules into Pine and
when we're done we'll get something like
this now my results aren't 100% accurate
compared to his results but that could
be because he's using different data to
me um he's using a different back
testing software but the results are
similar enough and profitable enough to
Warrant investigating in pinescript so
before I get started I'll play a short
clip from his video just to um
demonstrate the rules that he lays out
and again when you uh finish with this
video or even now if you want to I'll
leave a link below in the description to
this video I definitely encourage you to
go and watch the whole video because
there's some really important ideas that
are laid out in this video but anyway
let me break down his rules and again
hopefully he's okay with this if you
ever see this video Joe and you you're
not happy with me um basically stealing
your work let me know and I'll take this
video down uh but I just want to share
this with my audience because I think
this is really important information and
an important template um that Traders
should be aware of Traders especially my
experience I obvious have a lot of
Traders come through my Mastery course
um there's a lot of questions I get
where Traders are over complicating
trading in a way that I feel is
unnecessary trading does not need to be
very complex in order for you to make
good money out of the markets and this
strategy right here is a good example so
let me skip forward to the rules here
and I'll just play a quick clip from
this video so now let's look at the
exact rules of this simple pullback
strategy so the buy rules first of all
we're going to want a close a above the
200 day moving
average and a close below the 10day
moving average so very basic rules the
longer term trend is the 200 day moving
average we want to be above that but we
want to close below the 10day moving
average so we've got a small pullback
within the longer term Trend now the
sell rules are extremely important here
um we're going to we're going to sell
when the close Rises back above that
10-day moving average so we're not
looking for long
term trades here we're just looking for
shortterm trades um short pullbacks and
the other rule is we will sell if we get
a 10% loss so if we get a 10% loss we're
going to exit on the next bar open okay
we need some more settings um that we
can put into our back tester um so that
we can run an accurate back test so
position size going to use just all
right I'll stop it here I don't want to
play too much of his work on my channel
uh again go and check out this video if
you're interested uh so the rules are
incredibly simple we're waiting for
price to close above the 200 day moving
average and close below the 10day SMA
simple moving average that's it buy
rules couldn't be simpler that's
something I really love about Nick R's
work um in his books and his um videos
online he's a huge advocate for using
simple and robust trading rules he goes
so far as to say that he doesn't believe
that the entry
reasons or entry criteria for strategies
is a very important aspect of a trading
system there are other aspects of a
trading system that are far more
important um such as the overall concept
of the system why it makes money um and
obviously your exit reasons are super
important and your money management risk
management um approach plays a massive
role in the profitability of any trading
system the entry criteria is one of the
least important criteria it's not not
important but it is one of the Le lesser
important aspects especially when we're
trading a robust system so this strategy
is extremely simple we're waiting for
the entry rules here and then the sell
rules are also very simple we um we're
waiting for the the candle the bar daily
bar this is a daily long early strategy
by the way on the S&P 500 ETF that's
what the strategy was designed to be
traded on but it uh in my preliminary
testing it seems to be profitable on
several other markets as well but anyway
the sell conditions are once we're in a
trade if price closes above 10day SMA uh
we exit our position we're just trying
to capture small chunks of the overall
long-term Trend um the secondary rule is
that if price declines by 10% from our
entry price or in other words we have a
10% loss on a closing basis we exit on
the next bars open uh we have a position
size of 100% of our Capital no Leverage
is used starting capital in this back
test is
$50,000 commissions is 0.005 cents per
share which is the Interactive Broker
rate and um execution is entering trades
on the next bars open which is luckily
how the training view strategy test to
work so that's really easy to emulate in
today's lesson so let's jump into the
pine editor and start coding this into
Pine code now before we do that I should
probably mention the um overall metrics
of this system according to Joe's back
testing using Amy broker which is a much
more powerful strategy tester system
than trading view but it's also much
more complex um I might consider
exploring Amy broker code in future
lessons if you guys are interested in
that I'm learning how to code in AFL the
um programming language for Amy broker
it's a it's a it's a very powerful
program but it is also much more complex
than Pine there's pros and cons to that
the pros are that you can do very
extensive statistical analysis of your
strategy results over historical data
the cons are it's expensive you need
extra data so data from a data provider
and the code is is just harder to learn
compared to Pine but anyway that's IR
relevant for today's video so the
metrics here have a decent annualized
return um but it is less than Buy and
Hold so Buy and Hold Returns on average
about 10% per year on the S&P 500 this
strategy returns about
7.6% so it's less profitable than just
simply buying and holding the Spy ETF
however look at our maximum draw down
the Max draw down of just holding the
S&P 500 ETF is 55% of your Capital so
you lose over half half your Capital by
just doing nothing and holding the ETF
but you do make about 10% per year which
is okay uh but this would make a lot of
investors uncomfortable and I'm sure a
lot of Traders and investors would sell
as you near that Max draw down and then
that will affect your annual annual
return negatively and so there's a lot
of psychological reasons why Buy and
Hold is not a good strategy despite the
fact that it does have a 10% return on
average per year whereas this system has
a slightly less return turn but look at
the max draw down 12% I would take a Max
draw down of 12% any day of the week on
any strategy that is well within my risk
tolerance and so that's kind of the idea
of this strategy it has a much better
risk adjusted return than Buy and Hold
and it also has a very high win rate 75%
win rate is pretty impressive now to
achieve that win rate it doesn't make a
lot of money on each trade so half a
percent per trade but its Edge is in its
win rate so this is a strategy where the
win rate plays a major part in its
profitability um I usually trade
strategies that are the opposite so the
risk reward profile is what accounts for
the profitability rather than the win
rate so I can trade strategies with 40
45% win rate but with a high risk reward
and that is how I tend to make my money
whereas this strategy is kind of the
opposite we're taking small wins but
very frequently anyway let's jump into
the pine editor and code all of this
into Pine all right so here we are with
a blank script a relatively blank script
all I've done here is input my default
strategy parameters so we have overlay
set to true so we're drawing over price
action our initial capital is set to
$50,000 our default quantity type for
this strategy is set to percentage of
our equity and our quantity value is set
to 100% of our account balance so on
each trade we get involved with we're
trading 100% of our account balance with
no leverage our commission type is set
to cash per contract and the commission
value is set to 0.005 cents per share
which as I mentioned earlier is
interactive brokers commission rate and
interactive brokers is probably one of
the most common if not the most common
stock trading platform and so that's why
we're using this as our default
parameters now if you've watched my
previous video on the latest update to
trading view strategy tester you'll know
that they've recently added this uh bar
magnifier setting and I said in that
video that we should always turn this on
on every single script we write now that
is true but only on scripts that have a
stop- loss and takeprofit like a fixed
stop-loss fixed takeprofit or entry
limit orders um for a strategy that
operates solely on candle closes it's
not necessary because there is no risk
of intra bar price action negatively
affecting our back testing results if
you're not sure what any of that just
meant make sure to go back and watch the
previous video on this channel about the
latest uh strategy tester update oh
leave a link to that in the description
as well so we don't need bar magnifier
for this particular strategy let's move
on to getting our user inputs so to save
time I'm just going to copy and paste
some code I've already written because
it's not important how the user input
code is written but we need several
inputs here so we need two moving
averages one is the 200 SMA the other is
a 10 SMA 10 period SM so a long-term and
a shortterm moving average the second or
third parameter here is our stoploss
percentage so by default that's set to
0.1 or 10% so if price declines 10% from
our entry we exit our position so that's
basically a fail safe stop loss so if
price never closes back above the 10
period SMA we can still exit our trade
for a loss to cut our losses short
instead of letting our losses run too
far the final inputs here are just a
start date and an end date filter these
are used for analyzing in Sample and out
of sample periods um I'm not going to go
into too much detail about statistical
analysis of our back testing results in
this video because it will make this
video way too long that's a subject that
deserves its own series let alone video
and maybe I'll cover that in the future
if you guys are interested in it I'm no
expert on that stuff I'm not very good
with mathematics to be perfectly honest
with you guys but I am learning a lot
about this stuff through Nick rager
courses and so in the future I will
probably record uh lessons on this super
important subject of deep and robust
back testing processes but for now we'll
keep things as simple as possible and
just focused on the pine code so today's
lesson is just an example a strategy
example how to code a really simple
concept into code into Pine code and
then test that theory in a simple but
quick manner the next thing we need to
do is get our indicator values so again
I'll just paste this code to save time
it's really simple we're just getting
two moving averages two smas using ta.
smma both based on the closing price
Source price source and one with a 200
one with a 10 period now I need to
replace these with our inputs so that we
can adjust these moving average length
in the settings menu uh if we want to so
now if I save my code we should have
these settings up here there they are
and they have little tool tips
explaining what each setting does this
is completely optional I'm only doing
this because this is a YouTube video
script and I want you guys to fully
understand what each user input does now
now next thing we need to do is get our
date filter so again I'll paste that
code in really simple here we're just
checking if the current Bar's time is
greater than or equal to our start date
and time and is the current Bar's time
less than or equal to our and date and
time so this allows us to filter what
trades get taken based on a date period
now we get to the juicy part where we
check our buy and sell conditions
so remember the rules are really simple
um the first thing we need to do before
I get to the rules is save our Buy price
so I'm just going to initialize a
persistent variable V variables mean
that they don't reset on every single
bar it's a float type so it's a number
type with a decimal place and it's going
to be set to Zero by default on the very
first bar on our chart and then we'll
obviously overwrite this with our Buy
price when we enter a trade that way we
can actually calculate our stop loss
that 10% decline from our Buy price so
that we can ex exit trades that go
against us now our buy condition is the
closing price greater than our ma1 which
is our long-term moving average the 200
period moving
average and is the closing price on the
current bar less than our short-term
moving average or the 10 period moving
average those are our basic entry
conditions but we also need to make sure
that we're not already involved in a
trade because this strategy does not
include pyramiding so we want to check
is our position size equal to zero if
it's equal to zero we're
flat and we want to check our date
filter so I'll throw in the date filter
here this just checks if the current bar
Falls within our two time periods and
that's it for our buy conditions um now
before I continue let's draw some pretty
colors onto the chart um and by that I
mean our moving M averages so we're
going to plot our ma1 and ma2 onto the
chart save my script and now what we're
looking
for is price
to be trading above the 200 period
moving average and close below the 10
period moving average and then we buy on
the next bars open and we sell when
price closes back above that 10 period
moving average or Price declines by 10%
that's it that's all we're looking for
so let's finish coding this out we have
our buy condition next up we need our
sell condition and that remember is just
is the closing price greater than our
short-term moving average or
ma2 let me indent these a little bit to
make it easier to read the second
condition for selling is that we are
currently involved in a trade so to
check if we're involved in a trade we
just check if position size is greater
than zero that means we have open
contracts and that's it for our basic
cell condition the next thing we need to
do is uh check our stop loss so our stop
loss remember uh I'll start with calling
it stop distance and stop distance is
going to be set to and now this is
completely optional what I'm about to do
next it does make the code a little bit
more difficult to read but it will make
our plots easier on the eyes when I'll
show you what I mean in a moment but
what I'm going to do is check is our
strategy. position size greater than
zero question mark if so if this
condition is met then we want to
calculate our Buy
price minus the closing price divided by
the closing price this will give us the
stop- loss distance as a percentage on
the current bar so this will calculate
the percentage decline from our entry so
let's say we entered on this bar here
I'll put a horizontal line there that
red line this code here will calculate
the percentage decline from this red
line on each bar on our chart on a
closing basis so each bar that closes
below this red
line um this code will calculate this
number here
6.53% or minus
6.53% this will calculate this as a
positive number so in this case it would
be 6.53%
-
6.53% and we use that to check our stop
loss but before we do that the next
thing I want to do is calculate our stop
loss price so that's going to be again
is our position size greater than zero
so are we involved in an open trade if
so we subtract our Buy price from our
Buy price multiplied by our stop
percentage so this is our stop loss
percentage Again by default it's 10% or
0.1
so this stop price will calculate again
using this red line as our Buy price the
stop price will be by default 10% below
this line so all the way down about
here at 1 uh 42 1.45
is so that's our stop loss if we entered
on this bar here our stop loss is down
here and if we never get a bar that
closes Above This short-term moving
average but price closes below this uh
red line then we exit our trade for a
loss that's our stop loss and then
finally the final thing we need to write
out here for our buy and sell conditions
is our stoploss condition itself and for
that again we check is the position size
currently greater than zero so we're
involved in an open trade and our stop
distance so the current deine on a
closing basis on a percentage basis from
our entry price
is greater than our I and I stands for
input so input stop
percent then that means price has
declined by our stop loss percentage
point and we need to exit our trade
that's it now I know I went over that
pretty quickly but I'm trying to keep
this video relatively short you can
always slow down the video or watch this
a couple more times if this went over
your head um but this is all we need to
enter and exit our trades the final
thing we need to do is actually tell the
strategy tester when to enter and when
to exit and that's actually really
simple so for enter positions we're
going to check if by whoops by condition
remember Pan's case sensitive so if by
condition is
true then we use the strategy. entry
function to enter a trade we need to
give it an ID so I'll just call this
long where long only remember this is a
long only strategy I believe this kind
of strategy is called a long beta
strategy so we're just trying to capture
long only returns out of the market and
in this case we're not even trying to
beat the market we're just trying to
beat the Market's Max draw down while
maintaining a decent return annual
return but anyway the next thing is a
direction we need to tell the strategy
tester which direction we want to enter
our trade today we're long early so we
just set that to strategy. long that's
it we're entering our trades based on
our buy condition now the next thing we
need to do is save our Buy price so that
all of this code here can actually be
calculated so so far we haven't actually
saved a Buy price we do that obviously
after we've entered a trade so we need
to put that code below our buy condition
now because we are entering on the next
bars open after the signal or the
condition is met so once our buy
condition is met the strategy tester
let's use this candle right here as an
example again so here we get a confirmed
entry we're above our 200 period moving
average we just closed below the 10
period shortterm that's our entry
criteria met on this bar that criteria
gets met but the strategy tester won't
enter our trade until the next bars open
which will be about
here so when we save our Buy price we
don't want to save the um signal candle
closing price we want to save the next
Bar's open price as our Buy price so to
do that we can just check if we had a
buy condition on the previous bar so if
buy condition on the previous bar is
true then we save our Buy price as the
current Bar's opening price and now we
have our Buy price saved and all of our
metrics here will be calculated properly
and that's it for our entry conditions
the next thing is to check our um exit
criteria to do that really simple we
just check if Cell can do
so if we have our standard takeprofit
sell condition uh which is that the
current bar closed back above the 10
period moving average so here for
example we're trading above both moving
averages and then we get a close below
the 10 period SMA we would enter long
right here we would hold our trade until
price closed back above that 10 period
moving average and then we would sell on
the next bars
open so that's what our sell condition
is but we also have our stop condition
remember so that can also be combined
with our sell condition so if we have or
sorry or if we have a sell condition or
a stop condition then we want to exit
our trade and to do that we can simply
use the strategy. close function we need
to tell it which um order to exit in
this case that's our long order so we're
exiting our entry ID of long on this
function here and to make it clear when
we exit for a profit or for our stop
loss being hit I'm going to add an
optional parameter here which is our
comment and the comment is just going to
say
exit so normally it will just say exit
if we close our trade however I'm also
going to add on a conditional statement
here that will say if and let me make
some some more room here if we had our
stop condition
met then add-on
SL equals true so this is text that's
going to display on our chart and it
just simply says stop loss equals true
so we exited our trade because our stop
loss was hit otherwise add nothing to
this string because we don't really care
we don't this will just differentiate
between trades that close back above the
10 SMA And Trades that close below our
10% decline from our entry that's it the
final thing I'm going to do here is just
overwrite our Buy price to n a this is
purely for drawing purposes we'll get to
that in a moment but now there's only
two more lines of code to write and our
script is completed and that is I'll
just copy this code over to save
time it's just two more plots so we're
going to plot our Buy price onto the
chart so that we can see when the script
bought which price it bought at and
we're going to plot our stop loss onto
the price so that we can see where the
script will exit our trade if price
declines beyond our stop- loss and I set
the offset on our stop loss to minus one
because the way we've written our code
up here it won't actually draw the stop-
loss until we've been in the trade for
one bar so we want to shift our stop
loss line back one bar so that the two
lines are drawing in sync so I'll show
you what I mean if we save my code here
hopefully this compiles without any
errors and there we go it definitely did
not so where is our error it's on line
30 I didn't finish our conditional
statements here
so for these two statements we're just
going to add na on the end so our stop
loss
distance if we are not involved in a
trade our stop distance is going to be
set to na so that we don't draw anything
onto the chart so here stop price is set
to na when we're not involved in a trade
if we don't do this um we'll have lines
drawing all over our chart even when
we're not involved in a trade we don't
want that so when we're not involved in
a trade we set our our stop price to Na
and our Buy price to Na and that way we
don't have lines drawing all over the
place so now when I save my code
hopefully this compiles there we go
there's our script completed so let's
find a good example here here's one that
I was using before as an example so
here's our entry conditions met trading
above the 200 SMA trading uh closing
below the 10 SMA on this bar we enter on
the next Bar's open we enter long and
then we hold this trade until price
closes above the 10 period SMA or we
close below our stop loss now in this
case that never happened we
actually uh we didn't hit our we tested
our stop loss we didn't close below it
uh but we did close back above the 10
SMA below our entry and so this
technically was a losing trade so here
uh This Bar closed back above the 10 SMA
we exit we sell on the next bars open
and so here we took a loss of about 3.7%
but there's our script completed and if
we open up the strategy tester here's
our metrics so we have approximately a
12% Max draw down from um 1995 until
today so I set my end filter to 2099
we're obviously nowhere near that yet
the way time's been flying this year I
feel like it won't be long before into
2099 but for now we're trading up until
the current day from 1995 and these are
our metrics so a net profit of 351
according to the trending view strategy
tester some of these metrics I feel like
the strategy tester calculates a bit
weirdly compared to what I'm used to but
anyway that's another subject for a
different day for now we have a decently
profitable strategy over 457 trades over
several years with a decent Max draw
down and a half decent return annual
return nothing spectacular but
considering that this would just be part
of a portfolio of strategies uh this is
a really cool concept to investigate
further and now before I wrap up this
video one thing that Joe speaks about in
his video at the very end is talking
about how we could expand on this
strategy by adding extra rules or
conditions to the strategy because it is
very very simple now I like to start my
strategy development with a really
simple idea or concept A arguably too
simple idea is better to start with and
then you build on that idea so right
here we have a strategy that is
profitable with a really high win rate
that's great how can we improve the
results of this strategy what's a simple
way we could improve this strategy one
way that I can see here that I thought
of earlier this morning is it doesn't
make a lot of sense to me to just exit
as soon as price closes above the 10 SMA
I prefer to have a reason to exit my
trades and it doesn't have to be a very
complex reason but I prefer it to be a
little bit more complex than simply just
closing back above a moving average and
so what if we
added here's a perfect
example look at this we we're trading
above our 200 SMA we close below our 10
period we enter long on this bars open
and then we exit on this bars open after
we close back above the SMA what is this
this is like a what 1% 2% gain 1% gain
that's pitiful considering how this
Market rallied from here so what if we
added a really simple exit reason such
as a lower close so we only exit our
trade if price is trading above the 10
SMA and we get a candle or a bar that
closes below the previous bars low and
then we exit on the next Bar's open
let's add that to our code and see how
that affects our strategy
results so for this I'm going to add a a
user input and I'll just copy some code
over to save time so here we've added a
new user input that says iore so input
lower close and it's a Boolean input
it's set to false by default and this
setting exit on Lower close simply waits
for a lower close before exiting above
our short-term moving average if I come
down to our sell condition line of code
here I can add on one more little
condition here I can check do we have
our standard exit reasons or conditions
met so did we close above our short-term
moving average while involved in an open
long trade and is iore lower close not
turned on so that would return true so
if we do not have that setting turned on
we will just exit when price closes back
above the SMA otherwise if we do have
this turned on then we want to check if
the current bars closing price is lower
than the previous bars low that's it
really simple just a couple of
characters of Code here and let's see
how it affects our bottom line so I'll
save that code let's look at this
particular trade right here if I come up
to our options or settings here bring it
over here we enter long here on this
bars open let's see what happens when I
click exit on Lower
close so now we stayed in this trade we
entered long here rather than exiting
right here we held our POS position
until we got a price action confirmation
that we should exit now it's a really
simple confirmation just a simple lower
close so this bar here closed lower than
the previous bar so we exit we sell our
long position on the next bars
open and that turned a 1% winning trade
into a 6% winning
trade and we still have our standard
stop- loss reasons so here's a here's an
example of a losing trade based on our
stop loss so exit SL equals true we
entered long on this Bar's open after a
close below the 10 period SMA while
price was technically above the
long-term moving average and then
unfortunately the market rolled over but
rather than holding on to our loser we
eventually exit our trade for
approximately I'd say this is like a
99.8% loss roughly so let's drag that
down
9.5 9.5% loss on that trade but we are
now holding our winning trades for much
longer um here's a good example of why
we use a stop loss back in the covid
crash on the market when the market took
a dive uh this is why we use stop losses
um but let's have a look here let's look
for a trade that really played out
nicely here's a good one so we enter
long here we hold all the way up to this
lower close and then we get back into
the market uh soon after that exit
when price closes back below this SMA so
this is a really cool strategy and now
here we have a
problem price did not
close uh above our SMA when we got our
lower close and so the script did not
exit our position so that's this rule
here if you wanted to you could play I'm
not going to in today's lesson I want to
wrap this up here but if you wanted to
you could negate this rule when using
the lower close rule and that way the
script would have exited up here but
because we have our prerequisite of
price being above um ma2 it waited until
here to exit that trade if you want to
that could be some homework for you I
guess to go and edit this code to
include that feature and see how that
affects your results but now let's look
at our metrics our draw Down's gone up
slightly gone up by 2% but our return
has gone up
significantly because our average trade
profit has gone up significantly whil
still maintaining a very high win rate
now I'd need to do some more testing to
make sure that I haven't missed
something and this is actually giving
out results that are accurate but the
whole point of today's video is not to
give you a strategy to go out and test
or trade but rather a concept to think
about some examples on how you can
achieve these things and yeah now I hope
this helped you better understand the
strategy development process I hope it
inspired some ideas for you to go out
and play around with and I'll wrap this
lesson up here as always the source code
will be below a link to the source code
will be below in the video description a
link to the original video by Joe that
inspired this video um basically I just
stole his trading idea and adapted it to
suit myself in pinescript but you get
the idea this is the strategy
development process basically is going
out finding cool ideas and then adapting
them to your personality your personal
preferences and then through the power
of pinescript we can really quick
quickly test this stuff and decide if
it's something that we are interested in
pursuing further this video is long
enough as it is so I'm going to wrap
this up here thanks for watching I
really appreciate it I hope you have a
fantastic weekend and I'll speak with
you in the next video take care and good
luck with your trading as always
