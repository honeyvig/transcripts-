okay right so uh coming to the mode of
preparation okay so I have we have
students who are about to start their
preparation in the next couple of days
and we have people who are halfway into
the
preparation and we have people who are
done with the preparation so whatever it
is okay so the the most most important
thing that is required uh for the next
few months because we are not still
at get the official date of your neat
2024 so whatever it is like let it be in
the in the month of March or let it be
in the month of any month okay so the
most important thing that is required
for a decent
rank for a decent rank in neat
202 so what do you
feel what is required for a decent rank
in
uh which is most important here in this
last four months let's make it as four
months so what is most important in the
last four months of the
preparation
consistency impossible how can we 10
consistence okay so the most important
thing yes uh you're right here the most
important thing
is the revision the revision will get
you
rank revision will get you rank okay so
revision is the most important thing so
the goal of Team MDS conquer is
focusing a good revision a good planned
revision okay so what my suggestion for
all of you is try to revise the content
okay so it's not about whether you want
to do smart videos whether you want to
do this or whether you want to do that
it's all about revision so everything
whatever you do should be integrated to
revision for
example I'm solving uh I'm solving I'm
solving a question paper today we have
an exam so I'm solving a grand exam so
in Grand exam so out of 200
140 I got 165 marks or I got 170 so how
many wrong answers are there so there
were 17 170 right answers so 70 were
wrong answers so I have to focus on this
70 wrong answers and I need to learn
this 70 I need to learn this 70 along
with the explanation part and some
content so this is called
as
revision because reading is already done
for the grand exam now you are revising
the areas where you are losing the mcqs
now or else for example
U you you have decided to do
endo and uh and you have some two to
three hours to do Endo so someone has
suggested you to do the quick revision
video that is present in
Endo quick revision the video is telling
as quick revision means the quick
revision video is something not new that
you are learning the quick revision
video is something that you are trying
to revise this is also revision this is
also revision you are attending an
evening
activity that is also revision so
everything moves around revision and
Analysis you need analyze why I'm doing
a mistake here how can I overcome this
particular mistakes so that analysis is
required okay right so that is most
important thing what we need to focus on
for the next couple of days okay right
so so mandatory things whether you do
whether you start preparation
now whether you start going to start the
preparation the next few days or whether
you're already preparing okay so I want
to give a mandatory checklist for you
for everything so the checklist goes
like
this okay for any exam for any exam for
a smart preparation
the most important thing that we need to
focus on is the
topics that are repeated in the last 10
years okay for example you see
Endo you have a question on
gapa in
2023 you have a question on gapa and
forms of gapa in
2022 you have a question on chemically
plasticized gapa technique in
2021 so the gapa or the questions around
gapa are very frequently repeated okay
so this is an important area you see for
example you see
pedo pedo in
2022 23 24 21 22 every year
you are having a question on
trauma you are having a question on
apexification
apexogenesis regenerative Endodontics
okay can you show me a question paper
without a question or an option related
to
MTA can you show me a question paper
without an option or without a question
on MTA in the last five years can you
show me one question paper at least
can you show me a question paper without
a question on
fluides can you show me most of you are
solving the old question papers right
fluides do you accept that fluides is
there everywhere in every question paper
MTA is there everywhere in every
question
paper trauma Elis
classification next uh coming to tests
of significance can you show me a
question paper without tests of
significance case control study CAD
study odds
ratio normal distribution curve can you
show me a question paper without a
question on any of these like test of
significance or normal distribution
curve or odds ratio or case control and
cohard study ratios ordinal
ratio so for every subject there will
will be a list of 100 to 150 very very
important topics and more than 60 to 70
percentage of the questions will be
moving around the same topics so that is
nothing but called as topics which are
done in the last 10 years topics which
are given in the last 10
years so the main focus or the smart way
of preparing yourself is focusing on
these topics and these topics if you are
focusing on these topics and if you're
perfect with these topics and the mock
exams and the basic checklists of MDS
conquer not heavy heavy checklist so
basic checklist of MDS conquer it is
very easy to stand in the top 500 of the
country further if you want to make
things better better accuracy and
everything give exams properly talk with
the mentors interact with the mentors do
something you will get upgraded okay
clear right okay so for a basic
student basic student okay or basic
preparation of MDS conquer okay what
things to be done even if you are
planning to start the preparation in the
next two months after two months also
okay the basic things to be done is
before you start a particular subject
check out if there is any quick revision
Video available over the subject quick
revision
video finish that quick revision video
don't write heavy heavy notes the videos
will be there only so you try
to write the notes in such a way okay in
this quick revision video sar has
explained about 245 bar dimensions and
everything okay 245 but Dimensions write
the topics which were covered by the
teachers not the contents of the topics
okay so he has explained GB blacks
classification he has explained GG
mounts
classification he has
explained isas
classification he was talking something
about K's risk
assessment he was talking about smart
burs he was talking
about GC and its
modifications so these are
topics I don't want anyone to write
heavy heavy notes writing notes is not
our goal topics whether the topics are
being done properly or not if you are
doing quick revision videos and followed
by followed by check out 2017 to
2023
mcqs how many years it is 171 182 193 24
215
267 and
20 38 seven years seven years of
question
papers very good seven years are very
good I told 10 years seven years so then
if you're done with this 7 years then
you can think of 2016 8 years 2015 9
years 2014 10 years sufficient more than
sufficient beautifully sufficient so
focus on this 10 years okay and check
out this most of your quick revision
videos will be focusing on the last 10
years topics which were uh done and I'll
try to explain them repeatedly again and
again again and again okay rather than
increasing
the increasing the width of your
preparation I want to increase the depth
of your preparation okay okay so these
are the things that you have to focus on
quick revision videos done okay
repeatedly not once two two three times
you you should be very familiar okay I
know this I know this I know this I know
this I'm familiar with this I know this
classification then try to solve the
mcqs from 2017 to 2020 three all these
mcqs will be there
in books that you follow Let It Be
dentist or dental pulse except
2023 where where is where where will be
your 2023
papers for example you using 14th
Edition of dental pulse or 15th Edition
of dental pulse you may not have 2022
papers also where are these papers
available
20202 ini C
2023 neat 2022 yes they are available in
your
website okay don't worry it's not
mandatory that you have to give an exam
2023 or 24 just directly submit it check
out what are the questions given check
out the explanation read them we'll see
we'll see you'll have so many mock exams
don't need to worry I I'll read then
only I'll give never it never happened
never happened it's not going to happen
this year next it may happen Okay so
check out this keep a checklist okay
okay so you you keep a notes first
one quick revision
videos how many videos are there for
example uh a topic is having three
videos you you write down revision one
done revision two done revision three
done write down the dates when the
revision was done just the videos were
hardly 20 to 30 minutes but I tried my
best to cover them as quick as possible
so it is called as quick revision video
so then 2017 mcqs done or not 2018 done
or not 2019 done or not prepare this
checklist 2020 done or not how many
times done one two okay so when I'm
doing from revision one to revision two
okay you see most of these are already
covered here so now basically 2015 I
have 60 mcqs but now most of the 60 mcqs
okay more than 40 mcqs were covered by
Shri sir in his quick revision video he
has discussed so many things they are
very familiar questions now in the
revision two I'll be doing only left
over 20 Mark the 20 this 20 only has to
be gone for R3 and R4 required revision
100 2018 I have 50
mcqs more than 35 mcqs were already I'm
familiar s has already given they
already there on the website so left
over 50 15 has to be going for revision
to be clear with the numbers be clear
with this okay so now you're done with
21 22 and 23 ah website 23 website I
have done it where it is clearly mark
it so then once you done with this the
next one is if you are an offline
student you'll have offline papers
if you are PR live
student you will have PR live papers
where are these PR live papers they are
on the group download it take the print
out and your PR Live recorded video will
be there on the website in your smart
videos check out the class keep it in
1.5x try to observe the class it's a
revision Pro live Class 2 hours if you
keep it in 1.5x it will be finished in 1
hour 15 minutes it's a revision solidly
a revision class so every subject you
are having minimum two and three few
subjects you are having three to four PR
classes so your quick revision videos
for an offline student Let It Be an
offline class or a PR student let it be
a PR live class it's more than
sufficient to cover most of the content
related to the
exam whenever you feel like you are
losing the mcqs repeatedly on a
particular area then we'll think of
waiting at that area okay like for
example waiting at that area and going
into the depth oriented reading okay
same topic frequently losing mcqs okay
whatever the content is there is not
sufficient then go back and check the
content okay so then your WhatsApp
activities that regularly going to be
done we'll have some live classes we'll
have some quick revision few more quick
revision videos I'm going to upgrade
okay we we're going to solve more mcqs
we we'll be having more mock exams so
give mock so this
is a decent checklist so this year what
I am planning is I'm planning to
cover live sessions of pp books so all
of you are having PP books right so
we'll be doing PP books live of all the
subjects okay so by which I'm adding PP
books also to the checklist so this
checklist is more than
sufficient for a basic student for a
basic student
to get 500,000
below for a basic student if you are
extraordinary if you're extraordinary
definitely it will be better okay crash
course also same you'll have quick
revision videos in the crash course 2017
to 2023 mcqs will be there in your
dental PS PR live and offline papers
will be missing you'll have your
WhatsApp activity and we'll be having
live class class along with your PP
books so that is the reason why we don't
entertain people for the test series
because we will read with a particular
mode here and we are going to follow the
same mode for all the
students clear clear guys this is the
checklist to get 500 to th000 below a
for any student below average student
also you sir just passed sir I'm just
passed my percentage is hardly 55 52
percentage sir 55 60% is sufficient you
follow this you'll get 500 to th000
below rank very simple and it will be
very organized so we are trying to
organize things over a period of time
okay so we are trying our best to make
things organized we are trying to make
the things better easy for the students
okay right but make sure let it be your
an intern done with the internship or
whether you want to plan and quit the
quit the internship and focus full-time
on the preparation whatever it is make
sure you are in a secured place with
less negativity around you that is more
important you have a good content but
you have people with a toxic environment
or people who are toxic around you they
are definitely going to spoil your
preparation so SN we have so much time
okay let's let's focus on the present
thing mock if you want I'll open mocks
for you you can start whenever you want
so the final date of exam should come
out then we'll think about when to start
the mock exams without any notification
from nbe there is no point even if you
if I open the mock okay if you're very
interested and if you have already taken
uh in C inct marks will be active from
from tomorrow so you can give inct marks
there almost neat and inct the syllabus
is same if you're interested you can
start in MO there's nothing wrong people
who are already done with the syllabus
you want to go ahead of your
batchmates you're working yeah you have
rights to go ahead of your batchmates if
you want you can start in C mock because
I'm planning to provide some eight or
nine or 10 10 in marks will be active in
the next two two to three days it is
your wish how many you want to give you
can give any any doubts or suggestions
you can post us okay so this is a
mandatory
checklist apart from the regular things
what you are going to do regular things
like sir I want sir I'm okay sir I can
revise all the marked areas of my dental
pulse which are previously marked I can
do that sir okay you go do it or else uh
sir I have written short notes with
underlined stuff from from the smart
videos so I want to revise them sir yes
you can do it or else how you can revise
a smart video following this also it's
very simple like if you have a smart
video so now you have a question u in
any of the exam or a previous question
for example in 2019 there is a question
on ankis unilateral anle how can you
differentiate unilateral ansis and
bilateral anuses the question is there
so you're not very clear about the
explanation which is given or you feel
like okay I have already written this
notes you can go back and check that
notes when you're solving the question
or the same question is coming in the
mock exams you can go back and check
your old noes this is how you can make
your uh reading or Preparation more
effective okay so this is a mandatory
checklist that uh you should follow
okay all right any anything more guys
how to renew after the subscription
expired before the
exam no your subscription will be there
till the date of exam here it will be
automatically extended no need to worry
it's not till March 1st we'll be
extending we'll be with you till the
date of exam no need to worry
they guys anything
more
interns get an isolated places if you're
if you're focusing on Preparation that
is the reason why we always suggest the
students to come to offline Center
offline Center you'll have that positive
uh environment around you you can meet
your mentors we'll be having int ified
reading over here okay so if you want
you can come to offline centers or you
if you're not able to you can reach your
nearby study areas make a good study
study Zone and try to read
it how to take smart notes with smart
videos it is taking more time in this in
this checklist there is no smart videos
there is no smart notes I'm talking
about this checklist only
you have any doubts related to the
checklist exclusively apart from this
checklist you can post me on the
WhatsApp we can talk on for I'm talking
about this checklist any doubts related
to this
checklist yes of
course it is going to be so worthy if
you solve all the mcqs in the dental
pulse topicwise subjectwise
extraordinary chances will be more the
more the mcqs is solve the more the
mistakes you can overcome the more the
things you are going to learn the more
the things the more the mistakes you
overcome the better the rank and the
performance in the exam they're they're
completely directly proportional
reciprocation any any doubts please do
post it so many of you are asking so
many doubts on the WhatsApp so this good
time to
discuss once you are done with this and
if you feel you still have time then try
to focus on other things okay so apart
from this like offline Pro live and
everything you are going to do the
website mcqs I'm not asking you to mug
it I'm asking you to understand it okay
just give the exams and try to learn the
mistakes learning right so apart from
this learning your mistakes is also
important we'll update Sony we'll update
very soon we're already doing here on
the evening uh WhatsApp active we are
already doing
uh most of your synopsis of dental PS
and everything so let the people finish
their inct exam which is there on
November 5th then we are going to
upgrade the schedule meanwhile we are
also waiting for the notification from
nbe so that we'll give you the exact
plan until unless the final exam date is
decided I cannot come out with the exact
dates
no that's what like it is how much time
you are preparing is more important
you're an intern still reading two to
three hours it is difficult to complete
the backlogs okay you need to take off
from the college and find out a schedule
where you can complete the backlogs that
is the reason why for example you are
missing a subject at least try to finish
the backlogs in this particular sequence
try to finish the quick revision video
for example you're having two to three
quick revision videos which are not
going to take more than two to three
hours okay so in such a way I want you
to finish the backlogs if you have any
such backlogs first list out how many
backlogs are there are there five
backlogs are there 10 backlogs or out of
22 subjects you have 20 backlogs 20
backlogs difficult to cover okay if you
have five eight or something we can
accommodate in the
schedule exam will be as of now tively
my prediction is going to be in the
month of March already discussed these
are all discussed
already that that is your wish it's not
how many days it is how many
hours they still Telangana interns
they're going to colleges so they can
cannot read more than five to six hours
per day for example you see Maharashtra
interns there are few Maharashtra
interns who has recently came to
Hyderabad in the offline Center they're
reading 14 to 15 hours per day so it is
almost three times okay so a one day of
in a Telangana
intern is equal to three days of a
Maharashtra intern okay so it is 1 is to
three ratio so this maharash in who is
sitting in the offline Center can finish
a particular subject in in six days okay
and uh for example they're completing a
subject in two or three days and the
same subject will be done in a six days
or a seven days by a telan so that is
how it is going to be it is number of
hours you reading per day is more
important than number of days left over
for the
preparation you prepare a checklist okay
you prepare a checklist and okay you
feel like I'm end I'm good in Endo okay
so first try to differentiate between
the subjects okay try to list out the
subjects okay the 10 subjects which you
are good at 10 subjects which you are
bad at okay or for example there will be
untouched or un uncovered subjects okay
so you give more priority to the
uncovered or uh like uncovered or you're
not proper with the subjects you give
more priority for example the schedule
is going with general surgery it is not
mandatory that you have to go with the
general surgery if you're already done
with the general surgery and the general
surgery is coming second time it's not
mandatory that you have to go with the
general surgery if you feel like I'm not
good at Dental pharmacology you can skip
general surgery and focus on Dental
pharmacology that's what we don't have
any limited time uh like for example
revision of a single subject will be
different for you and different for me
so you have to decide uh in how many
days I'm going to give a schedule my
schedule is keeping in mind of all the
students but your schedule is keeping in
mind of only you and your
capabilities so that is the reason why
don't my suggestion is don't get over
excited I want to finish this I want to
finish that okay do it do it okay keep
some
uh you have a video Yeah Sur how to
avoid negative marking you have a video
on YouTube you can you can uh negative
marking you type it MDS coner you'll
have a video okay you can check it off
or you can just ping me on the WhatsApp
I'll send you how to aoid negative
marking how to aoid negative marking my
answer is simple what is my
answer how to AV negative
marking what is my regular answer how to
a negative
marking get more right answers yeah your
negative marking all will will get
nullified you you can check those
videos negative marking impact will come
into existence only in the marks like
for example you're taking an exam on
Endor there is nothing called as impact
of negative marking because you're
reading Endo in the last five days and
you're taking an exam on Endo so you'll
definitely go for the right answer there
is no overlapping or there is no
confusion but if you're handling 20 to
25 subjects in a single paper then the
existence of negative marking or imp of
negative marking will be
more
checklist
checklist I want you to check finish the
checklist first whether reading the book
or our smart videos or dental P synopsis
which is worthy this checklist is worthy
first of all if you want to be in 500
below or thousand below of the state
finish the this checklist first then if
you have any
time if you have time for example there
are people who are reading 15 hours per
day they have more time then they can
they can extend that okay but basically
I want you to finish this keep it as a
first
priority that is what I'm telling you
this checklist will give you 500 below
thousand below all India rank so first
of all if you want to get 10 below all
India rank also it is
mandatory that you should get 500 below
500 below student will only get 10 below
rank right so this is a mandatory
checklist for MDS conquer students to
get 500 below all India rank so after
this 500 below if you have time then you
try to prioritize which is more
important for you because once you're
solving mcqs okay then you will feel
like do you do I mean just an open
question for all of you so you have
around 20 20 subjects okay roughly and
you have so many notes notes so many
videos so many mcqs can you do all these
things in the
last last 10 days can you do all these
things in the last 10
days yes or no is my
options yeah the answer is very simple
no then you prioritize the things which
are more important you're just going for
a buffet yeah marriages will go for a
buffet right conferences and
everything so in a good Buffet you're
going to keep So Many Items deserts only
10 will be there so totally their target
is to keep 500 600,000 items can you
taste all thousand items in a buffet can
you taste all thousand
items yes or
no or for example 10 deserts are there
can you taste all the 10 deserts we
cannot taste all the all the 10 deserts
it's very simple like what so what I
want to eat okay so I'm going to ask my
friend who is already done with the
dinner which is good RA what is what
desert is 10 deserts are there which is
good okay I I prioritize them okay I
like Biryani I'll eat Biryani I'll have
lemon rice also there I don't like lemon
rice I eat Biryani CD rice is there in
my home why I should come to a party and
eat CD rice I don't I like this
particular sweet okay I'll eat that I
like this so I'll prioritize the things
which are more important so if you have
a buffet of things in front of you this
is a checklist of buffet which is very
important for you to get a rank below
500 so after finishing this still your
stomach is empty and if you're feeling
hungry then it is your wish or you can
ask me call me sir we done with all
these items so now I want to finish with
a buffet with a with a good uh desert
sir so tell me which desert is good
which desert will be more scoring
which is more important more efficient
desert you tell me I'll tell you then
you can do
it no nidi we don't have any such
discrimination for your uh for your neat
exam neat exam every subject is going to
have an equal importance if you just
prioritize the number of subjects the
number of subjects will be more in final
year when compared to first second third
year okay number because we'll be
covering eight final year subjects so
the number of subjects will be more in
final year so each subject is going to
carry 14 marks okay so 8 into 14 the
number is huge definitely final year
subjects which are going to be I'm not
telling they're more important or more
scoring I'm telling they're going to
carry more marks because number of
subjects are more like you see third
year you have three subjects only so 3
into
14 3 into 14 second year third year
first year second year third year okay
you have third year subjects only three
subjects are they 3 into 14 so you have
only 52 marks so when I'm talking about
uh the last final year subjects they are
eight 8 into 14 so scoring will be more
so every subject has an equal importance
in neat examination inic clinicals are
more important uh your neat exam every
subject has an equal importance and
final year subjects are going to carry
more
score
mock exams here Racha go open the
website click on the mock exams go into
neat
folder neat question papers will be
there from 2018 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022
papers are there 2023 will get activated
in a couple of
days
anything more
guys trust the
mentor okay and trust yourself start
working don't questioning yourself okay
the beauty here is if you start
working you will be in the list okay
it's very simple this preparation is
very very simple very organized
preparation
they will release the admit cards here
we'll get to know don't worry we'll
we'll drop the notification once they're
open about inct examination centers and
H tickets that is your admit
card anything more winers
and once you feel like you are getting
more questions on a particular Topic in
a particular subject you try to open the
particular written smart notes or the
the notes what you have written from the
smart videos and you can add on that to
that particular Point okay for example
you're frequently losing McQ on a
particular classification which you know
that you have already written in your
notes go back and check that notes
so this is how you are going to
correlate sh if you have time you can do
you have to do it if you have time
that's what I'm telling this is a
priority guys I hope like few of you are
solving uh mcqs okay so tell me how many
mcqs will be there in a particular
subject from 2017 to
20123 roughly how many it's going to be
per each subject
roughly I hope most of you have solved
it easily easily you'll be having 50 to
60 mcqs per year okay right 50 to 60
mcqs per year 50 mcqs per year how many
years I have told you seven years so
you're having how many
mcqs 350
mcqs of each
subject okay right and uh in the website
just a rough calculation okay so 2017 to
2023 you'll be having 350 to 400 mcqs
means Concepts
okay one second thing I'm talking only
about subject
specific subject specific subject
specific mcqs on the website will be
subject specific plus you have grand
exams
Grand exams right so many exams are
there on each subject you will minimum
minimum you will have 200
mcqs okay you have quick revision videos
for example you are a pro lifee student
each subject you'll have again 200 mcqs
if you're an offline student you'll have
300 to 400 mcqs so you're are covering
so many Concepts here Unk knowingly
that's what my point is okay so no need
to break your heads if you have time
okay okay if you solve Dental BS if you
don't have time you keep them as a
priority
okay most of the things will be covered
there in these uh 500 mcqs okay so of
each subject most of the concepts will
that is the reason why I'm asking not to
focus on the McQ and the answer I'm
asking you to focus on the explanation
part of an McQ for example they're
giving a classification so what is El
class for okay so I don't want you to be
perfect with only El class for I want
you to be perfect with every class of
Elis so that's what integration has to
be done so that integration is required
whenever your syllabus is limited you
can learn depth oriented reading is
required so that is what my focus for
the next four months if the exam is in
March you have four months of
preparation time which is a great
preparation time according to me okay
you can do wonders in four months so
even if you start today there is high
chance that you will end up with 100
below 200 below all India rank even if
you start today today Fresh Start
chances are there that you will get a
great Rank 4 four months four into uh
like four 4 into 30 120 days and each
day of minimum of 10 hours so 120 days
into 10 is 1,00 hours of preparation or
around thousand hours of preparation is
extraordinary for a good student decent
student to get 200 below or 100 below
all India I have seen people doing this
in the last s to eight years of my
experience I've seen people doing this
it's very
easy anything
more please do drop me if you have any
concerns or anything so that I'll try to
explain here it's very simple
preparation is very very very very
simple okay things is you try to
organize yourself keep a priority do the
checklists mark the checklist and do it
and revise it again and again give exams
properly so and try to analyze where you
are going wrong and revise them again
and can so this is how you can make
yourself best in the preparation phas
okay so don't break your stress it is
very simple I see most of the students
they they complicate the things they do
that mix right suggestions from Seniors
Juniors batchmates all the stories to
stay away from all this for the
next couple of months just try to hear
the voice of the mentor try to follow
the suggestions that are given by the
mentor more than sufficient most of you
will definitely crack the entrance exam
okay right
so next year the opportunities are more
seats are more okay in all India State
Cota everywhere seats will be more okay
so a category seats will be more
compared to B category seats next year
so the chances of getting into good
colleges and good departments are very
very high so let's work for the next
four months and
achieve a good rank which is going to
give Pride for you me and your family
and this is going to sustain
uh and hold uh the future in the
Dentistry for the next few years of
Dentistry okay right clear anything more
or shall we close for
now let's do it yeah good it's good okay
it's good good it's very good okay so
last but not the least is when I was an
intern I was an intern okay there's
nothing to hide so I'm also same same
like like you okay so always I I just
check out the uh negative aspect of
everything okay negative aspect of
everything so I see why why this why not
that why I have to study I want to enjoy
with my
batchmates I roam I enjoyed we used to
have parties okay so we wasted a time
I'm not feeling regret for what I have
done but over a period of time post
internship uh the breaks I have taken
because of my financials up ups and
downs in my uh life and everything so we
have taken few breaks so I have learned
so much about life okay so life will
teach you everything so the teaching uh
should be in your golden face I told you
right five years of golden face will be
there so I want you to focus learn
everything good bad everything ups and
downs troubles and everything if you
learn in the golden phase of your
professional life then you'll be happy
in the upcoming phase okay if you don't
handle the things properly in the golden
phase then there is a high chance that
if you get such challenges uh in your
settled pH means marriage post marriage
and all these things you will you cannot
manage them it's going to be so
difficult so whenever God is giving you
some
challenges in this particular phase
maybe in the next five years accept them
learn them try to overcome them enjoy
them because life is to have both the
sides okay so you'll be more
successful uh when you cross the journey
as a failure okay once you fail you will
know the real value of success real
flower of success you will get to know
only once you fail okay right so it's
very simple yeah that's what I'm telling
like I I see the offline
students and I I see the interns I was
in Ida I was seeing few
inters and I I check out like uh once
I'm very bored or once I'm traveling on
the flight I check Che out few of your
status statuses on your WhatsApp and all
that sometimes I feel good sometimes I
feel I feel bad it's not bad I feel pity
for the people because why I feel pity
is I know your journey because I have
cross the journey I have done that
journey I was an intern I know how you
behave when I was repeating sitting in
the offline centers even then I enjoy I
used to play cricket I enjoy I used to
go for movies I used to have parties I
used to
roam but the outcome is okay I'm not
feeling bad for the outcome but the
outcomes will have both pros and cons
like you feel bad okay why I have done
like that I should have done like this
so what my point is why I feel pity
about you is because I see this fellow
is same copy paste of me this this
fellow is behaving in the same way how I
used to behave when I was an intern how
I used to behave when I was in a
repeater or how I used to behave when I
was a PG okay so my consent is you are
doing the
same process that what I have done or
what my seniors have done or my teachers
have done but at with a different levels
with a different levels and few of them
they quit this process but few of them
will not quit this process if you're not
quitting then it is fine perfectly fine
but I see the generation most of them
are quitting this process in the middle
because they feel bad that okay I'm not
up to Mark I may not achieve this so
let's quit this I see most of the
girls uh so in the latest uh uh things I
have seen more girls like you see
interns I see more than 80% do you do do
you accept this 80 80 out of 100 batch 8
year girls more than eight year girls I
have been seeing this in most of the
colleges of Andra Telangana
Maharashtra is it right guys are there
any exception colleges more than 80% are
girls EX or no 80 batch of 20 boys less
than 20 boys 80 girls and I see so I'm
addressing this for the girls I'm
feeling very bad uh there is a my
batchmate my role number is 66 my uh my
friend's role number is
65 she's doing good she's very happy in
her life recently I met her in
uh in in the alumon meet and we were
talking and she was asking me Shri
should I
start preparation uh you want me to do
MDS my husband is his husband is very
good okay lucky it's lucky he's
motivating me to do some Masters go back
to the college do some Masters and he's
motivating me he's ask she's asking me
2013 we are inance after 10 years my
batchmate is coming and asking me is it
a good idea to do MDS
now okay so what I personally have seen
is girls more of these 80 girls more
than 40 girls are quitting
Dentistry putting Dentistry so the left
over are 40 girls okay in this 40 girls
20 girls are being encouraged to finish
the Masters or they have their
priorities and goals and they are uh
making their family to support them or
going against the family to achieve the
goals so we are left over with 80 girls
40 girls are done with Dentistry they're
quitting it the left over 40 girls 20
girls are fighting
surviving making the family to support
them doing something okay so they are
able to achieve the girls but the left
over 20 who really want to do MDS or
really want to practice dentist and do
something to the society for their
well-being okay you'll have that Pride
light right after after 10 years your
your children in the school telling my
mom is a dentist okay she has a clinic
here she works there she has so many
patients she's very busy so that is
going to uh it has some professional
Society I mean the society is going to
recognize you and your future generation
also okay my father is this my mother is
this so that for to carry that Pride I
see few of my friends and few of the
people who has taken Long Lap they're
coming back and doing
Masters to have that okay right so I I'm
seeing this like I I regularly get calls
from the students they feel bad they cry
okay for what the things that are
happening in the family maybe your
inance now you have that freedom okay uh
enjoying the freedom enjoying
that uh that Legacy I mean that that
that privilege that is given by your
parents but things will not be same
after a few years so I'm more worried
about that okay so let's let's do
something finish it off now okay you
should not get regretted bad okay you
see my bchm coming after 10 years
few of my batchmates last last year my
batchmate has got 1200 all India rank
okay she she she's doing MDS now and
luckily four of my batchmates who has
taken coaching uh with MDS conquer and
they are yes they're done with the few
of them are done with the PG and they're
very happy for the calls what they have
taken so there are many uh Housewives
okay so recently we had a we have a mam
in our in our MDS last year to need 2023
son is preparing for ug need mother is
preparing for PG need okay so luckily
both of them has got good ranks okay
ma'am has Got
U government government seat okay she
got a government seat okay and similarly
last year we had one more student uh
ma'am one more ma'am who is age of my
mother okay her age was like 54 years
okay so 54 years she has cracked the
entrance exam and she has taken
admission and she has restarted the
journey so I I myself will question why
what she will do 54 years
okay it's their dream yeah it's their
dream okay so we may think okay there
are few students coming and asking so
what they will do sir at 54 years no
it's their dream that is going to give a
high level of confidence on their life
and that that is going to give a great
satisfaction for them okay so you see my
batchmate after 10 years coming back and
asking me I'm thinking of to start
preparation thinking of to join MDS do
you feel can I manage because you know
me from four years of our ug Journey can
I do you think can I I told yes it's an
extraordinary call yeah even if I get a
chance to go back to college and restart
the things I'm always open because
college is something where you have
everything everything okay you have fun
and everything you may be you may be old
but your batchmates will not be old
right there so they they Ang so they
make you uh to enjoy that college life
okay right so I hope like you have
privilege with you a few of them are
exception for this maybe few of them uh
they have restarted the preparation with
a Lap okay so if you have a privilege
use it okay you're lucky everyone is not
having the same privilege I see students
financially parents are not they don't
have a great backups so they're not much
interested to support I see students who
got great ranks but in in the lab of
counseling and uh it's very bad you see
I have a student two years back we have
a student who got very good rank very
good rank she she her rank will deserve
a government Dental College seat in Endo
you see how much good rank that is but
she has not joined she has not joined
it's very bad it's very painful you know
sometimes for the mentor
who really monitor the hard work or
commitment of a good student get a good
rank we are very happy getting a good
rank if the student is not joining
because you see nowadays the counselings
and the exams are having a good lab like
you see when the exam was done in the
month of March when counselings are done
counselings are done after six months so
in this six months lap the girl got
married the girl got married and the
illas were not at all
interested uh to support in continuing
her education see so much painful
preparing so hard getting a good rank
which deserves a government Dental
College seat you see how much hard work
the student has kept and finally uh the
marriage or these XYZ things which are
not controlled by us are going to change
Our Fate the the particular individual
will have regret throughout their life
okay right so I don't want any one of
you to fall in the same pool okay let's
enjoy this
process I'll be there to support you
along with my team in all the ways what
whatever that is possible preparation
wise hitting you psychologically to
making you a better individual or
helping you in dentist and everything so
let's do this together it's a team
workor okay you require it's a
reciprocation work okay we require
support from you how can I make you to
get a rank
is either you have to get a rank from
your side or you can take the help of a
mentor to get a rank but how can I make
my students to get a rank is the proper
way of
reciprocation so let's work hard from
both the ends it's not only you it's not
only me okay I sit every day 2:00 3:00

reciprocation yes most of you are doing
