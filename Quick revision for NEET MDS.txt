again hi everyone I'm here to discuss
some of the important numericals an
examination point of view mostly the
stuff is related to the prosthetics so
please try to follow me we'll cover as
much stuff as possible in a limited
duration of time okay so coming to the
first one I want to discuss about the
masticatory forces first in natural
start a natural teeth
it is 616 your doubts okay
and first complete denture it is 110
Newton's or six to eight cases or 13 to
18 pounds similarly there is one more
question related to the amalgam that is
condensation force of amalgam the
condensation force of amalgam is one to
two cases or three to four lbs or 13 to
18 Newton's okay I hope you are very
clear about this there are two questions
actually related to the amalgam
condensation force okay a recommended
value is different recommended value is
15 lbs okay so if I apply these 15 lbs
which is practically not possible in the
patients mode so they used or the
generally we use that is what 3 to 4 lbs
so if a keyword is their recommended
condensation force then you have to go
for the 15 lbs or if they have normally
ask what is the
condensation force that is used for
amalgam is 3 to 4 lbs for 6 - sorry 1 to
2 cages or 13 to 18 euros I hope you are
very clear about this
so the next is about the immediate
dangers so there are there 3 numericals
related to the immediate dangers first
one immediate dangers are removed after
24 hours only after 24 hours and
occlusal Corrections occlusion
Corrections in immediate dangers is done
after 48 hours so the third mcq is the
realigning further immediate denture is
done after 6 to 8 months I hope you are
very clear
coming to the immediate dentures they're
removed only after 24 hours occlusal
Corrections are done after 48 hours and
dry lining is done after 6 to 8 months
ok so moving to the next part
ok next import one is the Bennett angle
and the Bennett shift easy the net angle
is on the balancing side so the shift
will be on the opposite side so the
Bennett shift is on the working side
I hope you're clear with the concepts
until now so we'll move further we will
learn few more stuff related to the
prosthetics part that is about the
implant and their vital structures okay
the dimensions of these implants and
their vital structures in and around so
the most commonly asked question the
vital structures if they're asked in
general the distance between the implant
and the vital structures direct question
the answer is two millimeters okay
so for us they can ask a question like
this if you think if it is an implant
they can ask what is the distance from
the implant to the label that is one
millimeter lingual it is one millimeter
what is the implant and the natural
tooth distance that is 1.5 millimeter so
these are the normal questions like or
else what is the distance between the
two implants interim plan distance three
millimeters
I hope you are very clear vital success
it is to millimeters implant and the
buccal cortical placed one millimeter
implant and the lingual cortical at one
millimeter implant and the natural DS
1.5 millimeter implant and the implant
distance is three millimeters so apart
from these you need to make a note about
few more MCQs implant and nasal cavity
that is one millimeter implants and the
maxillary sinus that is one millimeter
implant and the inferior areolar
channel that is 2 millimeter implant and
the inferior border of mandible that is
1 millimeter and mental foramen
is five-millimeter okay I hope you are
clear right okay
so we'll come out with few more
numerical related stuff in this weekend
