Fields the scope of deep learning is
expanding every day deep learning can be
defined as a subset of machine learning
concerned with neural networks designed
to imitate human brain deep learning
Engineers are offered a great salary the
average salary of a deep learning
engineer in the United States is 140 000
per year most deep learning projects
involves tools like tensorflow Keras
pytots and many more if you are a
fresher this video is made for you let
us quickly drop crucial deep learning
project ideas but before moving into the
topic please make sure you subscribe to
Simply learns YouTube channel and press
the Bell icon to never miss any updates
coming to the first idea which is
chatbot a smart chatbot will utilize
deep learning to understand the context
of the user's inquiry and then provide
the relevant response chatbots can be
deployed in a variety of ways it is
always better to opt for deep learning
instead of any other Frameworks and
tools in this section we can create our
data sets and create a simple chatbot
Python language is highly recommended
for this such as the power of chatbots
that the number of chatbots on Facebook
has increased from 100K to 300K within a
year here deep learning chatbots use
machine learning algorithms the best
part is that the platform can interact
with the user with zero human
intervention next is face detection
system this is an excellent project for
a beginner it is designed to visualize
the images in real time key features of
this will be a deep neural network to
describe the face let us consider a
scenario assume two different images of
the same person then the network should
recognize the image of the person
without fail it suggests that the model
should recognize facial features and
generate numbers using these aspects you
can develop the model use using Python
and CV with the help of this project you
will gain experience with object
identification and learn how to
recognize anything in a picture up next
we have image classification system due
to advancements in deep learning image
classification is much easier today we
can implement this idea by developing
deep neural networks that can recognize
different images we'll train the
computer to identify and categorize
images tensorflow and python will be
used to create the software coming up we
will learn about cancer detection system
cancer is a serious condition that must
be detected as soon as possible we can
use an image classification technique to
quickly identify the disease because
cancer cells differ from normal cells in
this area deep learning models have
excel at accuracy the provided training
data determines how accurate the model
will be and the most important deep
learning idea which is called called
fake news detection system thanks to
digitalizations Consumers have access to
every news at their fingertips but every
news we get might not be true companies
like Facebook Google and others use AI
to identify and detect fake news from
their platforms there are different
methods for achieving this objective but
this effort only aims to spot the
suspect ones by skimming the text coming
up we have gender and age detection you
may have noticed that many smartphones
cameras now incorporate AI they are even
capable of determining a person's gender
and AIDS deep learning can be used for
this but we will need a lot of data to
build a model coming to language
translator using deep learning you might
have used Google translator quite often
machine translation one of the most
well-known subfields in computational
linguistics focuses on translation from
one language to another nmt which is
abbreviated as neural machine
translation which has grown in
popularity and Effectiveness with deep
learning is one of the most effective
algorithm for this task and the last one
is drowsy driver recognition system
fatigue is one of the main factors in
accidents on the road long distance
drivers sometimes find themselves dozing
off in the driver seat to prevent and
minimize such tragedies our work aims to
develop a drowsiness detection agent you
will build a system that can recognize
closed eyes in drivers and alert them if
they nod off behind the wheel using
Python opencv and Keras this device will
inform the driver even if their eyes are
closed for a short period preventing
potentially fatal car accidents these
were the most important project ideas in
deep learning hope will have covered all
the crucial project ideas for you in
case of any queries please feel free to
mention them in the comment section
