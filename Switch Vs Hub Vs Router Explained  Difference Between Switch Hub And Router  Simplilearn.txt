foreign
there are multiple devices at work that
oversees the data exchange over the
communication Channel
these devices are differentiated based
on their performance processing unit and
working protocols which we'll be
discussing later in the session
hi guys and welcome to yet another
interesting video by simply learn
but before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to Ms an update from
us
now without further Ado let's take a
look at the agenda for this session
to begin with we will look into what is
a hub and some information related to
the network hub
moving to the next topic we will look
into what are network switches and some
information about the same
next we will look into what are network
routers and how they affect the
networking exchange of data between
communication channels
as for the last topic will be a
difference between a network Hub switch
and a network router
let's begin with the introduction to the
network hub
a network Hub is a device that is
designed to connect multiple Network
units in a closely connected Network
channel
so hubs are also used in Lan Networks
the network Hub shares data with the
destination device by acting as a
central connection point of data
transmission and connecting all the
other devices to in the channel
some points to remember about the
working of a hub Hub is incapable of
processing any complex protocols due to
the absence of an intelligent unit in
the system
also the physical model of the Hub is
composed of multiple sockets for
connecting network devices
now let's move on to the working of a
network hub
for the first scenario we will assume
that a message is being sent through the
Hub to a destination node
let's begin
according to the example Hub has
received a message for device a
where it will share the same message to
device a
which is a basic protocol
but due to the absence of any
intelligent unit or a processing point
in the hub device it will share a
message for a to all the other connected
devices that are device p as well as
device C
this creates a lot of access of traffic
in the network channel
now let's move on to the second scenario
which is when receiving a response from
the device
in this case when the device a shares a
response to the hub to be sent to the
sender device it will share the same
response to all the other connected
devices again due to the same reason
that is lack of any Processing Unit or
intelligent point
in the network channel
please take a look at the arrow points
which is very important during the
transmission of data
with this we have clear all the points
that are important for a network Hub now
let's move on to the next topic that is
information on switches
the network switch is a networking
device that is active in the data link
layer of the OSI model and is designed
specifically to connect private networks
in a line Channel
switches are program to share messages
only without designated device that is
mentioned in the header format of the
message
which cut down the network traffic in
the channel
switches uses different types of data
which can be either packets or data
frames
switch uses a destination Source address
and the destination address for
forwarding the message to the specific
device in the system
now let's look into the working of a
network switch
the first scenario is when the message
is received to a switch and is to be
forwarded to a particular device
in this case we are receiving a message
for device a
which will be shared only to device a
according to the address mentioned in
the header format
this
decreases the network traffic in the
channel and also prevent
the access of message to device B and
device C
this task of managing the address and
sending the data to the designated
device is handled using Mac address
which is used by the network card
installed in the network device
now let's move on to the second scenario
that is receiving a response from the
device in this case the switch will
receive a response from device a
which will be forwarded to the sender's
address mentioned in the message
and this will prevent the response to be
shared to device V and device C due to
the presence of a processing unit in the
switch
with this we have completed all the
important points to be known regarding a
network switch now let's move on to the
third topic that is information on
routers
let's begin
a network router is a device that is
designed to share data between multiple
networks at a much larger scale in
comparison to a hub or a network switch
it is connected to multiple devices at a
very large level
that can be considered as metropolitan
area network or a wide area network
router uses IP addresses to share data
with a specified device in the network
channel
and they also perform the task of
translating an address that is available
in a private Network to a globally
recognized Network
so that it can access Internet
which is known as Nat Network address
translation
if you want to look further in the
translation process that the router
performs you can visit our video on the
same in the simply learn Channel
now with this we have completed all the
introduction points regarding a network
router now let's move on to the working
of a network router
in this scenario a message has been
received by the router for device a
from which it will reduce the IP address
for the device a and share the data
the message deliver efficiency is
highest in case of a network router as
it uses routing path from a routing
table to guide the message to its
destination point
and vice versa
with this we have completed all the
important points regarding a network
router now let's move on to the last
setting for this session that is
difference between a network Hub switch
and a router
for this difference we will use
different features to differentiate the
working of a hub switch and a router
the first difference is based upon the
osm model layer
in case of a hub it is active in the
physical layer of the OSI model that is
also known as the first layer
and in case of a switch it is active in
the data link layer of the USM module
also known as the second layer
whereas a network router is active in
the network layer of the SI model also
known as the third layer
now let's move on to the next difference
that is based on addresses used by each
of them let's take a look
a hub as we already discussed doesn't
use a MAC address or an IP address for
the transmission of data in the network
channel
in case of a switch it uses Mac
addresses available in the network
channel to provide a guidance system for
the message to be transferred
whereas in case of a router it uses IP
addresses to transmit the data to the
designated device
let's move on to some other differences
that is format of data used in each of
them
Hub uses electrical signals or bits for
data transmission in a network channel
whereas such uses a data frame or data
package for the transmission of data
over the communication Channel
and in case of a router it uses data
packets to be transferred
and the next difference is based on the
mode of transmission
let's take a look for this
a hub is based on half duplex network
connection that means at a certain point
of time only a single device can share
or receive data from the other endpoint
of the network channel
and in case of a switch it is full
duplex network connection that means it
can simultaneously receive and send a
data packet or a data frame to any of
the network devices connected in the
system
similarly a router is also based upon
the full duplex network connection form
let's move on to the next difference
that is installation purpose
on the basis of installation purpose a
hub is mainly preferred in a lan Network
or in a private Network where two to
three devices are to be connected which
increases the efficiency due to the
absence of a processing unit in a hub
as for a switch it connects multiple Lan
networks or a large area network
available
as for the case in a network router it
is a Global Network that connects
multiple devices across the globe and
it's also designed to connect internet
to any of the device
let's take a look at the next difference
that is device classification
in case of a hub it uses broadcast
format or a broadcasting device to
transmit data over the communication
Channel due to the absence of any
Processing Unit in the system
and in case of a switch it uses
multicasting application for the
transmission of data
and in case of a router it uses routing
path from a routing table to transmit
the data in the communication Channel
let's take a look at a few more
differences
that is installation cost
a network Hub can be installed very
easily in a network channel as it does
not perform any complex task
in case of a switch
it required moderate cost installation
as it performs some complex queries or
complex protocols in the network channel
whereas in case of a router it is the
most expensive to install in a network
channel due to the high device picks and
the Performance Based protocol
and the next difference is based upon
processing and intelligence
now that we are clear a hub device does
not have any Processing Unit or
intelligence point
and is the most basic point of data
transmission
whereas in case of a switch it possesses
a processing unit
to differentiate the destination address
or a source address in the header format
of the message
whereas in case of a network router it
is the most sophisticated device among
all the three network devices as it
performs the most complex queries and
protocols in the network channel
with this we are completed
with the session on difference between a
network Hub switch and a network router
