essentials own your skills and start

begin your journey into becoming a
prompt writing Maestro so let's get
started and before commencing guys just
a quick info for you if you're one of
the aspiring AI ml Enthusiast looking
for online training and graduating from
the best universities then try giving a
short to Simply learns postgraduate
program in a ml in collaboration with
bird University and IBM you can find the
course Link in the description box below
and the pin comment so let's get started
so here we will discuss the components
of a well structured prompt along with
their explanations and examples so let's
see there are six types of components
number one is context so this sets the
scene or provide background information
necessary for understanding The Prompt
so let's see an
example and that to in chj only so the
example could be that in a world where
artificial intelligence has replaced
most jobs describe a day in the life of
a human worker so this gives the context
if you want we can type The Prompt also
that is in a world where AI has replaced
most jobs describe a day in the life of
a human
worker so this is the example of the
context so we are giving the context
that in a world where artificial
intelligence has replaced most jobs so
describe a day in the life of a human
worker so we have given the context and
ask him the result for that so this is
how it's done so we won't see the result
we'll get back here and the next
component is Task so the specific action
or question that the responder needs to
address that is the task and the example
could
be so let's see an example in the chat
gbt only we'll stop this prompt and
write the example of the task so we can
write the task example that could be
write an essay on the effects of global
warming on agriculture so you could just
ask him for an task so write an essay so
this is the task that we are asking the
chat GPT or any llm so after this we
will combine all these components and I
will show you how you can write the
perfect prompt so that you could get the
better response from the llms that could
be chat GPT or Google part so let's
write here write an essay we'll just
write on the effects of global warming
so this is the task that we are
assigning to
jgb okay so we are not interested in the
response so we'll get back here and
let's see the third component that is
Persona so that specifies the Identity
or role the responder should assume
while answering so it should be
considered for the llm that it could be
a data scientist or we just ask him that
as a medical professional or act as a
data scientist or advise a patient on
managing type to diabetes without
medication so this is how we could ask
CH gbt so for the Persona purpose we'll
write an example that as a medical
professional advis a patient on managing
type 2 diabetes okay so this is the
Persona that we have asked him to be a
medical
professional now moving to the next
component that is format that defines
how the response should be structured or
presented let's see an example so we
will ask him to list five tips for
improving personal productivity in
bullet points so in bullet points that's
the format we want from the chat jbd so
list global warming points global
warming points as bullet points so this
is the format we want we'll wait for the
response so you could see that it has
started providing in the bullet points
so moving back the next is exampler so
sometimes a sample answer or part of an
answer is given to illustrate the
expected style or content so for example
we could ask JJ that like in the example
the protagonist overcomes fear write a
story about overcoming a personal
challenge so you can give these type of
examples or if you're writing prompt to
any specific region you can give the
example for that also okay now moving to
the next one that is tone so that
indicates the move or attitude the
responder should convey so you could ask
any llm that write a humorous blog post
about the trials of parenting todlers so
you could ask the tone also if you want
we can ask chipy here that wrer humerous
I don't know spelling is correct or not
but
yeah blog post about the
trials of parenting tolers
so he will guide you in a humorous way
only and provide the response so with
the right technique you can craft
prompts that are not only precise but
also versatile suitable for any learning
management system so this approach
ensures that your prompts will engage
students encourage critical thinking and
drive meaningful discussions no matter
what the platform you use whether it
could be chat gbt or B so you could
Embrace these Technologies or components
of the prompt and write your prompt
very precisely so you could see that he
is writing a blog post in a humorous
tone so let's pause this and see an
example that contains most of the
components okay so we'll start with that
that would be nutritionist so we will
ask so as a nutritionist speaking at a
high
school and like we can write speaking at
a high school career day so create a
presentation outlining the importance of
healthy eating habits for teenagers and
use a friendly and engaging tone and
include real life success stories to
illustrate your points so there will be
context task Persona format and example
and we will set the tone also so we'll
write the prompt at a high school career
day so create a presentation or create a
draft for presentation as it can't
directly create the presentation so will
ask him presentation outlining the
importance of healthy eating
habits so healthy eating habits for
teenagers you are specifying that
also okay and here we'll set the tone
that a user friendly tone and that could
be friendly and engaging tone and
include real life success
stories to illustrate your
points okay so here text is high school
career day we have given the context and
the task is create a presentation on
healthy eating habits and the Persona we
have given is neist that CH will act as
and the format is presentation with real
life stories that's the format we have
given to him and then we have given the
example of real life success stories and
the tone we have asked is friendly and
engaging similarly we can write other
prompts so as you could see that the CH
has started drafting the response and
after that you can Rectify your response
and that could be in on liners also so
we won't go into that we will write
another prompt so that you guys can get
a clear idea so here we'll start with
another prompt that would be imagine you
a Sci-Fi author writing we will ask the
chat JY that you are a Sci-Fi author and
writing a short story
okay and we can ask him set in a
future we water is scare leing scars and
here we will ask him to craft a
narrative that explores the daily
challenges and faced by a family using a
dramatic and suspenseful tone okay daily
challenges faced by a family using a
dramatic and
suspenseful so if I tell you about this
prompt so the context is future world
with water scarcity and the task is
write a short story and the Persona we
have set here is sci-fi author and the
format is narrative and example we have
given here is the daily challenge of a
family and the tone we have asked him to
set is dramatic and suspens similarly we
can ask JJ the prompts that is as a
financial adviser prepare a guide for
young adults on managing finances after
college and use a conversational tone
include actionable steps and start with
the story of a recent graduate to
illustrate common Financial pitfalls so
here the context could be financial
management post college and the task is
to prepare a financial guide and the
Persona is financial advisor the format
is guide with actionable steps and the
example is story of a recent graduate
and the tone is conversational
so similarly you can write prompts and
generate more prompts that could be more
effective for the LMS and you could use
these methods or these components to
generate a well structured prompt so
