hey everyone welcome to this video on
node.js basics
node is a popularly used javascript
framework for back-end development
it has been widely adopted by developers
across the globe
this video will introduce you to nodejs
we will first begin by understanding
what exactly node is and what its salary
trends are
later we will understand its
architecture and what makes it stand out
from other frameworks
after that our instructor will guide you
through a step-by-step process to
install node.js on your system
and lastly you will learn how to connect
react.js with the node.js platform and
build a simple application
but before we begin if you haven't

so without further ado let's begin
welcome to this video by simply learn in
today's session we're going to learn all
about node.js so without further ado
let's begin and look at what's in store
for us first up we'll understand what
exactly node.js is then we understand
the necessity of node.js then we'll
learn about some of the parts of node.js
node.js express framework node.js use
cases and finally we'll look at some of
the industry trends so what exactly is
node.js now consider a scenario where a
user interacts with the web application
the user only interacts with the front
end of the application but there's a lot
of work that goes behind the scenes
now in a web application there's a front
end a server and a database the front
end is developed using javascript and
frameworks like angular and react while
the server is built on java php or
node.js and the backend database that
stores the data usually consists of
mysql or mongodb so node.js is an open
source cross-platform javascript runtime
environment for running server-side
applications it is used to develop io
intensive web applications like video
streaming sites single-page applications
online chatting applications and other
web applications it is used by large
established companies and newly minted
startups nodejs was developed by ryan
dal in 2009 and at the same time of this
session its latest version is v13.3.0
now that we know what node.js is let's
go ahead and look at why it was so
prevalent in the field of web
development here are a few points first
up node.js is extremely fast being built
on google chrome's v8 javascript engine
its library is extremely fast in code
execution note package manager has
around 50 000 bundles for developers so
whatever functionality is required for
an application can be easily imported
from npm all apis of node.js library are
asynchronous that is non-blocking it
means a node.js based server never waits
for an api to return data node.js
dramatically reduces the processing time
while uploading video and audio files it
is also an open source platform and is
easy for beginners for web development
the above reasons more than justified
the popularity of node.js platform and
why it is being adopted by large number
of organizations and businesses today so
now moving on let's familiarize
ourselves with the parts of node.js
node.js consists of several components
now let's look at them one by one first
up we have modules now modules are like
javascript libraries which are used in a
node.js application to include a set of
functions now we can use require
function with the parenthesis to include
a module in a node.js application
node.js application has many modules to
provide basic functionality needed for a
web application some of them could be
http util fs url query string stream and
zlip next up we have console the console
module provides a simple debugging
console that is similar to the
javascript console mechanism provided by
web browsers now the console can print
messages to std out that prints standard
output messages and stdr to print the
error messages the next component is
cluster
now nodejs is built upon the concept of
single threading programming a single
instance of node.js runs in a single
thread to take advantage of multi-core
systems the user will sometimes want to
launch a cluster of node.js processes to
handle the load a cluster can be added
to an application in this way here's a
small code for you the next component is
global now global objects in node.js are
available in all modules now these
objects are functions modules strings
etc some node.js global objects are
mentioned in the table you have dir name
that is a directory name file name
exports module and require the next
component is error handling now node.js
applications experience four types of
errors we have the standard javascript
errors system errors user specific
errors and assertion errors now errors
in node.js are handled through
exceptions now for example let's handle
an error that would occur when we divide
a number by zero now this error would
crash the nodejs application and so we
should handle this error here's a small
code for you
next up we have streaming a stream is an
abstract interface for working with
streaming data in node.js streams are
objects that let you read data or write
data continuously there are four types
of streams first one is the readable
these are these types of streams from
which data can be dead writable these
are the types of streams to which data
can be written
duplex these are both readable and
writable streams
lastly we have transform these streams
can manipulate the data while it is
being read or written moving on to the
next component buffer the javascript
language has no mechanism for reading or
manipulating streams of binary data
buffer is a module that allows handling
streams that contain only binary data an
empty buffer of length 10 can be created
by this method next up we have domain
domains provide a way to handle
different io operations as a single
group domain module intercepts errors
that remain unhandled there are two
types of methods that are used for
intercepting these errors firstly we
have internal binding in this case the
error emitter executes its code inside
the error method
next up is the external binding now here
the error emitter is explicitly added to
a domain via its add method the next
component is the dns the dns module
enables name resolution for example it
is used to look up the ip addresses of
host names dns module is used to connect
to a dns server and perform name
resolution by using the method
dns.resolve the dns module is also used
for performing name resolution without a
network communication by using the
method dns.lookup the next component is
the debugger node.js includes an
out-of-process debugging utility
accessible via a v8 inspector and
built-in debugging client this node.js
debugger is not feature packed but
supports simple inspection of code it
can be used in the terminal by using the
inspect keyword before the name of the
javascript file in order to inspect a
file say myscript.js you can use the
following method now that we are
familiar with all the major parts of
node.js let's go ahead and learn about
the node.js express framework
express is a flexible node.js web
application framework that provides a
wide set of features to develop both web
and mobile applications you can assume
express as a layer built on top of the
nodejs that helps manage the server and
the roots now let's have a quick look at
some of the core features of express
framework it is used to design single
page multi-page and hybrid web
applications it allows setting up of
middleware to respond to http requests
it defines a routing table that is used
to perform different actions based on
the http method and url it also allows
dynamic rendering of html pages based on
passing arguments to templates now
moving on let's take a quick example of
a simple hello world program now this is
developed using express framework to
gain a better understanding all right
first up we have the word express now
this is used to import express framework
into our node.js application now the
app.get method is a callback function
with parameters request and response the
request object represents the http
request and has properties for the
request query string parameters body
http headers etc the response object
represents the http response that an
express app sends when it gets an http
request now the application will listen
to the defined port which in this case
is 8.081 and variables host and port
will contain the address and the port
respectively lastly we have the
console.log which is used to show the
address and port in the command prompt
so this is what the command prompt would
look like and finally the output is
displayed on the web browser having
learned about the express framework now
let's move on and look at the node.js
use cases
now it is no doubt that node stands out
for its speed and intensive data
exchange so top industry leaders like
nasa paypal netflix among others
incorporate node.js first up we have
netflix the world's leading internet
television network with over 117 million
users is one of the top companies that
trusted their services to node.js the
reasons why the company chose to use
node.js for application scalability and
data intensive application now you must
be wondering what application
scalability is this basically the
potential of an application to grow in
time being able to efficiently handle
more and more requests per minute and
data intensive application allows
millions of people to stream netflix
simultaneously next up is walmart now
walmart is the world's largest company
by revenue with around 514 billion us
dollars according to the fortune global
500 list in 2019. again the reasons why
the company chose node.js with
asynchronous i o and efficient handling
of concurrent requests now asynchronous
io which is a form of input output
processing allows other processing to
continue before the transmission has
finished nodejs is able to efficiently
handle concurrent requests with the use
of thread pool and event queues uber
uber is an american multinational
ride-hailing company offering services
that include peer-to-peer ride sharing
pride service healing and food delivery
the reasons why the company chose
node.js were asynchronous i o quick
iterations and active open source
community as mentioned earlier
asynchronous i o permits other
processing to continue before the
transmission has finished now quick
iterations now node.js is continually
being updated and added new features
that help in further improvement in the
performance of web servers and finally
active open source community resolves
many problems that an organization may
face in a particular scenario next up we
have nasa now nasa is an independent
agency of the united states federal
government responsible for the civilian
space program as well as aeronautics and
aerospace research the reasons why the
company chose node.js were reduced
access times handling of data intensive
tasks and the fact that the servers are
active 24 7. now nasa has lots and lots
of data and using node.js has really
helped them in reducing the access times
it is also continuously handling and
working with large streams of data
node.js is highly stable which helps in
keeping the server active 24 7. next up
we have paypal now paypal is an american
company operating a worldwide online
payment system that supports online
money transfers as opposed to
traditional methods like checks and
money orders the reasons why the company
chose to use node.js was the fact that
node.js has extremely fast build times
it allows tasks to be carried out with
fewer lines of code when compared to
other server technologies like java and
php and nodejs being data intensive
efficiently handles a large amount of
data next up is medium medium is a
popular online publishing platform
developed by evan williams and launched
in august 2012. the main reasons why the
company chose to use node.js were a
data-driven applications now these
applications are ideal for being
interfaced with node.js servers b to run
a b tests now a b testing is essentially
an experiment where two or more variants
of a page are shown to users at random
and statistical analysis is used to
determine which variation performs
better lastly node.js server maintenance
is simpler than its counterparts moving
on to the last topic of this session
industry trends now node.js developers
are in demand across the globe since
many companies are adopting javascript
libraries according to forbes it is one
of the top 10 most in demand jobs
according to note source the total
number of nodejs downloads increased by
40 in the last one year the use of
node.js in production has increased
dramatically since its release in 2010.
with early adopters such as linkedin
paypal and netflix among others node.js
has seen an exponential increase in its
use in web development the popularity of
node.js is also accounted to javascript
now since javascript is the most popular
language as evident from a survey
conducted by stack overflow in 2019 many
developers can start working on node.js
library with not much of a learning
curve node.js developers are being
offered better salary options than other
web technology developers according to
pay scale the average salary of a
node.js developer in india is around 6
lakhs 13 000 rupees per year the average
salary of a node.js developer across the
united states is around 105 000 us
dollars per year hello this is matthew
from simply learn and today we're going
to jump into node.js and the
architecture around node.js
so why would you want to get involved
with working with node.js well there's
actually a lot of great reasons a lot of
the top web applications that you are
working on today are built with nodejs
and the architecture beneath it allows
you to not only just build those web
applications but to be able to build
end class applications and by enclaves
we mean
service driven applications or
applications that are running on uh your
phone on your desktop on your tablets
they can all be built with nodejs
and there are huge advantages around
working with node.js
one of the biggest ones being the huge
community around node.js and node.js is
just one of those standard solutions
that you use for building out your core
architecture when you're building out an
application and there's just a lot of
people out there that are using it
so let's jump into web applications and
how it'd be of benefit to you with your
web solutions
so
with node.js you have the client side
and the server side and the client side
has the solutions that allow you to have
hooks into the client side put together
very easily
so behind the scenes of the client you
have service and technology and
connections to your database so if
you're building out your solutions with
node.js it makes it very easy to be able
to architect the entire solution from
top to bottom for your entire
environment whether you're building that
locally on a test server whether you're
building for a traditional data center
or if you're working in the cloud
so on the client you're going to be
using technology such as react js and
angular in the server you're going to be
using node.js php and java
and then the database itself is going to
be something like mysql or mongodb and
actually the number of databases that
can be supported with node.js is
increasing all the time
so when you're working with writing your
code in angular or react.js you can even
use vue that's actually a great one
working with node.js you have this
client-side framework that provides the
hook into the web browser whether it's a
mobile web browser or a desktop web
browser
the server is then responsible for
taking those requests that are coming
from the browser and
interpreting them and so on the server
you're going to run node.js you're going
to run it alongside with php and java
php if you're not familiar is a really
great way to get started with writing
web applications that run on the server
java is just a really solid traditional
application language for building out
web apps
and then the server itself is going to
be responsible for those client
interactions with back-end services
connecting with apis and reinforcing
your security model now can you do all
of that in the client yes you can do a
lot of that in the client particularly
with the frameworks from angular and vue
they are really flexible you can do some
great things there but one of the things
you want to be looking at when you're
working with building your web
application is really three key things
one is security the second is being able
to scale your solutions and the third is
speed and responsiveness and what i have
found through my own architecture is
that if i balance out between clients
and server the load and the structuring
of how you actually build those
solutions it really helps
create a very seamless solution to your
customer
and then at the back of all of this you
have your database and my sequel a
mongodb of two popular databases but you
can also use node.js to connect to many
of the cloud databases that are running
on aws azure google cloud ibm other
services they all have connectors in
fire node.js into their databases
so let's talk about the node.js
architecture and understand why it's so
good so to begin with node.js has what's
called a single threaded event loop
architecture and this allows you to be
able to handle
many many concurrent clients at the same
time it's just a very flexible way of
being able to scale up your support for
many clients
and then in addition to that we have the
javascript event based model along with
the javascript callback mechanism that
allows you to have this standard
approach to being able to connect with
and talk and discuss interactions
between the client and the server it's
good to have these kind of standards
where you're not using something that's
unique to a specific framework or
specific technology this just makes it
so it's a more accessible for everybody
so if we look at the actual node.js
server itself everything centers around
the the concept of the event loop and
the event loop has a a an event queue an
operation completed and fire requests
threaded pull and then it'll actually do
the actual computation or the file
system interaction
all of this interconnects in a nice
seamless loop the great thing again with
node.js is that it's not new technology
it's been around for almost a decade
it's very very well tried out many of
the largest websites out there are
running node.js
so let's now dig into each of the parts
of the node.js architecture so let's
talk about requests
so the way that the request works is
that you have
your framework uh such as angular
on the client and that will then send a
request to the website and there's many
ways that those requests can happen
through web workers through forms and
through other interactions
but at some point a request is sent to
the server
and so these requests can be for data
they can be for deleting data they can
be for updating data they can be for
interacting with services as mentioned
before but the goal is to have some kind
of request now once that request
actually hits the server and then we
start actually getting into the cueing
and threading process that centers
around the event loop and this is where
node.js really excels because it's able
to use that single threaded model to be
able to manage from just even a few
requests to tens of millions of
requests so it receives the actual
request and starts the event queue and
this is where a single threading process
starts is by queuing everything up
appropriately
and then it then maintains the threat
within a pool so you have the queueing
process as one action and then you have
a threaded pool which manages those um
threads as well
and then we have an event loop which you
know goes through actually receives and
processes those requests
and then finally what we're doing is
we're actually they're going to be
interacting with a system and that could
be a database it could be a cloud system
it could be an api file system but we're
interacting with something that's
outside of the node.js server so the
node.js server itself is doing some
actions on the server but then it's also
interact with things outside of its own
server environment
and so let's talk a little bit about
that workflow
so requests come in they go into the
event queue and they get spiraled
through the event loop and then we have
a non-blocking operators which are going
to be doing the input output polling
such as kq epoll and other services and
from there we're also going to be then
interacting with the threaded pool and
we're using the blocking operations to
manage that threaded pull
and that threaded pool is going to now
then go outside of the server and
interact with something beyond the
server so whether that is a database or
file system or api or microservice these
are things that can be interacted with
and so let's go through some of these
advantages that we have here so so i'm a
fan of working with node.js so i have
lots of advantages so the one the big
ones are right off the bat is the
ability to be able to handle multiple
client requests
quickly and easily this really is
important as we move into our digital
ecosystems and we start scaling up
solutions you'll find that as you build
successful apps the demand for those
apps will grow exponentially and what
that means is you need to be able to
have a solution that can interact with
requests quickly and easily
there's no need to create multiple
threads because of the event loop again
this is another thing that's really
critical when it comes to building out
solutions you want to be able to have a
solution that can scale massively at the
flip of a switch now particularly as we
start working on building out
cloud-based solutions
nodejs also utilizes really low
resources and memory again when it may
seem like a small thing when you have a
solution and it's using just a maybe a
smaller amount of memory but if that
solution keeps adding to that memory
usage you then
restricted for how big that application
can grow so the less resources and
memory a solution is using the faster
and higher it can grow in scale in this
video we'll help you install node.js on
your windows system so without further
ado let's begin the first thing you need
to do is download node.js from their
official website
so go ahead and type
download
node.js
navigate to their official website
and here
you can see the 64-bit version so go
ahead and download that once the
download is done go ahead and run the
downloaded node.js installer
accept the license agreement keep the
default settings as it is
and then say install
so with that we finished the
installation process
once node has been successfully
installed the next crucial step is
verification now this process ensures
that node has been properly installed
to do so we first open the command
prompt and then type in a few commands
to verify the successful installation we
type in this command
node hyphen v now this command returns
the version and if it returns the
version it means it has been
successfully installed
so here we go it returns the latest
version
now the final step is to update the node
package manager now this npm is bundled
with node.js which consists of all the
repositories and packages required for
development purposes
so to do that type in the command
npm
install
npm
hyphen hyphen
global now that we're done with the
installation of node let's go ahead and
implement a small program for that we
make use of a text editor in our case
we've installed vs code so go ahead and
download vs code once you're done with
the installation this is what vs code
looks like so go ahead and click on file
and create a new file it's going to be a
simple program where you're going to
print a hello world message on the web
browser to do that we make use of http
modules so node comes with built-in http
modules to transfer data across it
so for that we make use of a require
method we create a variable first say
var
http
equals required
and just say http within single quotes
now the http module can create an http
server that listens to the server ports
and gives a response back to the client
to do that we make use of the create
server method
so let's go ahead and type the code
say http
dot create
server and internally it consists of a
function
now the parameters to this function are
request and response now the response is
basically used to write to the client so
we say response dot write and here we
type in the message say hello world
welcome
to this tutorial
once you're done with that you end the
response
so the server listens to a port number
to display the message by default it
listens to the port number 8080. so we
keep that as it is and we end it save
your file
say
demo.js maybe demo1.js and say save now
to run the program you have to open the
command prompt so open your command
prompt
and mention the path to your file so in
our case it's our desktop on the desktop
so cd
desktop and now to run it say node
demo1
dot js now you navigate to your browser
and say localhost 8080 and here we go
our message is successfully displayed
welcome to this session on how to
connect react.js with node.js and in
this session
we are actually going to look at
how do we connect react.js with node.js
so a very warm welcome to this session
on react.js connectivity with node.js
and in this session we are going to
focus on how do we connect our react.js
application with the node.js platform so
we are going to dive into creating a
hands-on demo which will have two parts
to it we would have the client
application that we will first create as
a react application we will then create
an express.js application with node.js
and we will then try to connect both of
those applications together so
express.js is a rapid application
development framework that allows us to
create a web application very quickly on
the node.js platform and we'll use it to
create a custom api and then connect
that endpoint to the react.js client
application so let's dive into our demo
and
let's start with creating our client and
node express applications and see how to
set them up and then get them connected
to each other let's start with our
hands-on demo and we will first go to
the node.js website nodejs.org we can
download the lts version which is a
stable version of node.js moment i click
on this it will prompt me for a download
it will download the msi file and then
all i need to do is double click on it
keep clicking on the next button and
install that would install node.js for
us next we'll open our editor you can
use any editor of your choice so i'm
going to use
an editor called
visual studio code and let's open up the
terminal here and i also have the
command prompt open where i've navigated
to a folder that i've created called
react.js demos now we'll invoke the npm
package manager which is invoked by the
command npx so npx will not only install
packages but also execute them once they
are installed so once they are
downloaded it will execute the package
and
we will use npx to go and create a react
application called client so while we
give it time for the installation to
complete we can then open it
within our editor so we'll give it time
uh so that the installation completes
so the installation is completed and so
we've seen here that the installation
has now completed and let's uh go and
open up this project so i will say file
and open folder and
let me pick up that folder and we will
open this application called client so
that's my client app let's fire up the
terminal so
okay so that has launched the terminal
for us
and here uh all we need to do to fire up
this application and get it running is
npm start which will compile and start
up this application that is created
let's close this we'll go to the browser
and now let's say localhost 3000 so that
gives us a startup page the sample uh
default startup page for the first
client application uh and this is going
to work as a client we'll now go and try
to create
the back-end
application which is going to be another
application that we will set up and to
create that
let's say npx
express
generator api okay so this will uh
create an express application on node.js
called api and let's give it some time
for installation okay so that's done
clear this screen we'll come out here
we'll open another instance of the
editor we'll say open folder and that's
the api application we'll say select
folder and the api application is opened
let's go to the terminal now in the
terminal we will attempt to install all
of the packages that are required that
would be logged in the package.json file
so the package.json file here would be
listed uh so you can see we have a list
of packages that it uses and npm install
will go and install all of these
packages that were pre-listed here so
let me ensure it's executed correctly
and we'll fire that once more that's
done so npm install has installed all of
the packages required and let me
terminate this run by pressing a control
c so this terminates
the client application that was
executing and now we will say npm start
so that this application executes and
let's refresh
so that's the standard express
application now that has got installed
now let's go to the api application
we'll go into the bin folder and here
we'll have a file called www we will
change the default port number from 3000
to 9000 let me stop this application
from executing we've just updated the
port number now let's go to the routes
and we'll create a new file in the
routes folder called test api dot js
here we will say variable express
equal to require express
and here we'll say variable router equal
to
express dot
router and here we will say
router.get we'll open this
so that's the default route root route
is going to be slash for which we'll add
a callback function which will take the
request and the response parameter and
next pointer in case there is another
function to call post that and here we
will just send a simple message saying
api is working okay a simple message
sent out for the root default route and
we'll have to export this so we'll say
module dot exports equal to router all
right so that's uh done let's go to the
app.js file and here let us import that
so here is where we will import this
by saying app.use we want to use the
test api file and that is
test api router and this is exactly the
same variable name that we will declare
here which will be equal to require and
we are going to say routes
test api all right so let's try
launching this now we would say npm
start after adding this code let's go
out here and 3000 test api is going to
be the url to hit it's not three
thousand but nine thousand now because
we just updated the port so nine
thousand test api and there we have a
message which says that the api is
working properly so this is tested now
let's go to
the client application in the client
application let's go to the app.js file
okay this is the file that
we would have to revamp a bit so let's
uh revamp this here we will declare a
class app which extends so that creates
a new module so it extends
react.component
and here we have constructor we will
accept the props
here i would pass props to the super
class constructor and
set the state to api response
currently it just has an empty value
next we'll add up a new function called
call api which will generate a call to
that
api url which was http localhost 9000
was the port and test api was the url
once this is called we will then call
the then function declare response
generate a call to response.txt and then
we will again say this dot set state api
response
is going to be equal to the response
that comes in from that url which is
nothing but a string which says api is
working another function called
component will mount so the moment the
component is initialized on the screen
and loaded we will generate a call to
this function we created called call api
then comes
the render function in the render
function we would go and return a div
class name as app this would be app
header the standard logo after which
in the paragraph we wouldn't need the
link here right after the header we'll
add a paragraph where we will print this
dot state and the variable we created
called api response and we will data
bind to that so that largely completes
uh the return so we simply create this
application uh that's the react
application that will talk to this api
that is and this uh url that is hosted
on node communicate with it get a simple
string as a response print that string
inside this
react application so once that's done uh
we have the component wheel mount which
is a life cycle method here it's a
lifecycle event that gets triggered the
moment the component loads and that's
when uh we have actually gone and
executed the call api custom function
let's go to the api application we'll
terminate the execution here there's one
more step that we'll have to perform
which is cross origin
resource sharing which means that to
allow the react application to
communicate from another hosted domain
to this particular domain server we will
actually have to enable cross origin
scripting and sharing otherwise it will
block the request coming from another
application so for that we'll have to
install globally cross origin module and
dash dash save indicates that it's going
to do a global install for all
applications
that are on this particular system so
we've installed this
and we'll clear the screen let's go to
the app.js
and right here is where we would want it
to go and use cards so we will say
app.use course so that it uses this
particular api and here is where we will
declare the course variable and go and
import the new library package that we
just installed which is quartz so looks
good and now let's
fire up this application with an npm
start let's also fire up client with an
npm start and now when i go and
try looking for localhost 3000 which is
the react application the react
application should go and talk to the
api that is hosted on node.js which
returns to me that string message so if
i go and ping that api separately which
is localhost
9000 test api you can see this is a
standard message so here i directly ping
the api that's hosted in node.js now we
are consuming it through the react.js
application and if you scroll down you
can see the message returned from
node.js into react saying the api is
working properly so the practical impact
of this is to actually host restful
services etc on node as a server and you
can go and consume the data that is
returned there could be in string text
or json format directly into the
react.js acting as a client application
and with that we have come to the end of
this tutorial
i hope it helped you get an
understanding of node and how it works
