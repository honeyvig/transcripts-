preparing for a linux developer role so
this video is for you hello everyone and
welcome back to another video by simply
learn this is anubhav and in this video
we will be learning about linux
interview questions but before we begin
if you haven't subscribed to our channel
already make sure to hit the subscribe
button and press the bell icon so you
will never miss any update from simply
learn so without further ado let's begin
and see what's in it for you
first we will see the introduction to
linux after that we will see trends and
recent changes in linux commands
moving ahead we will see how to become a
linux developer after that we will see
the opportunities and salaries of linux
developers
and after that we will see linux command
interview questions
linux platform gives its open source
natures has integrated a wide range of
innovation minds who have given their
best to introduce world changing ideas
into reality
linux is basically an operating system
which is popular for its efficiency as
well as its performance
it can run on various hardware platforms
manufactured by ibm intel and hp
now let's see some trends and recent
changes in linux commands
linux is super computing the development
and deployment of linux powered
supercomputers is a trend that shows no
signs of awarding given the flexibility
structure of the linux system as well as
the compatibilities it has
the usage of linux has a supercomputer
operating system is guaranteed to remain
one of the most important linux trends
in 2022.
let's see the next point new linux based
hardware
the linux platform has gained a
repulsion since the raspberry pi and
chromebooks gained the attention of the
particular domain of viewers these linux
based components are breaking new
grounds as the new pass
thanks to their small from size and
ability to perform routine tasks with
ease the platform has now witnessed
advanced implementations throughout the
prior calendar year
now
the next point we will be discussing is
the cloud and the linux
although linux is popular in the
technological community
it is going to continue to increase in
popularity in line with the open-minded
techniques of 2022.
as cloud-based technologies and the
linux system are so interconnected
the linux system is expected to grow
with the cloud-based alternative
now let's see the next point which is
chromebooks and chrome os
chrome os has transformed into the most
flexible operating system available in
the market
chrome os just obtain the ability to
connect with google play store and run
just about any android app
giving user one of the most trained web
circuit experience possible
talking into consideration the
improvements on the operating system it
is too soon going to be on a quick
survey towards possibilities becoming
the most flexible platform compatible on
running android and linux softwares
now
let's see how to become a linux
developer
let us take a look at the required
skills needed to make a career as a
linux developer
first one is learn c programming
the first and the foremost thing which
is needed
is learn c programming most of the part
of linux are written in c if you want to
contribute low level parts of the system
you should know the assembly language as
well however
intentionally it is important to learn
the c language
next step is to learn algorithms and
data structure to become a linux
developer you should have a fundamental
knowledge of data structure and
algorithms and algorithm is basically a
step-by-step approach to solve a
particular problem
on the other hand data structure works
on organizations data both these
components help the programmers to solve
the problem within a minute
the next step you should learn is
operating system
now that you have acquired some
knowledge of the programming the next
thing on your to-do list should be learn
everything about the operating system
and then
do some programming
competitive programming can help you
masters algorithms and data structures
it also shows you how to solve a program
in a short period of time
a competitive programmer must be able to
solve an issue in a short amount of time
now let's see the opportunities and
salaries of linux programmers
when it comes to linux professionals you
have two choices
you can either work towards becoming a
developer or you can go into
administration
furthermore the professional options are
not limited to linux platform they
encompass the wide range of application
the following are the areas where hiring
managers are looking for hiring linux
developers
first one is system architecture
linux system architecture salary in
india range between 6.3 lakhs to
44 lakh with an average annual salary of
21.1 lakhs
the next one is system administration
the average salary of a system
administration in india range between
rupees 2.4 lakh per annum to rupees 4.5
lakh per n
the next one is
web developer and development linux
developer average annual salary in india
range from rupees 3 lakh to 8.9 lakhs
and for desktop and app development
every starting salary for linux
developer and app developer is in india
is rupees 3 lakh per year
now
we'll move ahead with the linux command
interview questions
the first question that we will discuss
is what is linux
linux is a uni-based open source
operating system lena storewalls was the
first to introduce linux the primary
goal of linux was to give a free and low
cost operating system for people who
couldn't buy windows ios or unix
now
the next question is define linux kernel
is it legal to edit linux kernel
the answer is the linux kernel is a low
level software system it is used to keep
track of resources and give a user
interface
yes it is legal to edit linux kernel
linux is released under the journal
public license which is gpl and any
project which is released under gpl can
be edited and modified by the end users
let's move on to the next question
which is
what is l-i-l-o
l-i-l-o
denotes linux loader it is basically
linux boot loader which loads linux
operating system into a main memory to
start execution
most of the computer systems are
featured with boot loaders for certain
versions for mac os or windows os
so
if you want to use linux os you have to
install a special bootloader for it when
a computer gets started bios conducts
small initial test and transfer control
to the master boot loader
for from here lalo loads the linux os
and start it
the benefit of utilizing lilo is that it
ensures a quick boot of the linux
operating system
moving ahead let's move on to the next
question
which is what are the basic components
of linux
the following are the basic components
of linux first one is shell
it is a linux interpreter which is used
for executing commands
the next one is kun
kernel is the core part of the operating
system which is used to manage hardware
and operations
after that
the next one is system utilities
these are the software functions which
help users to manage their computers
the next one is gui
gui donates graphical a user interface
through which the user can interact with
the system
but online cli gui compresses buttons
images and text boxes for interaction
the next one is application programs
software programs are designed to
complete a particular task
now
the next question is which shell are
used in linux
the following are the most common types
of shell used in linux the first one is
fish
friendly interactive shell offers some
special features such as web-based
configuration
fully scriptable and auto suggestions
with clean scripts
the next one is bash
boring again shell is the default for
most of the linux distributions the next
one is
zs8 zhil offers unique features like
startup files
file name generation login or logout
watching and closing comments
the next one is
chs
c shell follows c like syntax and has
features like spelling correction as
well as
job control
now
let's move on to the next question
what is swap space squab space is the
extra space utilized by linux to
temporarily keep concurrently running
processes when ram space is sufficient
when you start a program it is stored in
ram so that the cpu can quickly retrieve
data
if you have more running programs then
ram can accommodate the swap space is
used to store these programs
the processor will now search for the
ram and swap space for data
swap space is used in the form of
execution of ram by unix
let's move on to the next question
which is differentiate between
dos and bash
bash is a command which is case
sensitive and dos commands are not case
sensitive
in bash there are eight characters for
file name post fixed with three
characters for the extension and in dos
no naming conventions are used
again bash is used as an escape
character and dos is used in the form of
directory spatter
now let's move on to the next question
which is
what is file permission
in linux
the following are the three types of
permission in linux first one is the
read
it allows its user to open and read the
file
the next one is right it allows its user
to open and edit the file and the third
and the last one is execute it allows
its user to run the file
the next question is
what are inode and process id
inode is a unique name provided by the
operating system for each file similarly
process id is also a unique id provided
to each process
what are linux directory commands
given below are the five main directory
commands in linux
the first one is pwd
it displays the path of the present
working directory
the next one is is
list all the directories and files in
the present working directory
cd it is used for changing the present
working directory
rmdir
it deletes a directory
and mkdir it is used to create a new
directory mkdir is also known as make
directory
now let's move on to the next question
what are the various processes states in
linux
given below are the process states of
linux
the first one denotes ready
the process is ready to run
the second one running is the process
has been executed
the third one is wait or block
this shows the process is waiting for
the input
after that it's completed or terminated
this process shows com the process is
completed execution or was terminated by
the system
the last one is zombie
the process terminated by the
information is still available in the
process table
let's move on to the next question
what are process management system calls
the following are the system calls used
to manage the process
the first function is fork function
it is used for creating a new process
then next is a exec function which is
used for executing a new program
the third one is a wait function
wait until the process completes the
execution
after that it's exit function it is used
to exit from the process
after that it's get pid function
get the unique process id of the process
and the last one is get ppid function
gets the
parent process unique id
let's move on to the next question
what are the redirection operators
the redirection operator is used for
redirecting the output of the specific
command as an input to another command
the following are the two ways to use
this
the first one is this symbol
which is overwrites the file's existing
content or creates a new one
the second one is this symbol
which shows the add the new content to
the end of an existing file or create a
new one
let's move on to the next question which
is
explain a latch
a lat is a temporary storage of device
that is controlled by a training signal
which can be either stored as 0 or 1. a
latch is a primarily used to retain
state information and has two stable
states
high output or one or low output or zero
as long as a latch is powered on
it can store one piece of data
the next question is
what is microprocessor
a microprocessor is a device which is
used for execution
instructions it is a single chip device
that fetches the instructions from the
memory decodes it and executes it the
following are the three basic functions
which are carried out by a
microprocessor
the first one is
addition subtraction multiplication and
division are example of mathematical
operations
the next one is make decision based on
the circumstances and then jump to the
new different instructions as needed
last one is move data from one position
in memory to another
now
let's move on to the next question
how to rename files in linux
there is no such particular command for
renaming a file in linux however you can
use the copy or move command to renew a
file
the first command which we use is move
command
we write it like
dollar sign
mv which donates at move
old name and then the new name of the
file
like this only we will write a copy
command in that there will be a dollar
sign cp means copy
old name of the file and then the new
name of the file
like that only if we want to delete a
command we'll write dollar sign
rm which donates as remove and the file
name
let's move on to the next question
how to write the output of a command to
a file
you have to use the redirection operator
to do this write dollar sign the command
which you want to use and the greater
sign and then the file name
the next question is how to copy files
to a floppy disk
the following steps will guide you to
copy file to a
floppy disk the first one is
mount to floppy disk the second one is
copy the files
and the last one is unmount the floppy
disk
let's move on to the next question
how should we identify which shell you
are using
open the terminal and run dollar sign
echo which is echo and then again dollar
sign and shell all in capital
let's move on to the last and final
question for this interview question
series
how would you sort the entities in a
text file in ascending order
you can do this by using the sort
command
for this you have to write the dollar
sign
sort
simple dot text simple dot text is the
file name that i am using here you can
use the name of your file you which you
want to do
ascending order operation
and with this
