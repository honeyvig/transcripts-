being in the IT industry for 20 plus
years has taught me one thing you need
to keep updating your skills on a
regular basis no matter what level
you're at I recently completed the
professional certificate program in Ai
and machine learning from Simply learn
in partnership with Purdue University
and I must say it was very insightful I
wanted to have a better understanding of
AI and ml to effectively manage a design
and development of the products of the
company and this course has helped me do
exactly that hi I am Hussein Ari Mirza I
live in San Jose California I moved to
the US around 20 years back throughout
my career I have worked at large
organizations as well as startups right

products one is AI based chatbot which
is for focused at auto dealerships the

the Practical possibilities this helps
me work more efficiently with my team

a wonderful experience with simply learn
the course material was comprehensive

experienced The Faculty was able to
adjust their teaching style in order to
cater to the overall skill set of the
class industry relevant projects are
based on real life scenarios this helps
in reinforcing a practical aspects of AI
ML and helps to correlate it with real
life projects which I work with on an
