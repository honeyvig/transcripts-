a candidate advancement towards the
partner round will be determined by how
well he or she performs throughout the
technical round
and in last you will have your hr round
the human resource round is the last
stage the quotient in this round will be

work experience and basic human resource
questions

company's website
there are some basic questions that i
can tell you right now explain your
resume to me why pwc private limited
would you consider shifting to a
different part of india
in 5 or 10 years where do you see
yourself
and what do you believe in to be your
greatest strength and weaknesses
these are some questions that are asked
frequently in the hr round
we will be discussing some of the
important hr questions in the last
if you are preparing for an interview of
pwc or any other company i would like to
share some tips that will definitely
help you
first one is understand the role know
what you are applying for
make a list of all the information you
can on the employment position you are
looking for
including the skill set and the
education requirements among other
things
as pwc has a variety of positions and
various profiles for each one it is
important to know what you are applying
for before you walk in for the interview
second one is the resume projects
read over the resume for beginning to
end
pay close attention to the specific for
each product technological list don't
add projects or technologies that you
are not familiar with
update your knowledge of the previous
project listed on the resume as well as
the technologies you are learned about
develop the habit of solving data
structure and algorithm challenges on a
regular basis to improve your skills
never lose upon the challenges presented
in the interview if you can't instantly
come up with the solution
then brute force the problem and
subsequently apply refinements on top of
it to get the best answer
always look at things for several angles
and keep going at them for all angles
note the hints that have been provided
it's not uncommon for the interviewers
to provide guidance to
assist the candidate who run into
difficulties
in order to go into another phase you
must act quickly after receiving the dip
if you are unable to determine what the
clue is
this is a huge red flag
next one is behave professionally
it is important that the interview are
not only looking at your resume to see
whether you have the necessary
qualifications your interpersonal skills
such as
how you respond to challenging topics
your thought process if you match the
organizational culture whether you
interpret the interviewer or not as a
result you should consider before you
speak and avoid saying things that may
be seen as a wrecked signal
after that
think loud
it's always seen by the interviewers
that the candidates are thinking in a
right direction but they are not sure of
in that situation the interviewer is
that who tells you you are in the right
direction so
get your thoughts out to the interviewer
and let him tell you whether you are
wrong or right
research and communication you shouldn't
be nervous since the hr interview is
likely to be a nice person you won't be
tested on your technical knowledge
during the hr round so keep your cool
with solid communication skill the hr
round will not be daunting as it seems
candidate preparing should include a
self introduction
capabilities and shortcomings and a
resume walkthrough among other things
show the interviewer that you are into
this job discover the purpose and
objective of pwc private limited as well
as its history and background
information
make use of these phrases whenever you
get a chance during the interview
in order to gain the distinct edge since
it is demonstrative that you have done
extensive study on this firm
and that
are your edge to join the team
after that
try to practice
mock interviews don't be afraid to try
practicing or interview in advance
this will provide you with a sense of
what you anticipate during the real
interview
your interview performance will improve
as a result of giving more mock
interviews
this also helps you to improve your
ability to communicate
now we will see some frequently asked
questions in the interview
first one is is it difficult to join pwc
nothing is difficult if you put in
necessary effort and practice beforehand
these interviews are mostly considered
with resume coding challenges data
structure and algorithms object oriented
programming and fundamentals of computer
science
make sure you have a thorough
understanding of these things in order
to achieve your pwc career objective
with flying colors
what are pwc eligibility requirements
there shouldn't be no current backlogs
or outstanding debts
students should have gpa at least 6.0
throughout their academic career
does pwc have a coding round pwc does
not have a coding round at this time
quoting questions on the other hand will
be asked during the interview process
what are the starting salary of a new
hire in pwc
on average pwc private limited higher
pressures with a standard salary of
rupees 6.5 lakhs pwc software engineer
composition range from rupees 6 lakh per
year to freshers to 8.5 lakh per year
how long does the interview process of
software engineer at pwc last
it's impossible to predict how long the
pwg interview process will take
everything is subject to change based on
the circumstances
for the most part pwc does not have to
recruit extra applicants and then have
them on the sideline
even if you passed all the interviews it
might take up to 10 days for the
ultimate offer letter to arrive
typically the interview process lasts
from a few days to a few weeks
now we will see pwc technical enterprise
versions
the first one is what is the difference
between c and c plus plus
c is a programming language that is
procedural
and c plus plus supports both functional
and object-oriented programming
c plus plus is a multi-paradigm language
c is a subset of c plus plus and c plus
plus is a thought to be subset of
c
next one is c works from the top to down
and c plus plus is built using the
bottom up approach
inheritance polyformism and data
encapsulation are not supported in c
but in c plus plus inheritance
polyformism data capsulation and
abstraction are all supported in c plus
now
in c plus plus what are the advantages
of a vector versus
an array
arrays are fixed whereas vectors are
resizable when the array
reaches its limit the array does not
automatically expand but the vector does
so by relocating the elements and
relocating new spaces
whenever an array is dynamically
allocated it must be explicitly
dislocated whereas vector are
automatically dislocated when they reach
the end of their scope
the size of the dynamically allocated
array must be explicitly tracked by the
size of the vector does not need to be
washed
the array can't be copied or assigned to
another array however the vector can be
rigidly copied or assigned to another
vector
next question would be
what does merge sort means how does the
merge sort measure in terms of time
and space complexity
merge sort is a divided and conquer
algorithm for sorting a set of data
that can be
an array or linked list it divides the
input into two halves and each state
until there was one element left in the
input
then merge the sorted halves to
create a sorted input
merge sort isn't a build in algorithm
which means you need to use extra spaces
for sorting the input
merge sort is a stable algorithm which
means that if the input contains two
identical elements the sorted output
will keep its relative ordering
write a program to filter list members
that are even valued between 1 and 20.
this can be accomplished in various ways
however using filter and lambda is the
more pythonic approach
a function and a sequence are sent to
the filter method
or its true or false should be returned
by the function
it applies a function to each element in
the sequence and return an iterative for
those that return true from the function
we can pass a standard function filter
by lambda is a better way to do it
now
what is the difference between a binary
tree and a binary search tree
a binary tree is a tree with no more
than two children per node
the value that a node or its children
can have is unrestricted
in the case of a binary tree searching
requires traversing the entire tree
and in binary search tree the left
subtree of a node can only contain nodes
whose value are less than the parent
nodes values and the right subtree of a
node can only have nodes whose values
are greater than the parent nodes value
in the case of binary search tree we
simply need to traverse the tree's
height
in the worst case scenario for searching
in python what is the difference between
list and tuple
in python
the main difference between list and
tuple is that list is mutable
whereas tuple is immutable the structure
or content of a mutable object can be
alterative after it's formed
whereas
an immutable object can't be changed
after it has been created
the list has more flexibility than the
tuple since we can simply add new
elements delete existing elements and so
on whereas tuples are immutable
therefore adding a new element or
deleting current element requires us to
create a new tuple
now
we will see what exactly is bootstrap
what benefits does bootstrap has over
css
bootstrap is a twitter developed open
source front-end framework for making
web development easier and faster this
is just reusable code that we can
download and use for our own web
development to achieve the
functionalities we need without having
the to rewrite the same code
it works with practically all browser
because it supports almost all of them
bootstrap can make the website
responsive meaning it adapts to the
screen regardless of the device being
used to see it
bootstrap has falling advantages over
css first one is it's an open source
because bootstrap is free we don't have
to pay for it
after that it's time saving
we can get the same functionalities by
using the bootstrap in our code rather
than developing the same code from the
start which speeds up our development
responsiveness
bootstrap fluid grid layout adapts to
the device screening resolution so we
don't have to think of the viewer using
laptop desktop mobile tablet and so on
after that it's cross browser
compatibility because bootstrap supports
all major modern web browsers we don't
have to worry about whether or not a
feature will work in all of them
it is easy to use bootstrap is simple to
use and requires only a basic
understanding of html and css
now
the next question would be
what is the distinction between linear
and non-linear data structures
in non-linear data structure a single
node can connect an unlimited number of
items
on the other side only the next and
previous element are linked to the
current element
in non-linear data structure there are
multiple levels of involvement
on the other hand in linear data
structure there is only one level
involvement
there are multiple levels of
involvements
non-linear data structure are easier to
implement and
linear data structures are challenging
to implement
example for nonlinear data structures
are
tie trees graph etc and in linear data
structure it's queue array linked list
stack etc
now we will see pwc interview questions
for the hr rounds
tell me about the time you had to
correct someone's mistake
an interview are these types of question
to discover how you manage obstacles
identify your shortcomings and assesses
whether you have what it takes to
accomplish the job properly
you want to be carried in your response
but
you also want to convey a positive story
about how a mistake helped you become a
better job applicant
accomplish the error benefits and don't
line around them switch quickly what you
learned or how you grew after making
that mistake and outline the steps you
took to ensure that the mishap never
happened again
after that
what do you think this role involves
interview would like to understand why
you are integrated about this particular
job
investigate the typical responsibilities
of this role
and then consider
how you are suitable or if you have the
traits talents and the ability that
qualifies you for this position
the interviewer can also ask this
question in the hr round that why pwc
there are four key reasons for this you
can say
there are my personal reasons the
customers the brand and the training
that you give
working with pwc allows you to
collaborate with and learn from the
professionals in your area
one will be exposed to variety of work
types clients good training and the
chance to assume responsibilities
all of these aspirants contribute to one
careers advancement and
to pwc experience
the next question would be
give an example of a time when you
worked with people outside your usual
network
employer wants team player so interact
in a scene that demonstrate to the
recruiter that you can perform well with
others
they need to see if you can
bring communication collaborate in a
group and optimize the outcome of your
collective endurance
then what's the most difficult thing
about working with you
the interviewer wants to see through
this question if you are self-aware and
if you can take accountability for a
situation try to answer this question
along the lines of the job you are
applying for however giving a clever
context about this situation that the
interviewer should know that you have
learned from this experience
show the interviewer that you can work
efficiently as part of a team
after all your in-daughters should
highlight your strong points rather than
your flaws as an employee
