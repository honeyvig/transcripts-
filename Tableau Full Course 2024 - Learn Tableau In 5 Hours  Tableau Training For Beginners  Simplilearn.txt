are going to see so many functionalities
of t Okay so before we proceed further
as you already aware powerbi so I would
like to hear what is bi according to
your knowledge in simple
words
yeah yes business intelligence tool
okay Advanced Excel tarun K advanced T
I'm asking what is bi business
intelligence by this time you should
give me a clear answer okay getting data
getting info from data finding
connections okay man just manipulating
data tarun is it just to get the data
Jenny Scott H Harish now very close to
the answer data
visualizations any other answer you see
you have to put all these points
together then only it become as a bi
business intelligence clear all of you
if you're putting all of them together
then only it become business
intelligence not just data
visualizations not just importing the
data bi will help us to get the data
from various sources bi tool will help
us to get the data from various sources
if you have data in Excel you can import
the data from Excel if you have data in
SQL or Oracle or any other database your
bi tool should be in a position to get
the data the data can be a live or the
data can be batch batchwise data or
offline report okay once data is in what
we have to do have you remember what are
what are the five common stages we have
to perform yes what are the five common
stages we have to perform I have very
clearly mentioned and you take any bi
tool yes guys you take any bi tool yes
guys tell me come on if you take any bi
tool every bi tool follow how many
exactly five common
stages see it is not mandatory to
remember five common stages remember it
is not mandatory to remember five common
stages pages but it always good to know
about them life cycle of bi2 life cycle
of report okay so first one is we have
to collect the data collection of the
data right once we have data we'll go
for what hello my dear friends we'll go
for
transformation what the third stage
going for a data model and creating a
join have you remembered this fourth
stage is doing analysis and
visualizations and fifth stages
publish if you remember five common
stages it's make easy for you to go what
report
preparation simple now these are five
common stages we have in across all the
bi tools and bi tool will help us to get
the data from various sources
and the data can be transformed based on
our business
requirement the data can be transformed
based on business
requirement and we can perform certain
data
manipulations or we can get some
insights why we have to get the insights
from the raw data to take a decisions
now in simple words in simple words by
the help of bi tool what we can do we
can
extract meaningful
information we can extract meaningful
information or we can find what
patterns or we can bring
insides okay and see you have raw data
you are going to perform certain
calculations why to get some meaning out
of it to find out certain patterns to
get more insights yeah why we have to do
all these things why we have to do all
these things why why why I should find
out the
patterns why should I find out the
insights why come on why why we should
do all these
things come on guys why we should do all
these things to solve the business
correct to solve the business issues
right or this bi tool will help us to
take to take wise
decisions actionable
items got
it clear all of you so this is a use or
purpose of having a business
intelligence tools how many business
intelligence tools we have come on you
have to list down quickly you have to
give the answers
how many bi tools we have a lot how many
Excel is not a bi tool okay Ashish Ash
SAR no problem good to see you Ash okay
remember Excel is not a bi tool clear
who asked this who said this Ashish
Ashish correct yourself okay now we do
have powerbi we have Tablo right we have
click sense we have
Zoho right SQL is not bi tool remember
correct yourself Jenny Scott okay SQL
and Excel those are not bi
tools alter YX Etc clear all of you now
one
question can I call powerbi or tblo as
ETL tool can we
consider all these bi
tools as ETL
tool yes can we consider them as a ETL
tool if you say s you're
wrong you're wrong all these ba tools
are
not ETL tools you cannot call them as a
ETL tool
no okay why I highlighting this point
here because you have already gone
through powerbi so I want to add few
more
points in during interview they may ask
you hey table is a ETL tool you should
say no it is not a ETL tool but if you
notice functionality of any bi tool all
of them are follows methodology of ETL
tool got it you can you take powerbi or
table or click sense or any other bi
tool it will
follow it will follow
methodolog tool but those are not ETL
tools clear all of you you will see the
flavor you will see the flavor the
methodology but those are not actually
ETL tools those are are purely bi tools
am I clear okay but mang here we do I
have made I have made so many
mistakes is it okay there are there are
many typos okay perfect so Ashish asking
apart from powerb and T which one is the
most used bi tool so most of the time
you'll see tblo and powerb now is
nowadays power Bas is not uh leading the
market second position is
Tabo okay if not probably you can see
click sense in a third position
but as I mentioned earlier also if
you're good at one bi tool it's easy to
learn other bi tools also
clear alter VI mostly will see to do
data manipulation and all but not that
much used remember if you're good at one
bi tool remaining all bi tools are very
easy to learn okay so now today onwards
we are going to learn what
you're going to learn what
ta okay what I will do I will correlate
with powerbi so that you can quickly
recap what we have seen while you were
in a powerbi session okay I will
correlate don't mind if you you if you
didn't attend any powerb session don't
worry we are going to learn table from
scratch clear one or two guys are there
who didn't attend any powerb sessions
for you don't worry
clear all of
you okay guys tblo is also one of the
most famous and well known
bi2 okay so in tblo we do have various
products different types of products we
have in Tabo what are lot those
different products we have look at my
screen we do have something called tblo
desktop we have something called tblo
desktop what is the use of having tblo
desktop what is the use of having tblo
desktop in this tblo
desktop we are authorized to prepare a
report in simple words to prepare a
report we'll use
what tblo desktop clear all of you to
prepare a report we'll use tblo desktop
this is like what powerbi desktop
this is like what powerbi desktop now
second point is table desktop free
version answer is
no this is not a free version not a free
version you have to
buy Orba desktop free version yes it's a
free version clear all of you but tblo
desktop you'll get for 14 days as a
trial version 14 days as a trial
version clear any questions
here you can make use of tblo desktop
for only 14 days you see tblo desktop is
used to prepare a report as powerbi
desktop okay and it is not a free
version you have to pay Okay no Okay you
have to pay okay no
problem but for 14 days yes you can use
it okay now wait a minute do we have
any do we have
any op sources for this tblo answer is
yes what it is we have something called
Tabo
public we have something called what
tabl Loop public what is the use of this
so this is also to prepare a
report this is also used for to prepare
a report again it's a free version it's
a free version you see something you are
getting for money something we have no
paid version and something you are
getting for free that means what there
must be some difference between these
two correct there must be few
differences between these two so you'll
see Tabo public with limitations as it's
a
free we have a table public it's a free
version but we'll have few limitations
so what I will do I will highlight those
limitations also and during our training
we are going to use Tabo public
only clear but in real time which one
we'll
use in real time we'll go for a tblo
desktop we'll go for a tblo desktop but
during train
will go for tblo public clear all of you
perfect I have a question since powerbi
table programming to primly make reports
out of the given data which is most
preferred and why powerbi is mostly used
because it's a free version okay it's a
free version mostly nowadays powerbi is
being used beside the free version last
time also I highlighted few points since
powerbi is a Microsoft product and we
all are already using so many Microsoft
products let's say operating system
Windows yeah and U database
SQL and you can see the email for for
sending emails we use Outlook and to
have a to chat with our colleagues we'll
use teams and when it comes to Cloud
we'll have aour and we have a SharePoint
from from Microsoft whatnot so these
many products we have been using so when
I use power VI also that will make us
yeah to integrate without any challenges
got
it not more Futures I would say you'll
not get any uh issues you'll not see any
compatibilities
issues and is easy to comparatively it's
very
easy if you compare tblo and powerbi
powerbi is a bit easy because powerbi is
a advanced version of
excel but when it comes to
tblo tblo also very nice we have very
very nice
interface plus when it comes to huge
amount of data table is the best
one okay performance- wise table is a
best one and when it comes to map
visuals you have more scope to customize
maps map visuals and you have more scope
to you know customize Dynamic visuals in
Tabo got it and Tabo is a older one I
would say the age of Tabo is around 15
years almost 15 years and powerway is
almost seven years 7 to eight
years got
it and which is a oh okay um asking very
good question using power table this is
a personal choice or or no no it's it's
a organization Choice it's not our
personal choice but mostly both are
almost same concept wise same to same
you'll see different set terminologies
that's it interface is a bit different
but concept wise all bi tools work in a
similar way clear all of you any
questions and tblo is very expensive so
so we do have two different products
here tblo desktop and T public correct
now we have something called
what TBL data
prep so what is the use of having this
tblo data prep tblo data prep we have
right this is used to perform
what data cleaning
activities to perform data wrangling
job got it all of you
you so anyone can correlate this with
what in powerbi any correlation with
powerbi what do we have in powerbi to
perform data cleaning jobs data cleaning
activity exactly we have something
called what power query editor my dear
friends okay I'm just correlating that's
it okay if you are not sure what is in
powerbi you don't need to worry I'm just
correlating so we have something called
tblo Data prep now is it free version no
this is also not a free version It's a
paid version you'll get this for 14 days
as a
trial clear all of
you do we have any free version here as
we have a table public answer is no you
don't have anything for free when it
comes to data prep you'll have this for
14 days as a trial version that's it
clear all of
you any questions no right no let's move
on now third one is we have something
called
tblo
server tblo server okay Ash is asking if
powerb is free then why companies go for
tblo is there any major difference so
that companies are investing in tblo
that's the reason asish most of the
companies nowadays switching from tblo
to powerbi and if you correlate the age
of tblo is nearly uh 12 to 15 years but
powerbi is 7 years that means what
earlier people used to uh earlier many
organization before power be lost they
used to work on tblo you see there's a
gap between six years between these two
you see six year so now since there was
nothing except Tabo so they used to have
tblo but in but again as I mentioned in
terms of performance wise or visual wise
or interface wise table is a really good
one okay now Tablo server what the TBL
server to share our reports to share
reports to end user we'll go for a Tablo
server and this Tablo server is nothing
but what on premises
server what do we have in
powerbi in powerbi we have something
called what powerbi
report
server understood this is also on
premises server on premises server got
it all of you no questions all good why
we have to go for a tabl server once
your report is ready we have to share
our report to end user so how we can
share this we are going to deploy in
tblo server this is on premises server
what do we have another server come on
what do we have another server we have
two
servers another one
what tblo online so here what do we
have
powerbi services oh my goodness it's a
Cloud
Server it is a Cloud Server got the
point what is the use of having Cloud
Server same to share so now you have two
options either you can upload your file
in tblo server which is on premises or
if your company is using tblo online
which is Cloud Server there also you can
upload your
files am I
clear you have two different servers one
is tblo server and another one is tblo
online tblo server means on premises
tblo online means Cloud Server and these
are are paid versions by the way you're
not getting anything free here Tablo
online also you'll get free only for 14
days as a trial version after 14 days
you cannot use that Cloud Server
remember perfect now we have something
called what Tablo public server also we
have what do we have we have a tblo
public server tblo public
server that means you can publish your
files publish to publish
reports publicly we'll use public server
also but in fact in real time we are not
going to use this Tabo public server
okay because it is available for all the
users now what else we have we do have
something called tblo
mobile we have something called Tao
mobile okay here also we have a powerbi
mobile yes or no powerbi mobile if you
want to see your report in mobile phone
also you can install this mobile
application right now we have something
called tblu reader this is just to read
your report read to read
reports we cannot edit
this we can't edit
report but we can read it but we can
read
report clear all of you it is a
interview question they will ask you how
many different products we have in tblo
you see we have Tablo
desktop we'll have tblo desktop where we
are going to prepare a
report got it it's a it's a paid version
and we have something called tblo public
which is which is free version and it is
used to prepare a report but in general
in real time you're not going to use
this Tabo public okay but Harish Kumar
guys we are going to use TBL Loop public
during our training period
okay now we have something called tblo
Data prep we'll use this tblo data prep
to perform the cleaning data cleaning
activity we can perform and few data
cleaning activity can be performed in
Tablo desktop also this tblo data prep
it is launched just four years before
this tblo data prep launched almost five
years before got it why they have
introduced data prep earlier we used to
perform all data triangl job being in
tblo desktop but what is happening
because of to avoid performance issues
to avoid performance issues Salesforce
team launched tblo data prep and what
are what what they are saying hey dude
if you want to make any data
transformation make use of tblo data
prep once data is cleaned you can you
can get this clean data in your in your
Dam
desktop anyway we are going to see this
tblo data prep I will highlight once
again what is the flow in real time okay
for time being what you can understand
these many products we have we have
something called Tablo server which is
on premises server used to publish our
files and we have another server called
tblo on online it is called Cloud Server
and this also used to publish our
files and we have something called tblo
public server and we have to tblo mobile
phone and finally we have tblo reader
got it now these many tools we have okay
let's see we are going to use tblo
public we are going to use tblo
public
okay okay
now should I go to Next Level you see my
screen tblo
desktop is not a free version but we are
going to get 14 days stle version right
so
here almost every quarter Salesforce
team will release new updates they will
release new versions okay just look at
my screen we do have so many versions in
tblo yes I have just given three uh
Excel files in chat box I request you
all to download from chat box okay so
group and replays pivot example and
Sample Superstore data set okay okay
just look at my screen for time being so
here we were talking about table desktop
right so this desktop is used to prepare
a report so here we do have many
different versions okay guys there are
many versions
now if you see here I'm going to to
share this link very shortly just look
at my
screen so these are our different types
of versions if I open this
2024 so here we do have two different
versions 2023 under this so during
interview they will ask you definitely
what is the latest version of table
desktop it's a interview question they
will ask you what is the latest version
of tablet so before one day before you
go to interview one day before so you
have to check what is the latest
version clear
and they will ask you on
what how they will put this question
okay what is the latest version you're
working on don't give this answer that
I'm working on 2024 no no one will use
latest version in real
time clear probably you can say you're
working on 2022 or 2021 one anything is
fine but don't say you're working on
2024 as it is the
latest
clear now you see I said tblo desktop
you can use for 14 days as a trial
version correct look at my screen what I
generally suggest to my Learners if you
want to work on a tableau
desktop if you want to work on tblo
desktop what I
suggest instead of going for a latest
version my dear friends instead of
downloading this latest version what you
can do you can download lower
versions what you can do you can
download lower
version listen to me very
carefully let assume that we have
downloaded
2022 and we worked on 14 days on
this after 14 days what will happen you
cannot open this application after 14
days after completion of 14 days you
have to go to next version you have to
upgrade 20222 to 2022 do3 again you can
use this for 14 days after 14 days what
you can do again you can go for a next
version you have to upgrade your product
to next versions am I clear if you're
really wanted to work on a Tablo desktop
this is a work around solution am I
clear all of you this is just a work
around solution if you really wanted to
work on tabl desktop okay now you can
say you can ask me hey who is going to
install after every 14 days is there any
work around answer is yes one work
around is every 14 days you have to go
for a next version if you don't want to
do this there is another another work on
what it
is we have something called tblo
student we have something called what
Tabo student so tblo team is giving one
year
license they are going to give you one
product key we would say
license say
license you see tblue for
students in order to get license you
have have to submit your student ID
card okay you say get tblo for free so
here we offer free one- year Tableau
license to
students what you need you should have
at
least student ID card and remember
student age must be greater than 16
years 16 plus yeah if you have your
school email ID College email ID that is
also
fine within 4 hours you are going to get
a license that license can be applied in
tblo
desktop you can use it for one year
clear am I
clear you don't need to uninstall for
every 14 14 days is it clear or you want
me to repeat once
again this is another workaround
solution that license can be applied in
three different
laptops
wow I repeat let's say you have applied
for student license you got one key this
key can be applied in three different
laptops interesting yes now plus you can
use this license not only on tblo
desktop but also tblo data prep we have
something called tblo Data prep right
same key can be
used same key can be used in tblo data
prep
also clear are you talking about email
address email address also you don't
have right you don't have such
domain tunet simply learn.com no you
don't have it it won't work if you have
something like this let's say lesie
at Oxford university.com oxford.com yes
for this you will get
it okay otherwise let's say you have a
ID card let's say this your ID card that
ID card should have a validity it should
not be an expired State there should be
valid ID card okay if you have siblings
you can take that ID card and you can
upload it no problem you will receive
license clearly
is it clear all of you any queries no
queries right so these all are work
around solution to use tblo
desktop if not you can go for a tblo
public that's it tblo public is
sufficient yes tblo Public public is
also a sufficient tool to do a
practice I will highlight few areas
where you need tblo desktop okay now
what we are trying to do now we are
about to download tblo data prep we'll
install today tblo data prep we'll do
certain data transformation we'll get
some hands on it later on we'll install

look look at my screen
now today we'll work on TBL Loop data
prep today we are going to work on a
tblo data prep guys so the moment when
you open this tblo data prep you'll see
something like
this all right so what is the flow see
flow means set of
actions series series of action set of
action is called as
flow set of action is called as a flow
okay now so here you're going to see
recently opened flows I will let you
know once again what is a flow so at the
screen here you're going to see recently
opened flows and right hand side you're
going to see some training
material okay now any bi
tool if you take any bi tool first step
is what we have to have the
data correct we have to have the data
and TBL prep is used to perform data
wrangling job or data transformation
job correct now we are going to perform
few basic data transformation using tblo
prep so that you can
understand beauty of prep
Builder okay okay before we proceed
further let me highlight one problem
statement let me highlight problem
statement so that you can understand how
we can utilize table data prep okay just
give a minute I'm going to open one
Excel
file why my piece is now
slow so we have one Excel file called
Excel file called group and rep
place do you have that Excel file all of
you right we are going to import that
file called group and
replace how to get the data here see
connect to
data you see this connect to data you
have to click on this connect to
data and go to that folder where you
placed Excel
file see click on Microsoft
Excel click on Microsoft
Excel navigate to the
folder navigate to that
folder where you placed group and
replace what is the file name group and
replace this one you have to take this
Excel
file you have to take this Excel
file and click on open I'm holding my
screen for your
reference most of the time what I will
do I will highlight with markers
correct you have to follow my
markers okay now you see this Excel
file yeah in this Excel file we do have
one table
but the data contains know so many
errors we have inconsistency
data we have inconsistency data so we
are trying to
know we are trying to get rid off all
those
errors by using TBL Loop prep
Builder it's still taking some time for
me to load the data no why
okay meanwhile try to understand this
flow look at my
screen this is
database this is tblo
desktop this is tblo data
Prep tblo Prep Builder
and here we have a
server this can be a cloud server or
anything what is the first step we have
to do we have to import the data all
right you
see we are importing data from desk from
database to
prep in this table data prep what we are
doing we are going to perform all data
transformation right right and this data
transformation in the form of a
flow in the form of a flow will perform
all those data Transformations over here
once the data transformation is done
what we will do we will publish this
flow in the
server what we will do we'll publish
this flow in the server in real time
that means here we have a clean
data now I would like to prepare a
report I would like to prepare a report
now I do have two options to get the
data one
is I can get the data from DB to Tablo
desktop but if I try to get the data
from database to tablet desktop what I
have to do here I have to clean the data
over here this is one way instead of
taking data from database what I will do
now I will take this flow into my
Tableau desktop because this is already
cleaned this is already clean I'm going
to perform or I'm going to prepare a
report based on this clean
data clear all of
you I have two options one option is I
can get the data from database if I'm
taking data from database I have to
perform data transformation once again
being in data being in table
desktop this is one option otherwise
what we can do we can take the data or
we can take the flow from the
server this flow is nothing but a clean
data so where we clean this data being
in tblop
prep we'll get the data from database
we'll do data transformation once it is
done we'll publish in the server from
there we are going to pick in tablet
desktop is it clear all of you the flow
what I highlighted is it
clear you have to understand this
flow okay during interview if someone is
asking you to how to have know how tblo
data prep will work you have to explain
this flow that's it
okay now let me erase all these things
let me open this Excel
file you see this Excel file my dear
friends you see this
one so here we do have something
called let see air BG listing in this
column let me apply the filter on this
table
see here I just apply the filter on
this data entry guy
entered this data
incorrectly yeah you see for bathroom he
entered bathroom bathrooms somewhere he
just entered ba B th you
see for bedroom it just typed bed
somewhere bed RM bedrooms and
bedroom you see data is now
inconsistency here now if you look at
the second
column spelling
mistake beautiful with single L Double
L difficult
spelling mistake pneumonia pneumonia
what oh my God you see understood
spelling mistakes now naming format what
do you mean by naming format let's say
my name is Abdul Rahman first
name Abdul Rahman something like
this what has happened in few record my
name record my name is entered as Abdul
Rahman in few more records my name is
recorded recorded or entered as Abdul
Rahman first name last name last name
first name okay Harish Kumar just we
started in First Column we we have typos
here and in second column also we do
have spelling mistakes in third column
name formatting is
mismatching in fourth column again
spelling mistake P so at the
end we
have inconsistency data agree all of you
how to find tune this data if I want to
do this in Excel I have to do a number
of find and replace agree how easily we
can perform fine how easily we can
perform fine tuning using tblo data
print there's a game here clear all of
you right all
good now let's see now all of you let's
go to tab prep
Builder
see right perfect
now my dear friends you see we have only
one sheet in this file automatically
this one sheet is placed on the
canvas automatically this one sheet is
placed on the canvas so you see here so
if you look at this plus Mark here we
have different different
options if you see a bit difference I
think based on
know um mangesh Yad based on the ver
vers okay based on the version probably
you might have a different screen but
mostly you'll have the same thing what
we have done here we just imported data
from Excel abisola clear all of you see
this TBL Loop prep
Builder we have taken group and replace
Excel file and the sheet one already
placed on this
canvas pleas clear all of
you now if I click on this BL
sign you see guys so these many
different actions we can perform just
look at my
screen you can aggregate almost we have
seven to eight actions to
perform new rows if you want to do any
aggregation if you want to do any pivate
and pivate if you want to join the
tables or if you want to any script what
not everything can be performed over
here okay now my dear friends you see
plus
here click on this plus go for a first
option clean step we are going to clean
the data what we are trying to do we are
trying to clean the data oh do we have
to follow step by step no you can do any
action based on the requ
requirement right you can if you want to
do directly payot table yes you can do
the payot table if you want to join the
tables directly you can join the tables
if you want to aggregate directly you
can go for aggregation got it it is not
compulsory you have to execute step by

undo clear but don't do anything
now my dear friends now we have find
tune the
data once data is cleaned what we have
to
do once data is cleaned what we have to
do we have to public wait wait we have
to export now here we have a two options
remember as I mentioned in real time
what will happen we are not going to
export this data in our local machine no
we are going to publish this flow in the
server okay how you can publish this in
the server if you go to file or publish
go to top left corner file just look at
our screen now don't click on publish go
to left hand side top left corner we
have something called file right top
left corner file click on it wait wait a
minute you see guys one option you can
save this
locally okay or else you see export
package flow you can export this or you
can publish this in
servers but we don't have server now
what we are going to do we are going to
export this clean data in the form of
Excel how to export this data in Excel
you see now there is a plus Mark right
clean activity there is a plus
Mark Harish yes on this flow click on
plus Mark all of
you click on it yes you see Last Action
called output
output all of you click on output we are
just trying to export this data in Excel
orcc
file
okay done wait a minute wait a minute
you see
now you clicked on output now you are on
a output action we are trying to export
this in a different different format
where you want to export this file that
is a question left hand side you see
name you can give a name you see left
hand side go down go down huh
name name of the file what if you want
to give any name you can give the
name let's say what you can see here
clean data something like
that give a name
clean anything is fine where you want to
save this file you have to remember this
location if you want to change yes you
can change
it okay if you want to change you can
change it but let it be there but you
have to remember this in which format
you want to see this data you see output
type there is a small drop down so we'll
talk about what is this do hyper but for
time being what we'll do we'll EXP put
this data in CSV file all of you select
CSV
file hold on is it done all of
you no one is lagging right now it's
time to export now you see that is the
location and file name is clean data and
file format is CSV file now what you can
do to export this there are two ways
there is option called flow other than
that we have a play button
also play button on output on output
action we have a play
button on canvas flow
canvas huh you see all of you click on
this play button run flow that's
it all of you click on
this done so this fine tune data now
exported in CSV file format you see this
series of action the set of action is
called what
flow set of action is called what it's a
flow now now if you don't mind Harish
could you just open that file where it
is saved under
documents my table data prep under
documents my table prep repository there
is a by
default I think prep I guess
over here I don't think so go
back go back yeah TBL Loop
repository
okay
here so go back to that table data prep
we'll see the location exact
location data sources under data sources
you have that file table prep repository
under data sources you have one folder
called Data
sources tblo prep repository no my dear
under tblo prep yes under prep
repository here you have a data
sources you see now clean data just open
this just double click on
this is it open
this guys you see it's very easy right
just double click Harish you didn't
double click I
guess I just wanted to show you all how
data will be now
okay you
see how data is
cleaned it's very easy right oh wow
good perfect thank you Harish thank you
for your
demonstration
great now again what we will do
now we'll
check how to Pivot the data okay just
give me a
second just look at my screen my dear
friends
do you all see the
screen
yeah
now what I would like to do let's say we
have data something like this I would
like to summarize this data in which
format I would like to summarize the
data in which format let's say I want to
have something like
this let me make over here let me here
let me where should I do
this let's say Here
country east
west south and north here I should I
need India us UK Canada what is the
total value of India in east region
let's
see if I select all the cells total is1
756 once again what is the total value
of India in west region let's see let me
select all this 1249 y
1249
495 I would like to have this kind of a
summary based on this table can we do
this yes guys can we do
this in Excel what we have to do in
order to do
this let's say in Excel P table oh is
it guys
do we have to go for a pivot table in
Excel to have this kind of a summary
table is
it oh let me give a try I'm selecting
this entire table going back to insert P
table let's say let me insert this pivot
on same
sheet right now I'm going to drag and
drop Contry over here and region on
column shelf now you tell me what should
I do now
want me to take this J and a value shell
oops
no M
see things are not getting
added
see we would like to have a summary we
would like to aggregate all those values
from J to
December got the point all of you this
is the problem
statement if we have data in this
format if we have data in this format we
cannot do summary quickly we can do that
but there is a work
around we can do that but there is a
work around but can we summarize the
data no directly we cannot do
summarize can we use some if no Su if
also won't work J is Scot Su if also
won't work when Sam if will work when
PIV table will work when you have this
data in a different format then it will
work okay which format it should be you
see now I'm just doing manually this if
I have data something like this let me
transpose this you see when we have data
in this format okay this is from country
and region you
see it's a month it's a values right so
all these values belongs to India and
east region so what is the value of West
let me copy down all these values let me
transpose
them right so all these values from Jan
to
December and all these values from west
region and countries
India you see if I have data in this
format
if I have data in this format yes as you
said we can go for a
sumf or we can go for a pivot table oh
is it yes you see now I am selecting
this entire table let me go to insert P
table let me plot over
here now let me take country on a r
shelf region on a column shelf you see
now value should be on a value shelf oh
wow you see how easily we can summarize
it got the point so that means if you
have data in this format we cannot go
for a summary we cannot create a summary
table but if we have data something like
this we can summarize the data now you
can ask me one question how should I
know when to go for a data
transformation or when should I go for
this kind of a transpose or when should
I go for p and and pivot answer is based
on some experience or based on some you
know practice you'll get to know how to
or when to or where to go for p and
pivot The Columns clear all of
you is it clear all of
you yeah but if it is Excel it really
takes a lot of time to transpose all
these
things right if it is Excel it takes a
lot of time to convert them from column
to rows but you see if you use Tableau
Data
prep you can you can do this very
quickly oh is it yes so I request you
all to load this pivot example file in
tab prep now question do we have to open
a new tblo prep no not required you have
already table prep open right you have
already open TBL prep right again go
back to connect to data uh see go to
connect to
data pick
Excel take the Excel go for pivot
example and click on
open very
good
now what we have to do now again here
here we have a plus
Mark click on
this
here go for a
pavot click on this pavot sorry click on
this place Mark go for a
pivot done all of
you
now look at this
abis Sola here you have to click on this
plus Mark take a p
table take pivot table make sure to
select this table pivot
action okay then only you will see all
these options now what we have to do
here my dear friends here under Fields
you have these many columns
right
yeah you have these many columns you see
columns to rows which one you have to
convert column to rows you have to
convert month all right so we have all
months in columns we have all months in
columns we have to convert them into
rows got it now simply drag and drop
this Jan under this one this area
pivoted Fields drag and drop
see just drag and
drop Jan okay next Feb where is the
Feb just drag and
drop clear all of you just look at my
stream just drag and drop over here P
values drag and drop
is it done all of
you very easy right you see now here you
can rename this if you want to rename
yes if you double click on
this let's say say
month just rename this as a month double
click that will allow you to
edit that will allow you to
edit
clear very easy now once you have done
this once you are done with
this what we have to
do we have have
to execute this flow to execute the flow
click on plus click on
output click on
output okay
now file name it's your wish unprivate
table it's your
wish and this location it's your wish if
you want to change this you can change
it or let it be open I'm going to export
this in CSC
file right
DOI now you can click on this play
button to run this flow so this entire
stuff is called as a flow this is a
flow this is called a flow okay now all
of you execute this
flow that's it
in real time do you think that we are
going to execute this
locally no right keep that in your mind
remember in real time we are not going
to execute anything locally because
we'll have lot of data the data will not
be stored in our machines what we'll do
we'll export this flow sorry we'll
publish this flow in the
servers okay now now let me open that
F let me go to that
folder see this is my
folder right let me open
this it just you for your reference I'm
opening this Excel file you don't need
to open this okay just have a look you
don't need to open
this okay guys just look at my screen
now oh wow now e easily we can go for a
p table now I'm going back to P table
this is only for your reference my dear
friends you
see country on a otion region on
evalution P values boom my
goodness so crazy
yeah very easy right great now let me
close this you don't need to open this
Excel file I just open to show you
all
output in the save folder what is the
status for
where H this is actually if you
see my laptop is connected with one
drive this is not sing with my one
drive got
it
okay okay now let's again go back back
to few
other simple stories what we can
do we'll go for a union we'll see how to
upend the
data how to consolidate the data okay so
let me show you problem
statement so let's say we do have three
to four different different
tables we would like to make it as a
master table by consolidating data from
different tabs
okay so we have seen in power query
editor how to append the data you see
same data we
have it's a North table it's a East
table South and
West we have data in four different
tables we would like to upend the data
or we would like to create one master
table so how to consolidate this data
using table prep
Builder okay okay clear all of you we
are going to see how to append the data
like
this this is North data this is East
data something like
this is it clear all of you problem
statement South
table
yes something like this yes abis
we are trying to consolidate data
something like
this West
table consolidation we're appending the
data like
this how to create this
consolidation okay this is my local file
I have already given this guys do you
have this Union Excel file if not let me
know I will share it
okay let me share this
file okay no
problem okay all of you download this
Excel file and quickly load
this quickly load
this how to load the
data see click on this
place click on this place
click on this Excel
workbook all of you
take Union
workbook all of you take Union
workbook on Excel
workbook all of you take
union now this Excel workbook is
contained this Excel file contains four
different tabs four different
sheets so automatically you'll not see
anything on the
canvas earlier when you imported pivot
example or group and replace Excel file
automatically you might have seen or
observed that particular sheet is
already placed on Flow
canvas right but this time none of them
are imported you see because we do have
four different worksheet in
this this Union file contains four
different tabs
sheets none of them imported on report
Canvas OR flow
canvas flow
pain what we have to do now manually you
have to drag and drop one table that's
your wish any table you can drag and
drop manually
drag and drop one table on the
canvas
done perfect now so here we have a plus
Mark click on this so This join we can
join the tables over here but I'm
parking this join here because we are
going to see in tblo desktop how we can
join the tables in tblo desktop okay
okay now let's pick Union there are two
ways to upend the data there are two
ways to Union the tables but we'll go
with this option click on
Union click on
union now you have to drag and drop
second table see you have to move this
close to this you see here options the
moment m the m when you place this table
close to East you'll see few options or
if you place your table close to this
Union again you'll see few more
options drop
this over here add like
this abisola you see my screen here
you'll have this flow
pain right here you have the table left
hand side first drag and drop
one
table you got an error message okay wait
a minute let me finish this guys once
again take another
table just move this to Union and you
have to drop over
here can't I drop here you can drop over
here also you can drop over here also
but to give you better Clarity better
picture it's better to add this new
table under Union
like this so you will see this good
picture you see you will see a good
picture here that's it no difference at
all you see
add so how we can understand this we are
going to combine all these four tables
yeah we are going to make it as a
union clear now once it is done all of
you generate
you have to do this a bit fast okay okay
what you have done you have taken join
close it click on the join and delete uh
click on it delete remove it that's it
it's a union now now what you have to do
drag and drop that
not left hand side here drag wait wait
yeah please wait Madam where s delete it
delete delete means you have to hit on
remove delete
yeah on keyboard you have a delete
button
right delete is always easy M ah now
drag and drop North North you have to
place this North table close to Union
and you'll see few options H you see
wait wait why you rushing why doing so
fast slow slow slow
just huh slow politely smoothly you have
to Handle With Care wait you see add
button don't drop it blindly you see
there's option called add ah drop it we
are not joining we are appending the
data do the same for South table
also drag and drop South
smoothly Handle With Care very good you
see this is a momentum not here place it
on Union only move this to add add add
add plus add right very good once again
Dragon drop West also West table do the
same thing H smoothly you have to handle
very
good good momentum
yes go near to
Union go to near to Union yes add add
add add add
yes you
see you you have taken four tables to do
Union okay join is different Union is a
different abisola we have discussed join
means adding column simple word join
means adding column Union means adding
row what we are doing here we're adding
rows we are appending the data
clear guys you have to remember s you
have to remember in simple
words okay you have to remember only in
simple
words
now to see this output what we have to
do again click on this plus click on
output clear all of you
and you don't need to see output my dear
friends click on
output so this is let's say
consolidation
consolidation
file select CC
file click on run flow that's it
okay
perfect now what we will do now we are
going to import the data oh we have been
doing the same thing but this time we
will load sample Superstore
data what we'll do now we are going to
load sample Superstore data set how to
get it once again click on this
plus click on this plus click on Excel
workbook sample Superstore data set I
request you all to take this
one sample
Superstore is it done
click on
Open click on
open
wow this Excel workbook contains only
single sheet called orders you see now
got it now what we'll do now let's see
now take clean step first click on this
plus go for a clean
step now all of you click on this data
this one data
GD where you can see data in a table
form right clear now stop doing just
look at my screen don't do anything just
look at my screen now here you will see
how your data is framed in this table
here we do it says you do have 22 fields
nothing but columns and 20,000
records it's a table
structure got it now each and every
column is now representing with data
type also you see it's a data type it's
a
number it's a text it is a
date and it is also string or data type
and this is a date
clear all of you what is a data
type what is data
type so these are data types what is
data type
simple Yes guys what is data
type it's basic and very very important
you should understand you're dealing
with what type type of
data you're dealing with what type of
data data data type is nothing but
format of
data in which format data is being
stored what is the format of the data is
it
string is it text is it number is it
date is it Boolean what type of data it
is
clear all of
you right is it really important to
understand data
type last time we have discussed
right last time we have
discussed have you remember let's say
here we do have
A10
B20 yeah can I sum of these two
values can I do summation on these two
values no right
now for example if I want to do some on
10 + 20 what I have to do I have to
extract values right 10 so in order to
extract I'm using right function right
comma two I'm extracting numbers only
again WR function right I need two
characters from right hand side what I
did I have used a formula to extract
digits from right hand side 10 20 now
can I use some formula
here to do summation on
this can I use some formula to do
summation on
this can I use some okay what is the
output of this now if I execute this
formula what could be the
output no no if but cut no tell me the
answer if I execute this formula what
could be the answer yes guys
you should give the answer now my dear
friends if I execute this
formula you see why you seeing if they
are
numeric let's see if I execute this we
got zero why we are getting zero my dear
friends remember these all are very
basic things at the same time it's
really really important to
understand okay these are are really
basics but really really
important okay in real time we are going
to face this kind of a challenges very
frequently
clear okay actually here we have used
right function this right function has
given output correctly but format of
this cell is text it is not in a number
format you see hey are you text I'm
saying yes it's true I'm saying hey are
you number say no I'm not a number say
false I'm not a number I'm a text so we
have used some formula over here to do
the addition but since it's in a text
format it is giving zero as the
answer and do remember as I mentioned
earlier you'll have problem especially
when you have date you are importing
data from database you have a date
column it sounds like a date but it
won't be a date format it would be in a
text
format due to which if you're performing
any
analysis you'll end up with wrong
numbers clear all of you don't forget
this it is really really
important understanding data
types okay let's go back here so now
here it is displaying data type of each
column here we do have something called
extra geographical data you see
here
recommendations okay here recommendation
look at my
screen region wise column it's a string
of course it's a string there is no
doubt ABC is nothing but a string or
text if I click on this you see here
region wise column is saying change data
Ro to
State country let me go back to
oops let me go to Country column so that
country column itself is string but if
you look at the recommendations it's
saying hey this country is a
geographical data type you see let me
place over
here you see ABC it's a string there is
no doubt but these are our geographical
data you see now if I click on this
recommendations you see country change
data role to
country that means we are trying to
change data type this bulb also
recommendation what it is recommending
it's saying hey dud don't consider this
column as just a string consider this
column as a state or a country that
means geographical data type what it is
geographical data type
what is the benefit if I change this to
geographical what is the benefit in
return return what will have in return
you see table blue is super
smart whenever you drag this colum
called country anyway we are going to
see this but let me explain you why we
have to change this from string to
Geographic you see if you drag and drop
this country column under report canvas
by default Tableau will generate map
visual is it clear I repeat if you drag
and drop this country field on report
canvas TBL automatically pick map
visual got it all of you that is the
reason we have to convert this country
column State column City column into
Geographic it just giving
recommendations hey dude you have to
change them as a geographic clear all of
you
perfect will you just change
it you can click on this recommendation
also it's your wish
see at least one column you have to
change you don't need to do all you
don't need to do this for four columns
one column is
enough
okay one column is
enough I just changed on Country
column
done perfect
if you want to split the values you see
here go to customer ID
here go to customer ID if you want to
split the values click on this three
dots so here we have a split
values split values automatic
split you have to click on the second
one
data
grid you have under data profile you
have to click on data grid to see data
in a table
form we are going to see so many options
in table desktop okay I'm not sure how
you're going to remember all those
things but I'm going to each and every
minute is really
important every minute is really
important you're going to see new new
features
okay and practice is really really
needed now split
values custom split if you want to go
for a custom split you can go for custom
split use the separator what do we have
separator it's say Ione and split the
value
simple split the values
done for example let's say you want to
apply filter on this data
set for example you you want to apply
the filter you don't need hold this data
set you need only few records which
records you need let assume that so here
we do have a ship mode right you want to
have only uh first class records
what you need you need only first class
records how you can apply the filter on
this you see select the ship
mode first class we don't have first
class I think we do have same
day or let's say let's pick this one
region wise I would like to take only
us records how to apply filter on
this see
on
this go for create calculated
field go for create calculated
field we are going to use this create
calculated
field probably in our upcoming
sessions just wanted to show you how you
can write this Okay click on this create
calculated field go for a custom
calculations go for a custom
calculations you're going to see this Fe
this box now we'll talk about this box
later okay
now region wise is equal to what we need
us in double codes just do mention
us and click on
apply wait
wait no just give me a second we want to
apply the filter right it is not right
way let me remove
this we'll go for
this click on this filter
value select this region wise click on
filtered
values see
region wise is equal to
what
us we're actually applying the filter on
this
column we'll talk about this t uh this
box
later okay all if you click on this
filter value region wise is equal to us
click on
apply clear all of
you
perfect now we have only those items
where region wise is
us we have only those items where we
have us
region then perfect you see any action
you perform you perform any action
you're going to see all those steps over
here have you
observed change data type we apply the
filter yes so here we have done
something else we have removed you see I
have
removed this is first one is changing
data type the second one is I have
removed one column so this is a filter
one this is
split all actions are recorded over here
if you want to if you want to undo any
Last Action left hand side we have
changes from here also you can do
that right now once
again click on this plus you see now you
can export this data if you're trying to
export this data in the form of in the
format of CSV you will see only those
records where region is us and if you
just observe
this earlier we used to have 20,000
records but this time how many records
we have only 3,000 that means it's
already upate the
filter okay
now do I have to export this in CSV file
can't we do any other
action we can do other action
also it is not like you can go with only
single action it's not like that if you
want to perform any other activity yes
still you can do that what we'll do now
we'll go for a
pivot we'll go for a pivot what do you
say or we'll go for aggregation we
didn't see this aggregation right all of
you take this
aggregation all of you take this
aggregation click on this plus and click
on this
aggregate now drag and drop this
category
under group field and let's say we do
have
what we do have profit see drag and drop
this profit over here aggregated
field can't we add one more dimension
you can add one more Dimension also if
you
want if you want to add one more
Dimension yes still you can do
that now you see now you tell me if I
export
this if I export this am I going to see
the summary or am I going to see the raw
data you tell
me if I export this am I going to see
this aggregated
results or am I going to see this clean
data Ashish we are not going to see the
raw data we are going to see the
summary clear all of you we are going to
see the summary so how we can export
this here click on this plus and click
on this output
click on this
output you see you going to see output
something like
this got
it and again you can you can you can
take this output file in CC file in
CSV and you can run
this you can execute
this click on this play button
that's
it clear all of
you so enjoyed tblo data
prep it's too good
right
now go to file and save
this go to file save this
where you want to save it's your
wish wherever you want to save this you
can save this it's your
choice
okay so now today we are going to start
working with tblo public or tblo ttop
okay let me repeat once again there are
two different types of tools one is tblo
desktop wherein we can prepare the
report but it is a paid version and we
have something called
tblo public which is free version in
this TBL public also we can prepare a
report but we'll have few
limitations that is the difference
between these two tools okay yesterday
we have seen how to install tblo public
I request you all to open tblo public
okay Victoria hi good to see you
Victoria so you have to
download tblo public let me share the
link to download it Tao public you need
table public right take this one without
this we cannot proceed further take this
link download quickly tblo public
product if it is asking you to sign in
you must have credentials but for time
being what I will do I will give you one
dumy Account Details use this username
and password to sign in use this
username and password to sign in
meanwhile we'll discuss something guys
just look at my screen so this is tblo
desktop I will work on tblo desktop and
you can work on tblo public okay and
you'll not see much difference between
these two but in few cases definitely so
whenever we open tblo public or tblo
desktop we'll see three different
sections yeah first section second
section and third section under first
section you have a option to connect to
different
sources for example if you have data in
Excel and you are going to pick the
Excel if you have data in a CSV file or
a notepad you going to take a text file
okay now if you have data in SQL or any
Oracle database just look at my screen
here if I click on more so if I click on
more
so these are lot different different
servers you see if you have data in
let's
say where IBM db2 you'll pick this db2
if you have data in aour SQL database
you'll pick SQL Z database if you have
data in MySQL MySQL if you have data in
one drive Microsoft SQL Server what not
sap Hana what not so my dear friends
in Tablo public you're not going to see
these many connectors that is a
limitation clear in tblo public you
don't have these many connectors you
will see only in tblo
desktop clear all of you now yesterday I
was highlight I was highlighting
something yesterday I was talking about
data flow how you can get the data from
server using data flow let me recap Once
Again so here here we do have a
database this is tblo desktop
file tblo
desktop and here we have tblo data prep
we do have two ways to get the data
right you see I am importing data from
database to Tableau Data prep here I'm
going to perform data wrangling job once
data is cleaned what I'm going to do I'm
going to publish this flow in the server
I'm going to publish this flow in the
server right now in order to prepare a
report I have to have the
data I have two ways to get the data one
way I can get the data from
database if I go with this approach
again I have to clean this
data and another way I can get this flow
data from the server directly into tblo
desktop got
now again once data is in I can create a
report over here again I publish this
into the server now how to get that flow
from the
server I repeat how to get the flow from
the server you see if I go back to
here you see here we do have a Twi
server
right you can get the data from server
also
you have to connect here if I click on
sign in once I sign in I can get the
data from server as well got it all of
you is see tabl
Server
clear clear the flow perfect now what is
the first step we have to have the data
right so all of you click on this
Excel connect to data
click on this
Excel which file we have to import we
are going to import sample Superstore
data set all of you import sample
Superstore data set quickly okay Harish
you have to open table public and you
have to load sample Superstore data
set okay guys you see my screen here
whenever you try to import the data here
we do have different tabs bottom left
corner you see data
source actually we are in a data source
tab where we can see metad
dat and this is a place where you're
going to
create
relationships or you're going to create
join between the
tables it is like
a model view in powerbi in powerbi also
we have a model view where we can create
the relations right so here you can
create relationship between the tables
or you can create joints between the
table Yeah so here you're going to see
data in a Tabler form clear all of you
now by default you'll see one sheet
whenever you open tblo Desktop or tblo
product by default you will see one
sheet like whenever you open Excel file
by default you will see sheet one
whenever you open powerbi Desktop you'll
see page one here also whenever you open
a tblo desktop you'll see page one just
look at my screen so here this is the
server name or Excel file name in this
Excel workbook we do have a table called
orders in this table we do have these
many
columns all columns are placed left hand
side in powerbi it is placed where right
hand
side why I'm keep on highlighting
powerbi powerbi because you have already
gone through with powerbi I'm just
correlating so that you can understand
in a better way why I am always
correlating because you have already
gone through
powerbi that make easy for you to
correlate all bi tools works in the same
way in power bi it is placed right hand
side in table it is placed left hand
side plus here also you'll see all these
columns placed in alphabetical order in
addition to this you'll see here one
divider you see one partition here
created so these all are
dimensions or non- numerical columns
below this we have something called
measures numerical column got it now
we'll try to understand
this this is called Pages we call it as
a page
shelf we're calling it as a what page
shelf this is filter shelf we are going
to explore all these
things yeah this is called Mark
cards marks card here we have a small
drop down by using this small drop down
we can customize the visuals you see we
do have different different
options and this is called color shelf
size Shelf Text shelf whatnot again
these are called as a
shelves here this is called column Shelf
this is called Rose shelf it is looks
like a pure table
structure yeah this is called a
page or a
sheet
and right hand side you have something
called show
me it's called show me
panel this is called show me
panel in this panel will have 24
visuals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 8 3 are 24 24 visuals we
have got
it and this is called report
canvas this is called report canvas the
sheet one this is a title bar it's a
title for the title for report
got it we are going to explore each and
every
point just you know I would like to go
through this quickly at very high
level now my dear friends in this sheet
one have you opened powerbi sorry TBL
public right you see now you'll have
this something called tblo icon Harish
you have something called T icon if you
click on this table icon you'll have
option it's very easy first stage of any
bi tool is what you have to import the
data by the way we forgot to tell you
right I forgot to tell you the second
page so the second section in the second
section you'll see recently opened files
very recently whatever you have opened
those files can be seen on second screen
uh second section under third section
here we have some material yeah some
learning material you'll see on the
third section yeah
now guys in this page
one in this page you can
always plot only one visual at a time oh
is it
yes you'll have always single visual
it is not you know you can place
multiple visuals in like
powerbi in powerbi we used to place
everything in a single page right but
here it's not like that on a single page
single sheet we'll have only one
visual then you can plot another
chart you can take another one you can
plot another
visual every sheet will have only one
visual how to combine them together
how to combine them together you see
here we do have something called
dashboard the second icon what you see
this is called a
dashboard let me just just don't do
anything look at my screen if I click on
this yeah this is called
dashboard where you can place multiple
sheets I have three different sheets
every sheet will have a single visual
you you can drag and drop all these
visual on your
dashboard dashboard means collection of
sheets collection of sheets is nothing
but
dashboard perfect
now we have something called story you
see the last icon what you see this is
called story if you want to narrate a
story you can build the story also what
is story all about about story means
collection
of collection of
sheets plus
dashboards collection of you see sheets
and dashboard you are going to drag and
drop them over
here so we'll talk about dashboard we'll
talk about stories and we'll talk about
sheets and everything in our upcoming
sessions
okay so far so good
perfect now my dear friends what we are
going to do now we'll
make handfree on this tool now just open
that file would you like to share your
screen quickly just share your screen
quickly you see what is the first
stage collection of data right you see
left hand side we have a connect to data
top left hand side left corner click on
it what we have to
do
simple Excel workbook from where we have
to get the data Excel okay don't you
have data H download
it now what we have to do go to sheet
one that's it easy
right okay we have something called
click sense that is another bi tool
you have to learn click sense by
yourself
only H
perfect bottom left corner you have
sheet right you see bottom left corner
left hand side ah click on
sheet click on it my dear click on it
yes Abola share your screen yeah you can
stop it now abisola I think you have
open tblo data prep I think
so ah you see you have open tblo prep
Builder we are working on Tablo
public open the tblo public desktop wait
wait tblo
public I think yesterday we have
installed right why you are installing
once again close
this close
this cancel Windows search go to Windows
search Windows
search uh table type
tblo you see public is there you see TBL
public 2024 now click on
it click on it
wait
clear uh what you have to do
now very good
wait
guys I need your
attention this is tblo public
right we'll have few
limitations if you're working on table
Loop
public can we save this file in our
local
machine answer is no you cannot save
this in your
laptop oh is it yes how to save this
file in order to save this
file you have to sign in in tblo public
server you can save this under tblo
public server only now how to save this
all of you look at the screen now go to
file go to
file top left corner
yes okay you see save to table Loop
public as 1 2 3 4 5 6th one yeah this is
now great
out the moment when we have a visual now
we are going to
see that is in enabled state so what
we'll do let me give a try with one or
two visuals then I will ask you to save
this in server okay now all of you look
at my screen
now look at my
screen this is called column shelf and
this is called row shelves
right we are going to place
dimensions and
measures based on our requirement we do
have two different set of data over here
one is
dimensions and another one is measure
Dimensions means
what in Layon language non-numerical
data non-numerical data called dimension
measures are nothing but numerical
data numerical
data
technically qualitative and
quantitative yeah you can quantify
this this is qualitative
data got it you can quantify the data
that means on the numbers you can
perform mathematical
operations for example here we do have a
product sorry profit you would like to
see how much profit we have received
what is the total profit what is total
discount what is total quantity or
average quantity you can perform
mathematical operations on
numbers you can quantify the
data got it qualitative data is nothing
but a dimension you would like to see
based on certain Dimensions B that means
from which category we are getting more
profit in which Market we are getting
more sales from which region we are
getting more number of
orders got it so that is nothing but a
Dimensions how you want to view the
data actually Dimensions describes
numbers or
measures
Dimensions describe
measures how you want to see your
numbers in which angle you want to see
the numbers or at which level you want
to look at the
numbers so these are the different
different definitions of
Dimension okay now we'll plot one graph
now let's see now what we can do all of
you just drag and drop this
subcategory under Ro shelf like
this all of you drag and drop this
subcategory under row
shelf
clear
now it's very easy drag and drop Sals
under column
shelves wow you see now
clear do you see no bar remember it's
very easy to plot any graph in any bi
Tool It's Just DE easy job yes or
no
now we'll see how to sort this but
before we proceed further we have to
understand
terminologies you see this one under row
shelf we have subcategory right so this
is
called
pill this look like pills
right these are called
pills
clear
now yes we do have two pills but one is
in a blue color and another one is in a
green color what does it mean you see
this color indicates this green pill is
a
measure what it is this green pill is a
measure and dimensions
will be represented in a blue
color got it all of you green pills
represents
measures blue pills represents
Dimensions
yeah clear all of you perfect very good
it's a interview question by D now I
would like to
enable data
labels how to enable data
labels there are multiple ways to enable
the data labels but will go with this
option here we have a t for
text you can drag and drop any field
under column shelf and row shelf you're
going to get one visual okay how we can
understand this I will let you know once
we are in a visuals
okay now all if you click on this t for
text
to see data
labels got
it now we have a data labels for each
and every
bar
yeah this bar
indicates the sales value
correct now how to
sort this visual based
on sales value
now there are many ways to
sort if I over my M on this area mid of
this canvas we'll see one option you see
if I over my M on Mid of this canvas do
you all see
this one
click to
sort largest to
smallest another click smallest to
largest
third click sorting by ascending order
sorting subcategory by ascending
order got it all of you
sort
easy very
good now this is really very
simple sorting let me take you through
Advance sorting okay as I mentioned
yesterday you're going to see so many
options
okay now one more option you see
here this sub category right if I place
MOS on
this yeah here we have a small drop drop
down if I click on this so again here
also you have option to
sort click on the
sort this one if I click on this drop
down here you have option called to
sort done yep now from here also you can
sort Ascend by ascending order or
descending order this is very normal
sorting if you want to
sort by some other field still you can
do that you say sort by one is manual
sorting if you have something to sort
manually
like this you can drag and drop this is
something called manual
sorting this manual sort you can do
through Visual also just look at my
screen you see for example I want to
have this label at the top you see like
this this is called manual
sorting very rarely we go for a manual
sort okay we do have something called I
would like to display I would like to
show this one
by field you
see by field by which field can I pick
some other field yes why not you see
field name just take the
profit descending order like this select
field field is nothing but a column sort
order is descending from this drop down
just pick the profit things will change
automatically in back
done perfect shall I close this no one
is
lagging now what is happening here
actually we are sorting by The Profit
you see now let me close
this let me erase all this
markers you see copies the subcategory
is at top level but if you look at the
value sales value is lesser than
phones what is in
top sales wise okay it is less than
phones but when it comes to profit wise
profit wise copat are giving more
profit got it to give more clarity or
better
Clarity what I will do I will try drag
and drop this profit under column shelf
you see now all of you drag and drop
profit under column
shelf now you'll get more clarity
now got
it sounds
good clear what is happening
here profit wise copers is giving more
profit yeah sales are lesser than phones
sales wise phones is giving more sales
but profit wise it's in a second
position perfect

let's
let's let's proceed now all of you take
new sheet we'll talk about
filters we do have various
filters oh is it yes we have something
called Dimension
filter we have something called measure
filter we have something called
interactive
filters
interactive we have something called
data source filter
data source filter what not context
filter we do have these many
filters shall I make a note of all these
filters no you don't you don't really
require to make a note of all these
things because if you go through
LMS you'll you'll have one document on
this
topic okay if you go through LMS you'll
have have a
document I will not prefer to go through
any
PDF okay but in PDF you have all this
content clear all of you now we'll see
how to apply the filter using Dimensions
measures and how we can have a context
filter or interaction whatnot we'll talk
about the filters in today's
class in order to do that do one thing
all of you once again drag and drop the
subcategory under Ro
sh drag and drop subcategory under row
shell and drag and drop profit under
column shelf now on wordss what you have
to do whenever you are doing this you
have to sort the
values and you have to enable the data
labels make a habit to do this okay so
that it's you know you can practice
this you have to sort them and you have
to enable data
levels perfect now we'll see what is
dimension filter we'll see what is
dimension filter Dimension means what
non- numerical column you see now we
have something called subcategory right
I'm trying to create the subcategory
under filter
shell all of you just drag and drop this
subcategory under filter shell the
moment when you you do this you're going
to see one pop up
wow done you see here we do have three
different no not three four different
tabs here just look at my screen stop
doing this one General tab Wild Card
condition and top that means what you
can apply filter on this in four
different ways you can apply filter on
this in four different ways we'll
explore each and every
tab okay for example I'm in a general
tab I don't want to see first three
subcategories I'm going to uncheck them
you see all of you uncheck first three
subcategories once you do uncheck don't
click on okay you have to click on
apply what will happen if I click on
apply this change will be applied but
this box will
be written over
here
yeah
apply
done now Wild Card let's go to second
one called wild card match values so I'm
going to say s that means you see so I
have entered s over here and I'm going
to pick this ends with that means if any
subcategory is ending with S I would
like to see them got
it go for a wild
card enter S as for Singapore end
with and click on apply I would like to
see only those subcategories which are
ending with
s got
it clear
perfect now let's go to condition so
here you can put in a condition here you
can put a condition based on a condition
things will get filtered out oh is it
yes so you can write a formula also see
by formula in powerbi we have written so
many formulas right so here also you
have a scope to write the formulas so
what I'm going to do here I'm going to
say hey I would like to see some of
profit if it is greater than or equal to
what let's say
5,000 I would like to see only those
items which are above 5,000 what will
happen all these negative values plus
this one also will be
removed got it you on apply you see it's
gone condition by
formula you just write the simple
formula over here now here how many
items we have 1 2 3 6 7 8 eight
subcategories we do have now I would
like to see top five subcategories based

how we can apply filter using a measure
generally we not do this filter but
since we have this in culum quotes I'm
just exploring this what it is you see
measure means what a number right here
we do have a profit what I will do I
will drag and drop this profit under
filter shell you see I'm doing I'm going
to drag and drop this under filter shell
what will happen just look at my screen
the moment when I release
again we we are going to see one popup
this time this popup is a different
format see so asking me hey how you want
to apply filter on this visual since
it's a measure or it's a numerical
column we have option to apply filter
using some average median count whatnot
so these are our mathematical operations
let me cancel this if I drag and drop
any other non-numerical column yeah
we'll have a different options
you see on numeric on non- numerical or
on a dimension you can apply filter
using
this but it is a number if I drag and
drop this number column you'll have a
different format similarly if I do drag
and drop date you'll have a different
options you see now it's a date so based
on the column type you going to see a
different different options right now
let me drag and drop profit over here
I would like to apply filter on this
using sum I request you all drag and
drop profit under filter shelf yeah take
the
sum take the sum click on
next click on next what is happening
here if you notice this from where we
got this value see now this profit is
being displayed based on the
subcategories
so what is the least value here you see
tblue is very so very smart you see what
is the least value it is this these all
these all our profits are actually
aggregated by subcategories so least
value is minus minus 35k the least value
what is maximum value
one1 or 235 you see one
111k got it so this is how it is shown
lowest value and highest value now for
example if you want to see only those
subcategories which falls under I repeat
you would like to see only those
subcategories which are falls under this
range you see
now if some of category some of let's
say subcategory profit is some of this
12,000 minimum and maximum this you'll
see only those items like
this got it now for example let's say
you have a requirement you would like to
see only those subcategories which are
giving 10,000 to let's say
100K you would like to see only those
subcategories which are giving profit
between 10,000 to 100K then you want to

notepad you see we have addressed this
one top 10 students top 10 products
irrespective their country top 10
products there is no such filter
now now requirement is I would like to
see top 10 products with regards to each
and every
state with regards to State let's say in
California from California what are
those top 10
products got
it now what we'll do now take the
state take the state and click on show
filter take this state
here and click on show
filter
done right hand side you'll have one
separate
section where you can see list of
states
yeah California Florida oh my goodness
what not Maryland MD yeah
Texas so these are different different
states we
have now look at my screen carefully y I
would like to see top 10 from California
if I click on this California oh my
goodness how many products are
displaying this now I clicked on
California I could see only four
items why not 10
items by the way why it has shown four
items you see try to understand the
concept first of all we have
displayed 10 items
on top of it I applied filter using
State out of 10 product four products
are belongs to
California understood we have taken 10
products top 10 products out of which
four products are belongs to California
hence we could see top
four clear now let's say I'm removing
this California let me select Florida
oh my
goodness do we have any product no that
means what none of them falls under
Florida
State we have taken top 10 items none of
them belongs to Florida State hence
everything is blank am I making
sense
yes am I making sense
now requirement is what when I select
Florida definitely the state will have
certain
products the state will have definitely
few products I would like to see top 10
from Florida only when I select Florida
I would like to see top 10 items
similarly when I select
California I would like to see 10 not
four what we have to do in order to see
with regards to the state I have to
change the
context you see how to do that here we
have a state
right click on this small drop down
click on this add to
context add to context
simple add to context then
ah now you see the magic now this state
is now become as a context filter that
means first filter is being applied
based on the
state you
see California I have selected what will
happen internally listen to me very
carefully internally one logical table
will be
created one logical table will be
created the table will have only
California
records the table will have only
California records on top of this
logical table it will apply top 10
filter got it now here we do have top 10
products similarly let me go back to
this notepad so that you can understand
very easily first question was IR
respective region we have seen top 10
students
the second requirement is with regards
to this India how many are I would like
to see list of top 10 so here context is
now
changed got it now let me go back to
Tableau clear all of you for example
let's say let me ask you one simple
question I'm checking your understanding
okay for example if I select Florida I
have already selected California
let's say if I select Florida now you
tell me am I going to see 10 products or
am I going to see 10 + 10 20 products
how many products I'm going to see 10 or
20 if I select California and Florida am
I going to see 10 products or 20
products yes
guys Victoria
abisola 10 only
correct correct if I select
Florida Victoria try to understand now I
selected Florida now California and
Florida now what is happening internally
one table got created logical table got
created this table will contain two
different states one is California plus
Florida on top of this data set it will
apply top 10 filter hence we have top 10
items
okay clear all of
you this is called context
filter
yeah Victoria when you see four items
when when you are not making the state
as a context you will see
four now we made this state as a
context filter so first it will apply
filter on State on top of it it will
take top 10 items clear
so this is called context
filter to have better performance on
visual you'll go for a context filter
okay and based on business requirement
also clear all of you sounds good I
could see your screen now
yes what you're trying to do
now okay okay go
back okay drag and drop product name
under R shelf we would like to see top
10 products so drag and drop product
name under product under R
shelf add all members add all the
members drag and drop now profit under
column
shelf profit under column
shelf right sort them quickly and data
labels we have to do this with fast yes
enable data labels how will you enable
the data labels correct now how we can
check top 10
items very
good go to
Top by
field click on apply
click on okay done now we would like to
see based on the states right now drag
and drop
State under filter
shelf make it as context filter click on
all check all the
items check all the items you see they
all all
option click on
apply
okay now make it as
context add to context
that's it now show this filter show
State as a filter how will you display
this as a filter yes click on it show
filter that's it now if you select any
one state based on your selection it
will display top 10
products see got it very easy right now
we'll talk about
groups we'll talk about group all of you
take a new
sheet all of you take a new sheet now
drag and drop subcategory
under row
shelf and drag and drop profit under
column
shelf and you have to quickly sort
this sorry
down
plus you have to turn on data labels
you have to turn on data
labels
done perfect very easy right just you
have to do drag and drop drag and drop
drag and drop in fact we're not going
too fast there is nothing called you
know coding we're not writing any code
we not writing any formula we are just
doing drag and drop drag and drop okay
now my dear friends if you look at the
subcategories we do have
two different let's say if I categorize
them based on the profit I can say two
different groups we have one set of
subcategories are one set of
subcategories are giving positive profit
and another set of subcategories are
giving negative profits you see
now got it if you see three different
subcategories over here so these are
giving negative profit
and remaining all other subcategories
are giving positive profit so what I
would like to do I would like to create
a group based on the profit value I
would like to put all subcategories all
positive subcategories under one bucket
and all negative subcategories under
different
bucket basically I would like to create
a group on
this in order to group them we do have
multiple options I would say different
ways we have to
group we have different ways to group
them now we'll go with visuals how we
can group using a visual it's very easy
just look at my screen first what I
would like to do I would like to
bring all these three subcategories
under one bucket all this negative how
to select this negative subcategories
look at my screen if I place my mouse
over here you see click and hold and
drag basically you have to select these
three negative
bars basically what you have to do you
have to select these three negative
Parts like
this if you select and release now
you're going to see this option called
group you see now again look at my
screen click somewhere over here and
drag hold it and drag it now here you
will see
one attachment icon called group we are
going to create a group by considering
these three
subcategories click on
group got
it
done once again you see so here we have
supplies you have to click over here
hold it and drag it
what we are trying to do here we are
trying to select these three negative
bars and release and you'll see over
here one option called attachment group
member if you click on this now it is
now
grouped got it right hand side will have
two different
groups clear all of
you yes perfect now how to edit this
names
yeah how to edit this alas you see now
it's a easy way to change this if you
double click on
this see okay Ashish look at my screen
once
again no no you'll get it okay how to
undo let me show you how to undo this if
you want to undo any action so here you
have a back arrow
do you all see this back
arrow this is like a
undo okay now Ashish look at my
screen select three wordss and release
the moment when you release you'll see
this one click on
group that's
it got it all of
you now what we can do if I want to
rename
this you're not getting those options
okay give a try uh
release okay hold on once again click
somewhere else okay once again give a
try wait what you have to do probably
I'm just verifying
this you just you have to select last
bar not full just off of the bar you
have to select at the end don't drag
till the end don't select x- axis once
again enough enough you see now what you
doing
abisola you are selecting X
also got it abisola if you are selecting
x- axis you may not able to see that
option
clear now how to edit this
name no
problem okay you see I'm going to edit
this name if I right click on this so
here you have option called
editas you see now
right click on this
bookcases look at my
screen this first one bookcases it is
actually
a
negative subcategories right you see if
you right click on this and say edit
alas you see click on this and
say
negative
profit and we do have another group
called
other actually these are giving positive
profit right click on this other and
here you have option called edit alas
you want this
one right click on this other click on
edit alas make it as
positive
profit
yeah how do I click on the correct axis
you don't need to you see abisola have
you created a group first of all tell me
have you created a
group have you created a
group you see can we change
them I mean to say can we change
different
color you see to change different color
my dear friends you just double click on
it abisola what you have to do you have
to just double click on this for
negative profit the moment when you
double click on this you'll see option
to edit the color from this pallette you
can select the red color if you want for
plus profit that means positive profit
you can select green color click on
apply that's
it I repeat to use a different color to
apply a different color what you can do
you can double click on this profit
negative profit or positive profit and
you will see one option called edit
colors pick that group and apply the
color
pick that group and select the
color
done now this is called
group this is called
group there is another way to create a
group oh is it yes
there is another way to create a
group how we can create the
group how we can create the bins let's
see now for
example guys for example let's
see let me take a new sheet all of you
take a new
sheet all of you take a new
sheet yeah so here we do have let's say
what do we have let's see which one
we'll pick shall we take the
country we have only US country okay
let's see so we have a state column
right so let's say for every uh let's
say group of states we have a
lead let's say we do have 10 states for
this 10 States we have particular lead
let's say asish leading 10 states and we
do have 10 more States those states are
leading by whom let's say
lesle how we can create this kind of a
group or for example we would like to
categorize States based on region let's
say few States
east side east
region and we do have 20 more
States those are are North Side North
Region we do have few more States those
are belongs to west region got the point
so how we can group
them let's see now go to state here
click on this Arrow mark
click on this state there is an arrow
Mark small drop down you see this one
click on
this go to create so here we have an
option called
group click on this
group this is another way of creating
the
group
Okay click on this group all of you I'm
holding my screen if you're lagging
anywhere let me know done now
if you want to give a name to this group
you can give a name over
here see these many states we have what
you can do randomly you can pick one
state scroll
down and hold shift key and
select I repeat select one state hold
shift key and randomly pick one
state that means we are creating
one group by considering all the
states now once you select these many
states simply click on what group click
on
group once you click on a group by
default you will see states names you
have to give a name to this let's say
east
region all these states belongs to
East got
it if you missed any point
let me show you once again select one
state and hold shift
key hold shift
key and randomly select any one state
like
this I'm selecting these many states and
click on Group by default group name
will be your state names so what I'm
going to do now I'm going to Reign it
I'm going to say south region
for it if you're lagging let me know
because I'm anyway going very slow I
cannot repeat
this anyway I'm going very
slow if you're lagging let me
know don't ask me after 5 minutes or 10
minutes select one
state hold shift key
and randomly pick one state like this
and click on
group and how to rename you see by
default you'll have state name as a
group name so this is let's say North
Region got
it
grp we have created four different
regions
so this is how you can create the
group got it click on
apply click on apply or okay you see
under data
section you're going to see a new field
called State
group can we use this
field to visualize the data
answer is yes you can make use of this
new group to visualize the data also so
is it yes for your better understanding
what I'm doing I'm going to drag and
drop the state under row
shelf yeah now I'm going to
place let's say profit under column
shell you
see this is also another way of creating
the
group
here now all of you take a new
sheet once
again all of you take a new
sheet okay what do you mean by hierarchy
what do you mean by
hierarchy what is
hierarchy yes guys any idea what is
hierarchy no
idea like trees like a flow of pathway
hierarchy like
trees going in the flow different
values okay it's kind of a grouping okay
we are going to put relevant values
Under One
Roof right let's say simple example is
let's
say we have a team
lead under team lead we have a team
members right all these team members
reports to team lead and team lead
reports to what whom he will report to
managers
and this manager reports to
whom they will report to senior manager
and the senior manager reports to whom
let's say
directors or VPS yeah so this is called
hierarchy this is called
hierarchy got it now we are going to
place actually relevant you know
Dimensions relevant categories Under One
Roof that will make us that will make
that will help us to drill down
further you can drill up or you can
drill down you can drill down or you can
drill up based on your business
requirement okay now if you
see this order
date or ship
date most of the
time date field in a gross all the bi
tools will have the hierarchy by default
you don't need to create any hierarchy
when you have a date column you see
now if I drag and drop this order date
under column
shelf look at my
screen what I did I just drag and drop
this order ID under column sh you see my
screen
here by default it has created a
hierarchy under this year actually this
date is now rolled up by year if I want
to drill on further I can see now
quarter level data you see now I clicked
on this plus Mark we have this again can
we go further can we do drill down yes
if I click on this plus Mark again we
can see data at month-wise you see
month-wise data again if I click on this
place Mark again I can see Day level
got it so this is called
what this is called hierarchy by default
on top of Date column will have a
hierarchy for example if I want to have
my own
hierarchy how we can create the
hierarchy let's see
now you see Let Me Clear the sheet how
you can create the sheet people are
removing like this manually you guys are
removing like this okay instead of
moving one by one what you can do you
can clear this worksheet so here we have
one option called
clear clear the sheet you see if I click
on
this gone so this is how you can clear
the sheet okay now what I'm going to do
I'm going to create a
hierarchy okay so hierarchy means you
know putting all Dimensions Under One
Roof all relevant
items we have a
country right yes we have a
country under this country we can place
State yes under the state we can place
City yes these are are you know
geographical data correct these are all
relevant Dimensions can I create
hierarchy on top of this
CS can we create hierarchy answer is yes
you
see before we proceed see it wait wait
uh ah we'll create on this what we'll do
now all of you go for a country column
here click on
this and here we have a
one drop down right click on this go to
create so here hierarchy click on this
create
hierarchy I'm holding my
screen you have to click on this h first
you have to select the main
item under this you're going to add few
more
Dimensions once you click on create
hierarchy it may ask you to enter the
name of the hierarchy so click on this
see let's say Gio I just enter the name
called Gio hit enter in this country
what we have to do we have to place
State how you are going to place the
state one way you can click on it you
can drag and drop over here like
this you can drag and drop like this if
you have too many columns sometimes it
become difficult to do drag and drop and
there is another way now you see City
this is another way I would like to have
City also in this hierarchy so I'm going
to click on this drop down City so here
we have a hierarchy add to hierarchy Gio
I would like to add City column under
Geo
hierarchy this is also another
way done all of
you
yeah
wow here now actually what is the
benefit what is the benefit to have a
hierarchy you see the
benefit I'm not going to drag and drop
country state city individually I'm
going to drag and drop this g
under column
shelf now just look at my screen I'm
going to place this sales value under
row
shelf yeah or is let me switch this
so that you can see very easily
now business benefit is I just Place
country or this entire GE so here it is
now displaying this
hierarchy user will have a scope to
drill down further anyway user cannot
see this how user can have a scope to
drill down so here even if I over my
mouse on this you see here we have
option if I click on this Plus
see user can drill down from
here got
it so this is the benefit of having a
hierarchy the benefit of having
hierarch clear all of
you instead of placing four or three
columns what I will do
I will take only hierarchy field on
column shelf or a row shelf as in when
needed user is going to drill down and
drill up
further clear all of
you
perfect okay we'll talk about lias we'll
talk about elas you see now for example
let's say let me check the data so here
we have the data right
data and a table form so here we do have
a ship
mode we do have different types of ship
modes we have a standard class first
class second class yeah what
not four different types of ship modes
we have what I would like to do for our
you know business requirement based on
business requirement we have to have
different names for the ship mode let's
say first
class I want to have let's say premium
class or something else how to edit this
name how to give a different name for
this
so in order to use a different
name see what we have to do there
are multiple ways to rename them
actually we are not renaming or we are
not replacing actual
data as main name suggest elas will have
actual data as it is but we are going to
replicate with some other
words okay we're not changing actual
data you see now we have multiple ways
if I go to data
source but let's not go to data source
because we are already working on a shet
right we'll see everything over here
only so here we do have a ship mode
click on this so here you have an option
called elas you see elas click on
this
done now in this ship mode we do have
four different ship modes first class
same day second class and standard so
actually this is our actual
data this is our actual data we would
like to you
know have a different name or different
value for this first class let's say
instead of having first class can we say
let's
say uh FC let's say
FC or if you want to have any other name
feel free to use this same day you just
double click over here let's say SD that
means same day
yeah second class let's say SC that
means second
class standard class let's say
STC standard
class you can have any value just for
our understanding purpose I'm using this
abbreviations okay and click on okay
that's
it can we use this in our visuals yes
why
not all of you just try to drag and drop
this newly created
l is it
done now you have multiple ways to do
that just give me a
second now you see my my my screen just
give me just look at my screen as I
mentioned you can do
this from data source
also yes if you don't want to display
this elas see you can click on
this see here if you want to have this
elas here from here also you can do that
and being in sheet one also you can do
that just now we have it
yep if you want to display actual name
also you can do that where it
is peras you see here also we have
multiple options to do
this okay you have multiple options to
do that
now what we'll do
now we'll talk about again let's go back
to group see we have created a
group right so especially this
one we have created two different
groups one is for negative subcategories
and another one is the positive
subcategories fair enough now let assume
that let's say we have one subcategory
called
table as of now this table is now giving
negative
profit as of now this table is giving
negative profit hence it is in a
negative bucket let's say tomorrow
onwards this tables subcategory started
giving positive
profit do you think that this stable a
automatically falls under positive
bucket do you think that this table is
now placed under positive
bucket
yes yes guys as of now this table
subcategory is giving negative profit
let's say tomorrow onwards the table
subcategory started giving
positive now can you expl this table
under positive
bucket or you going to see that negative
only you see whenever you're going for a
group do
remember groups are always static in
nature these are all static in nature
the stable subcategory will not go to
positive bucket if it is in a positive
State
no clear if you want to move from
negative to positive you have to
manually edit
this that means what when you are sure
that things will not change
frequently then only you have to go for
a
group if things are changing very
dynamically you cannot create a group on
it is it
clear similarly here also we have
created a group right let's say here we
have created this group in a different
way for example these many states
belongs to asish our Le asish is a lead
for these many states Jenny Scott is
leading these many states if it is fixed
then only you have to create a group
for example let's say California moved
from Ashish to Jenny
Scott then you have to manually
edit clear all of you so groups are
actually static in
nature dynamically it won't change if
you want to make any changes you have to
manually change them
clear yeah now
we have something called
set what we do have something called
set what is the
set based on the condition you can
create a
group based on a such based on a
condition you can create a group let me
take a new page
try to understand whenever you are
creating a set based on a condition you
see set based on a condition you can
create a
set actually data will be divid it into
two
parts based on a condition whenever you
have a condition at the end you'll see
two things one is true or false if
condition is met that means it's a true
statement if condition is false that
means we'll see false
statement
clear now you can create this set based
on a condition that means we have true
or false two
things now set will create two groups
always how many groups two groups one
group is called
in another group is called out
you will see all those
items in in group which met the
condition
true if condition is true you will see
all those items under in
group if condition is not
satisfied you will see all those items
under out
group for example
you have 100
products you would like to see top 10
products what will happen top 10
products you would like to see top 10
products you would like to
see 10 product will be placed under in
group and we do have remaining
90 those remaining 90 products will be
placed under outg grou
what is
set
yeah clear all of you what is set set is
actually subset of the data you have
data subset of the
data and this subset of the data will be
divided into two
parts one is in group and another one is
a out
group you will see all those items where
condition is false sorry condition is
meant if condition is met you'll see
those items under in group if condition
is false you'll see those items under
out group that's it you'll see always
two groups in and
out clear now what we are going to do
now we are going to create again let's
see we would like to see top 10 states
based on the
profit we would like to see top 10
states based on the profit okay but this
time we'll we we'll give a try through
set
now how we can do that you see
now where is the
state so here we have a
state right if I place MOS on this here
create a
set all of you click on this set all of
you click on the set done now name of
the set is what top
10 top
10 give a name called top
10 I would like to see top 10 states go
to Top by field top 10 based on what
based on the
profit click on okay
all of you click on
okay let me click on okay done the
moment when you click on okay you see
somewhere over under data section you'll
see top 10 set and icon for set is
different you'll see something like this
circles you
see you'll have different different
icons for set you'll have this kind of a
icon for group you will see
attachment right for hierarchy you will
see different
one like this for calculated field you
will see something like this equal to
ABC for calculated
field
Yeah by looking at this icons you can
understand what is for parameter you'll
see something
else we ready to discuss
parameter so you have to look at this
icons right
now top 10 set is now created fantastic
now just look at my screen what I will
do I will drag and drop the state don't
do anything just look at my screen I'm
placing the state under row shelf so
these are these are our states and I'm
going to place profit under column shelf
fair enough I'm just doing quick sort
and I'm going to enable data labels so
far so good okay so these are our
different states all the
states okay now we have a set just look
at my screen this is only for your
understanding purpose top 10 states just
look at my screen when I move when I
drag this top 10 set you see the moment
when I started dragging it's showing in
and out you see in and out in and out
you see now just look at my screen
if I place this under row shelf right
before the state just look at my
screen now it has created two groups one
is in group where you will see 10 states
and remaining States you're going to see
under out
group got
it clear all of you now what I will do
now let me clear
this let me clear the sheet
I'm going to place top 10 under row
shelf you see once again let me Place
profit under col column shell you see
now what is happening you'll have two
groups in and
out in means top 10 value and remaining
State value is under out group yeah so
this is also another way of visualizing
it now let me clear this now let's give
a try
all of your drag and drop State under R
shell and drag and drop profit under
column
shelf do the quick sort and enable data
labels now drag and drop this top 10 set
under filter
shelves finally drag and drop this top
10 set under filter
Shell by default it will take in
group sometimes if it is if if it is
throw in popup stating which one you
want to pick you just take the
in most of the time by default it will
pick in only if it is asking you to
choose which one you want to take you
can take
in done all of you all of you rename it
give a nice title to this report let's
say top 10
States using
cell can we have bottom 10 states can we
have bottom 10
states
yeah all of you create bottom 10
states all of you create a
set how you can create a
set see now
go to state once
again click on Create and set this
one done all of
you let's create another
set to bring bottom
10
State create
set name it as bottom 10
now to have a bottom 10 again you have
to click on top only okay name it as
bottom 10 click on this by field over
here from this drop down you have to
select the
bottom from this drop down you pick
bottom type
10 profit and click on
okay done all of you once it is done
again take new sheet and display bottom
10
states once it is done all of you take a
new
sheet and display bottom 10
states I'm taking new
sheet let me drag and drop State under
row
shelf profit under column Shelf
do a quick sort and enable data
labels and where is bottom
10 so here drag and draw this under
filter sh you see it is a bottom
very
easy
perfect
now one interview
question we can create set only on
Dimensions make a note we can create a
set only on
Dimensions got it only on numerical
sorry non- numerical column
clear you see product name it's a
dimension you see we have option called
set segment is a dimension create a
set perfect ship mode is a dimension we
can create a set but if I go to a
measure discount profit sales and
quantity so these are our numerical
columns so here we don't have that
option called
set here we don't have any option called
set what do we have here we have
something called
bins what do we have we have something
called bins we'll see bin this we'll see
this bin how to create a bin also very
shortly but before we proceed you
see we have created two
sets one is
top and another one is bottom
yes or no so we have created two sets
top 10 and bottom 10 can we combine
these two
sets can we combine two
sets why because let's say on a single
sheet I would like to display top 10 at
the same time I would like to display
bottom 10 states also what I would like
to do I would like to display top 10 and
bottom 10 bottom 10 on a single sheet in
order to display these two I would like
to combine I have to combine two
sets is it possible yes it is a possible
okay what will happen when you combine
two different
sets you see my
screen all of you select top 10
you have to select the set if you click
on this drop down so here you will see
one option called create combined set
you will see this option only when you
select the set
set you'll see this option only when you
select on a set got
it click on create combined
set
now all I you stop doing I'm going to
give a name
called top and
bottom it's a name of this set called
top and bottom I'm I'm combining this
top 10 with what with
bottom with bottom okay now so here we
do have four different ways to combine
them it's like a
joint okay it's like a joint
the first one you see all members in
both the
sets all members in both the sets so
what will happen just look at my screen
what will happen if I go for a first
set you have top
10 in this you have two
groups one is
in and another one is
out and you have another set called
bottom
10 in this also you
have two groups one is in and another
one is
out got it when we are combining these
two sets what will happen it will create
another
set it will create another set in that
set also we have a in and out whenever
you create any set
you'll have two in and out so now in
newly created set or in Combined set
under in what you're going to see so you
will see all in items from top 10 plus
all in items from bottom 10
sets in and in will be placed under in
and this out out
items and this out items will be placed
over
here got it here you'll see top 10 and
bottom 10 in and in you see all members
in both the sets that means positive
values that means in group where
condition is satisfied those items will
be placed under
in clear all of you and remaining all
other items placed under
out
group is it
clear
perfect now we do have few more it's
like a you know full outer join inner
join left join and right joint so we'll
talk about all these joints in our
upcoming sessions okay for time being
what you can do here my dear friends
give a name top and bottom okay select
two sets from each drop down and go for
First Option all members in both the
sets and click on
okay now here we don't have option to to
combine with more than two sets but what
you can do you see now two sets are
combined you'll have one combined set on
top of it if you want to combine yes you
can
combine at then you'll have another set
that is called combined set on top of it
if you want to add another said yes you
can do
that clear Victoria let me click on okay
now again you're going to see another
set top and bottom here now what we'll
do now just drag and drop this what
state under row
shelf and drag and drw profit under
column
shelf let's do a quick sort and enable
data labels
now you have to drag and drop this top
and bottom under filter shelf wow just
drag and
drop top and bottom set under filter
shelf top 10 and bottom 10
states
using combined
set all of you change the title
looks good all
good
fantastic now shall we proceed now my
dear
friends let's go back to top 10 states
here we have a top 10
states yes of course we have a top 10
states now user is asking hey dude I
don't want to have always top 10 states
sometimes I may go for 15 sometimes I
may go for 20 or sometimes I may go for
five also got it so how we can display
based on user input understood what is
the requirement what user is asking hey
I need one window where I'm going to
choose how many items I want to see for
example if I say top five I would like
to see top five
for example if I want to say top 10 I'm
going to pick 10 to display top 10 if I
say 15 I would like to see top 15 states
so how we can allow user to pick the
number at the same time based on his
selection we would like to display the
visual based on user selection we would
like to
display the
visual so this is something called
parameter
what it is
parameters so if you want to take user
input value I repeat if you want to take
user value user input value and based on
that value if you want to perform any
additional calculations or based on that
input value if you want to make your
visual to Dynamic you can do
that or to perform what if analysis
you'll go for a parameters in a nutshell
you want to get something from the
user in a nutshell you want to get
something from the user based on
user value you're going to perform
certain
actions that is called parameters
parameters are more powerful you can use
this parameters in your calculations you
can use these parameters in your
visuals got it all of you
now how to create a parameter let's see
now it's very easy you see now so here
let me click on
this this Arrow Mark over here there are
many ways to call parameter but this is
this is easiest way this is easiest way
click on this dropdown here you have
option called create
parameter all of you click on this
create parameter
done let me click on create
parameter now let's give a
name what to select nothing Ashish you
see my screen I have highlighted with
the
markers here you have a small drop
down click on this here you have option
called create
parameter click on this create parameter
let's give a name to this let's say top
n
this parameter name is top n let's say
top n what the data type the data type
is what integer just give me a
second okay what is the data type it's
the integer select this integer now so
here you
see this
one what type of value you want to
allow if you set allow all if you set
all that means user can enter any
value user can enter any
value if you want to create your own
list predefined
list you can go for a
list if you want to set a range you can
set the range also what we'll do now
we'll pick the
list we'll pick the list so I'm trying
to Define one list predefined list so
minimum is let's say
five yeah 10 or a
15 or a
20 you see all of you what you have to
do you select you just name it as a top
end data type of this is a
integer right allowable values must be
list we are going to create a list
manually you have to enter over here and
once it is done click on okay
done display as if you want to display
this with something else yes you can
display that
also but don't make it to changes make
it very simple click on okay done all of
you once you click on okay on data
section you'll see this
parameter see do you all see this under
parameter section based on version to
version you'll see
this yeah they have created separate
section to place all the parameters you
may or you may not able to see this
section okay don't get confused if you
don't
see so we have now
parameters let's show this parameter to
user how we can display this click on
this drop down here show
parameter click on show
parameter
done now I'm in top 10
states right so now right hand side
we have top end parameters
remember I didn't click on show me if
you click on show me you could not able
to see this it's now
covering make sure to see this top end
parameters now from this drop down if I
select anything now is it
changing is this visual is changing
based on my
input
no so we have to create relation between
these two yes sir
no we have to enable connection between
these two any guess how we can enable
the
connection any guess how we can enable
the connection between this parameters
and this
visual okay now you tell me just hold on
let me give you a
clue how we have defined this
10 where we have defined this
10 you tell
me filters it's a set right while
creating set we have defined
10 agree all of you agree you see we
have seen this States top 10 states
using
set how we have set this 10 in set we
have right now let's go to that set top
10 set this one top 10 set click on this
top 10 set here you have to click on
edit the
set here you can edit the
set or if you want to edit here also you
can
edit see edit the
set got
it if you click on this edit
set now tell
me where we have to to make a
change this is top here we have entered
manually this is a static
value we don't need static value over
here somehow we have to get this
parameter value agree all of
you somehow we have to get this
parameter value over here how to get
this parameter value over here if you
click on this this drop down here you
will see newly created parameter called
top
n from this drop down you have to pick
the
parameters got it all of
you now click on okay now is it changing
now now if I select five items oh wow
superb 10 oh my goodness 15 oh my
God got it all of
you yes it is a interview question in
interview they will ask you how to
display Dynamic top and
items
yeah okay now let me pick top
five I'm displaying now top five items
you see in this page there is a small
bug may I know what is that
bug I'm displaying top five items but
there is a bug now tell me now yeah
title yeah you see the
title it is still says 10 but I'm
displaying how many I'm displaying
five got it so somehow I should get this
five over
here that make more sense correct
somehow I should get this parameter
value over
here this should be also
Dynamic correct all of
you now so how to edit this title how to
make this title to Dynamic if you double
click on
this you can you can edit this I am
removing this
10 I have to have parameter value how to
get parameter value you see remove the
10 so here you have something called
insert you see here you have something
called insert if you click on this
insert you will see parameter here you
have to select parameters what the
parameter name top n it's a parameter
name done you see parameters STP
and now you going apply
and click on
okay is it done all of
you see click on okay now this title
also now two Dynamic let's say 10 oh my
goodness let's say 15
20 F yeah make
sense we'll come back to this parameters
later once again we'll see how to use
this parameter in our calculation
there is always a way to spin the balls
correctly so that others can understand
very
easily if you see the
flow if you see the flow you see very
neatly and
clearly we are going through each and
every topic and we can easily connect
them also correct so what we have seen
today so we have seen what is Tabo
public tblo desktop yeah we have seen
the basic sorting and how to sort based
on some other fields and we applied
filters using Dimensions measures and
date filters and we have gone through
interactive filters and we talked about
context filter this context filter is
important during interview they will ask
you and we have seen how to group
Dimensions yeah through using visuals
and another way also and hierarchy we
have seen and we have seen how to name
it yes and we have seen set right we can
create set only on Dimensions not on
measures remember this during interview
they will ask you can we create a set on
measure answer is no you can create set
only on
Dimensions right and we have seen how to
combine two
sets right we have combine two sets to
highlight top 10 and bottom 10 at last
we have seen parameter also parameter is
nothing but user input value we can take
user input value to do further analysis
what if analysis got it now it is time
to save your file remember once again
how you can save this file you guys are
using tblo public that means you cannot
save locally to save it you have to
publish this in
the Tablo server go to file at then end
you will see save table as Okay click on
it and it will ask you to enter the
credentials use your credentials and
