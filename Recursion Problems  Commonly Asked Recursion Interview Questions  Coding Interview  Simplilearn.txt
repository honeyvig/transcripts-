recursion it is one of those topics
which tends to blend with almost every
other category in the programming world
interviewers always ask questions based
on recursion to gauge candidates problem
solving abilities because this topic
pushes the candidate's limit and
differentiate them between good and
exceptional
and on that note i am weber khandelwal
and i welcome you all to simply learns
youtube channel
in this session we will discuss some of
the commonly used recursion problems
asked in the interviews
we shall begin our session with the
first question
we will be calculating sum of the
numbers from 0 to a given number
then we will discuss a recursive
function that returns the factorial of a
given number
after that we will take a glance at a
recursive function that returns the nth
fibonacci number post that we will take
a closer look at a recursive function
that checks if the string is a
palindrome
finally we will discuss recursive
function that can reverse a given string
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
click down the bell icon below so you

youtube channel
so without any further ado let's get
started with our first question
we will calculate the sum of numbers
from 0 to a given number
we will start with creating a function
sum
in function definition we will first
check if the given number is 0
or 1
then we will return the number else we
will return addition of that number with
the recursive sum function
with n minus 1 as an argument
now let's try it in the code editor
we will write a function and
sum
argument and num
we will check
if
num
is equals to 0
or
num
is equals to 1
if yes then we will return
num
else
we will return
num
plus
sum
of
n minus 1.
now
we will write the code for the main
block
we will declare end and comma press
we will call cn
to take the input data
then we will equal res equals to
sum
at
n
then we will print this sum
yes
now let's try and execute this program
we will give argument as 5.
as you can see our function is working
flawlessly
let's get back to our slides
now let's move on to our next question
we will discuss a recursive function to
find the factorial of given number
we will start with creating a function
fact
in function definition we will first
check if the given number is less than
or equal to
1
then we will return 1 else we will
return multiplication of that number
with a recursive fact function call with
n minus 1 as an argument
now let's try that in a correlator we
will start with function and
fact
argument end
and
if
and is less than equals to one
then
we will return
one
else
we will return
and multiplied by recursive function
that
with n minus 1 as argument
now let's write the code for the main
block
so we will declare variables end
and comma rest
will take input
from the
user
now rest is equal to
fact
and
now we will try to print the value of
res
so
factorial
yes
let's try and execute this
we will find the factorial of 5 which is
120
as you can see our function is working
flawlessly it is getting us the value of
factorial 5 which is 120
let's get back to our slides if getting

then we will move on to our next
question
we will discuss a recursive function to
find the nth fibonacci number
we will start with creating a function
fibonacci
in this function's definition we will
first check if the given number is less
than or equal to 1.
then we will return that number
else we will return the sum of recursive
function fibonacci with n minus 1 as an
argument and recursive function
fibonacci
with n minus 2 as an argument
now let's try to do that in the
correlator
let's start by creating a function and
fibo
with argument as
and n
we will first check if n is less than
equals to 1
if yes then we will return
and
otherwise we will return
sum of
recursive function fivo
at n minus one
and the fibonacci function
at n minus 2
let's write code for the main block
we will start with variable
and
n
comma
res
we will call cn function to get user
value for n
then we will store the value of
fibonacci function in res
now we will call print function say out
to print the value of ras
so anet
is fibonacci to res
return
zero
let's try and execute this
we will check the fibonacci number at
ninth position which is 34.
as you can see we are getting the value
as 34 that is our function is working
flawlessly
let's get back to our slides
now we will move forward with our next
question
we will be discussing a recursive
function that can check if a string is
palindrome or not
we will start with creating a boolean
function in is parallel
with an argument as string str
integer low
and integer high
first we will check if the string has at
least one character or not
then we will compare the first character
and the last character
if a mismatch happen then we will return
false otherwise we will move to our next
pair by recalling the recursive function
with incrementing low and decrementing
high by 1.
now let's try this in the code editor
we will start by creating a recursive
function to check if str
from low to high is a palindrome or not
here the low defines the
first index and high defined the last
index
so we will write a boolean function
is
valine
with argument as
string
str
comma
end
low
comma and
high
we will check for star base gas
so if
low is greater than equals to high
then we will return
now we will check
if
the first
character is
equal
to the last character
return false
now we will move to the next pair
so
return
is
parent
with argument as str comma
low
plus 1. comma hi
minus 1
now let's write the code for the main
block
so
we will take string
spr
is equals to
malayalam
now we will check
if
alien
now we will find this length of this
string so int
ln
is equals to
str
dot length
now we will check
if
s palin
from str common zero
to comma
l a n
minus 1
if it is true then it will
give c out
we will print palindrome
rom
else
we will print
not
a palindrome
try and execute this in the code editor
as you can see it is saying that it is a
palindrome which is correct so a
function is working flawlessly let's get
back to our slides
finally we will discuss a recursive
function that can reverse a given string
we will start by with creating a
function reverse with an argument as
string str integer low and integer high
first we will check if the string is
greater than one character or not
if yes then we will swap them
then we will move to our next pair by
calling the recursive function reverse
with incrementing low and decrementing
high by 1.
now let's write this code in the code
editor
we will start with creating a recursive
function but before that
we will include a special library
include
algorithm
now
void
reverse
string
ampersand str
note that we have passed the string as a
reference parameter
low
end
high
now we will check if
low
is less than
high
if yes then we will swap
str
at low
comma
sdr
at high
then we will call the recursive function
reverse
to move to our next pair
str
comma
low plus 1
comma high
minus one
let's write code for the main block
we will write string
str
which is equals to
simply learn
now we will
reverse comma 0
comma
str dot length
minus 1
now
c out
reverse
of the
string str
let's try and execute this
as you can see this function is working
flawlessly as it has reversed the word
simply learn
