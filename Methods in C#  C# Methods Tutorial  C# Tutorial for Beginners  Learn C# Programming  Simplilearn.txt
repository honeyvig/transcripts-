hey everyone i am rabba khandelwal and i
welcome you all to simply learn youtube
channel
today we will talk about one of the
interesting topics methods in c sharp
but before we begin i would like to
remind you that we have dailies updates
on numerous technologies
so if you are a tech geek looking for
the newest technological breakthroughs
then try subscribing to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit the bell
icon so you never miss an update from
simply learn
now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin a session by understanding
what methods are in c sharp
then we will discuss the components of
methods in c sharp
after that we will discuss how to pass
parameters in methods
following that we will try to implement
methods in the code editor
finally we will wind up this session
with a quick summary
now let's get started with what methods
are methods in program a block of code
or statements that allow the user to
reuse code conserving memory time and
most importantly increasing code
readability
this is the basic syntax we first
mentioned the access modifier then
return type method name with some
parameters in the open braces and then
add the method body in the curly braces
now let's have a look at the components
or elements of methods
there are five components of methods in
c sharp
first up access modifier return types
method name parameter list and method
body
let's discuss them in detail
we will start with the access modifier
it specifies the method success type
that is how it can be accessed in your
application
in c sharp there are three types of
access modifiers
first of public
all methods have access to the code
next private in this only the current
method will have access to this
code next up is protected in this it is
only available within the same class or
the hierarchy of that class next up
return type
the data type of a value returned by the
method is specified by the return type
the return type is void if method
returns null
in c sharp the return type can be int
void double string
and so forth next up method name
it indicates the name of the user
defined method that the user invokes for
example factorial which is preceded by
open braces
then method body it refers to the line
of code that describes the duties that
will be executed by the method during
its execution
it is kept in curly braces at last
parameter list
within the open parenthesis a comma
separated list of inputs
parameter is defined preceded by the
data type if there are no parameters
then empty parenthesis must be used
there are three types of parameters
value parameter reference parameter and
output parameter
now let's see how we can pass parameters
in methods in c sharp
c sharp methods can be classified based
on the return type
and input argument first up method
without parameter and without return
type for example this print function
prints
the string void parameters
next up without parameters and with the
return type for example since there are
no parameter in this product function
then we will define variables inside the
method body and return the product value
then we have with parameters and no
return type for example this
circumference function
is using r parameters which then helps
us to calculate the circumference and we
will print it in the method body itself
at last the width parameters and with
return type for instance in this
factorial function we pass the integer
parameter n
then we calculate the factorial n and
then return that value
now let's implement these in the code
editor
let's get started with defining some
variables
so
we will be using
and
rad
which we will give the value as 7
and
n
which we can give value as 4
and a variable get res
now we will start with our first
function that is print function
this will be a void function that is
without any return type and without any
arguments so static void
print
and in the curly braces we will call
console
dot write line
in braces
we can type in
like
welcome
to
simply
learn
now
let's try
to execute this one
so
we will call the print function
now save it and let's run it
as we can see it is printing the welcome
to simply learn
ignore this
warning
it will be resolved when we will use
these variables
now let's get started with the next type
that is without return type and with
parameters so we will have
static
void
circumference
and
are
here we will directly print
console
dot
writeline so circumference
plus
2
multiplied by
in closed braces we have 22
divided by seven that is pi
then
star
r
we'll close it then
we will write a function
so we will call
circumference
with the argument as drag
let's run this
as we can see it is now printing the
circumference is equals to 42.
now let's write up another function
which will have
a return type without parameters
so we have
static
end
product
here we will define
and
as x is equal to 7
comma y is equals to
22
and this
then res
will equal to
x
multiplied by y
then we will return
rest
now
let's store the rest value in get rest
to get
res
is equals to
product
then we will write up
console
dot write line
and then
get rest
let's save this and run it again
as you can see it is giving us 154 which
is 22 multiplied by 7
which the product function should do
now
let's write up another method to
demonstrate with return type and with
parameters
so this time we will be writing up
static
and
factorial
and end
n
so end
f1
is equals to one
for
end
i
is equals to one
i
less than equals to
n
i plus plus
f1
is equal to
f1
multiplied by
i
can return
f1
now
let's
have get res
and we will store
factorial
and
then we will call
console
dot write line
and we will print
get press let's save it and run it
as you can see it is now printing 24 as
well which is a 4 factorial
now let's wind up this session with some
advantages of the method
the method ensures that the program is
well structured
the use of methods improves the
readability of the code
it is also an efficient approach for the
users to reuse the existing code
it also reduces the amount of time it
takes to execute
and the amount of memory it uses
and this was all for today's session
