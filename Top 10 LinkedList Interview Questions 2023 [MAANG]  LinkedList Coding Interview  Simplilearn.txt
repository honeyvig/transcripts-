interview questions to land in your
dream company then you are at the right
place most of the trickiest interview
questions include stack and kills
sometimes you might also face dynamic
memory related questions link list can
be a One-Stop solution for all such
strict data structure questions they
have become essential to crack every
software engineer to get hired by the
top tech companies so please stick till
the end of this video while we give away
answers to that one important
programming question that is the most
frequently Asked in software development
interview hey guys welcome to Simply
learn today we'll be learning the top 10
link list question and answers and while
we are at it please leave us a like if
you find our content helpful and a sub
to the channel would be appreciated so
without further delay let's get started
the top 10th question is
differentiate between three types of a
link list the three types of Link list
are singly link list dou link list and
circular link list in singly link list
the traversal is Possible only in One
Direction whereas in W link list the
travil happens in two ways forward and
backward Direction and each note
consists of data and the address of the
previous and next note whereas in
circular link list the traversal of a
circular singly link list is is until we
raise the same node we started in an
index and in single link list and W link
list the last node is pointing to null
meaning no node ofate in a list whereas
in circular link list the last node in
an index points to the address of the
first node no n is found in the
list in singly link list every node in a
link list connects with the other
through a point variable that holds the
address of the next note a w link list
uses two pointer variables that points
to the address of the previous and next
node a circular link list uses two
pointer variables that points to the
address of the previous and next node
and the last node next will point to the
address of the first node in a
list top ninth question
is write a program to add a note at the
beginning end and specified position in
any link
list so as you can see the screen this
is a program to add a note at the
beginning end and specified position in
a link
list so as you can see the screen here
we have a structure of a
Noe coming to the insertion at beginning
function here we creating a new node and
allocating memory to it using MOG
function and then we are assigning a new
data to a new noes data part and
initially the new nodes next is holding
head that means uh head head is assigned
to the address of new notes
next Now new is head then coming to
insertion at the end so we are going to
insert the node at the end of the link
list so here we creating a new node
allocating memory to it using mlog
function and assigning a value using new
data so new data part is holding new
data and last note is equal to
head so initially it's assigned to head
but if we are checking the condition if
head is equal equal to null that means
head is equal to new return return else
check the condition while last node next
is not equal to null then last node next
is assigned to last node and now last
node next is equal to new then return
then coming to insertion of Noe that
means of the specified node so if
previous node is equal equal to
null then print the given previous node
cannot be null
return that means we are uh inserting a
node at the specified position so if the
previous node is equal equal to null
then the given previous node cannot be
null so for that we are creating a new
node allocating memory and assigning a
data using new news data is equal to new
data and new data new notes next is
holding previous uh previous node next
and now previous node next is equal to
new and this display function will print
all the elements in a link list so when
node is not equal to n then it will
display the node data part and then
assign uh nodes next to node coming to
the main function here we are assigning
values to the node so we are calling the
function insertion at end and passing
the value that is 25 insertion at the
beginning passing value 15 insertion at
the beginning again 10 uh insertion at
the end we are passing 30 and insertion
of to a specified note that is 20 and
then print the link list element so for
that we are calling the display function
so let's run the
program so as you can see the output
here the link list elements are 10 15 20
25 and 30 it has print in an
order the top eighth question
is find the sum of the nodes in a link
list so in this program we are going to
find the sum of the nodes in a link list
so here we have a structure of a node
where we have data variable and a poter
variable next so we have a function
called insertion to insert an element
into the list so we are creating a new
node and we are allocating memory for it
using MOG function and assigning
data so new node data part is holding
the data and new node next is assigned
to head that means now head is holding
the address of the first node so head is
equal to new node and coming to the main
function we have a head which is
initialized to n and initially the sum
is equal to zero so now calling the
insertion function and passing the value
so we are going to insert the value 1 16
26 and 30 that means we are assigning a
value to the nodes and then we are
creating a pointer which is assigned to
the Head while pointer not equal to null
then we are performing certain operation
that is sum is equal to sum plus
Pointer's data so
calculating U that means we are adding
the data of all nodes and then pointers
next is assigned to PTR so that will
calculate all this um data that means
all this uh elements 1 16 26 and 30 and
then it will display as a sum of all
nodes so let's execute
it so as you can see the sum of nodes is
equal to
73 the top seventh question
is Implement a c program to reverse the
elements of a singly link
list so in this program we are going to
reverse the elements in a single link
list so as you can see see the screen
here we have a structure of a note where
we have a data and a pointer pointing to
the
next we have a reverse function so we
have reverse function to reverse the
data so coming here we are creating a
previous which is initially initialized
to null and then we have a temporary
variable that is assigned to head and
the next is equal to n
so while let's make this
temp so while temp is not equal to
null then it will execute this statement
that is the statements are used to
reverse the elements that means the list
of elements that we are given here will
be
reversed so for that we are performing
this operation that is the temp whatever
is there in the temp nodes next is given
to the next variable and whatever is
there in the previous is given to temps
next and what's there in the temp is
given to previous and finally uh the
temp is equal to next that means
whatever is there in the next is
assigned to
Temp and now head is equal to previous
coming to the insert Noe we are going to
create a new node uh then assigning a
value using data so new node new noes
data is holding the data and the next is
assigned to
head then that means um the first uh the
head is holding the address of the first
note that is new no address and then the
head is equal to new note and then
coming to the display function this will
display all the list of elements that is
we are using temp variable that is equal
to head that means assigned to head
while temp is not equal to none print
the data so uh it will print the
data uh so what data it's like temporary
next whatever is there in the temp data
it will print all the data all the nose
data and then temp next is assigned to
Temp then coming to the main function
here the head is initially assigned to
null and we are calling the insert node
to insert the values that that is 10 20
30 and 40 so it will print the given
link list is and calling the display
function so it will display all these
elements and then calling the reverse
function to reverse this element and
then again calling the display function
to display it back so let's try to
execute
so as you can see here we have the list
of data that is 40 30 20 10 and the and
the reverse data is 10 20 30 and
40 the code that I'm executing in this
session and the question and answers we
are discussing will be attached in the
description box below so you can have a
look at it and execute the code for a
better understanding and if you face any
issues while executing the programs then
please let us know in the comment
section below and our team of experts
will be happy to resolve all your
quiries are the
earliest top sixth question
is write a program to count the number
of nodes in a link
list so in this program we are going to
count the number of nodes in a link list
so here we have a structure of a note
where we have again same data and the
variable or a poter to the
next then coming to the insertion
function this is to insert element for
that we are creating a new node and
allocating memory then assigning a data
and the new next is holding head that
means head is equal to new node head is
holding the address of the new node and
coming to the display function here we
are going to display the what uh the
count the node count so here we have a
new node which is assigned to head and
initially the Noe count is equal to zero
while new Noe is not not equal to null
that means new note next is assigned to
new note and every time it is printed it
will increment note count by one so we
are using node count Plus+ that means it
will increment um node by one so then it
will display the total number of nodes
in a link list so coming to the main
function here we have head which is
assigned to null and calling the
insertion function passing the value 10
20 and 30 so now now we have uh the
values 10 20 and 30 and calling the
display function to display the number
of counts sorry number of noes in in a
link list so let's execute
it so as you can see the total number of
nodes in a link list are three because
here uh here we have given three values
to three not so let's try to add one
more so let's run it
so as you can see now the total number
of notes in A Link list are
four while we are already discussing
some interview questions let us know the
trickiest ones you faced in your
interviews in the comments below let's
see if anyone responds with the right
answers to your questions could be
helpful for all the viewers with some
extra questions to
learn top fifth question is
Implement a program to merge two sorted
link list from their
end so now let's understand the program
to merge two sorted link list from their
end so as you can see here again same we
have a structure of a node and we are
creating a pointer variable that is next
and then we have a display function so
this will display the
elements so here we are creating a
pointer variable PTR which is assigned
to head while PTR it will print the
data and then pointers next is assigned
to PTR then coming to insert we are
going to insert the element into the
list so for that we are creating a new
node and allocating memory for it after
allocating memory we are assigning a
data for new notes data part and the new
node next is holding head that means now
the head is equal to new node head is
holding the address of the new new note
then coming to the move
function so here we have PTR and head
well if head is equal equal to none then
return is what we are going to do here
is creating a new node which is assigned
to head and then head is equal assigned
to Heads next and pointer is assigned to
new notes next and PTR is assigned to
new note so this function here we are
going to move the link list so
this function uh these are the
statements that we are going to perform
and then coming to the reverse we are
going to reverse to uh two set of Link
list so the first link set of Link list
is first and the second is second so
while first and second initially result
is equal to null if First Data is lesser
than second data then call move else
move function and pass the first set of
data else call move and pass the second
set of data
while second then again we are calling
the move
function and and result uh that is we
are um passing the reference result and
second while first then we are calling
the move and passing the first set of
Link list then it will print the result
so this is basically to reverse the link
list so we are reversing the uh first
set of as well as
second and then coming to the main
function here we have a first set of um
link list that is first set assigned to
null and whereas second set is also
assigned to null so for I equal to 6 to
I greater than 0 that means from i0 to 6
I is equal to IUS 2 that means it going
to it's going to print the even numbers
from 0 to 6 calling the insert to insert
the elements then so passing the first
this that means this is the first set of
Link list and this is the second set of
Link list where I is equal to 9 I
greater or equal to 1 then I is equal to
IUS 2 that means from 1 to 9 it going it
going to print the odd numbers so we are
calling the insert function and passing
the second set of that means this is the
second set of um
elements then print first list of
elements so display first so this will
display the first set of Link list and
then again print the second list of
elements calling the display function to
uh display the second set of Link list
then calling the reverse function to
reverse first as well as second so after
merging the link list so now um this is
going to merge to link list so then
after merging again we are calling the
display function to display so let's try
to execute
it so as you can see the first list of
elements were 2 4 6 and the second set
of list is 1 3 5 7 and 9 so it going to
merge this two link list from their end
so this is the sorted uh link list so
here we have 9 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 so this is
going to sort the elements and then
merge from there
in the top fourth question
is write a program to delete a note at
the beginning end and specified node in
any link
list so as we have previously discussed
on how to insert the nodes now let's
understand on how to delete the node
from a
list so as you can see here we have a
delete function that means to delete a
Noe so we have last and key note as an
argument that we have passed and if last
is equal equal to null that means
written that means there are no nodes in
a list so and this function is to delete
a note at the end so if last last data
is equal to key node and the last next
is equal to last then free the
last and we are assigning the last equal
to none and then it will return then we
creating a temporary variable which is
assigned to last and then we have a
delete node a pointer to delete
node so if last data is equal to the key
Noe while temp next is not equal to last
then whatever is that the temp notes
next is assigned to Temp and the last
note next is assigned to Temp next and
free the last so once you free the
memory of a last node then assign the
last next that means the temp next is
assigned to the
last while temp next is not equal to
last and temp next data is not equal to
the key node then whatever is there in
the temp next is assigned to Temp so if
temp next data is equal to the key Noe
and the temp next is um is assigned to
the delete note now the delete note next
is assigned to Temp next and then we are
going to free the memory for the note to
be deleted now calling the display
function to display the list so if
creating a pointer variable and if the
head is equal to
null if head is equal to null that means
the list is
empty then we are assigning pointer is
equal to Heads next so do that means
this will print that is uh it will print
the notes data uh so once it prints the
First Data again it will um the pointers
next is assigned to the PDM then we
print all the uh notes data and then
checks the condition while PTR not equal
to HS next coming to the main function
as we have already seen how to insert so
the elements that we inserting is 30 40
10 20 and 10 sorry it is like 10 20 30
and 40 and print the link list elements
so we are calling the display function
to print the elements
and after deletion the link list
elements are so which element we are
deleting that is 10 so delete node we
are calling the delete node to delete
the element 10 then again we are
displaying calling the display function
to display the elements so let's execute
it so as you can see the link list
elements were 10 20 30 and 40 so after
deletion the link list elements are 20
30 and 40 that means we have deleted 10
successfully top third question
is write a program to remove duplicate
elements from the sorted link
list so here basically we have the
elements these are the sorted elements
that is u 10 20 30 40 and 50 and also we
have a duplicate elements that means
duplicate nodes so basically we are
going to delete this so we are going to
delete this 10 then 30 and extra 40 so
for that uh we have a structure of a Noe
and then we have a display function so
in display function we are going to
display the uh
data so for that we have a pointer which
is assigned to head while pointer it
will print the data of all the no
and we are um assigned pointers next to
PD then coming to insert function this
is to insert the elements or the note so
creating a new note and allocating
memory for it and then assigning a data
and new notes next will be head that
means um the new node address head is
holding the address of the new new node
and then we have a remove duplicate
function so this function is basically
going to remove this extra or the dup at
10 30 and
40 so in this function it checks if head
is equal equal to null return that means
there are no nodes then creating a
pointer which is initialized to head so
while pointer next is not equal to none
then we are going to perform this so if
check the condition if pointer data is
equal to pointer pointer nodes next data
that means if this and this is equal to
uh if this and this element is is same
so suppose this is the
pointer and this is the pointer
next so this is what your pointer next
data so if those both are
same then we are assigning pointers next
next to next next and then free the
space or the memory for the pointers
next and next next is assigned to
pointers next else we are assigning
pointer next to the PTR and coming to
the main function here we have I and the
elements that um list of elements that
is 10 20 30 40 and 50 and we have extra
or the duplicate elements as well and we
have n which is assigned to size of
elements divide by size of elements
starting from the index
zero and initially head is assigned to
null and for I equal to n minus 1 I
greater than equal to Z we are inserting
the elements and then decrementing I by
minus
one we are calling the remove duplicate
function to remove the duplicates and
then again display the uh list so let's
execute
it so as you can see here they have we
have removed all the duplicates that is
we had extra 10 30 and 40 so now um the
duplicates are removed so now the list
is 10 20 30 40 50 and the last is
none top second question is
Implement a program to rotate a link
list so in this program we are going to
rotate the list so for that we have a
rotate list function so here we have a
variable called P if p is equal equal to
zero then return so p is nothing but the
list if the link list is empty then it
will return so let's consider the below
example that is we have a list called 1
2 3 4 and five so if p is equal to 4 so
that means PTR is assigned to head first
so current will either point to the p pa
or null so if initially the count is
equal to one while count is lesser to p
and the pointer is not equal to null
then we are assigning pointers next to
PTM and we are incrementing the count by
one so that means the current will point
to the node four in the above example
that means um this now the current that
is PTR is is pointing to the
fourth and if PTR is equal to null then
it will return else now again the
current points to K node that means uh
here we have the P so the current points
to P not store it in a variable so
whatever is there the four here in this
example it is four so this four will be
stored
in here it will store in the variable
this one P
note now the P points to the note 40 in
the above example so now here while
pointers next is not equal to null then
assign pointers next to PTR and now
pointers next is equal to head that
means head is holding the address of the
poins next and now uh P node next is
holding head and again the P node next
is assigned to null that means we are
keeping the four as it is and rotating
that means rotating in the sense
now this three elements will come this
side and this so it's kind of a it's not
a reverse but it's just a
rotating so coming to the insert
function here we are going to create a
new note uh and then assigning a value
and first notes uh address will be uh
holding head will be holding the address
of the first uh new notes next and now
head is assigned to new note and now
this function is to print the element
so while node is not equal to none then
only it will print the all the data of a
node no nodes data and now nodes next is
assigned to note and coming to the main
function here head is assigned to null
so for I is equal to 6 I greater or
equal to Z that means from 0 to 6 uh we
are inserting values that means uh
inserting the node so print given link
list so whatever is given first it will
display then after rotating
now PTR is pointing to four so after
rotating the list again we are going
to display the list of elements so let's
execute
it so as you can see here the given link
list is one 2 3 4 5 and 6 so after
rotating it is 5 6 1 2 3 and
4 our first question
is Implement a stack using any link list
so in this program here we have a
structure of a node and in the top is
assigned to null and push item that this
function is used to push the items into
the stack so using link list we are uh
implementing a stack so here creating a
new note and allocating memory for it
and then assigning a value to a new
notes data part so if the top is equal
to null the new note next equal to null
else the new noes next is equal to top
so now the new node is top so if it is
uh the top is equal to new node then
item is pushed successfully that means
inserted and pop item this uh function
is to delete the item from a stack so if
top is equal equal to none that means
stack is empty else uh we have a
temporary variable which is assigned to
top so it will delete the top item from
a stack so temp next is assigned to top
and we are going to free the memory for
a temporary variable and then printing
the element that means printing the
items in a stack so if top is equal
equal to null that means the stack is
empty else uh here we have a stuck node
temp that means we creating a temporary
variable which is assigned to top and
while temp next is not equal to null uh
then it will print the data of a temps
data that means it will print uh the
items in a
stack so a temp next is assigned to Temp
and then again it will print all the
data so coming to the main function here
we are having a choice and then item
while one using while condition uh it's
asking options that is push pop display
and exit so first asking enter your
choice so if you enter the choice the in
case one we are going to insert the item
into the stack uh so we are calling the
push uh function that is push item
function and then in the case two if you
um select the option two then we are
going to call the function pop item if
it is third then print item if it's
Fourth then it is exit by default if you
if you enter anything apart from 1 2 3
and four then it's going to print wrong
choice so please try again with
different
choice so let's try to execute it
so first let's enter the choice one and
enter the value to be inserted that is
10 again let's enter one and value 20
now let's uh display so now the uh
inserted on 20 and 10 so to delete let's
enter Choice 2 so that means whatever
was at the top is deleted successfully
so top was 20 so now 20 is deleted
successfully so now let's display three
so as you can see now only 10 is in the
list or in the
stack so here I have one question for
you guys and the question is Implement a
program to check whether the list is
palum please try to find out the answer
and let us know the solution for this
question in the comment section below so
