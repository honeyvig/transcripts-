hello everyone
and welcome to this session on modules
in python
today we are going to discuss this topic
which is very important topic in python
which helps you in reusability of code
and you don't need to rewrite the code
again and again
so we will see what are the nitty
gritties in writing modules in python
now what's in it for us today
we are going to discuss what are python
modules
why do we need to use them what are the
different types of python modules
and how differently in different ways we
can import these modules in our code
now a python module is nothing but a
simple python file with dot py extension
including the statements and the
definitions
so basically you need to prepare a
module file with all the functions which
you want to import into your
regular python code across all the
modules
now it contains codes that you can reuse
in several programs so it's like saying
you write once a piece of code like
common utility methods calculation
methods rounding off addition
subtractions or some common business
rules which can be reused across your
project then you keep it at one place
now this helps in
such a scenario where you have a large
team different set of developers are
working on different different modules
different specifications but one single
utility module file dot py file will
contains all the common and reusable
functions which not each and every
individual developer can will go and
change it's only few set of
administrators or the senior developers
can maintain and pass it on to the team
now
for example a file containing python
code demo dot py
is will be called as a module and its
module name would be demo
so you need to take care that whatever
the name of the file is that is what
will get imported in your
python code so we will see that with
their certain examples on our jupyter
notebook
now why do we need to use as i have
reiterated it provides flexibility to
organize the code in a logical way
and it enables reusability which is the
most important factor so one of course
you can organize the code you keep the
reusable code at one place or you can
keep a modular approach and also
reusable so no not all the developers
have to go and rewrite that code and it
is easy to maintain
and helps in debugging the code easily
so if you know that there is an error
coming there is an issue coming uh in
one of the modules which is imported or
which is the grind lying in the common
file then it becomes easy to debug you
just have to go and check that
particular function you don't need to go
and check in each and every piece of
code
now there are two types of python
modules definitely there are built-in
modules which python library provides
which you don't need to import
explicitly
but there are certain user defined
modules which you create on yourself for
your own custom development for your own
custom programming
so built-in modules are predefined
modules and are part of this python
standard library for example random date
time sys so we will take a look at these
examples also
and of course the user defined modules
which is the primary objective of this
session where we're going to show you
how do you create your own defined
modules and then import them
so the user creates the user-defined
modules to ease complex tasks in a
project so you program the complex piece
of the code in a common module and give
it to everyone
you can define your own functions and
classes
now what are the different ways there
are
five different ways you can import
modules so you can just say import
module name and all the
uh classes and functions within that
module will get imported
you can give an alias so basically
giving an alias makes it simple
and you can refer that alias throughout
your code
then
if you want to import anything specific
from the entire module you don't want to
import
all the functions and classes then you
can just import the specific functions
and classes and give their name then
fourth is from module you want to import
any address as an alias you can import
and give an alias to the specific
function name or the class name
and then of course similar to the first
syntax you can module all everything so
first and the last syntax are almost
having the same meaning to module to
import everything in your module okay so
with this background uh
let's first
take a look at the
python file so we have what we have done
is we have created a
module calculations dot py so just
please
focus on the part where
the name of the file is calculations
and in this
python file dot py file we have created
a couple of functions uh and the
relevant logic related to those
functions
so very simple functions like addition
add you pass two variables and you send
the result
add the variables and send it back
basically we are overriding uh the
python internal operator add in our
python module and we will be invoking
this one so we'll show you how to invoke
then you will have i have written
multiplication
division
remainder so you do you pass two
variables divide them and find the
remainder
then now a custom function where i am
adding 10 to both the variables which
are being passed to this function and
returning the result
then there is a function which checks
whether the number is a prime and if it
is not a prime number you will get this
output and if it is you will get a is a
prime number
okay
and then another function which says
check anagram
so we will just sort the two strings
which we will send and check uh both are
equal or not if both are equal then the
strings are anagrams otherwise they are
not
so these are the set of functions which
you have written now we will see how
will we use them in our code
now first syntax which i am writing is
import calculations so this is the name
of my dot py file which is residing in
the same folder where i am writing this
piece of code
and now
if you see in my
dot py i have a variable y whose value
is six so i'm just
using that value and running it and
printing it i'm just gonna
uh show you how explicitly i'm invoking
the functions
in the calculations class in the
calculations dot p by five okay
now
let's invoke
another function remainder passing 140
and then i should get 20 as an
output
okay
so this has gone back and executed this
particular function
now what i'm going to do is
another example of my addition i'm
saying calculations.add
i'm going to initialize and pass two
variables
and my expected output is 35
okay
so it has gone and executed
this function
now i'm gonna show you another syntax of
importing so from calculations i'm just
importing the add function
so i'll
ask for user input to enter for one and
two numbers and then i'm just going to
add it
two and five so i got my output is seven
now
the difference to be noted over here is
that in the previous
uh syntax i was making a call like
calculations.add
but now i don't need to make a
calculations dot add syntax
uh invocation i just need to say import
add
and i just need to use the add function
that's all
now
let's use another
syntax to import
modules so i'm using import calculations
as cal so all the modules are imported
but the alias uses
cal and
similarly like the previous example i am
going to take two inputs
and print the sum
now the difference in this syntax in
this syntax is i'm using the alias cal
dot add
but my output should be same
okay
similarly i can call
prime
whether it's not a prime or prime number
i can call the check anagram using the
same alias
and i can call the
remainder function
okay
so i hope you have
noticed that the difference
in importing the way of importing the
module makes a lot of difference right
now let's take another example of
importing some functions or variables
so i'm gonna explicitly i'm importing my
variable y and functions multi-prime and
check anagram explicitly
and
i'm gonna print
y
okay
and i'm gonna multiply
two numbers
so if you see i'm using these aliases
over here
okay i'm using these variables directly
as i've already imported
now i'm going to say prime9
now it's printing none if you see it's
because of the statements which are not
executed right so that's why you are
seeing
now let's check anagram
and now
another thing to be noted is i'm trying
to invoke a function remainder which i
have not imported over here so let's see
how what error python throws okay so
yeah so python has throws an error that
name remind remainder is not defined
because i have not imported it over here
so now
in order to import reminder what i am
now
doing different is importing all the
functions
now if i use reminder
it should run
okay
i am using divide
okay cool
now
i am going to show you another function
which is a utility function
directory function
which will show me
all the functions
variables as part of the
python file add at 10 check anagram
divide
multi prime remainder y and of course
these are some inbuilt packages
uh which are already there in the python
file as part of the python loader but
these are the ones which i have created
so you can actually see the list of all
those
functions in one go
okay
now i'm going to show you an example of
inbuilt
modules so this import math math is an
inbuilt module of python
and i'm gonna show you
how you can see all the relevant
functions within the math module all
these are the math module
functions which are available for you
to use i'm going to show you one or two
so like
print math 2 to the power 8
and you get the answer 256
print math remainder so i'm not invoking
my
module function and invoking the math
inbuilt
library function remainder
and the remainder is 0 40 divided by 2
remainder is 0
and square root of 81
9
then
very important another very interesting
utilities of date time which you can use
and you can print today's date and time
then another
utility is random utility
and
i am going to create a list l1
and
write a piece of code
which will choose a random element from
this list
and
just print it
okay so if first time it has chosen oppo
again if i run it it will choose one
plus if i again run it it might choose
something else so it will randomly pick
okay
okay so with this we have seen that you
can create your own utility functions
import it write it in a piece of code
dot py file import it in your code as an
alias or all the modules and
use them or you can use the python
inbuilt
uh modules right i hope you all guys had
a great learning session and i look
forward to connecting with you next time
