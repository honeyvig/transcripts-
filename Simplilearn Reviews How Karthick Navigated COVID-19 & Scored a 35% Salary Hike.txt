I the very first graduate of my
family I come from a line of Carpenters
and my father was one
to my father used to always teach me the
value of hard work he used to always say
me
that my hard work paid off and I got a
new job with 35% of hike by completing
this CSM certification with simply learn
hey hi myself Karthik jaal I'm a quality
analyst and and this is my
[Music]
journey I don't know when he actually
believed me that I'll be able to cope up
with my studies until 10th he never
talked about my uh education or how I am
with anyone after my 10th certification
and I was topper of my school and then
he realized that maybe I can cope up
with the studies my mother was the one
who was actually uh looking at my
progress in studies she was actually
supporting me a
[Music]
lot so every interview that I give and I
come back to home uh my mom us to see my
faces and see that okay it's positive or
negative she'll realize that so it's
always there and she'll just ask me to
go out spend some time with your friends
and come back uh because she know that
how how difficult I am actually with
with no job because all of my friends
have got the job we are of some 10 to 12
members and all have got played and they
are already in their like mode and I was
like giving up back to back interviews
and even my mom was actually asking
after some time like why you not getting
the job but she used to support me every
time when I'm coming back I got my first
job the first happiness I saw in my
mom's face like she was like yes my
prayers paid a lot so I started as a
test engineer in T Harris and followed
by I started working in mic technologist
as a automation engineer and currently
I'm playing a role as assistant manager
in Sol so what I've realized is that I'm
doing something but what I'm doing is
right or what so or I'm missing anything
that I can still do but I I I doesn't
know actual responsibilities of that uh
particular position that I'm playing
that is the first call to take up a
course to to learn something in a
process diving there where I realized
that I need some certified courses
professional courses that could help me
that how I can facilitate myself to put
my effort into some the project that I'm
playing around so it's a saranan the
project manager that we had in a current
organization he actually talked about
this with me because he has taken up
courses with CSM I mean simply itself so
he told me that uh you can just uh
browse this site and get to know what
they're actually what courses they are
rendering and he actually talked about
the CSM course with me uh it was not at
all a regular classes that I had it was
a 5day session I remember so it was a
great experience it was not a normal
classroom session it was a lot of
interactive sessions we had a lot of use
cases to uh decide and put our efforts
into it so it was great uh doing courses
with simply we had an agreement
initially Monday to Friday is completely
yours I'll never disturb you on those
days but Saturday Sunday it it should be
completely mine so we used to plan for
outings initial stages yeah we had more
of these outings and all he suddenly
came and told me that he's going to take
up a course I I never agreed as he told
I never agreed when he in that
certification process he used to
completely be very interactive I have
never seen anyone so interactive in a
certification course I had a doubt are
you really taking up this certificate
course or you're just chitchatting no he
was like this is very interactive on
once he was done with this course and he
landed up on another job I was really
happy with it he has done something uh
wor so previously uh I was playing as a
sd3 so we call it as software
development engineering test three so
it's a senior role that I was playing so
from that I got into an assistant
manager role so leading a team of nine
so that was something like a senior
position to a manager role so the
composition that I was getting is around
35% from the current uh pay that I got
always see people who were around you as
great only then you learn things
