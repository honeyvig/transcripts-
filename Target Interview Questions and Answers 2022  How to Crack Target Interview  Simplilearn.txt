components such as libraries frameworks
and other software modules almost always
run with full privileges
if a vulnerable component is exploited
such an attack can facilitate serious
data loss or server takeover
applications using components with known
vulnerabilities may undermine
application defenses and enable a range
of possible attacks and impacts
different open source and commercial
tools have emerged over the years to
tackle this problem
node security project or nsp
the nsp is known for its work on node.js
modules and npm dependencies it also
provides tools that scan for
dependencies and find vulnerabilities
using public vulnerability databases
such as the nist national vulnerability
database or nvd as well as its own
database which it builds from the scans
it does on npm modules
retire.js
retire.js is an open source javascript
specific dependency checker the project
is primarily focused on ease of use
that's why it has multiple components
including a command line scanner and
plugins for grunt gulp chrome firefox

msi which means it's covering the
javascript.net c-sharp and java
ecosystems
