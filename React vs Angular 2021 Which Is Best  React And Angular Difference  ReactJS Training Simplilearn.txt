hey everyone welcome to this session
today's topic is react versus angular
so what's in it for you
we'll first get familiar with both the
programming languages by going through a
quick introduction
then we will compare react and angular
focusing on their performance
after that we will discuss the learning
curve for learning both of these
frameworks
we'll also get to know about the
adoption of these frameworks and their
application in the field of web
development
after that we'll compare the community
support available for each framework
then we will dive into the industry
trends and job prospects
and in the end i'm going to tell you
which technology to choose but i will
give you enough food for thought for you
to choose the technology that suits you
and your project best
so let me first give you an introduction
to react
now react is javascript library for ui
development it is managed by facebook
and has an open source community of
developers
the framework was introduced in may 2013
it is currently one of the most popular
front-end libraries for web development
moving on to angular angular is an open
source javascript framework for web
development and mobile development it is
typescript based and is managed by
google's angular team and the angular
developer community
launched in september 2016 angular also
known as angular 2.0 is a complete
rewrite of angularjs which was
introduced in 2010 it competes directly
with react front-end library
moving on let's go ahead and compare the
performance
now react's performance is greatly
improved with the introduction of the
virtual dom and is generally better than
that of angular
the act uses the concept of virtual dom
that puts less load on the browser react
was released with the usb of being
faster than other frameworks available
furthermore since the data binding
process is unidirectional bindings are
not assigned watchers as in the case of
angular when it comes to angular it
performs worse especially in complex and
dynamic applications
the performance of angular apps is
negatively affected by bi-directional
data binding
angular uses traditional dom that
updates the whole web page even if a
single element is changed
however the most recent update of
angular has greatly improved its
performance and it does not lose to
react anymore
so moving ahead let me give you a brief
insight into the learning curve
react is a library and not a framework
it is quite simple to understand if
you're familiar with javascript
however it takes time to learn how to
set up a project properly so you need to
learn the redux library which is used in
more than half of react applications for
state management
react depends on other libraries to add
functionality constant framework updates
also require additional effort from the
developer when it comes to angular it is
a full-fledged mvc framework
although typescript closely resembles
javascript it also takes some time to
learn
now angular is more complex to
understand some complicated features are
embedded into the framework core which
means that the developer cannot avoid
learning and using them
angular itself is a huge library so
initial learning effort is worth it
since you probably won't have to learn
other libraries like react moving ahead
let's look at the community support
react framework is one of the most
popular javascript frameworks worldwide
it has larger community support and you
may face a lack of documentation at
times the community support makes up for
the lack and documentation
when it comes to angular even though
angular was released before its adoption
is lesser when compared to react
comparatively it has a smaller community
support
documentation is on point and definitely
better in the case of angular
also the community support has improved
over the few years
moving on let's look at adoption and
application
react was released in may 2013. react is
more popularly adopted by developers due
to its simplicity
it is actively used by companies like
facebook twitter netflix airbnb and many
others now here new york times is one of
the many popular websites built using
react
every new section acts as a separate
component so if any one of the component
updates the entire web page doesn't have
to reload making the web app feel much
faster and smoother
this is just to give you a brief example
when it comes to angular it was released
in october 2010. even though it is
improved now developers used to ignore
angular due to its complexity at the
time of its release
angular is used by google apple nike
mcdonald's and other companies
now gmail is one of the many popular
websites built using angular only the
initial loading takes time but after
that everything is so smooth because it
is pre-loaded onto the web browser
so moving on let's look at the industry
trends
first up is the market trends
now let's have a look at the google
trends chart that shows the search
popularity of react and angular in the
last five years we can clearly make out
that react's popularity is increasing
over time while angular's popularity is
more of a straight line
moving on to job trends a react
developer's average salary in the united
states is around 91 000 us dollars per
annum in india the average salary of a
reactive lopper is around 7.35 lakhs per
annum
when it comes to angular
an average salary of an angular
developer in the us is around 73 000 us
dollars
when it comes to india the average
salary is around 4.88 lakhs per annum
so in conclusion angular is a
full-fledged mobile and web development
framework react is a library only for ui
development which can be turned into a
full-fledged solution with the help of
additional libraries
react seems simpler at first sight and
it takes lesser time to start working on
a react project however that simplicity
as the main advantage of react is
neutralized because you have to learn to
work with additional frameworks and
tools angular itself is more complex and
takes quite some time to master
yet it is a powerful tool that offers a
holistic web development experience and
once you learn how to work with it you
reap the fruits
now there is no better framework both
are updated continuously to keep up with
the competitor for instance while react
was believed to win because of its
virtual dom angular equaled the score by
implementing change detection in the end
angular vs react is all a matter of
personal preference a matter of skills
and habits
as a beginner in programming you would
probably benefit more from starting with
angular as an experienced developer you
just keep working with what you know
better so with that i'd like to end this
session i hope you liked it do you think
we missed out on anything important let
us know in the chat section below thank
you so much for watching and thank you
