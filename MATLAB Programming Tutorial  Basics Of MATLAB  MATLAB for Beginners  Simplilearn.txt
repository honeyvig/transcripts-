agenda for today's session is
try catch statement in Matlab arrays in
Matlab at last we'll see some of the
basic programs in Matlab let's begin the
session by understanding environmental
programming we have already learned
about the graphical user interface of
Matlab in our Matlab tutorial video now
let's see some of the shortcuts in
Matlab the first one is CNC may use CLC
to clear the command window the second
one is clear use to remove all the
workspace and the variables created in
workspace and the third one is dial here
a copy of the input and the most of the
output typed in the command window will
be enclosed in the diary file along with
this we have Diary of it suspends the
input into our diary file under diary on
which resumes the input file and the
fourth one is which it will tell which
versions of file is being executed and
where it is located now let's see
control statements in Matlab basically
we have five types of control statement
and the first one is a friend statement
the if is a control statement that
provides the functionality to select the
block of code to execute at Trend type
the syntax of if and statement is as
follows the predefined if condition is
checked first and the if condition is
true it executes a statement inside the
if statement if the condition is false
it will move to the next statement and
the second one is if else statement here
the first if condition is checked and
the if that condition is true the
statement inside the if will be executed
if the condition is false then the else
statement are executed and the third one
is if else if
the ineffensive first the if condition
will be checked and if this condition is
true the statement inside the if will be
executed if else then it will check the
condition in if else statement if that
condition is true then it will execute
the statement inside the if else
condition if both if and if else
conditions are false then it will
execute the else statement and the
fourth one is nested if else statement
the nested if else statement is the
combination of multiple if statements
first it will check the condition of the
first if statement if it is true it will
execute the statement inside that
condition if not it will go for the next
if expression and then it will execute
the statement if it is true like that it
will con check the condition of all the
if statement and if any one of is true
it will execute the statement inside
that or else it will execute the
statement in the else condition and the
last one is Matlab switch
in switch we have a switch expression if
the switch expression matches any of the
case expression it will execute the
statement inside the case expression if
not it will execute the default
statement present in the otherwise
expression now let's see the examples
for control statements in the Matlab
platform first let us consider the if
statement let's take a small simple
example for its if statement that is a
is equal to 5 if a is less than 10 then
it will print the number is less than 10
else it will print the number is less
than 10 minutes executed a is equal to 5
the number is less than 10. now we don't
want this a to be printed
for that we can just mention a semicolon
after 5.
now the answer is printed the number is
less than 10.
you can also do this using script you
can take a new script you can type here
a is equal to 5.
it is
we use this to display text
in the quotes
right
number is
then
then press enter
else
thank you
and quote
another device
large
and
just
now when you press on run
we have to just save the file and so it
has to save and again see in the comment
prompt you can see the number is less
than 10 you can see the output in the
number is less than 10 and a is printing
and this is the filing you don't want to
again run
file name the number is less than 10. if
you give the input number as 12
and then run
file name the num is accident like this
you can do it in the comment window or
else you can also do it using an script
or creating a new script now we came to
know how if and if else will work when
the value of a is less than this
condition that is 5 and if we run the
program
condition is a is less than 10 then the
Phi is less than 10 the condition is
true then it will display the number is
less than 10. when the value is more
than the condition like here the value
of a is 12 and if we run the program now
the if condition fails so the else
statement that is the number is less
than 10 will be executed like this the
if and the if else statement will work
now let's see how else if statement will
work
now let's take one more script and let's
consider a sample example for health if
statement
in that example we have n is equal to a
random number of integers from 100 to 1.
it will generate a random number that is
an integer type and it will be a between
1 to 100 and we are taking a variable H
which is equal to 23 now if the value of
n is greater than the age then it will
display I am else if the value of n is
less than the H then it will print your
anger if the both the conditions are
false then it will print we are of same
now let's see what will be doubt
because before executing let us save the
file
you can see the random number generated
is 30. so it's printing your anger
because 13 is less than the age number
that is 23 let us run one more
see now the random number generator is
92 when 92 is greater than 23 it's
printing I am younger like this the IFL
statement will work if the first
condition is satisfied then it will
print the statement inside that
Foundation or else it will check for the
else if condition again if it is third
true then it will print the answer if
the both conditions are false then it
will print the L statement now let us
understand how the matlabs which will
work I have taken one more script and
let's take an example of a switch
statement here N is a variable which has
a input keyword input keyword is used to
take the input from the user or a
keyboard here we have printed as end
error number the switch statement is
here if the user if the number given by
a user is equal to the any of the case
statement it will print the statement
and incented case condition otherwise it
will bring the default statement
now let's see by running this program
now see the program name is printed now
that it's asking for entire number and
enter as what and press enter
it is a positive one C the number
entered by the user is 1 then it will
check for the first case if the number
matches it will execute the number does
not matches then it will go for the next
condition as the entered number is 1 it
checked for K 0 does not match and the
last case 1 is matched and will print
the number as a positive number what if
it does not give any of these numbers
and if we give other numbers what will
happen let's see
the entered number does not match any of
the case conditions so it will display
the default statement that is other
values like this switch statement in
Matlab box we'll see Matlab looping
statement a looping statement allows you
to execute a statement or a group of
statement multiple steps generally there
are two types of looping State the first
one is a form a for Loop is used to
repeat a statement or a group of
statement at a fixed number of times and
the second one is a while loop a while
loop is used to execute a statement or a
group of statement an infinite number of
times until the condition specified by a
while is false now let's see some of the
examples in this along with the break
and the continue statement start with
the Looting statement let me clear all
the scripts
and Let Me Clear My
as we know for Loop is used to repeat
the statement in a fixed number of times
let us understand or look an example
let's take in script I'll take for a
variable called a
is equal to number from 10 to
20 yes
printf
sorry
creative inside the bracket within
single quotes
I will write
the value of a
is
move the single
code and mention the variable
and end with a semicolon and I will
write and at the last now let's run the
program
save the file
and run
we can say the file name is printed and
the value from 10 to 20 is printed the
for Loop condition is H would print a
value starting from 10 till 20. first
the a value will be 10 it will print
again it will come it will go to next 11
print 12 print until it will print the
value it will reach 20. now let's see
how while loop will work let's take a
new script and we I am taking in
variable again a it will be assigned or
10 and then
while
condition
a is less than 20
should
think Loop value
of
I am using the same condition but in a
while loop and we'll mention the
variable and close the semicolon
and then I'll increment a that is a is
equal to a plus 1 I don't want that
value to be printed so I will both times
I will call it and at last
and
with the loop
now just run the program
save it
and run
C
file name is printed the value of a is
10 and we'll start the value of a is 10
is 10 is less than 20 years it will
print the value and it will implement it
as a is equal to a plus 1 it will become
11 now it will again check for the
condition is 11 is less than 20 yes it
will bring the value like that it will
con continue until it will get 21 if 21
is less than 20 no it's not the
condition is false then it will end the
loop if you don't want other 10 to be
printed like I'll just mention a
semicolon here
and if you want this to be printed like
if you do you want to know what time it
is it is incrementing then it will
remove the semicolon and it will run
this again see for every iteration we
will come to know first the value of a
is 10 then it was incremented as 11 it
is printed 12 printed 13 14 15 16 17 18
and 90 and the value of 19 is printed
and when the value
a is equal to 20 20 is not less than 20
if we have mentioned equal then it may
be printed but we have mentioned less
than 20 is not less than 20 the
condition phase and the loop ends here
this is our wild end of for Loop Works
in a Matlab
now let's see what is break statement
and how it will execute in the Matlab
a break statement terminates execution
of for Loop or a while loop
let's understand with an example let's
take a new script
I'll consider a variable a which is
equal to 10.
I don't want this to print in output and
close to the semicolon
and I'll consider a while loop
with a condition a is less than 20.
inside while loop I'll print this
within the codes
value of
a
is
close the code and mention the variable
and encloses within semicolon enter
and I'll increment the a value a is
equal to a plus 1. I don't want this to
be printed in the output so again I
would mention this semicolon
again I'll mention
a if statement
if
a is greater than 15. so this I'll write
break and with a semicolon
and end the if statement
foreign
as we can see in the output the values
from 10 to 15 is printed
as the first value of a is 10 if it will
check for a while condition a is 10 10
is less than 20 yes is less than 20 then
it will bring the value then it will
print the a value to 11. now it will
check the if condition if 11 is greater
than 15 no the condition fails and it
does not come inside the if loop again
it will execute the while loop it will
continue until the value of a it will
become greater than 15 and it will
execute the break statement the program
ends there now let's remove the
semicolon and understand step by step
see as we know the value of a is printed
then again the a value of a is
incremented to 12 13 14 15 and it lasts
the value of a will be incremented to 16
and when that case the if condition is
checked it will satisfy and the break
statement will run then as the break
State Building learn it will execute the
program and will exit the program
that specialty of break statement
whenever the break statement inside your
program will be executed it will exit
the program now let's understand how the
continuous statement is worked in metal
a continuous statement Works within a
four or a while loop and passes the
control to the next iteration
let's understand with an example I'll
take one more script
first I'll take a variable a which is
equal
to the number from 1
250
and the difference between the numbers
are 4 the number should be 1 to 50 and
with difference between those numbers
should be 4. and I'll n equals within
semicolon
and now I will take a for Loop for
variable K is equal to
from 1
to the
numeral of
variable
next I'll take an if statement
is the reminder
of a of K
of K
is equal to 3 now I will just say if
this is to continue or else
and the statement one if is ended then
I'll say
display the value of
a of
t
form
now let's learn the program
save and done
you can see
the value is printed as 9 21 33 and 45.
first let's see what are the numbers
printed in a for that I'll remove the
semicolon handle again write the book
as I said before the numbers from 1 to
50 is printed with the difference of 4 1
4 Defense 5 like that it will continue
till 50.
first we'll check for the forward
condition four conditions start with 1
and it will come to
if in if we are written a of 1 is
divisible by 3 the a of 1 that is K
value is 1 now a of square of 1 a of 1
is 1 1 is not disabled by 3 though it
won't come inside the if loop again it
will go for the next it is a of 2 a of 2
is 5 again it is not divisible by 3
again check for a of three a of three is
nine nine is divisible by three the if
condition is satisfied then it will come
inside the if Loop cutting the statement
it will display the value 9 this will be
continue until if the if statement is
satisfied for example it will only
satisfy for the multiples of 3 that is 9
21 33 and 45. so only that values will
be displayed and as it will come inside
the loop it will say continue it will
continue and it will display the values
only the multiples of 9. like this the
break and the continue statements Works
in The Matrix
now it's time to see the try catch
statements in Matlab the try cash
statement is an error Control Function
let's see the syntax of that
the try cats function has a try end of
catch expressions
the expression or a statement inside a
dry Block it's true it does not it will
not come into our catch block if it is
false or it and any error occurs in this
try statement then the catch block will
be executed now let's see with an
example I'll take an example with a
variable a is equal to
once of 4
and a variable B is equal to
zeros of 3 and I'll close both the
variables with semicolon
now I'll write the drive block try is
equal to M given expression C is equal
to square bracket a semicolon B close
with a circle
now
catch
Matlab exception I want this to be
displayed in my output so disk of Matlab
exception and at last end the try cash
statement now let's run it
as we know the statement or expression
inside the try block is C is equal to a
semicolon B which is an invalid
expression so the Matlab exception that
is the catch block has been executed now
let's see some of the array Concepts in
Matlab we have already learned how to
create a basic array in our Matlab
tutorial video now let's see how to
create a multi-dimensional array and how
to create a spare Matrix in Matlab let's
understand one by one with an example
array within more than two Dimension is
called as multi-dimensional arrays let
me create a three dimensional array
function using once
of
three four and three
and let me assign it to a variable
called a
three-dimensional array of
created by three by four by three R will
be created where it has a once all the
elements inside this array will be 1.
now let's understand the cell array in
Matlab
a cell function is a data object in
Matlab it can contains any types of data
or any array numbers strings structures
or shell
see how to create cell array in Matlab
for that we will use a cell keyword or
end function before that Let Me Clear My
Command window I have to create a cell
or that is true cross 2 array using a
cell I'll do it as cell
of
2
plus 2
.
a 2 cross 2 are array which is created
using a cell
we can also create a 3 cross 3 or a
multi-dimensional array using cell like
cell of
3
2 3
.
a 3 by 2 by 3 arrange created using a
cell variable
foreign
to store a array of different size
for that I'll take a new script and
script will take a variable C is equal
to
sell off
to
2 comma 4.
and the semicolon and I'll take a for
Loop
for n is equal to
1 to 8.
sea of
is equal to using the magic keyword
magic of
n and double end
for Loop just save it
now we can see that a 2 cross 4 array is
created
now let me display C of
foreign
as we can see we using this program or
using cell we have created an array
which can store a different size of like
different element of different size in a
single array now let's understand how to
create a spare Matrix in Matlab
let me go back to our Command window
a spare Matrix is a large Matrix in
which a vast majority of elements will
be zeros
in another words we can say a spare
battery is a matrix where the principal
diagonal numbers will be same and rest
of the principal diagonals the other
elements will be zero
now let's see how to create a spare
Matrix in Matlab
we will take a variable a is equal to
I want a spare Matrix of element having
two the principal diagonal of my spare
Matrix would be 2.
and you will start
I
off I'll mention
five
five line or a 5 row and Phi column has
been created with only a principal
diagonal of my array is 2. the rest of
the other elements are 0. like this you
can also create one more like a is equal
to one I want one
star
10.
see 10 cross 10 as created and all the
principal diagonal way elements are one
using star and I this function we can
create a spare Matrix in Matlab
now it's time to see some of the basic
programming in Matlab in basic programs
first we'll see a string program
before that Let Me Clear My Command
we'll see how to reverse a string in
Matlab for that let me take a string
like Str
is equal to and I'll take my first
string as
the double
dead now I'll take one more variable
called
new Str and I'll use a keyword called
reverse
and inside that I'll pass HDR
and then enter
you can see the structure Str variable
has a value called Lo which is been
reversed in new SDR
you can also do it with an uh creating
an array let me again update the Str
variable with a
array string like file create
hello
hand
hi
and next row should be here
and
welcome
let's create the close square bracket
and then enter you can see true cross 2
array has been created
now again we will say take the same
variable it is new Str is equal to
reverse of
Steel
as you can see the entire array elements
has been reversed
so what if if you want to reverse any
particular
variable or particular element in the
array
for third you should just mention the
position of that Arianas like I have
mentioned I want Hello to be reversed in
this newest
I just enter
new as the in Str the allo has been
reversed now I want some certain
position for example from one to three
it should reverse
let me print what were the Str values
this is my array
now I want
from 1
3.
it should give us
first one reversed second one reversed
and the third one has been reversed
like that we can reverse
the any types of strings or single
string are a group of array string
we can reverse our any Dimension array
also you can use
next basic program we will see on Matrix
first let me create one Matrix X
with the element of elements like one
two three four the first row and four
five six seven eight second row
and one more I'll take it as V
or Y
which will have seven eight nine
and ten
level
12 13 and 14.
now I want to concatenate these two
Matrix for the dialogue key a is equal
to
X semicolon y
and press enter
sorry instead of why I have mentioned 7
there you just
bye
you can see the both the Matrix has been
added first the X Matrix that is one two
three four five six seven this Matrix
and 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 both X and Y
Matrix has been added
now we can also add in extra elements to
an already created Matrix for example
I'll take B variable is equal to
I want X
variable to add an extra elements of
level 12 13 and 14.
see the X Matrix it is which has a
elements of one two three four four five
six seven as an extra
elements added to this that is 11 12
13-14 like this you can also add an
extra row or extra elements to an
existing Matrix
now what if you want to add a row of two
different Matrix for example a is equal
to or a
is equal to square bracket of x
before that let me print a word
why
and I will do a is equal to
X
you can see
the first row of X is added to our first
row of Y
and the second row of X then I do a
second row of Y
like this you can add a row of different
different Matrix
now let me see
how to write a Fibonacci series program
in Matlab
a Fibonacci Sequence the type of series
which each number is the sum of 2 that
is preceding it
now let me take a new script
we'll take a keyword over and variable
false
and next
we'll write the function
foreign
and close the
same colon and I is equal to 3.
and we will write a while loop
for
variables in n
is I minus 1
less than n
feed the end of
I is equal to
save then now I minus 2
Plus
fig
of I minus
one
now
close the semicolon and enter and I
should
increment
is equal to I plus 1 close the semicolon
and end the value
last
filled in
is equal to
save b n
f 1
2
and
minus
and you will and this function
first you have to we are writing a
Fibonacci series for Android
numbers we took a fib and a variable so
I assigned to a fib of VN
and first two numbers of our paperwork
series will be one by one and I will
start from the third element
if the fibofs N that is I minus 1 is
less than n it will implement this
formula and increment the I value the
while loop will continue until the
condition is true
with large blueprint the Fibonacci
series from 1 to last minus 1. now let's
save the
file and run it we can see the first two
numbers of our Fibonacci series is same
as we mentioned one and one from three
on the subject is the third element of
Series has been changed as we have given
I is equal to 3. and it is printed till
a hundred within a hundred
like this you can write a Fibonacci
series program in Matlab
now let's see a palindrome program in
Matlab
I'll take a screen Str is equal to
input
forms
input keyword is used to take a input
from the user so I am using input
what is your strip
and I'll read that string as yes
and I'll close the semicolon
and if
Str is equal to
I am using a keyword clock flip r
flip R is used to flip the string from
right side
and I'll pass the string variable
Now using disc
we will display
this string
sorry
to close this symbol code
and the SDI one
single code
incident that is a
control
and enter else
is
in the square brackets the
chain
let's take our
days
and two single quotes
and then and the
let me run the program I will ask what
is your string I'll give it as hello
and the string yellow is not a palette
row once again I will run the program
and then now I'll give noon as my
string the string known is a palindrome
like this you can write a palindrome
