I hope this is after a long time that
I'm making time to make a video the
primary intent was for this video is
like in the past one one and half month
I was like moving here and there here
and there meeting so many aspirants who
are very very disparate for this neat
entrance okay like first of all there
was a meet of conquer in Hyderabad where
like 70 to 80 people have attended both
the toppers of previous year and the
present intense specifically then after
one more meet in Rajamundry where there
was an interaction with many many of the
of intense particularly followed by a
need in karapa an interaction among 40
to 50 people has attended the meet and
it was a successful that after a few
talks here and there in deadly followed
by few talks in Hyderabad and it moves
on like it moves on okay after after
interacting with many many people a
direct interaction I really like many of
you guys are like in confident okay
lack of confidence is the primary reason
of the lack of preparation
okay so preparation is lagging somewhere
the main reason is lack of confidence so
as further suggestions given by the ex
back we are now moving to and your we
are moving ahead talking with people
interacting with people sitting together
making the strategies and lots of things
are going behind this work
okay apart from the good result what we
have this year in the first need okay
after after after a like a blast of need
but we we had a very very decent result
all our banging the first mark in need
by dr. Manisha and followed by a state
first rank in our state that is a
mistake first followed by a long line of
state first we made very decent because
we made it okay
everywhere we made a decent things
because we have 18 entries until now in
all india court of need plus two more
are still waiting so it's going to be 20
there and definitely it's going to be 20
in the state entrances and as well as we
are expecting something better in our
brand Telangana judicial so apart from
these I feel like okay I need to do a
video a video because you you can recap
it whenever you want so that's the
primary thing which made me to start
with this video this video is not for
any promotional purpose first thing and
second thing this video is not high five
it does not have any graphics it's
completely a handmade video okay please
be very clear I don't have any other
source of posting this high definition
video so I'm just using my YouTube
account and you know you know my
intention right so coming to the
conquers be very clear okay
people who are about to start
preparation and people who are half a
vendor preparation and people who are
thinking to start the preparation this
video is it includes all the category of
people this video is made based upon the
Kushans frequent questions or the doubts
in the mind of an aspirant so your you
are at the beginning you have few doubts
right so this video will give you the
answer in the middle you you may be
stressed out or you may be in doubt you
have few more doubts this video will
give it answer at the end you are in the
race you're in the computation this
video is going to give the answer so
this video is particularly to give few
doubts to motivate to clear the doubts
to clear whatever which is related to
the mindset of the aspirant so first of
all in this video I want to discuss
about the status of preparation okay I
hope a very clear the stages of
preparation while you are preparing
there will be few stages in the
preparation okay
these changes were categorized according
to me
after analyzing so many individuals as a
students friends analyzing myself so I
feel like the first phase is keeping
your targets on okay so many of us was
still in the fastest or who are in doubt
okay I mean it's like you need to keep a
target a single target okay your target
should be one and it should be static it
should be static it should be one right
that's very fine your target is one
always and it should be static it should
not keep on moving like one day you come
yeah I want to do MDS have all this
Department few days I mean after two or
three days you will come back here one
of my friend is preparing for MD I just
want to prepare her and B I want to
start the preparation for nd so on a
week like I think I may know the work of
the designer I want to open a clinical
with this various degree now I want to
work somewhere I want to quit dentistry
so your targets keep on changing this is
a main irritating issue with many many
many of us particularly in terms because
they are very instead the mindset of
intern is very unstable that they get
easily getting placed by the people
around them and they move on guys be
very clear we are 24 years right so I
feel like we can take our own decisions
we can make our own decisions we are
capable of taking a decision and we are
capable of executing it right so I don't
know why you guys are very very panic to
keep on changing your targets keep on
I mean I don't want this to happen like
the first days of preparation is your
target should be fixed it should your
target should be one and it should be
static it should not keep on moving
right what all the options are how told
ya everyone every option has its own
advantage but I don't know why you guys
keep on changing your target so I want
you guys to keep a single target and it
should be static always it should be one
and it should be static be very clear
and I mean the reasons why it may fail I
can give a few reasons one is lack of
confidence second one is lack of low
scores in your undergraduation level
okay
negative people around you that can be
one underestimation of yourself no
proper mindset no proper vision no
proper analysis of what you are going to
be in in the future so these are the
things that going to get get influenced
you to pull back from the targets like
can I do MBS can I can we get a straight
rank can I get a GDC you are under
estimating your size okay you need to
enter the race and you decide the race
if you want to win the race no I can't
run no I can't make it so these are all
like negative things right you need to
remove the negative things and you need
to talk positive and you need to move
positive so once you do this you will be
in the race definitely you will be in
the risk for this you need to have a
positive people around you who talk
positive who motivate you who guide you
analyze you it's not about like yam
deals it is waste please don't do that
please don't do this
I mean don't talk with such people you
know what you're doing you know what is
right you know what is wrong you are not
a kid right so don't get easily
influenced by the people around you
because they have something in their
mind because their mindset is different
and what your mindset is different your
abilities are Reverend your capabilities
are different and your education is
different so you are an unique
individual where you can take your own
decisions where you can stick on to your
own decisions
where you can work and make them true
okay please first is making your target
okay your target should be one it should
be one and it should be static I want
every individual who are in MDS concur
you should like once you start the test
series once you start the discussions
once you take the things seriously into
consideration I want you guys to finish
off this - stage one that is the target
your target is 6 now conquers the first
move what you have to take once you join
the MDS conquer is like or take a white
paper okay take a white paper take write
your target what you want yeah I want
this department where you want in this
chorus I want I want some constant
conservative and endodontics in the city
of Hyderabad or in Judy Sevilla or new
DC Trivandrum or in GDC Amritsar okay
you just you just you just write on a
paper you just write on a wrapper and
you make your target fix it should be on
your phone wallpaper so this is the
first thing that you have to do every
time when you touch the phone it should
ping you that your target is on you need
to work on so I want you guys to finish
this target one that is the stage one
right so moving on to the stage two
your target is fixed target is fixed now
whatever to you so now you should be
static the target is static now you
should be static means you should sit
for a longer duration of time you should
work for longer duration of time you
need to attend the discussions for
longer duration of time you need to give
exams you need to do whatever that is
necessary your page should be static you
should work work work that's all
you should be static your target is
static now you should be static I feel
like many of you guys are still in the
face to stage to where you are not
static
one day you're studying working like hen
for 10 hours eight hours second year
taking a break telling that you have
some work you have some personal things
you're not feeling well not able to
attend is not able again that you are
giving a reason for your incapabilities
you you're not doing the thing and
you're giving a reason so I feel like
many of you guys are just like they are
in the phase to where you need to take
em or you need to Kostas once you're on
stage one I agree says when it's
difficult things to decide your target
but once you decide your target
definitely you have to be static and I
want you guys to finish the stage too as
fast as possible it may take 10 days for
few individuals who are very determinant
can take one month can take six months
and that can take one year and the
duration of this phase is going to
influence your rank because logically
the time is time duration of the
preparation is the one that's going to
play a very vital role in deciding your
fate and rank right so this phase going
to vary from 10 days to nes so it's all
you your determination your
concentration that's going to decide you
to decrease the duration of this second
phase and improve your rank or embryos
course so I want you guys to move like
you need to sit okay there is
one rule oldest rule 21 rule 21 is
nothing but like once you start a new
thing for example if you are planning to
work early in the morning and you fall
to study it's not going to happen on the
day 1 it will be difficult but you need
to make it day 2 difficult day 3
difficult for as days increases the
difficulty level decreases at 21 days
once once you've done the same task for
21 days from 27 days from 22nd day it's
going to be part and parcel of your
daily curriculum so you don't need to
you know need to keep a last okay to get
up right so it happens by anything
because there's rule 21 that's going to
be the universal rule so I want you guys
to keep things on work and this attic
more around the books more around the
discussions and I want you guys to
finish this phase as fast as possible
because stage 3 is one of the most
interesting States I call this as see
stages okay it's all related to c1 is
like you how to maintain the consistency
in your preparation
whether you are posted in a particular
department like conservative endodontics
or prosthodontics interns particularly
you need to you need to give your best
you need to maintain your consistency no
no no I have posted in Pediatrics know
how posted in ortho I have plenty of
time now I'll work hard we'll get good
scores no no no I am posted in conserve
a - I need to do so many cases I am NOT
able to study so don't use such reasons
your consistency should be maintained
and if you are not able to maintain you
cross the stage - and you are trying to
spend most of your time in the State
Street consistency is one concentration
is the second one and confidence so all
C's you have to maintain your confidence
levels should be high because your cross
will stays - and your the second phase
of the preparation that is in the third
stage of the preparation which is almost
near to the success so you need to
maintain the consistency and you need to
maintain the confidence levels
conference levels are very simple and
easy if you have a
one mentor if you have a proper guide
who's guiding in a better way the
conference levels will be maintained
like you can just like trust your guide
follow him blindly follow the team
blindly so that definitely you're
confident cells will increase as you
spend much time with the books and your
scores move high and high it's very easy
for you guys to maintain your confidence
levels once you're on the track so I
want you guys to maintain the
consistency yeah five of us minimum five
of us you need to work with books you
aren't doing this I'm trying to do that
I'm trying to do this yes that's very
fine and confidence levels once you do
this it's like a cycle once you maintain
the consistency your confidence will go
high motivation from the mentors
motivation from the positive people
around you like good friends sitting
together and studying motivating each
other so these are going to increase
your confidence levels and obviously
once you have this confidence levels and
consistency you you're almost half away
not you're almost more than half away to
the success okay so I want you guys to
concentrate maintain the consistency and
build up your confidence levels so all
these three C's are going to play a very
very vital role you know exam once any I
mean like May there many more than 500
students in our in our test series right
now so you guys just think over this and
who are in this stage please try to do
is talk with the mentors talk with
Dementors talk at the positive people do
positive things talk a real positive
line read positive books and try to
maintain these concentration confidence
levels as well as consistently once you
are done with this case I want you guys
to finish this stage as fast as possible
and you need to make it as a habit like
okay I'm confident and if I'm doing the
things well I'm giving my best so you
need to do all these things once you're
like you'll move to the last is that is
estees it's all with us when stress
and the second is is success so you have
your done once you are concentrating on
the books and you're giving your best
once you are maintaining your confidence
levels once you are having the
confidence okay so once you're having
these curves you can move to the next
step
that is a very very easy one that is the
stress stress that is stress and success
that is two S's which play a very very
important role in the preparation
pattern these two S's are very very
important okay
stress sir I'm getting stressed though
yeah you have to get stressed because
stress is a driving force it drives it
drives and it moves you to the success
it is asbestos it's very important and I
mean like make sure that other people
who are really keeping the things on and
really working on I hope these guys as
cross this stage that is a stress to
success okay stress is the one of the
driving force that that makes you to
work more work more and once you're
starting worth more it's like drives
your drive so you drag it pushes you
yeah you did work you need to work
that's what the stress is like once you
have this definitely success is going to
be with you so I want each and every
individual off and base conquer
particularly to cross these stages okay
and you need to cross this you need to
feel this traitor's you will feel
definitely you will feel these three
doors like once you move one stays to
other stairs like stage one yeah my
targets are fixed and they're static and
fixed to MBL okay okay going to have a
jump in the next stage like where you
need to make yourself static seek your
seat and make a habit follow the rules
on day one when 21 days are done
definitely you're going to cross the
second phase and you are going to move
the third phase where the third phase is
all about creases that is concentration
distance e and confidence levels these
are like a cycle become one with other
so once you're done with the stage three
and if you feel like you're stressed
stressed stressed in ourselves like your
mind is going to tell ya you have to do
this you have to do this you had to
finish this you have to notice all this
M secured to our you are going to have
an exam you need to work on you need to
follow the mentor you need to follow
these guidelines that that's what the
stress is like your your fear of your
mentor voice your fear of an exam your
fear of your task and if your fear of
your basic books that are necessary for
the preparation then you are in the last
phase of the preparation where you need
to run where you need to work hard to
keep the second X that is called as
success right so this is the first
innocent that is the status of
preparation that every individual has to
cross so preferably tomorrow I'm going
to upload you in another video
okay which gives an information about
the planning action execution and
everything for the people who are about
to start the preparation right this is
the first phase and the second is take
in a second I am going to explain you
will explain people who are not able to
work on with the time keeping backlog
they had particularly interns not able
to cope up what able to remember
multiple like what books to read I am
NOT able to remember the questions and I
like once I'm moving from one subject
other subject a previous subject I'm
forgetting I don't know what to solve I
don't know where to go I don't know what
to do so there many many such questions
okay yeah and the third category of
people are that are doing well but I'm
not increasing my score my there is no
improvement in my score from the past
three or four exams even I'm working
hard like help but I'm still stick on
twos 160s one-seventh is one day it is
but I want to increase my scores please
tell me the technique so these are the
few more questions like I am able to do
well when I'm not able to find the
question right I am NOT able to
I'm skipping the options and I'm going
for the wrong answers I'm well-known
with the concept or unknown with the
question but I'm going for the wrong
answers in the examinations I'm not
having a good mindset negative people
are only pulling me back I have some
personal issues family problems my
health is not feeling good my x-rays are
lots lots of financial things emotional
things physical things everything
happens in the preparation and
preparation phase you have one where you
need to work on with the books that is
that is 50 percentage and work on with
the rest that is the emotional things
financial things I mean many things that
are going to pull you back so it's just
like a balance between all these things
that 50% days and this is going to be
50% I want you guys to balance it all
and the mentors and everyone in the
group particularly who are guiding you
who are observing you are
they're very strategical okay they have
lots of strategies in the brain they
work hard that is that everyone knows
and they have typical typical
strategical things that make MDS conquer
unique from the rest of the things okay
so we are going to make a video about
these listed or topics yeah I mean these
are the most commonly asked questions
for today you just go through this we
will have one more video tomorrow or day
after tomorrow okay thank you guys okay
keep working that's what I use to that
like we'll work hard
and we'll make things possible and we
will make embryos conquer drought right
signing off
