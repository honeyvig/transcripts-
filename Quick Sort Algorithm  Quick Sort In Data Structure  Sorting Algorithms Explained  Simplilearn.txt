hey everyone i am weber khandelwal and i
welcome you all to simply launch youtube
channel
in this session we will discuss
quicksort we shall begin our session by
introducing quick sort
then we will discuss quick sort
algorithm
after that we will implement quicksort
in the coordinator
finally we will sum up what we have
learnt from this session
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon below so you
never miss an update from simplylands
youtube channel
so without any further ado let's get
started with an introduction to
quicksort a quick sort is a highly
efficient sorting algorithm and it is
based on partitioning an array into
smaller sub arrays and then we will sort
these two resulting sub arrays in the
same manner
this algorithm is quite efficient for
large size data sets as its average and
worst case complexities are big o of n
square
now let's discuss algorithm of quick
sort
let's say we have an array first we have
to select a pivot
we can select either the first element
or the last or medium or any random
element as pivots
this pivot will dissect the array into
two sub-arrays then we will shift all
smaller elements than the pivot element
to the left
then we will again apply the same
operation for the left sub-array
and take pivot like we did for the main
array we will perform the same for the
right sub-array as well
we have now introduced the quick sort
and its algorithm now let's implement
this algorithm in the code editor
we will start by creating a function
swap
so void swap
end
star
x
comma
is equals to
star x
star x is equals to star y
r y is equals to temp
now we will write a function which will
partition this array this function will
take the last element as pivot
and the pivot element at its correct
position in sorted array and places all
smaller elements
to the left of the pivot and all greater
elements to the right of the pivot
so int
partition
and
arr
comma
and
low
so end
pivot
equals to
ar high
now end
i
is equals to
low minus 1
so for
end
j is equals to low
j less than equals to high minus 1
a plus plus
now if current element is smaller than
the pivot
so if
at j
is less than pivot
then we will increment the i
then we will swap
ampersand array
i
comma
ampersand array
at j
and we will swap
ampersand
array
at i plus 1
comma
10
array
at high
and then we will return
i plus 1.
now we will write the main function that
implements quicksort
so void
quick sort
and
arr
bracket
comma and
low
comma and high
so if
low
is less than high
and
pi
is equals to partition
arr comma
low
comma
hi
now we will separately sort elements
before partition and after partition so
quick sort
arr comma
low
comma
p i minus 1
and
quick sort
arr
comma
p i plus 1
comma i
now we will write a function to print
this array
so void
and
array
and
arr
comma
end size
and
high
so for loop
i is equals to zero
i less than size
a plus plus
see out
array at it
layout
handle
now we will write the main block so end
array
and comma 7
comma 8.
i will find the size so end n
is equals to
size of
array
is divided by
size of
array
element at zero
now we will call quick sort
n minus one
now we will print this
so c out
sorted
array
print
eric
now let's execute this
as you can see we have successfully
sorted our array
let's get back to our slides
at last let's sum up what we have
learned in this session
first up quick sort follows the divide
and conquer principle
next up quick sort has an average space
and time complexity of big o of n log n
next all pivots should be selected in
the same manner as the first pivot
finally quick sort is an unstable
sorting algorithm so even a single
mistake can crash a program
and this was all for today's session
