good evening everyone
i am gagan agrawal from sharadpur dental
college today
the title of my presentation is
something new something exciting
any guesses so by looking at this
picture
what all you think the picture is
showing something like
brittleness translucent structure heart
structure
any guesses what is it so let's have a
look once
so this structure is about enamel every
one of us know what is enamel
enamel is nothing but a hard translucent
tissue
covering the anatomical crowns of the
teeth of man and most of the mammals
enamel is also called sustaintica or
aminoblast amino
from where abnormal is product developed
from enamel is developed from
gene that names is ctpi2 that controls
to the normal production
this is transcription factor which
regulates skin
and nervous system discovered by
krisakuci
a krisakuci he is from arghan state
university
so what enamel composed of it's a
structure now
that something is in direct supports
that it consists of inorganic matter 96
percent
organic matter one percent and water
three percent
among organic matter includes tyrosine
rich and melatonins and non-aminogenic
inorganic matter includes calcium
phosphate hydroxyapatite crystals
fluoride strontium magnesium and lead
and apart from this it consists of three
percent of water
now what are the physical properties the
physical properties of enamel includes
extremely hard like mild steel so it can
withstand mechanical forces
as you all see in this picture uh this
enamel is very extremely hard like mild
steel
why it can waste mechanical forces
during mastication
it's my uh mastic
etc but maximum bulk around 2 to 25 mm
at crystal region
and knife edge thickness at neck region
as you're seeing this saw in the speaker
specific gravity of enamel is 2.8
permeability it acts as a semi permeable
membrane for
c-level urea eye etc
color light yellow to grayish white
depends upon translucency of enamel
that is attributable to glass
calcification and homogeneity
now normal structure what are the normal
structures
what are the structures that is related
to first enormous structure consists of
enamel prisms enamel rods prism sheets
also known as rod strength
interprismatic substance that is also
known as
inter or cementing substances first
enamel rods enamel rods are long slender
structures
with roughly five or six sides extending
from the interior normal junction
to the structure in very coarse and
oblique direction
the length of the rods are greater than
the thickness of the enamel
the diameter of the rods average 4
micrometer along the internal normal
junction and becomes
doubt at the surface becomes double at
the surface of it
the enamel rods normally have a clear
crystalline appearance
permitting light to pass through them
they appear hexagonal
round or oval and many resemble fish
scales
so in this you are looking at enamel
rods
these are baby in courses yeah obliquely
direction publicly detected
seconds ah oh in permanent teeth the
direction of
normal rods are similar to that of the
decedent street at occlusion two third
but at the cervical region the root
directed root wise so the enamel length
cervically as a knife
h second is prism
sheet prism sheet is the outermost
portion of the rod
and takes strains easily because it has
more organic substance
it is a substance which cements the rods
together
it is approximately 1 micron thick and
believed to have
proliferated from terminal bar apparatus
as enamel globules are
developed this is about inter prismatic
substance
some microscopic structure of enamel the
rods in cross sections has a common
pattern
keyhole or paddle shaped pattern with
head and tail
in longitudinal section the heads or
bodies in between the tails of adjacent
rods
will appear like rods are separated by
interprismatic substance
so when we use when we wave some
microbic structure of enamel
a keyhole or paddle shaped pattern is
gift
as you see in this figure
the appetite crystals appear flat
ribbon-like and arranged with their long
axis
paralleling the long axis of rods some
crystals may diverge
as much as 40 to 60 degree from the
axial plane of the rods
if someone asks you what are the
appetite crystals what are what is the
arrangement of a patented crystal sense
of microbic structure
so the pythagorean crystals arrangement
is like flat
ribbon like and with their long axis
paralleling the long half of the rods
some crystals may diverge as much as 40
degree to 65 degree
from the axial plane of the rods
like in this figure now structural
characteristics
what are the structural characteristics
of enamel
so transverse transitions hunter's
trigger bands
incremental lines of resist enamel
lamella enamel tufts
enamel spindles enamel cuticle and
pellicle
these all constitute its structural
characteristics of enamel
so first we will see one by one what is
first is transverse striations
lines across the rods with four microns
internal which becomes more visible
when in contact with acid it marks the
daily depositional growth of the
veinaman rods
more prominent cross tractions occur in
a regular period of about every four
days
for one week and are known as a stray of
red zeals or incremental lines
transfer stations are also known as
incremental line of arrest yes
see when you give microscopic structure
these are the transverse
striations also known as triophralzias
or incremental line of right cs
second is hunter sugar bands what are
hunter sugar bands
under sugar bands are alternating light
and dark bands originating from the
entire normal junction
towards the surface these are
originating from dej
towards the surface these are caused by
different directions of rods
or crease crossing of rods so that in
longitudinal section
some rods are cut transversely diazone
or dark zone
and some are cut longitudinally parazone
or light zone
so the rods which are cut longitudinally
are known as parazon or light zone and
the rods which are cut transversely
they are known as diazona dark zone
like in this figure c how hundred sugar
brands are developed
or hunter sugar brands is seen in
microscopic structure
incremental line of regions brand these
are the brownish lines
that mark the growth periods of enamel
beginning and ending layers of enamel
it represents every primary
calcification in the analysis
pericarmita and united line or brain
it represents every primary
calcification in the enamel
focus on this statement pericarmata or
it is all neonatal line or ring
stray of red cs
see in this figure
what are peri kamatas periga might have
nothing but indication lines of
pickering
transfer wave like grooves that are
thought to be the external
manifestations of strife itself
perigamet are nothing but the external
manifestations
of star of redzirs
see in this figure the both lines of
rexius and pericum hat is depicted
see now in first figure healthy tooth
with intact pericarmata
now in second figure partial loss of
origami is there
what is neonatal line neonatal line is
something like ring
so neonatal line are defined as
accentuated lines of resist
differentiating the parent prenatally
developed enamel from postnatal enamel
nutella and nylon is that line which
differentiate
prenatally developed enamel from post
natal enamel
present in all decedent and first
permanent molar this is very important
neonatal line is present in all
deciduous state and in permanently it is
present only in first permanent
mula this is believed to be the result
of abrupt change in the environment and
nutrition of the newborn infant
this is in this figure prenatal line
neonatal line and postnatal line
so what is neonatal line you see as you
see in this figure it differentiates
prenatal enamel from the post metal
enhancer
what are enamel lamella in our lamellar
nothing but leaf-like structure defects
extending from the surface of the normal
towards the interior
so enamel lamellar nothing but a surface
structure extending from enamel towards
the interior
enamel there are three types of enamel
lamella type
a type b and type c so
type a is true lamellar it is
hypocalcified
prisms an inter prismatic substance it
is limited to enamel
only what is type a hypercalcified
prisms and inter prismatic substance
now coming to type b what are enamel
lamellae type b
enamel cracks pre-eruptive can reach
dentine filled with epithelial cell or
connective tissue
so type b somewhat risk to the dentin it
is somewhat
rich to dentine and type c these are
enamel cracks
post adaptive can rich dainty filled
with organics or content of saliva
so in short type a is limited to enamel
type b somewhat goes to the optin tin
and type c
totally goes into dentine
enamel terms enamel taps are narrow
ribbon-like structure
composed of bundles of poorly calcified
rods and inter-rod
cementing substance originating from
dentinal junction
the term tuft is used because the
structure is
resembles the blades of grass attached
to the parent stream
so when you look is microscopic
structure you see normal dogs
it is look like grass like structure as
you see in this figure
what are enamel spindles club shapes
extensions or projections of the
internal tubules into the enamel
it is an aromatoplasty process which
extends between the cells of inner
gentle epithelium before the formation
of enamel
this is one of the factor that causes
the hypersensitivity of intuitive normal
junction
so enamel spindles are one of the factor
that causes hypersensitivity of the
internal normal
junction siege
this is enamel sprinkles
now enamel cuticle and pelican what is
an amal cuticle
nasmus membrane is a delicate membrane
that covers the crown of newly erupted
tooth
but is probably soon removed by
mastication nasmith emblem is nothing
but is much so much delicate membrane
that covers the crown of newly erupted
tooth but
is probably soon removed by mastication
pelican are precipitations of the
salivary proteins
covering the erupted enamel and may be
colonized later by bacteria
and food debris
see in this figure in animal cuticle see
play constraints uh now second is second
layer you see helical appear as a
homogeneous layer between plaque and
tooth enamel
when plaque on steroids attacks your
teeth they don't attach to the enamel
instead they attach to the protein
particle layer
when plaque and strains attack the vein
plaque and still supply your teeth
they do not touch the enamel they touch
to the protein like pelican layer
scalloped into the normal junction the
dentine surface on the crown
has shallow depressions or pits where
the normal caps are fitted resulting to
the irregular or scalloped appearance
of the junction of enamel and dentine
this provides
a form attachment of enamel to the
grinding surface
so what is the purpose of the interior
normal junction the internal normal
junctions purpose is
it provides form attachment of enamel to
the dentin surface
see scalloped pattern the ej internal
junction
now we talk about enamel structures in
normal characteristic physical
properties of enamel and all and all
but varies from enamel develop now
we will see enamel development
enamel organ originating from the
stratified epithelium of the stomodium
consists of four distinct layer
stromodium is the mouth oral cavity
beginning of
the beginning oral cavity stomach it
consumes four distinct layer
when it develops it consists of four
distinct layers that are outer enamel
epithelium
stila reticulum stratum intermediate and
inner normal epithelium
authoring epithelium outer
bottle cells of a normal organ which
becomes irregularly producing loops
where capillaries are found serve as a
protective barrier for enamel organ
during enamel formation cells develop
vesicles
and villi and a large number of
mitochondria indicating that active
participation of cells in the
transmission of nutrition
outer enamel epithelium helps in the
participation in transmission of
nutrition to the
cells
still at reticulum still at reticular
nothing
these are star shape cells in many
layers forming a network
within the normal organ it supports the
production of enamel matrix
it is resistant and inelastic therefore
it act as buffer against physical forces
that might distort the confirmation of
the developing ddj
it becomes reduced in size thus it
shortens the path of nutrition that
comes from the outside
as enamel gets his nutrition from after
enamel epithelium but now this chili
particular rod does what
it reduces in size and then shortens the
path of nutrition
that comes from the outside stratum
intermediate in the next layer
more inner compressed compressed layer
of flat tube bottle cells
also supports the production of cinnamon
matrix the cells show mitotic division
even after the cells of the inner enamel
epithelium cease to divide
inner enamel epithelium innermost
alcohol of the cell having
an organ it will differentiate into
ameloblast to that form in another
matrix
the inner enamel epithelium is that
layer which will differentiate into
amino glass what are ameloblasts amino
blaster enamel forming cells
that form enamel matrix cervical loop
when the crown has been formed the cells
of this portion give rise to heart fix
the epithelial root sheet
cervical loop is nothing but suffering
the crown has formed
the cells of this portion
of
i also call that the position of normal
matrix it is a process
of development of enamel consisting of
two phases so amelogenesis is consistent
constitute of two phases
one is formative phase and other is
mineralization and maturation phase
formative phase is also known as matte
organic matrix formation
and mineralization and maturation phases
and second phase
formative phase where there is a
formation of enamel matrix
formation of the entire normal high
membrane the ameloblast deposits a thin
matrix extracellularly on the surface of
the dentine
uniting with the membrane for
performativa to become the dengue normal
junction
so this is formative phase formation of
tom's process
now in the top formative phase there is
a formation of tom's versus how
the protoplasmic projections of
ameloblast into the matrix are the terms
processes
that appear as rows of projections
extending intracellularly
responsible for the way the normal
matrix is laid down
isolation of terms process from the cell
body of enamel of amiloblast by
condensation of cytoplasmic substance
closely associated with secant cell
membrane called terminal bar
also known as distal terminal bar
in of the distal enough terms process
with matrix material from the meloblast
formation of the fully formed segments
of rods are the pre-enamel rods
see in this figure tom's process
raw sheet inter or normal enamel rods
now second is mineralization and
maturative phase
the first stage of an intermediate
partial immunization occurs in the
matrix segment
and anti-prismatic substance as they are
laid down
the first mineral is actually in the
form of crystalline apatite
so enamel is nothing but first mineral
is actually in the pathetic in the form
of apatite crystal
the second stage of maturation starts
the height of the crown and progresses
cervically
second stage starts from height of the
ground to progress and it progresses
cervically
seems to begin at a dentinal end of the
rod it begins
before the matrix has reached its full
thickness
in normal penetration in our maturation
is occurs from cut step or inside the
lid and progress cervically
the maturation of the crystal begins
adjusting diode internally and
progresses to the outer
surface at first parallel to internal
normal junction
and later to the outer surface of enamel
maturation occurs by growth of the
primary crystals
till they fuse together the fibrils
between the crystals will become
thinner after eruption
the maturation continues by deposition
of ions from saliva to reach 96
of its weight in organic substance
now what other what is life cycle of
amiloblast this is the most important
question of all examiners
yeah because i am also an examiner i am
also a student so i know
this comes as i like you in my the edius
question paper in first year
currently i am in third year but this is
most important and is always oxygen exam
all the ways
life cycle of homeoblast life cycle of
amyloplasts includes
six stages what are six stages
morphogenic stage
organizing stage formative stage
maturative stage
protective stretch and desmolitic stage
the short form is
morph mpd mof mpd
of mpd yeah first
morphogenic stage before the ameloblasts
are fully differentiated
and produced enamel they interact with
adjacent resin caramel cells
determining the shape of the dj and the
crown
during this stage the cells are short
and columnar
with large nuclei that almost fill the
cell body
in morphogenic stage nothing where the
outer outer is outer outer portion is
zero
yeah organizing stage the ameloblast
interacts with the cells of the dental
papilla
at the periphery which latter
differentiates into odentoblast
then cells become longer and nucleus
freezones at the distal ends of the
cells become almost
as long as the proximal parts containing
the nuclei
after the first layer of dentin has been
formed the presence of dentine seems to
be necessary
for the beginning of enamel matrix
formation now
informative state there are changes in
organization and number of cytoplasmic
organisms
and inclusions are related to the
initiation of the enamel matrix
maturative stage enamel maturation
occurs after most of the thickness of
the normal matrix has been formed in the
occlusal or incisal area
amyloblasts display microvilli at their
distal extremities
and cytoplasmic vacuoles this structure
indicates an absorptive function of this
cells
protective stage when the enamel has
completely developed
and has fully calcified the miloblast is
to be arranged in a well-defined layer
and can no longer be differentiate from
the cells
of the stratum intermedium and outer
enamel epithelium
this cell layer then forms stratified
epithelial covering of enamel called
reduced enamel epithelium
that protects the enamel by separating
it from connective tissue
until the tooth erupts so reduced enamel
epithelium protects the enamel
by separating it from the connective
tissue until the tooth heat ups reducing
analysis is very important
it is acts in bhava dysmolytic stage is
the last stage
the reduced normal epithelium that is
formed in previous stage that is
proliferative stage it seems to induce
atrophy of the connective tissue
separating it from the oral epithelium
so that fusion of the two epithelia can
occur
it is probable that the epithelial cells
elaborate enzymes
that are able to destroy connective
tissue fibers like desmosis
now what are the clinical considerations
now these are the normal of enamel
yeah we will see what we are seeing now
enamel characteristics enamel structures
physical properties of enamel how the
enamel develops the amino genesis life
cycle of angular glass that includes
six stages now we will see clinical
conjugations but
in what diseases enamel will suffer
so first question is how does the
knowledge of enamel affect cavity
preparation
while looking by looking at this figure
the answer of that question is
direct acid reaching enamel and bonding
properties restorations and ceilings
i'll be doing restorations on
cylindrical
or while doing gravity preparation it
affects
enamel effect the gravity depletion
direct removal of unsupported enamel
rods
that is the normal pressure will be
unsupported what makes
enamel structure susceptible to carries
crystals dissolved at low ph
acid produced by karyogenic bacteria
make enamel
structure susceptible to carries enamel
surface is porous
and imperfect fits fissures and lamella
how are carries and dental erosion
similar or different
same both involve chemical insult
different
k is due to bacterial action erosion due
to environmental factors
at what ph does enamel undergo
dissolution
what common dietary substance have a low
ph answer is
ph is range of 5 to 5.5
and what are what are the common dietary
substances that have low ps the answer
is
soda props spots drinks citrus
pickles etc the average american drinks
more than 53 gallon of carbonated soft
drinks each year
more than any other beverage including
milk beer coffee or water
pop is a poor dietary choice for three
reasons
what accounts for the natural coloration
of it what accounts for white spots
enamel translucent and porous dnd shows
through contrast with facial or hair
color
impaired translucence of enamel creates
optical white spots
what are some environmental factors that
affect enamel formation how
do this occurs nutrition systemic
diseases systemic diseases like diabetes
mellitus
hypertension thyroidism high fever
tetracycline
trauma fluoride etc this occurs during
tube development
tip development includes four stages
burst stage
cap stage early bill switch and advanced
barrel stage
in advanced bill stage the development
of enamel takes place
how does fluoride affect enamel there
are two mechanism
protective function and by too much
affects fluorosis
protective function indicates inhibitor
of crystal dissolution
and remineralization with fluoroapatite
crystals
what are some mercury conditions
affecting enamel the identity conditions
that affecting enamel are amelogenesis
imperfecta ectodermal dysplasias excitra
ectodermal dysplasia is a disease of
skin
it is a disease of skin amelogenesis
imperfect term
is a condition where there is a
disturbance in the formation
and maturation of enamel matrix enamel
hypoplasia
result of the disturbance in matrix
formation clinically the surface of
enamel
may develop its fishes or grooves or
enamel may be very thin
in animal hypo calcification results of
disturb mineralization of enamel matrix
clinically the enamel appears rocky
white or opaque and soft
in a half enamel hypercalcification
enamel appear as chalky white or opaque
and soft
so thank you you don't have to brush all
your teeth
just the ones you want to
