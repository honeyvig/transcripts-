in this tutorial we will learn about
typescript typescript has grown in
popularity in growing years Microsoft
created and maintains the typescript
programming language it is a rigorous
syntactical superset of JavaScript with
the addition of optical static typing
typescript is a large scale application
development language that compiles
JavaScript existing JavaScript programs
are also valid typescript programs
because typescript is superset of
JavaScript let's see what's in it for
you in this session we'll first start
with understanding what is typescript
then we will see why do we need
typescript
what led to the development of
typescript next we will see some of the
important and key features of typescript
followed by which we will look at the
advantages of typescript and
applications of typescript then
proceeding further we will see how to
set up the development environment what
are the necessary tools required for the
development of typescript then we will
see how variables data types functions
and Loops are used in typescript but
before you begin if you love watching
Tech videos then subscribe to our
YouTube channel and make sure you have

an update from Simply learn so without
wasting any further time let's get
started
what is typescript
typescript is object oriented and
strongly typed programming language
which is a superset of JavaScript
typescript was designed by Anders
hijelsberg at Microsoft
the limitations of JavaScript for
developing large-scale applications at
Microsoft and among its external
customers led to the creation of
typescript
because of the difficulty of working
with complicated JavaScript code there
was demand for custom tooling to make
developing JavaScript components easier
typescript code is converted to
JavaScript which can be executed
anywhere JavaScript is supported
in the browser onenote.js and in your
application
typescript is Javascript with some
additional features to support more
robust interaction with your editor
typescript adds additional syntax to
JavaScript
typescript is a scripting language that
understands JavaScript and users type
inference to provide powerful
capabilities without additional code
why need typescript
now we'll see some of the reasons why we
need typescript
firstly we have compilation
JavaScript is an interpreted language
thus there is no need to compile it as a
result it must be run to ensure
authenticity if there is an error we
need to write the code only to find the
output as a result you will have to
spend hours looking for faults in the
code error checking is provided via the
typescript transpiler if the typescript
detects any syntax mistakes it will
compile the code and generate the
compilation error this AIDS in detecting
errors before the execution of the
typescript typescript provides an
optional type system for JavaScript code
when a client doesn't have a value for a
parameter he can personal optional
arguments are a feature of typescript
you can declare some optional arguments
in the function by utilizing optional
parameter features so the decline does
not need to supply a value to optional
parameters
strong static typing JavaScript does not
have a powerful static typing system
through the TLs typescript comes with an
optional static typing and type
inference system the TLs that is a
typescript lying with service can deduce
the type of variable defined with no
type based on its value
typescript supports object-oriented
programming typescript supports classes
interfaces inheritance and other
object-oriented programming principles
typescript supports type definition
existing JavaScript libraries can use
typescript type definitions external
typescript libraries are defined in
typescript definition files as a result
it can include these libraries in
typescript code
features of typescript
typescript supports other JavaScript
libraries typescript is a new Microsoft
language that is a highly typed superset
of JavaScript with the support for
object oriented programming and other
current features like decorators
because browsers and nodes comprehend
JavaScript typescript compiles
JavaScript typescript is portable
typescript is cross browser cross device
and cross platform it can run in any
environment that supports JavaScript
typescript unlike its competitors does
not require a dedicated virtual machine
or a specific runtime environment to run
typescript is superset of JavaScript
it's a strong syntactical superset of
JavaScript with the addition of optional
static typing typescript is a large
scale application development language
that transcompiles to JavaScript
existing JavaScript programs are also
valid typescript programs because
typescript is superset of JavaScript
typescript is static when a client
doesn't have a value for a parameter he
can partner
optional arguments are a feature of
typescript
you can declare some arguments in the
function optional by utilizing optional
parameter features so the decline is not
necessary to supply a value to optional
parameters
object oriented programming when it
comes to object oriented programming
with JavaScript typescript shines
because of the class keyword it makes
object oriented programming look quite
similar to programming in other object
oriented languages like c-sharp or Java
applications of typescript
typescript can be used to create both
client-side and server-side JavaScript
applications typescript can be deployed
instead of JavaScript language since it
adds more features and gives errors
directly with the code
typescript is used for building large
scale applications for Enterprises
now let us look at the advantages of
typescript
during development problems are
highlighted at compilation time
any browser or JavaScript engine can run
on typescript
by defining a module it has a namespace
concept typescript supports strongly
typed or strongly typing typescript has
the advantages of being tightly typed or
allowing static typing it may confirm
type correctness at compile time because
of static typing intellisense is the
feature of typescript that develops
active tips as you type setting up
development environment

we need to go to node.js official
website and install node.js after
installing go to command prompt and type
the function node space hyphen V to
check if the node is installed properly
to install typescript run the command
npm node package manager install
globally typescript in the command
prompt and this will install typescript
so let's jump to the browser and see the
installation of dot.js and typescript
then we will go to visual studio and see
the different components like Loops
variables data types with examples
choose from over 300 in-demand skills
and get access to 1000 plus hours of
video content for free visit scale up by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more so to install
node.js come to the website
nodejs.org here come to the downloads
and from here you can install node.js
node is an open source server side
execution platform for JavaScript code
node is commonly used for real-time
applications like chat news feeds and
web push notifications because it allows
for a persistent connection from browser
to the server
node.js is a JavaScript runtime based on
V8 JavaScript engine from chrome
node.js is an asynchronous event driven
JavaScript runtime for building scalable
Network applications
to install for Windows click on Windows
if you have Mac OS click on Mac OS to
install
so I'll click on Windows here we go
node.js is getting installed since I
have already installed in my device I'll
cancel it
so once the installation is complete and
you have installed the node.js
next go to command prompt
in the command prompt run the command
node
hyphen V to check if whether the node.js
is installed properly
and here it shows the version of node J
as installed in our device
so here we can see that node is
installed properly next we need to
install typescript
to install typescript we need to run the
command npm node package manager install
hyphen G globally typescript
if you run this command the typescript
will be installed
that the typescript will be installed
worldwide with this command this implies
that each project you create on your
computer can use typescript dependencies
without having to reinstall the
typescript package
so after running this the typescript
will be installed since I have already
installed I'll clear this so after
installing typescript to check if
whether the typescript is installed
properly
to check if the compiler is installed
just type DSC typescript compiler space
hyphen version
and here you can see the typescript
compiler of version 4.5.4 is installed
now that we know how to install node.js
and typescript now we will go to visual
studio and see the examples
so let us see the different types of
variables available in typescript so for
variable declaration typescript follows
the same rules as JavaScript variables
can be declared with the commands like
variables
or we have let
and we have constant const
so these are the three types of variable
declarations available in typescript
we'll see them one by one
variables can be declared in typescript
using the VAR keyword just like in
JavaScript
the scoping rules are identical to those
in JavaScript
for example we can declare a variable
parameter age
and it is of the type number
which is equal to say 45 Something Like
This
and similarly we have
let
so let is a ecmascript 6 introduced two
new types of variable declarations in
JavaScript using the keyword let and
const to solve the issues with variable
declarations
these additional sorts of variable
declarations are also supported by
typescript which is a superset of
JavaScript
for example we have let's say employee
name
is equal to John
similarly we have constant
constant variables are declared in the
same way as variable and let variables
are constant transforms available into a
constant whose value cannot be changed
the same scoping constraints applied to
constant variable as they do to the left
variables
for example we have constant
num
equal to
100.
something like this
next we will look at the different data
types in typescript
we have different data types like number
string Boolean array
Etc
so number first we look at the number
just like JavaScript typescript Supports
number data type
all numbers are stored as floating Point
numbers these numbers can be a decimal
hexadecimal
for example
say let first
number
one two three
so
let's again
the third number
is equal to this is of the type now we
will write octal
and don't forget to put colon otherwise
it will show an error
let fourth
or declare the number of type
say binary
so typescript Supports number data types
like the numbers can be stored in
floating Point numbers or decimal or
hexadecimal octal or binary
so this is basically a number
and this is
hexadecimal
[Music]
this is octal
and this is binary these are the
different number methods in typescript
the method two exponential Returns the
exponential notation in string format
two fixed returns a fixed Point notation
instance format
to locate string converts a number into
a local specific representation of the
number
two position returns a string
representation in exponential or fixed
point to be specified precision
two string Returns the string
representation of the number in this
specified base and value of returns A
Primitive value of the number next we
have string then the data type which we
have is string string is an another
primitive data type that is used to
store Text data string values are
surrounded by single quotation marks or
double quotation mark
for example
if we say declare it let employ
name
strength of the type string
is equal to
Johnson
so this is of the type string
the different string Methods in
typescript are
cat method character act returns a
character at the given index concatenate
returns a combination of two or more
specified strings index of returns an
index of first occurrence of the
specified substring from a string and
minus 1 if not found
the method replace replaces the matched
substring with a new substring
in the method split split the string
into substrings and returns an array
two uppercase converts all the
characters of the string into uppercase
to lower case converts all the
characters of the string into the lower
case
the next type which we have is Boolean
Boolean values are supported by both
JavaScript and typescript and stored as
rule or false
example for bullionaires say let
here note that the Boolean with small B
is different from the Boolean capital B
so the uppercase Boolean is an object
type whereas the lowercase Boolean is a
primitive type
it is always recommended to use the
Primitive type Boolean that is a
lowercase Boolean in the code because
with JavaScript courses an object to its
primitive type the typescript type
system does not the typescript treats it
like any object type the another data
type is of the type array an array is a
special type of data type which can
store multiple values of different data
types sequentially using a special
syntax
typescript supports array similar to
JavaScript there are two ways to declare
an array One is using the square
brackets and the other is using a
generic array type
example
this is one type to declare with the
square brackets
and the other type is to use the generic
array type
both methods produce the same output
arrays can contain elements of any data
types numbers things or even objects
arrays can be declared and initialized
separately these are the different array
methods in typescript
we have pop that removes the last
element of the array and returns that
element and push adds the new elements
to the array and Returns the new array
length sort sorts all the elements of
the array and similarly we have concat
index of copy within fill shift splice
and shift includes join
last index of that Returns the last
index of the element in an array
similarly we have slice to string
and to locate string similarly we have
Tuple Union any word and never as the
data types in typescript next we will
look at the if statement in typescript
and if statement can include one or more
Expressions which return Boolean if the
Boolean expression evaluates with true
a set of statements is then executed and
in if else condition an if else
condition includes two blocks if block
and an else block if the if condition
evaluates to true then the if block is
executed otherwise the else block is
executed
and we also have elsif so the elsif
statement can be used for if statement
next we will see Loops in typescript
typescript supports for Loop the for
Loop is used to execute a block of code
a given number of times which is
specified by a condition
so this is the forth Loop
the first expression is executed before
the for Loop starts and the second
expression is the condition for the loop
to execute and the third expression is
executed after the execution of every
code block here in this example I is
equal to 0 declares and initializes a
variable the second condition I is less
than 3 checks whether the value of I is
less than 3 or not if it is less then it
exits a loop the third statement
increases the value of I by 1 this Loop
will execute the block 3 times until the
value of I becomes 3. now that we have
seen Loops we'll see the functions in
typescript functions are the primary
blocks of any program functions are the
most important part since it is a
functional programming language it
functions we can implement the concepts
of oops like classes objects
polymorphism and abstraction functions
ensure that the program is maintainable
and reusable and organ nice into
readable blocks while typescript
provides the concept of classes and
module functions still are integral part
of the language for example we have
function
sum
so this is the example of function
classes in typescript now let us look at
the classes in typescript
so in object oriented programming
classes are fundamental entities used to
create reusable components typescript
has been primarily a functional
programming language where inheritances
prototype based functions are used to
build reusable components let us see an
example for the classes
employee name
so we'll create a class employee
and provide employee
ID
deploy name
so the typescript compiler
we'll convert the class to the
JavaScript code using the closure
and the Constructor is a special type of
method which is called when creating an
object in typescript the construction
method is always defined with the name
Constructor
so in this example the employee class
includes a Constructor with the
parameter employee ID
in the Constructor members of the class
can be accessed using this keyword
example this dot employee ID
it is not necessary for every class to
have a Constructor we will look at
advanced typescript concepts here is the
list of topics what are covered in this
video
so we'll first look at type assertions
type aliasis
typescript generics in operator null
label types
index types
index signatures map types similarly
conditional types supporting libraries
from node modules
the awaited type and promise type
assert signature
top level await and recursive type
aliasis
so these are the some of the advanced
concepts which we will cover in this
video before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our YouTube channel and
click on the Bell icon so you never miss
an update from Simply learn watch the
video till the end so that you don't
miss out on any concept so without
wasting any further time let's get
started with advanced typescript
we'll first look at type assertions
type assertion is similar to Typecast in
other languages but it does not do any
additional verification or restructuring
it has no effect on runtime and is only
used by the compiler typescript expects
that you the programmer have completed
the necessary and specific checks so
there are two types of assertions
one is the as syntax and the other one
is the angle bracket syntax both
versions are identical choosing one over
the other is primarily a matter of
preference however only as style
assertions are allowed when combining
typescript with jsx
type aliasis type aliases give a type a
new name type aliases are similar to
interfaces in that they can be used to
name Primitives unions tuples and any
other kind that you would have to Define
by hand otherwise
doesn't truly create a new type instead
it gives the type a new name aliasing A
Primitive isn't very useful however it
can be used for documentation purposes
type aliases like interfaces can be
gentle all we have to do is add type
parameters and utilize them on the right
side of the Alias declaration
this is the syntax work type aliasis
type generics
type generics is a tool for creating
reusable components in typescript rather
than working with a single data type it
builds a component that can interact
with various data kinds it enables users
to consume these components while also
using their kinds generics ensure that
the software is both adaptable and
scalable over time consider the below
code without generics the identity
function is a function that returns
whatever is sent in as a parameter you
could either provide the identity
function with a specific type or the
identity function with any type while
the use of any is generic when you use
any the function accepts any kind for
the type of argument
as a result when the function returns
you lose the information about what the
type was the only information you have
is that any type could be produced if
you pass a string
so for that we need the means to capture
the argument type in such a way that we
can use it to signify what has been
returned as well
we will utilize a type variable here
which is a form of variable that deals
with the types rather than values
the identity function now has a type
variable called type this type allows
you to capture the type of data the user
supplies
for example a number or a string so that
you can use it later you are going to
utilize type as the return type once
more
next we look at the in operator
the in operator serves as a type
narrowing expression
the true Branch Narrows to types that
have an optional or required property in
and defaults Branch Narrows through the
types that have an optional or missing
property n for a n in X expression okay
where N is a string literal or a string
literal type and X is the union type
below is an example code for inoperate
null and undefined are two special types
in typescript that have the values null
and undefined respectively they are not
particularly useful much like world
null and undefined are subclasses of all
other types by default that means you
can give things like number null and
undefined values
when the strict null checks flag is set
however null and undefined can also be
assigned to unknown any and their
respective types this helps you avoid a
lot of frequent errors you can use them
as Union type string null and undefined
if you want to send in either a string
null or a undefined
next we have index types
using index types we can get decompiler
to check code that utilizes Dynamic
properties names by using index types a
typical JavaScript pattern for example
is to select a subset of an object's
property
we may build and use this function in
typescript using the index type query
and index access operators let us jump
into Visual Studio code and understand
index types more better
so consider this code as an example for
index types here key of T the index type
query operator for any type t e of T is
the union of non-public property names
of t
and T of K the indexed access operator
is the second operator the type syntax
reflects the expression syntax in this
case
and T of K can be like index type
queries be used in generic environment
which is where its truly potential can
be seen all we have to do now is make
sure that the type variable K extends e
of t
in get property o
T and property name k so that means of
property name the compiler will initiate
the actual type of the key after you
return T of K result therefore the
return type of get property will change
depending on which property you request
index signature
index signature interact with the key of
ND T of K
the type of an index signature argument
must be either a string or a number
if your type has a string index
signature key of T will be a string or a
number
because in JavaScript you can access an
object property using either a string or
number
T of string is simply the index
signature type
below is the Syntax for index signature
if you have a type with number index
signature e of T will just be a number
map types
taking an existing type and making each
of its property optional is a typical
undertaking because this happens
frequently enough in JavaScript
typescript has a new feature called map
types that allows you to Define new
types based on existing ones
the new types turn each property in the
old type in the same way in a map time
for example make all the properties
optional or the read-only type
it's important to note that this syntax
refers to the type rather than the
member you can use an intersection type
to add more members
this is the simplest map type and its
parts the syntax is similar to the index
signature with a 4 in the middle there
are three sections in total the type
variable K is assigned to each property
one by one
the little Union of string the names of
the properties to iterate over a
stolding case and third one the
properties type is a result
next we have conditional types
based on the condition given as a type
relationship test a conditional type
chooses one of the two alternative types
when T can be assigned to U the type is
X and when it can't the type is y
because the condition depends on one or
more type variable a conditional type T
extends U
so X is to Y and is either resolved to X
or Y or delete
whether to resolve to X or Y or to
differ when t or U contains type
variables is determined by whether the
type system has enough information to
conclude that t is always assignable to
U
in conditional types we also have
distributive conditional type
that is a conditional type in which the
check type is bait type parameter during
instantiation distributive conditional
types are automatically distributed over
Union types
supporting libraries from node modules
typescript includes a series of
Declaration files to guarantee that
typescript and JavaScript support works
well right out of the box
and typescript includes a series of
Declaration files however there are two
drawbacks to using this declaration
files with typescript
one drawback is since while upgrading
typescript we must also deal with the
changes of typescript built-in
declaration files which can be difficult
when the Dom apis change so regularly
and the other drawback is that
customizing these files to meet your
needs and the demands of project
dependencies is difficult
so to overcome this a new feature like
types
was added that allow us to override a
specific built-in library then we can
update typescript and lock the file in
dependency management ensuring that it
utilizes the same version of Dom types
as a result we can update the types on
our own schedule
then with
then with typescript 4.5 we can update
typescript and log file in our
dependency management
await type and promise improvements
the weighted type is the new utility
introduced in typescript this type is
intended to represent activities such as
a weight in async functions and the then
method on promises notably the way they
recursively unwrap promises
existing apis such as JavaScript
built-in like promise dot all promise
dot race and others can benefit from
awaited type
in fact some of promise.all inference
concerns provided as foundation for
awaited promise that all combine certain
traits with awaited to produce far
superior inference results
tail recursion elimination on
conditional types
one typescript identifies potential
infinite recursion or any type expansion
that take a long time and damage your
editor experience it often leak fails
as a result typescript includes
heuristics to ensure that it doesn't run
off the tracks while deconstructing an
indefinitely deep type or working with
types that provide a lot of intermediate
results
let's jump into Visual Studio code and
look at an example
the trim left type for example removes
spaces from the beginning of string like
type when provided a string type with
space at the beginning trip left Returns
the reminder of the string to the user
this type is Handy but it will throw an
error if a string contains more than 50
leading spaces
this is problematic because these types
are frequently used in modeling
operations on strings such as parsers or
URL routers to make matters worse a more
powerful type useful generates more type
installations resulting in even
additional input length restrictions
trim left is a return in such a way that
it is still recursive on one branch when
it calls itself again it Returns the
result instantly and does nothing with
it
because these types don't require any
intermediate outcomes they can be
constructed more rapidly and without
activating many of typescript built-in
type recursion heuristics
next we have assert signatures
the asset signature features allow us to
construct functions that operate as
typed guards as a side effect
instead of returning their Boolean
result explicitly
consider a below example
after a search ring typescript has no
way of knowing if you have guaranteed
the type of input to prevent this most
people just make the parameter input
string which is fine
but it also moves the type checking
problem somewhere and in circumstances
where you just want to fail hard having
this option is beneficial
if this function ever returns typescript
can filter the type of input to sting
exactly like it would be if it were
inside an if block with a type card
to make this safe the assert function
must either give an error or not return
at all if the assert assertion isn't
true
and lastly we have recursive type
aliasis
the ability to recursively reference
type aliases has been limited the reason
for which is because each type aliasis
must be capable of substituting itself
for whatever it aliases
because this isn't always possible the
compiler rejects some recursive aliases
interfaces can be recursive but their
expressiveness is limited and type
aliasis cannot that involves combining
the two creating a type Alias and
extracting the types recursive
operations into interfaces
interfaces can be recursive but their
expressiveness is limited and type
aliases cannot
that involves combining the two creating
a type Alias and extracting the types
recursive portions into interfaces it's
effective
by establishing an interface users May
write what was practically the same code
typescript has no trouble working with
the interfaces and other object types
because they introduce a level of
indirection and their whole structure
does not need to be eagerly built up
however many found the workaround of
introducing the interface to be
inconvenient and there was nothing wrong
with the old version of value or array
that used array directly in Concepts so
we will look at typescript interview
questions if you are planning to attend
an interview on typescript then this
video will come in handy before we begin
with the video make sure you have
subscribed to our YouTube channel and
clicked on the Bell icon so you never
miss an update from Simply learn so
let's get started
we'll first look at beginner level
interview questions
what is typescript
typescript is an object oriented and
strongly typed programming language
which is a superset of JavaScript
typescript was designed by Anders
hijelsberg at Microsoft the limitations
of JavaScript for developing large-scale
applications at Microsoft and among its
external customers led to the creation
of typescript because of the difficulty
of working with complicated JavaScript
code there was a demand for custom
tooling to make developing JavaScript
components easier
typescript code is converted to
JavaScript which can be executed
anywhere JavaScript is supported in the
browser or node.js or any other
application
typescript is Javascript with some
additional features to support a more
robust interaction with your editor
typescript adds additional syntax to
JavaScript typescript is a scripting
language that understands JavaScript and
uses type inference to provide powerful
capabilities without additional code
explain the features of typescript
typescript supports other JavaScript
libraries typescript is a new Microsoft
language that is highly typed superset
of JavaScript with support for object
oriented programming and other current
features like decorators because
browsers are node.js comprehend
JavaScript typescript compiles
JavaScript
typescript is portable typescript is
cross browser cross device and cross
platform it can run in any environment
that supports JavaScript typescript
unlike its competitors does not require
a dedicated virtual machine or a
specific runtime environment to run
typescript is superset of JavaScript it
is strongly syntactical that superset of
JavaScript with the addition of optional
static typing typescript is a large
scale application development language
that transcompiles to JavaScript exists
in JavaScript programs are also valid
typescript programs because typescript
is a superset of JavaScript typescript
is static when a client doesn't have a
value for a parameter he can personal
optional arguments are a feature of
typescript you can declare some
arguments in the function optional by
utilizing optional parameter features so
that the client is not necessary to
supply a value to optional parameters
object oriented language when it comes
to object oriented programming with
JavaScript typescript shines because of
the class keyword it makes object
oriented programming look quite similar
to programming in other object oriented
languages like c-sharp or Java
what are export and import keywords in
typescript import keyword is used to
export declaration example export start
from module and the export keyword is
used to export any variable function and
type aliasis below is the example for
import keyword and Export keyword
can typescript be used for the backend
typescript can be generally used for
backend applications by using node.js
and having additional safety that the
language brings
how to declare a variable in typescript
let and const are the two methods to
declare variables variable names can
contain alphabets and numeric digits
they cannot contain spaces and special
characters except the underscore and the
dollar sign variable names cannot begin
with a digit hello is the example code
where we have declared a variable with
let method and we have declared a
variable inside a function
list the applications of typescript
script can be used to develop JavaScript
applications for both client-side and
server side execution
typescript can be deployed instead of
JavaScript language since it adds more
features and gives error directly with
the code typescript is used for building
large scale applications for Enterprises
how can a base Constructor be called
from a child Class A Base Class
Constructor can be called from Child
class using the super method as shown in
the example what are Getters and sectors
Getters and sectors intercept access to
a member of the object they give us a
way of having finer grain control over
how a member access each objects a
getter method starts with the keyword
get
and the setter method starts with the
keyword set what is the purpose of
tsconfig.json file
tsconfig.json file is a Json format file
in which we can specify different
options to tell the compiler how to
compile a given project this file in the
directory indicates that the directory
is the typescript's project root list
the advantages of typescript typescript
highlights errors at the compilation
time during the time of development any
browser or JavaScript engine can run
typescript it has a namespace concept by
defining a module typescript supports
strongly typed or static typing
typescript has the advantages of being
tightly typed or allowing static typing
it may confirm type correctness at the
compile time because of static typing
what are rest parameters in typescript
when the number of parameters that a
function will receive is not known or
can vary we can use rest parameters we
can pass zero or more arguments to the
rest parameters the compiler will create
an array of arguments with the rest
parameter name
how to compile typescript with Visual
Studio code Visual Studio code includes
typescript language support but does not
include the typescript compiler we need
to install the typescript compiler
either globally or in your workspace to
transpile typescript source code to
JavaScript the easiest way to install
typescript is through node package
manager the node.js package manager if
you have npm installed you can install
typescript globally on your computer by
using this command npm install hyphen G
typescript we can test the installed
typescript by checking the version or
help for this run the command TSC hyphen
hyphen version
list access modifiers supported by
typescript typescript supports three
access modifiers protected private and
public in protected all class members
can access them but the instance cannot
but in private it's only accessible by
members whereas in public it is
accessible members child classes and
instance of the class
this is the disadvantages of typescript
the typescript takes a long time to
compile the code typescript does not
support abstract classes and extra
compilation step for converting
typescript into JavaScript typescript
has overly complicated typing system
how to debug a typescript file
to debug a typescript file a DOT JS
Source map file is needed to debug the
file compile the dot TS file with the
source map flag for generating Source
map file use the command typescript TSC
space hyphen sourcemap file.ts Source
mapping URL is equal to file.js.map
how can we convert a string to a number
with typescript in typescript conversion
from a string to a number can be done
using the following commands parse int
method and we have parse float method
and number method
explain type aliasis
type aliases give a type a new name type
aliases are similar to interfaces in
that they can be used to name Primitives
unions tuples and any other kinds that
you would have to Define by hand
otherwise
aliasing doesn't truly create a new type
instead it gives that type a new name
aliasing A Primitive isn't very useful
however it can be used for documentation
purposes type aliasis like interfaces
can be in general
all we have to do is add type parameters
and utilize them on the right side of
Alias declaration below is the Syntax
for type aliasis
what are nullable types in typescript
null and undefined are the two special
types in typescript that have the values
null and undefined respectively they are
not particularly useful much like void
null and undefined are subclasses of all
other types by default that means you
can give things like number null and
undefined values
when the strict null checks flag is set
however null and undefined can only be
assigned to unknown any and their
respective types the one exception being
that undefined is also assignable to
want this helps to avoid a lot of
frequent errors you can use the union
type string null undefined if you want
to send in either a string null or
undefined
what is in operator in typescript
the in operator serves as a type
narrowing expression
the true Branch Narrows to types that
have been an optional or required
property in and defaults Branch Narrows
to the types that have an optional or
missing properties in for a n in X
expression as shown in the example below
where N is a string literal or string
literal type and X is a union type
explain index types in typescript
using index types we can get the
compiler to check code that utilizes the
Dynamic Property names a typical
JavaScript pattern for example is to
select a subset of an object properties
we may build and use this function in
typescript using the index type query
and indexed access operators in this
example key of T the index type query
operator for any type T key of T is the
union of known public property names of
T and T of K the indexed access operator
is the second operator the type syntax
reflects the expression syntax in this
case T of K can be like index type
queries be used in generic environment
which is where its truly potentially
seen all you have to do now is make sure
that the type variable K extends to K of
t
what are map types typescript has a
feature called map types that allow you
to Define new types based on the
existing ones the new type turns each
property into the old type in the same
way in a map type
it's important to note that this syntax
refers to a type rather than a member
you can use an intersection type to add
more numbers as you can see in the
example it is the simplest map type and
its parts are type keys and type Flags
where syntax is similar to the index
signatures with 4 in the middle there
are three sections in total the type
variable K is assigned to each property
one by one and the literal Union of
strings the name of properties to
iterate over the stored in case and
properties type as a result
what is mean by contextual typing
when there is a type on one side of the
equation but not on the other the
typescript compiler finds out the form
we can omit typing on the right side as
typescript can work it out automatically
this increases the amount of work needed
to type code
distinguish between typescript and
JavaScript typescript is an object
oriented programming language whereas
JavaScript is a scripting language
typescript supports static typing
JavaScript does not support static
typing
in typescript error can be found and
corrected during a compiled time in
JavaScript errors can be found only
during runtime as it is an interpreted
language
there is support for
ES3 ES4 5 and 6 in typescript
whereas in JavaScript no support for
compiling
in typescript functions can have
optional parameters whereas in
JavaScript this is not possible
in typescript converted into JavaScript
code to be understandable for browsers
JavaScript can be directly used in
browsers
typescript has proper build setup dot
package manager is required for static
type definitions no build setup is
required in JavaScript
what is jsx
jsx is an XML like syntax that can be
embedded it is intended to be turned
into legitimate JavaScript though the
semantics of that transformation will
vary depending on the implementation
typescript allows you to embed jsx type
verify it and compile it to JavaScript
immediately jsx needs to be translated
into a valid typescript we use the jsx
file with the dot TSX extension
define static typing
static typing refers to a compiler
having variables parameters and object
members that are recognizable at the
compilation type this helps in detecting
early errors static typing as is an
important concept
static typing is when the compiler
enforces that the values use the same
type here's an example
what is meant by type inference
when you don't specify an explicit type
for variable typescript can infer it
type inference is the term for this this
is normally done during the Declaration
when the variables or parameters are
initialized
typescript recognizes that the variable
Foo is a string even if we don't mention
string as a type
here is an example
how to create objects in typescript
objects are collection of keys and
values that resemble a dictionary the
keys must be one of a kind this symbol R
is and are sometimes referred to as
associate arrays
an object type in typescript refers to
any value with properties it can be
defined simply by specifying the
properties and the kinds of these
properties as an example
explain different data types in
typescript
number both integer and floating Point
numbers are represented by the data type
number
Boolean has true and false values
string it is used to denote a string of
characters void is usually applied to
function return types
null it's used when an object isn't
worth anything
undefined indicates the value assigned
to an uninitialized variable
any any type of value can be assigned to
a variable if declared with any data
type
what are the benefits of using
typescript
compilation JavaScript as an interpreted
language thus there is no need to
compile it as a result it must be run to
ensure authenticity if there is an error
you write all the code only to find no
output as a result you will have to
spend hours looking for faults in the
code
error checking is provided via the
typescript transpiler if typescript
detects any syntax mistakes it will
compile the code and generate
compilation error this AIDS in detecting
errors before the execution of the
script
the next benefit is it provides an OP
style type system for JavaScript code
when a client doesn't have a value for a
parameter he can personal optional
arguments are a feature of typescript
you can declare some optional arguments
in the function by utilizing optional
parameter features so the decline does
not need to supply a value to optional
parameters
strong static typing JavaScript does not
have a powerful static typing system
through the TLs typescript comes with an
optional static typing and type
inference system the TLs can deduce the
type of a variable defined with node
type based on its value
typescript supports object-oriented
programming typescript Support classes
interfaces inheritance and other object
oriented programming principles
typescript supports type definition
existing JavaScript libraries can use
typescript type definitions external
Javascript libraries are defined in
typescript definition files as a result
it can include these libraries in
typescript code
how to install typescript
typescript is a JavaScript programming
language for using application
typescript extends JavaScript with
optional types that support tools for
large-scale JavaScript application in
any browser or any host on any other
operating system to install typescript
globally with node package manager which
means you can run the typescript command
from anywhere in your terminal to
install the latest stable version of
typescript you just need to run the
command npm install hyphen G space type
script this will install the latest
version of typescript
what are decorators
a decorator is a type of Declaration
that can be used to decorate a class
declaration method accessor property or
argument
decorators take the form expression
where expression must evaluate to a
function that will be called with
information about the decorated
declaration when it is called at runtime
what are mixins
combining simpler particle classes is a
popular approach of constructing classes
from reusable components for languages
like scalar you may be familiar with the
concept of mixins or characteristics
to extend the Base Class the design
relies on generics and class inheritance
the finest mix in support in typescript
is provided through the class expression
pattern
explain classes in typescript
classes are not supported in JavaScript
es5 or earlier this feature the
typescript inherits from es6
a class is a collection of items with
similar characteristics Fields methods
Constructor blocks nested classes and
interfaces are all included in the
classes
because the syntax to declare a class
in terms of whoops a class is a template
for producing objects
what is a namespace and how to declare
it
the namespace is used to group
functionalities logically to enable a
signal or a group of Link
functionalities the namespace can
include interfaces classes functions and
variables
the namespace keyword followed by the
namespace name can be used to construct
a namespace curly brackets can be used
to define all interfaces classes and
other objects
foreign
types for namespace
explain the components of typescript
internally the typescript language is
separated into three layers each of this
layer is further subdivided into
language compiler and language services
language it is written in typescript and
includes typescript language components
it includes syntax keywords and type
annotations
compiler the typescript compiler
converts typescript programs into
JavaScript code it also converts our
typescript code to JavaScript code
parsing and type checking it
it provides information that allows
editors and other tools to deliver
greater assistance capabilities like
automated refactoring and intelligence
it adds a layer of abstraction to the
core compiler pipeline
what are the recent advancements in
typescript
typescript 4.2 has been released and it
includes more flexible type annotations
tougher checks and additional
configuration choices and a few breaking
changes
rest arguments can now be placed
anywhere in triple type in type error
messages type aliases are no longer
enlarged resulting in a better developer
experience
typescript 4.2 brings the language one
step closer to its aim of accurately
typing JavaScript at any size anywhere
JavaScript is used
described as syntax in typescript
the as is an additional syntax in
typescript for type assertion it was
introduced as the original syntax
conflicted with jsx
while using jsx with typescript only as
style assertions can be used
Define Lambda function
typescript provides shorthand Syntax for
defining function Expressions a Lambda
function is an anonymous function
without a name
below is an example for Lambda function
what are conditional types in typescript
based on a condition given as a type
relationship test a conditional type
chooses one of the two alternative types
when T can be assigned to U the type is
X and when T can't the type is y
because the condition depends on one or
more type variables a conditional type T
extends to U X is to Y and is either
resolved to X or Y or delayed whether to
resolve to X or Y or to differ when t or
U contains type variables is determined
by whether the type systems has enough
information to conclude that t is always
assignable to you
what is an interface with reference to
typescript
the interface defines the Syntax for
classes to follow a class implementing
an interface implements all its members
it can be reference but not instantiated
typescript compiler uses an interface
for type checking
what is the declare keyword in
typescript
as JavaScript does not have typescript
declaration to use it in the typescript
file without any compilation error
declare keyword is used
the keyword is used for ambient methods
and declarations to Define a variable
that Exist Elsewhere
now we will look at advanced level
interview questions
what are object oriented principles
supported by typescript
all object oriented principles
encapsulation inheritance polymorphism
and obstruction are supported by
typescript
encapsulation is a major component of
object-oriented programming language and
its method of structuring code so that
each block of code has its own set of
access points for external code
polymorphism occurs when many class
inherit from the same parent and
override the same functionality each of
those Kit classes is now responsible for
implementing a property or method but
they may do so it on their own unique
way
inheritance
typescript makes creating an object
model an inheritance chain a breeze to
construct classes simply use the
standard class keyword
obstruction is a method of modeling
objects in a system that separates the
responsibilities of the classes or type
from the code that inherits it
explain index signatures in typescript
index signatures interact with the key
of n t of K
the type of an index signature argument
must be either a string or a number
if your type has a string index
signature key of T will be a string or a
number because in JavaScript we can
access an object property using either
string or numbers and T off string is
simply the index signatures type the
index signature consists of the index
name and its type in square bracket
followed by colon and the value type
what are assert signatures
the assert signature features allows us
to construct functions that operate as
type guards as a side effect instead of
returning their Boolean result
explicitly
after a search string typescript has no
way of knowing if you have guaranteed
the type of input to prevent this most
people just make the parameter input
string which is fine
but it also moves the type of checking
problem somewhere and in circumstances
where you just want to fail hard having
the option is beneficial
what is Type assertion explain its types
a type assertion is similar to a type
cast in other languages but it does not
do any additional data verification or
restructuring it has no effect on
runtime and is only used by the compiler
there are two types of assertions
one is the as syntax other is the angle
bracket syntax
below is the example for a syntax and
angle bracket syntax
explain how typescript files can be
supported from node modules
typescript includes a series of
Declaration files however there are two
drawbacks to using this declaration
files with typescript
one is while upgrading typescript we
must deal with changes to typescript's
built-in declaration files
and the other is customizing these files
to meet their needs and the demands of
project dependencies is difficult
a new feature like at the rate types was
added that allows to override the
specific built-in library then we can
update typescript and the log file
independency management ensuring that it
utilizes the same version of the Dom
types as a result we can update the
types on our own schedule
explain the typescript generics
typescript generics is a tool for
creating reusable components in
typescript it builds a component that
can interact with various data kinds it
enables users to consume these
components while also using their own
kinds
the identity function now has a type
variable called type this type allows us
to capture the type of data the user
supplies for example a number or a
string so that we can use it later we
are going to utilize type as the return
type once more below is the Syntax for
typescript generics
what is the recursive type aliasis
the ability to recursively reference
type aliasis has always been eliminated
the reason for this is because each type
aliases must be capable of substituting
itself for whatever it aliases
interfaces can be recursive but their
expressiveness is limited and type
aliases cannot
that involves combining the two creating
a type aliasis and extracting the types
recursive portions into interfaces it's
effective
typescript has no trouble working with
the interfaces and the other object
types because they introduce a level of
indirection and their whole structure
does not need to be eagerly built up
explain tail recursion elimination
unconditional types
when typescript identifies infinite
recursion or any type expansions that
take a long time and damage your editor
experience
as a result typescript includes
heuristics to ensure that it doesn't run
off the tracks while working with types
that provide a lot of intermediate
results
the trim left type removes spaces from
the beginning of string like type when
provided a string type with the space at
the beginning trim left returns a
reminder of the string to the user
Advanced typescript removes tail
recursion from conditional types it can
prevent intermediary instantiations as
one branch of conditional type is merely
another conditional type
explain the awaited type and promise
improvements this type is intended to
represent activities such as await in
async functions and the dot then method
on promises notably the way they
recursively unwrap promises
existing apis such as JavaScript
built-ins like promise.all promise.trace
and others can benefit from the updated
type in fact some of promise.alls
inference concerns provided as
foundation for awaited promise dot all
combine certain traits with the awaited
to produce far superior inference
results
