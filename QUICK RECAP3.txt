so now I'm going to discuss about few
important questions about ECG okay
I mean ECC paper is is a paper with you
have so many greats Ritzer nothing but
so grids are arranged in the horizontal
axis and you have two squares okay you
have two squares one is small and the
second one is large so they can ask the
dimensions of these squares the small
one is of 0.04 seconds and it is of one
millimeter length whereas the large one
is 0.20 seconds and the length is five
millimeters
they can ask you the speed of ECG the
speed of ECG is 25 millimeters per
second and the next question is the
thickness between the left ventricle and
the right ventricle that is 3 is to 1
and the next more is about the leads
okay so you have so many leads in ECG
that is okay so they can ask you the
total number of leads the total number
of leads are 12 of which you will have 1
2 3 with the wrong numbers and the
second three are AVR AVL and ABF where a
is nothing but okay so this is okay so a
stands for augmented leads okay and the
next course is the left over six there
will be terms with v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 and v6
so these six are okay these six are
termed as three cordial leads okay so
you have total number twelve three three
and six
okay so
