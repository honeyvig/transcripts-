hey everyone welcome back to another
tutorial by simply learn
and in today's video we will be
discussing top 10 reasons to learn c
plus in 2022
c plus plus is an object oriented
language which is used in many superior
organizations to create some complex
applications
and c plus is quite all language so
there are some doubts regarding the c
plus language like whether this language
is still in demand or not
and if it is
then what are the reasons to learn c
plus programming language
c plus is no doubt bit old language but
it is still in the dominance in the
world of programming in many sectors
in this video we will be discussing the
top 10 reasons to learn c plus plus
programming in
2022 but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn
so we will start with the 10th reason
which is career opportunities
with the availability of easy to learn
languages like javascript python etc
people often ignore languages like c
plus plus
c plus plus is considered a foundation
language of many programming languages
and is one of the most essential
languages that you must know if you are
interested in computer science
as per the tiobe index of 2022
c plus plus lies in the fourth position
in terms of world's most popular
language
the career or job opportunities for c
plus plus programmers is enormous
because c plus is an old language and a
lot of code is already written in this
language
c plus plus is very useful for making
complex softwares android applications
and games etc
so it holds a strong position when it
comes to job opportunities
now
let's move on to the next reason to
learn c plus plus programming language
which is
c plus plus is efficient and fast
language
c plus plus is a fast language its
compile time and execution time is
faster than other programming languages
some programming languages are also
faster than c plus plus
but like c plus they are not close to
the machine code
as it is an intermediary language so big
organizations rely or depend on c plus
for fast speed with lesser resources
so our eighth reason to learn c plus
plus language is
suitable for big projects yes
c plus plus is well suited for big
projects
many applications and softwares that we
use or go through in our daily lives are
developed in c plus
for example spotify a popular music
streaming application
its backend code is written in c plus
plus
we all know youtube
c plus plus is used in building youtube
video processing function
the amazon application
that we use often
was also written in c plus plus
however there are changes over the years
and many more softwares like these are
developed using c plus
some of the main reasons for choosing c
plus plus for big projects is that it is
fast and efficient language
also it gives a lot of control when it
comes to memory management
and its library support helps in making
complex functionalities
now let's move on to our next reason
which is
community support of c plus
as we have discussed c plus plus is an
old language and is being studied and
learned by most of the programmers
around the globe
so it has a huge community support
in case someone needs any help or
guidance regarding c plus a lot of
programmers and experts are out there on
different platforms
creating resources like blogs for
example c plus plus tips of the week
podcasts like cppcast
and the organizations like the c plus
plus alliance and many more are out
there that can guide you through your
problem
all of these resources are open source
and some of them are paid
which can help a learner or programmer
to understand this language and clear
the doubts regarding it
now our next reason is
c plus plus is required everywhere
c plus plus programming language is
almost everywhere around the world
for example
it is used for making browsers
applications and software
also c plus is used majorly to make
operating systems and almost all of the
operating systems are built with c plus
plus
for example
mac operating system windows operating
system linux etc
similarly the browsers like safari opera
chrome
firefox etc are written in c plus
because it is fast and efficient
language
that is why it is more preferable
many games are written in c plus
and some advanced gaming systems are
also developed using c
language
so it is being widely used and learning
a language like this opens up the doors
for your career to many different
sectors of organizations
so next
our fifth reason to learn c plus plus is
it helps you in learning other
programming languages
c plus plus is an intermediate level
language
learning this language will give you
much deeper understanding of programming
structure because in c plus you have to
write declare and explain everything in
the source code
which gives you deeper knowledge of all
the parts of the program
languages like python are much easier to
understand because it is almost syntax
free language and you don't have to
specify everything while writing its
code
which makes the programming part easy
but you don't get the opportunity to
learn the logic structure of the program
like c plus
once you learned the c plus language
then other languages will be easy for
you to learn or grasp
as your foundation becomes strong
now
our next reason to learn c plus plus is
embedded systems
an embedded system is a microprocessor
based software and hardware system
that is used to design a specific
function
c plus plus is widely used in embedded
system because it is intermediary
language which means that it has both
the features of high level language and
low level language
which gives c plus plus an edge over
other languages because it directly can
access the hardware part without
sacrificing the high level part
many embedded systems like smart watches
gps systems mp3 players etc are created
using c
plus to choose a language for embedded
system c plus plus is the one
because it is hardware level language
moving on to the next reason which is
versatility
c plus plus is around 40 years old
language and still is one of the most
popular language
why is it so
it is because of its versatile nature
c plus plus is a highly adaptable
language and because of that it is still
useful when it comes to software and
developing games
it is widely used for so long that it is
compatible with many languages and is in
demand in many sectors
also the top tier companies seek
employees with a fine understanding of c
plus plus programming
which is a very good reason to learn c
plus twist programming
so next our top second reason
which is
c plus plus language for simulations
apart from python c plus plus is also
used for simulations
many simulators are created with the
help of c plus plus libraries
it is considered as an alternative to
the python language
the object-oriented approach provides
faster execution full accessibility to
the base language
portable models and executables
and a variety of complementary
development tools
the simulation built with tools has the
benefits of an object-oriented design
including the involvement of
encapsulation polymorphism inheritance
and parameterized typing
now let's move on to the top reason to
learn c plus programming in 2022
that is
c plus plus has high salary packages
c plus plus is in demand in reputed
organizations like facebook google etc
these organizations also pay some
handsome salary to the c
developers for working on their products
usually different organizations pay
differently to the entry level c plus
plus developers and the experienced ones
but the average salary of a c plus plus
developer in india is 7 lakh 78 290
and the average salary of a c plus plus
developer in usa is
118
305 dollars
the entry level c plus was developer
salary is bit average in the early one
to three years because of less
experience and mastering c plus language
usually takes some time
but the salary package grows after four
years of experience at a fast pace which
is a good reason to learn c plus
programming language
so with this we have come to an end to
