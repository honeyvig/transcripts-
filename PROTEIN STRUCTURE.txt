yes hi everyone so now I will be
discussing few important things related
to the structure of protein in detail
okay so if you go into the basic
structure of protein okay they can ask
you some diagram based questions it's
very simple primary which is something
like a just like a linear structure with
something like a linear structure a
secondary you will have more complicated
when compared to the primary tertiary ok
so you'll have more complicated when
compared to the secondary and the
quaternary is the most complicated all
subunits or lapping one another ok we
will learn everything in detail
examination point of view ok so these
are the areas I'll be focusing on the
areas where this need and be or all
these exams and MCQs will be focusing
one related to the structure of proteins
so have a look at this diagram because
they can ask you the diagram based
question like marking a b c a a means
what type of structure diagrammatical
structure of proteins what is a what is
B they can ask you some diagram based
questions or they can ask you a matching
like thing giving all these structures
on one side and asking you to identify
what is primary secondary and tertiary
in a simple way so coming to the primary
structure you need to focus mainly on
these two points that is the linear
sequence of this ammonia acids is the
main thing that you have to focus on the
primary structure and the primary
structure is mainly responsible for its
function the function of the engine the
biological function of the engine is
mainly concerned with the primary
structure the secondary is very simple
the second you can remember it as SS
that is the spatial orientation or the
arrangement of the proteins by twistings
of this polypeptide chain is called as
in a secondary the two stings and all
these foldings will comes out of the
secondary structure and secondary
structure is categorized into two types
that is the alpha helices and beta
sheets okay it is of two types mainly by
alpha helix compared to the beta sheets
so coming to the tertiary tertiary you
can remember with as T and T that is
three dimensional structure
packed structure with the hydrophobic
side chains which are present inside and
hydrophilic which are present on the
surface so if you say take a tertiary
structure of a protein you will have
hydrophobic inside and you will have
hydrophilic on the surface I and the
main main function of this tertiary
structure of a protein is to increase
the stability of the protein so I mean
like before going to the quaternary okay
there will be some bonds which are going
to play a vital role to maintain the
stability of this tertiary structure of
the protein and these are the bonds
which the proper sectors are mainly
considered ok there is slight difference
between the type of bonds that are
present in the tertiary and the
quaternary okay the type of bonds that
are present in the tertiary are the
hydrogen bonds one the disulfide bonds
next is ionic interactions that can be
analyst ratting bonds and they can be
hydrophobic interactions and a few water
wall forces of attraction so these are
the lists of the bonds which are mainly
concerned with the tertiary structure of
the protein so next we will go with the
quaternary that is the most complicated
structure of the protein so before going
in detail to this quaternary structure
the main important thing that you have
to focus is majority of the proteins
they may lie as in a single polypeptide
but few cases you he'll have multiple
polypeptides that is nothing but called
as oligomeric polypeptide chain so when
you have this complicated polymers in
bulk in a particular protein okay then
you have to go for this quaternary
structure this structure of subunits
okay is is this complicated structure is
maintained by the quaternary structure
and some of the proteins the composed of
two or more polypeptide chains they
refer as a subunits and the spatial
orientation or the arrangement of these
subunits means multiple subunits is
called as in a quaternary structure and
the bonds that are present in this
quaternary structure mainly are non
covalent bonds they are hydrogen bonds
hydrophobic interactions and ionic bonds
so you need to know the difference
between the types of the bonds that are
present in the tertiary structure and
the types of the bonds that are
necessary to maintain the
no structure and the main difference
that you have to focus is quaternary
structure is mainly associated with the
spatial arrangement of the subunits
whereas your secondary structure is
mainly associated with the spatial
arrangement of the proteins okay here it
is subunits okay in the corner it is
subunits whereas in the case of
secondary it is the polypeptide chain or
the proteins that that are mainly
responsible for the secondary structure
so the next important focus of the paper
status is all about the denaturation of
the proteins how the proteins are
denatured so they are list of
characteristics features that you have
to make a note you'll have to learn
because there are many questions related
to this denaturation of proteins so
going in detail denaturation is nothing
but is protein is organized because it
has primary it has second rate has Tara
Reid has quaternary structure so the
organized protein has to be D organized
so this organization or T organization
of a NATO protein is called as a
teenager ation so there will be few
agents that are added to make it to make
it to destroy the protein so these can
be categorized into physical agents of
the chemical is the physical agents can
be heat like violent shaking x-rays UV
rays the chemical agents can be acids
alkalis organic solvent salts of heavy
metals maria saal sait silicates
detergents and XY jet and coming to the
focus of capacitor this is an area this
is this is a slide where they are mainly
concerned about so if you take the
denaturation of proteins the
characteristic features so the the
important aspects are clearly underlined
in the red color so you can focus on
them the nato helical structure of the
protein is lost the primary structure is
not lost whereas the secondary tertiary
and quaternary structures are lost when
you go with the denaturation
the protein loses its biological
activity its ability the biological
ability of the protein is lost
denaturation proteins become insoluble
in the solvents okay the viscosity
increases and the surface tension
decreases there will be increased
ionized ability and there will be
increasing in the sulphur hydral group
of bonds denaturation proteins are
easily digested when compared to the
raro
as you can see the vegetables and
everything which are which are like
cooked cooked means it's denatured so
they are easily digested when compared
with a non cooked products and
denaturation in general is usually
irreversible process okay it cannot be
reversed back but if you have a careful
denaturation sometimes the careful
denaturation can be reversible that is
called as REE naturalization so example
for regeneration is that is something
corners in a hemoglobin undergoes
denaturation in the presence of salcette
but by removal of these the hemoglobin
by itself can re natural okay so this is
an exception case so you have to
remember this example and D natural
proteins cannot be crystallized so these
are the important areas where the Pappa
setters are focusing when they ask
questions related to the structures that
is primary secondary tertiary quaternary
we know the basic difference with the
diagram and followed by the
characteristic features of denaturation
of the most important areas where I have
seen multiple questions so please learn
about these aspects and prepare your own
notices all the best take care signing
