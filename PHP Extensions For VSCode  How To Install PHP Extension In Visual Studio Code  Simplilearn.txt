hello everyone
and welcome to simply learn in this
video we will discuss some
php extensions that can be and should be
added in visual studio code
to make php programming a little easier
and a life's a little simpler so without
further ado
let's open visual studio code and see
what all extensions do we have
now to check the extensions available or
search any of them
we need to go to this tab that is the
extensions tab
now these are the already installed
extensions
on our system and from here you can
search
extensions available in the visual
studio code marketplace
now the first extension and a must-have
extension
is php
intellifence
now to understand what it does let me
go back to the explorer
and open a test.php so what i'm going to
do
is write some
basic php built-in functions
let us say
php info
so what you need to notice is
when you type php info it shows a
suggestion
it is from the built-in feature that is
already installed into the visual studio
code but when you click on this
that's it now i'll show you the
difference
go back to extensions and install php
intelligence
now go back to your test file and
again type php
info now as you can notice you can see
two php infos here
now when you click on this one you can
see all the details about this function
available right here
so this is what php intellifence is
it intelligently suggests
and autofills parts of your code to make
your programming simpler
and much easier now moving on to a
second extension
our second extension will be php
mess detector
now what php mesh detector does is it
analyzes your php code on every save
now there's no additional setup required
if php is already installed
on your system which already is
so to see what it does
let us install it now before that
let us go back to test.php
and let me just
open this now here you can see the
output of your code
so if you go back to php mesh detector
install it
and go back to your code you can see
phpmes detector is visible here
and after everything that you write
it analyzes your code after every save
and it is pretty useful while writing
big and complex php codes
now let's move on to the next extension
which would be
php auto
close stack now what php auto close tag
as the name
suggests does is when you open a tag
when you
whenever you write a tag that is suppose
html
or body etc etc anything that you write
it will automatically close the tag
and you can simply start writing the
code so
this extension has saved me a lot of
time finding what problem is in my code
fixing the bug
when actually it was just that i did not
close the tag
so suppose i write html
and as you can see it automatically
closes the tag and you can simply start
writing the code
now moving on to our next step that
would be
php fmt that is php
formatter now
what it does is it formats your code
with proper indentation
and well your code looks much more
readable after this
so let me just show you
i've already created a test2.php
let me just close this so as you can see
this code is not indented at all and
one might have trouble understanding
what is going on and what
part of code is under what loops
and statements so we go back to our
extension
php formatter install it
go back to test one sorry test2
now when you right click
after installing this extension you can
see format document section available
then
when you click on it
the code gets automatically indented
and looks much more readable now so
as you may notice all these codes under
comes under the if conditions
and that's the rest of the code looks
much more readable now
now the last extension that i am going
to discuss
is
php debug
now this extension you may not use it
on a very regular basis but this
extension is very helpful when you want
to debug your code
and see what's wrong with it
all the instructions on how to use this
extension are written alongside it
and how to install how to use how to
install extra servers in order to
completely utilize
its potential since
this extension is a debug adapter
between visual studio code and xdebug
website that was developed by derek
griffins
so i'm going to install it
and this is the very website x debug
where any of your code is debugged
so these are some of the extensions that
you need to begin
or ease your journey into php there are
a lot more extensions available for php
and you can explore more into them as
you move forward
