hey everyone welcome to another video by
simply learn
in this video we will discuss about
typescript express
let's look at what's in it for you in
this session
we'll first start with understanding
what is typescript
then we will look at what is express.js
followed by which we will look at some
of the features of express js and
advantages of using typescript with
express
and at last we will have a hands-on demo
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell like so never miss
an update from simply learn
watch the video till the end so that you
don't miss out on the demo so without
wasting any further time let's get
started with typescript express
what is typescript
typescript is an object oriented and
strongly typed language which is a
superset of javascript
typescript is a variant of javascript
with a few more features typescript
extends javascript with extra syntax to
provide a more robust interface with
your editor
typescript was designed by anders
hegelsberg at microsoft
typescript was created in response to
the limitations of javascript for
constructing large-scale applications
within microsoft and among its external
customers
there was a demand for specialized
tooling to make developing javascript
components easier due to the complexity
of working with complex javascript code
typescript code is converted to
javascript which can be executed
anywhere javascript is supported in a
browser on node.js and in any other
application
typescript is a scripting language that
understands javascript and relies on the
type inference to deliver advanced
functionalities without the need for
additional code
what is express.js
express.js is a node.js web application
framework that is free and open source
it is used to quickly and easily design
and create web apps web applications are
applications that can be run through a
web browser because express.js simply
requires javascript
programmers and developers may create
web applications and apis with little
effort
tj whole away chook created express
which is now maintained by node.js and
several open source contributors
to construct our applications express
provides a simple interface it gives us
the resources we need to create our app
it's adaptable because there are a lot
more modules on npm that can be directly
integrated into express
let us look at some of the features of
express.js
server-side development is made easier
with express it's possible to create
single page multi-page and hybrid web
apps with express.js
express enables middlewares to respond
to http request to be configured
middleware is primarily responsible for
the orderly structure of express js
various functions
express js has a comprehensive routing
mechanism that uses urls to maintain the
state of a web page
it establishes a routing table that is
used to carry out various operations
based on the http method and url
express.js has templating engines that
enable developers to create dynamic
content for web pages by creating html
templates on the server
express js simplifies debugging by
offering a debugging mechanism that can
pinpoint a particular area of the web
application that is causing problems
advantages of express.js
express.js makes developing node.js web
applications quickly and easily
express.js is simple to set up and
personalize
it allows to define application routes
using http methods and urls
express.js includes a number of
middleware modules that can be used to
execute additional request and responses
activities
it is simple to interface with a variety
of template engines including
jade vash and ejs
it allows us to specify middleware for
handling errors
express is used to make a rest api
server and it's simple to provide your
application static files and resources
databases such as mongodb
redis and mysql are simple to connect to
a express.js
now let us look at the demo on
typescript express the prerequisites are
we need to have an editor maybe visual
studio code then we need to have node.js
installed and a package manager
installed such as npm or yarn
so we'll jump into visual studio code
here i have created a new folder
named express typescript then we will go
to the terminal
next we'll run the command
npx
type script
hyphen init will initialize typescript
next to initialize the node.js
application we'll run the command
ian
init
once we have initialized the node.js
application we just need to click enter
just click enter
and we have successfully saved the
package.json file
next we need to make a new directory
we'll make a new directory source
next we'll install the touch cli
globally
with the command npm install
touch
cli
so after installing this we'll run the
command
touch
source inside the source folder we'll
create the file app.ts
so here you can see we have created the
file app.ts inside the source folder
so after this we will install typescript
to install typescript run the command
yarn
add
type script
node
dev
type script
hyphen d
so after this we need to install express
to install express run the command
yarn
space add
express
next we need to add node modules and
express modules for that run the command
yarn
add
type slash node
type slash express
so let us now go to the app.ts file
and
run the code
we will close this
so i'll copy paste a few lines of code
here
wherein i have imported express
module
the constant app creates an express
function
and we have express dot json
and we have returning a message hello
world
so we'll save this and we are running it
on the local host with port number 3000
so we'll save this
and
run it
to run it we'll just
run the command e on
def
so application is listening at the
local host 3000
so we'll copy this
and open in the browser
here we go it's showing the message
hello world
similarly we have routing
like this example with app.get and
app.host the app object provides a
collection of functions that attach
callbacks to http request made to define
destinations
and other http methods such as post put
patch and delete can also have callbacks
attached to them
the router object is another approach to
setup routing
you can call the get put and patch and
delete methods on a router object just
like you do on a app object
and similarly we have
request and response
so the request object holds information
about http request including headers
query strings and parameters
when when an http request is received
the response object represents the http
response that the application provides
similarly for response the send method
is the most significant one it sends the
http response to the client so that it
can be received
the function accepts a variety of data
kinds including strings objects arrays
and buffers
the send method finishes the response
process with data but you can
alternatively use the end function to
end it without any data
the request and response objects are
accessible to middleware function
it can join the request response cycle
at any point
a third argument that middleware
receives is the next function
the get callback which processes the
http get request that we wrote in this
example
is an example of middleware
it's highly unique middleware that only
works in one situation they can also
carry out more general duties
