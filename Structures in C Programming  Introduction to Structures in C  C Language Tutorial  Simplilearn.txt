hey guys welcome back to another video
by simply learn in today's video we're
gonna be learning all about structures
in c
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make
sure to hit the subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update so now
without any further delay let's begin
this session will help you to understand
what a structure is in c
then let's understand the general syntax
of structure declaration
after that assigning members of the
structure in c
later structure initialization and
finally structure within structure
now let's begin by understanding what a
structure is in sync
as we all know array is a collection of
elements of the same data type similarly
a structure is a collection of elements
with the same or different data types
for example
unlike an array a structure can have
members of different data types like int
float care etc
now let's have a look at structure
declaration in c
we use the struct keyword before the tag
name to define a structure tag name is
nothing but a structure name whatever is
declined inside the struct curly
brackets are members of the structure
once the members are declared the
variable has to be created to access the
members of the structure
now let's see the example
we have struck keyword followed by
student as a tag name then a list of
structure members
and they are name of type cad roll
number and age of type int and s1 as a
structure variable
we can have a list of structure
variables
another way of structure declaration is
we can declare structure variable
outside the curly brackets by using
struct keyword followed by a tag name
and then declare variable list
for example
struct keyword
then student tag name and s1 as a
variable name in structures in c
programming we cannot assign values
during the definition of a structure it
indicates the wrong way to the
declaration so now let us try to
understand the right way of assigning
values to the structure members insane
to assign values to all the members of a
structure and axis we use dot operator
also known as a period operator
look at the syntax below to clearly
understand how we access and assign the
structure members
first the structure variables followed
by the dot operator and structure
members
for example s1 dot roll number is equal
to 34 s1 dot 8 is equal to 18 and we
make use of the string function strcpy
to copy the name
next we have structure initialization in
c
we can also initialize the structure
variable and to initialize we can
directly assign values of all the
structure members inside the curly
brackets with an assignment operator for
example
struct storing s1 is equal to inside the
curly bracket enter the values separated
by comma operator
in this particular example name is john
the roll number is 22 and the age is 18.
now that we know how to declare and
initialize structure variables in c
let's see how the structure elements are
stored in the memory
as we know cad takes one byte of memory
space so according to the size of the
string the characters will occupy in the
memory
in structures the memory is created once
the structure variable is declared as
per this example s1.name is a string so
that memory will be allocated and its
base address will be obtained
for the s1 variable the total memory
allocated is 8 bytes that is
5 bytes for s1.net 2 bytes for s1 dot
roll number and 2 bytes for s1.8
so i think you got a good understanding
of how memories are located for the
structure elements
okay so let us move on to the structure
within structure in c
when a structure contains another
structure as a member it is known as a
nested structure or structure within a
structure
for example
let's consider a structure name student
and another structure name as a date
in this example a structured date acts a
member so a structured date has its own
members and they are date month and year
of type int and structure variable for
date is doj
and the structure variable is
initialized for both the members of the
structure that is name admission number
8 date month and year
now let's execute a simple structure
program
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free
visit skill up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know more
as you can see in this particular
program using the structure we have
initialized the variables and trying to
print the values
and by using the dot operator
we are accessing the members of a
structure so now let's run it
and here we got an output name roll
number and age of a student structure
in our next program using structure we
are using another way to declare
variable and initialize the structure
members
as you can see we have declared variable
outside the structure curly bracket
and inside the main function we have
initialized the structure members
so now let's run the program
so here we got the same output
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the structures in c
programming i hope this session was
informative and interesting until next
time thank you stay safe and keep
learning
