below to find the data analytics program
that fits your experience and areas of
Interest now without further delay let's
get started now let's understand why
powerbi is needed first powerbi has the
ability to access vast volumes of data
from mult multiple sources it allows you
to view analyze and visualize huge
quantities of data that cannot be opened
in Excel some of the important data
sources available in powerbi are Excel
CSV XML Json PDF Etc second powerbi
provides an easy to use drag and drop
tool with features and functionalities
that allow you to copy all formatting
across similar visualizations powerbi
has exceptional integration with Excel
it helps you gather analyze publish and
share Excel business data powerbi helps
to accelerate Big Data preparation with
Azor using powerp with Azor allows you
to analyze and share vast volumes of
data as your data leak can reduce the
time it takes to get insights and
increase collaboration between business
analysts data engineers and data
scientists powerbi allows you to get
insights from data and turn insights
into actions to take data driven
business decisions finally powerbi
allows you to perform realtime stream
analytics it fetches data from multiple
sensors and social media procces to get
access to real-time analytics so you are
always ready to make business decisions
now let's see what powerbi is powerbi is
a business analytics service provided by
Microsoft that lets you visualize your
data and share insights it converts data
from different sources to build
interactive dashboards and bi reports as
you can see we have an Excel data about
sales using this data powerbi helps you
build different charts and graphs to
visualize the data now that we have
understood what powerbi is let us look
at the important features of of powerbi
first is powerbi desktop powerbi desktop
is a free software that you can download
and it allows you to build reports by
accessing data easily for using powerbi
desktop you do not need Advanced report
designing or query skills to build a
report second as already discussed
powerbi supports stream analytics from
Factory sensors to social media sources
powerbi assists in real-time analytics
to make timely decisions third support
for multiple data sources is one of the
major features of powerbi you can access
video sources of data such as Excel CSV
SQL Server web files Etc to create
interactive visualizations and finally
custom visualization custom
visualization is another vital feature
of powerbi while dealing with complex
data powerbi default standard might not
be enough in some cases in that case you
can access the custom library of
visualization that meets your needs let
us jump into discussing the various
components of powerbi as you can see
there are six major components of
powerbi now let's discuss them one by
one first is power query power query is
the data transformation and mass up
engine it enables you to discover
connect combine and refine data sources
to meet your analysis need it can be
downloaded as an addin for Excel or can
be used as part of powerb desktop second
we have power pivote power pivote is a
data modeling technology that lets you
create data models it also allows you to
establish relationships and create
calculations it uses data analysis
expression language or Dax to model
simple and complex data third we have
power view Power view is a technology
that is available in Excel SharePoint
SQL server and powerbi it lets you
create interactive charts graphs maps
and other visuals that brings your data
to Life Next we have power map
Microsoft's power map for Excel and
powerbi is a 3D data visualization tool
that lets you map your data and plot
more than a million rows of data
visually on Bing maps in 3D format from
an Excel table or data model in Excel
then we have powerbi desktop powerbi
desktop is a development tool for power
query power pivote and Power view with
powerbi desktop you have everything
under the same solution and it is easier
to develop bin data analysis experience
finally we have power Q&A the Q&A
feature in powerbi lets you explore your
data in your own words it is the fastest
way to get an answer from your data
using natural language an example could
be what was the total sales last year
once you have built your data model and
deployed that into powerbi website then
you can ask questions and get answers
easily now let's see what powerbi
service is powerbi service is the
software as a service part of powerbi it
is also referred as powerbi online to
access powerbi service you need to log
into app. powerbi.com now let me show
you that I'll go to Google open a new
tab and search for app.
powerbi
it's
loading this is how the homepage of
powerbi service looks like I've have
created some dashboards on it first you
need to log to app. powerbi service you
can see I'm logged in now under my
workspace if I go to dashboard here I
have created a finance dashboard you can
see the different charts and graphs I
have prepared and pinned it to the
dashboard so powerbi service allows you
to connect to your data create reports
and dashboards and you can also ask
questions to your data now as you can
see in this dashboard we have created
some charts and graphs so this is a tree
map there's a pie chart there's a bar
graph below you can see there are line
charts and donut charts it tells you the
total sales that were made the total
number of unit solds the sales by
product sales by country sales by
segment and lots more one of the key
features of powerbi is creating
dashboards from multiple reports and
data sets powerbi dashboard is a single
page visualization to a story The
visualizations on a dashboard are
generated from multiple reports and each
report is based on one data set a single
page dashboard is known as a canvas the
visualizations you see on the dashboard
are called tiles these tiles are pinned
to the dashboard by report designers now
let me go back to my dashboard so this
is called a canvas and each of these are
called tiles so on the top you can see
we have three tiles now let's understand
how to create and publish reports in
powerbi dashboards powerbi allows you to
create different reports on powerbi
desktop these reports can be published
on the powerbi dashboard using powerbi
service here you can see there is a
powerbi report created on powerbi
desktop if you click on publish it will
take you to the powerbi service where
you can build a dashboard here is the
button for powerbi publish once you
click on powerbi publish it will take
you to the dashboard so this is a single
page powerbi dashboard on powerbi
service now let's understand the powerbi
architect Ure powerbi architecture is a
service built on top of a z there are
multiple data sources that powerbi can
connect to powerbi desktop allows you to
create reports and data visualizations
on the data set Power VI Gateway is
connected to on premise data sources to
get continuous data for reporting and
analytics powerbi services are basically
the cloud services that are used to
publish powerbi reports and data
visualizations using powerbi mobile apps
you can stay connected to their data
from anywhere powerbi apps are available
for Windows iOS and Android platforms
now let's look at a case study on how
Meer which is one of United States
largest Supermarket chains used powerbi
to solve its business problems initially
Meer had become dependent on its it
organization to extract insights from
its data it was timec consuming and
inefficient as you had to wait for it to
build every report Meyer was unable to
perform ad hoc and realtime analysis
easily so what Meer did was it connected
powerbi to an on premises SQL Server
analysis services Cube this allowed them
to refresh 20 billion rows of data in
near Real Time with powerbi teams can
now pull in the data faster and perform
real-time analysis to derive insights
from data a bakery department inside
Meer used powerbi to compare its sales
with regional performance they analyzed
where Meer was behind the regional
Trends focused on the problem and
created a solution with powerbi they can
now drill down into early sales and send
out a sales flash to 800 Mayo Business
Leaders so powerbi enabled them to
standardize data sources and Empower
store directors and team leaders to
develop and track their data to ensure
what they can improve now let's do some
practical Hands-On demo with powerbi so
this is how the powerbi desktop
interface looks like on the left you
have the report view the data View and
the model view the report view is where
you visualize your data with different
charts and graphs to build reports the
data view allows you to view the whole
data while the model view is where you
check if there are any relationship
between the tables on the right you can
see the different visualizations that
you can build we'll quickly run through
all of these in our demo so here you can
see there's a finance sample data that
will help you draw insights about the
sale of products in different countries
we will create a report to visualize
different charts and graphs and analyze
those sales so let me go to my powerb
desktop first we'll import our data so
let me go to our get data Tab and choose
Excel as my data source I click on Excel
so here is our finance sample data
we'll select sheet one you can see the
data here click on it and then select
load this might take some time to load
the data now if I go to my data tab you
can see the entire data set it has
Fields such as segment country in which
the sales was made the name of the
product the unit sold and the sales
price and many more let's start building
our report now I'll go to my report view
so first let me create a text box let me
resize it
let me name it as Finance dashboard
we'll increase the size of the text
we'll use Font consolas Center it we'll
also add a background to this we use
blue color change it to
White and increase the size now let me
first show you how you can create a
matrix I'll go to visualizations and
click on Matrix let me resize
it from the data sheet tab I'll select
sales and drag on to
values so you can see the total number
of sales that were made now let me do
some formatting so I'll go to the format
tab click on column headers let's add a
background color and let me increase the
text size to 20 similarly under values
we'll increase the size of the text to
20 as well we can also click on border
and choose the color of the the Border
we take as Let It Be black so this is a
simple Matrix that we created which
shows the total number of sees that were
made similarly let me choose Matrix once
again now we'll drag on the unit sold
onto values we'll continue with the same
drill under column headers We'll add a
background this time let's choose some
other color and under values let's
increase the size of the text to 20 even
for the column headers let's the size of
the text to
20 again we'll switch on Border me
resize a
bit so here we have two Matrix created
for our report the first Matrix shows us
the total sales that were made the
second Matrix shows you the total units
that were sold now let's move ahead and
create a simple bar chart so under
visualization I click on clustered
column
chart
under this we'll drag the date column
onto access and the sales onto value let
me expand it so it shows you the sales
per year this is the sales that were
made in 2013 and this shows you the
sales that were made in
2014 now there's a drill down option
which gives you more
granularity this depicts the sales back
water if I drill down further you can
see this shows you the sales by month
also you have some options like like s
by and S by sales so you can see October
month made the highest number of sales
moving ahead let me now create a pie
chart where we will see the sales by
different segments under visualization
I'll click on pie chart let me first
resize
it here I'll drag the segment column
onto the legend and the sales column
onto the values as you can see we have
the sales made by different segments
government segment made the highest
number number of sales with
44.2% now let me add a border to both
the visualization I'll click on the pie
chart and go to the format tab I'll
switch on the border similarly for the
clustered column chart I'll go to the
format Tab and click on Border let me
resize a bit all right next we'll create
a very simple table that will depict the
total sales made by each product so
under visualizations I click on table
let me bring this below
so from the data sheet I'll first drag
product onto values you can see the
different products and then sales just
below it so this depicts the total sales
that were made by each product and
finally it displays the total value of
the sales that were made this is same as
the one shown here now let's do some
formatting under format tab I'll go to
values and increase the text size to 15
make expand it also under column headers
I'll increase the text size to 15 then
let me go and add a
border now let me create a map that will
show you the sales that were made by
each country so first let me create a
new page and under visualization I'll
click on map now I'll drag the country
column onto
location so you can see we have our map
ready and we'll drag sales onto size you
can see the different countries and the
sales that they made if I move the map
you can see the sales made in the europ
region let me resize it I'll add a
border to
this now let me go ahead and create a
donut chart that will show you the
profit by each segment under
visualizations I'll click on donut chart
I'll move this to the top now from the
data sheet I'll add profit onto the
values and
segment onto the
legend if I expand this you can see
government segment made the highest
amount of profit with
65.4% let me resize this and we'll add a
border okay in the final visualization
I'll show you how to create a tree map
this tree map will tell you the total
amount of sales made by each product so
under visualizations I'll click on the
tree map and let me expand it I'll drag
Sals onto values and product onto group
so here you can see our tree map and the
sales made by each product you can see
now we have our report ready we have
created two separate canvas to visualize
our data now if you want to change the
color of These Bars you can simply go to
the format Tab and under data colors you
can choose whichever color you want in
powerbi desktop you have an option to
switch your theme this will make your
dashboard or the report look more
attractive so now we are under the
default mode Let's try out different
themes that's Frontier temperature solar
which is a little yellowish the one
which I like is tidle I hope this was
helpful in making you understand the
basics of powerbi and how it works you
learned the various features and the
components of powerbi and looked at the
architecture of RBI finally you saw a
demo to create a report using Finance
data set now now let's get started by
how to install powerbi in Windows
operating system to install powerbi go
to Google and search for powerbi desktop
download now click on the first link and
then you will be redirected to the
official web page of Microsoft powerbi
here you have to scroll a little towards
bottom and select your language which is
English and then click on
download this will give you two options
so based on your processor select one my
system is 64bit so I'll be selecting
this one now download the file will be
558 MB so it might take a little time
now you can see your Microsoft powerp is
getting downloaded so if we go into the
download section you can clearly see it
so here it is getting downloaded it
might take a little time now the file
has been downloaded just run the file
and you can directly go to next since
the default language is in English and
in case if you want to select a
particular language you can go to the
select language option and select your
particular language you're searching
for it might take a while there you go
so the installation process has been
started now you can click on next and
now you can read all the terms and
agreements and click on
accept you can change the location if
you want but I'll be keeping it as
default again if you want to create a
shortcut you can on desktop I'll keep it
as it is now install it might take a
while so power has got successfully
installed you can see the desktop icon
there double click on it and you can
start
powerbi so firstly it is open source if
you want to have a licensed version of
it just get the license or buy now
option and for now let's use the open
source version so this is the Baria
window and those are the charts and
these are the data connections if you
want to get connected to your data
sources you can also have shortcuts to
that now what are the steps to connect
to data so now we will go directly into
powerbi and try to import one by one few
most commonly and popularly used data
sets which are most commonly used uh in
a day-to-day activity rest of course
there are uh powerbi supports n number
of data sources uh but we will do
something practical on the most pop ones
so let's let's open our
powerbi now this is my powerbi and first
I want to show you that how can I import
data directly from a web page and import
the data now it is asking for a URL in
order to import data so what I have done
is I have created a Google Excel sheet
with simple data with rows and columns
and what I've done is I've have shared
this sheet as publish to
web okay so you just need to say publish
to the web the link as web page and say
done it's it's automatically published
and say link so copy the link which you
have published on the web copy this link
and then go back to your tblo paste it
link over here and click
okay
now powerbi will try to establish a
connection with this Google doc sheet
because it's published on the
web you need to wait for a while while
it is
reading okay now it has read one of the
HTML tables so I'll select this one now
you can see it has it is showing me a
preview of the table which is there on
my Google sheet right it has 11 rows so
it has all showed all the 11 rows so now
I can go and transform this data because
I can see my headers are there starting
from the second row so there's an
opportunity for me to transform the data
so I'll go and transform it so that it
looks
clean okay so first is I need to remove
the first row which is the
null row remove the top
rows okay and then I need to use the
first row now as a header so you just
click this option use first row as
headers that's it so now if you see my
row ID order ID order date ship date all
my data is now ready so I can say close
and
apply click apply
changes now this is an example of web
data import you can go and preview your
data right now uh the biggest advantage
of this data connection is that it's a
live data so for example I insert
another
row let me change the order
ID some some I've some changed some
basic stuff and
I it's Auto saved contrl s now I'll go
to my table and I'll
refresh now you can see as I refreshed
my power query editor I clicked refresh
all and I got my new row which is there
in the live data I got that fetched from
my okay I got that row the row row ID
number 12 so I I have to say close and
apply now you can see the new new row
the row number 12 is now available in my
new data set in the data set because
it's a live connection it's a live
connection with the web based Google
sheet okay so this is one important way
in which you can import data now let's
try to import data from a text file now
I have already prepared a text file
called sub categories.
txt now let me just open it in a notepad
now it's a very plain simple file tab
separated file in which you have product
sub category ID subcategory name and
product category key so basically to
which product category this particular
sub product belongs to right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go back to
my get data option and I'm going to
select text SL CSV
option and I'm going to select option
mod product sub categories.
txt okay so now powerbi has identified
that it's a tab delimited file it has
recognized the headers Etc right and I
can now directly load this
file okay so now once the data is
imported in powerbi it is like
IR relevant to me it's a composite data
in import I'm doing right so in my
presentation when I'm talking about
importing data there are different
importing modes right import data import
can happen through different ways
okay one is direct query mode in which I
create a live uh connection to the
database which I'll also show you uh
using MySQL and
mssql server and also you can do a
composite mode in which you can have
data imported from Excel plus you can
have direct query modes so you can have
multiple uh modes to connect and create
a composite data model and that's what
we are doing right now in our practical
so what we are doing over here is one we
have imported data from the web second
we have imported data from a text table
now after doing text now our our next
task is to import from CSV let's try
another one so now I have imported
product
subcategory now I'll
import a CSV file so again I'll choose
the option text / CSV and now in this
CSV file let me open this CSV file and
show you what in is
it so this is a list of all my products
product key product subcategory key
product uh stock key keeping unit Etc a
simple CSV file and I'm going to import
that okay so now it is identified the D
limiter is comma rather than a tab and
it has already recognized the headers
correctly so I'll load
it okay so now my products are there
product subcategories are there for
product categories now what I have done
is I have created us Excel mode now so
now Excel I'm using to import my product
category so now I have to click on the
option of import data from Excel and
I'll say product
categories select the sheet
load and now so my products product
categories product subcategories though
with different uh uh data storage types
but still now the data is imported into
powerbi it is a composite data model now
another very important data typee which
you can import is the PDF also right so
what I've have done is I have created a
PDF called customers my customers data
is lying in a PDF so what I've done is
I've created a
PDF which has data for some columns are
there like you know customer key prefix
first name last name birth date marital
status gender email address annual
income total children etc etc so this is
the data set which I have created in PDF
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
select PDF
now and import customers. PDF and see it
has recognized my table on page one
which I'm going to
load
okay you can rename this as
PDF table
so this basically these are the
different type
of
data types we have imported PDF Excel
text CSV and web page now let's take a
look at another interesting data set
which we want to import is the my SQL
Server data
set so what I have done is I've already
installed my SQL server on my local
instance and there's already a schema of
SQL live tutorial over there and I have
certain tables
already prepared over there like
Department employee Etc
so my goal is now to import this data or
create a live connection with this data
set now in order to
import my SQL database Connection in
powerbi you need to
First download
a connector my SQL powerbi connector so
you need to go to this
link and then click on download and
install the MySQL connector based on the
operating system you have you click on
download and install it after you have
done this go back to
powerbi and then give the IP address of
the database in my case it's there in
this local machine and the schema which
I want to import is SQL live tutorial so
I'll give the
name click
connect okay now it's connected so now
it is asking me which particular tables
you want to create a connection with I'm
choosing department and
employee and I'm just loading
them okay so now this is the exact data
which is there in the employee and
Department in my cull okay so this is
one example of how to create
connectivity between powerbi and
MySQL now I want to do the same thing
using SQL Server Microsoft SQL Server so
I have also installed Microsoft SQL
server on my machine and I have used the
SQL Express so this is the name of my
server so which I'll copy the server
name and go to get data select SQL
server and for now database is optional
I can say direct query click
okay okay now it is showing me what all
tables I can import so in my SQL Server
tutorial in my SQL Server I
have
I have these three tables customers
employee Tre Olympic events so I can use
probably the customers one which
is now you can see this is the data the
customers data which is lying in my SQL
Server okay so I can preview it and load
it so now you can you can preview the
data in uh powerbi that this is the data
so I can rename is customers from
mssql uh and this is
from my
SQL
and okay so now this is not the only uh
data sets you can import now if you take
a look at the option which powerbi gave
of what different type and variations of
data it can it has compatibility to
import
from okay so we can just take a look at
the categorization on the left hand side
first there are file based like Excel
text XML Json is also possible you can
evenly directly import entire folder and
uh within the folder whatever uh data
types of files are there it will detect
it
PDF Pary or even SharePoint folder which
is itself a
Microsoft uh technology then different
kind of databases SQL server and my SQL
we just saw but it's not only limited to
this you can connect to Microsoft Access
ssas Oracle database IBM db2 postgress
uh sbase Terra data and then sap uh uh
databases Amazon red shift Impala
vertica Snowflake and N number of
databases which are there in the market
today uh Amazon Etc then it also allows
you to connect with its own power
platforms powerbi platforms data Mars
powerbi data flows data vers Etc azour
there are different kind of storage uh
mechanisms in azour and azour itself is
a Microsoft Technology uh so it has a
compatibility with lot of azour uh based
data stor like aour SQ database blob
storage uh azour data braks right aour
HD Insight spark so if you have those
kind of services running on your AER
cloud services you can even import them
over
here now online services like you know
you have erps running uh or some data
which is shared on the internet if you
want to import it uh that is also
possible through certain products uh
Dynamics 365 Microsoft Exchange online
Salesforce Google analytics Adobe
analytics GitHub uh LinkedIn sales if
you want to do some analysis of some
social
networking uh you know feeds that also
you can
import then other miscellaneous are also
there web based Hive R script python
script if there's something to import
get data from uh Google Sheets like we
saw one example in our video right now
so there are multiple options
available now once you have imported the
data which is relevant to you um in our
subsequent sessions we will see how to
create relationships but just giving you
a glimpse that whatever data you're
importing powerbi autod detect certain
relationships and it will create for you
but then you can go and manually also
change so this is the composite data
model which is getting created in the
back end while you are importing the
data you can easily go and manage these
relationships either keep them as is you
can delete and create new ones manually
so there is no limitation in
that
so this is what we have witnessed we
have imported data from different files
types data types and then you know we
have tried to once it is imported into
uh powerbi then there is no limitation
of how you use it you can create
visualizations across different data
sets and then create
your standard
reports so this is the example of
importing data from web importing data
from a database from a
PDF and then once you have data you can
shape and combine data you can basically
do what whatever transformation you want
to do you want to uh make joins merge
the data so for example if we go back to
our powerbi and if I go back to my
transform data section now as I have now
different data sets available with me I
have
I can do any kind of U you know
operation transformation on the data
right uh so like I showed you I uh
upgraded the header row because one of
the imported data was not showing the
header correctly uh or this column like
this exact one column is extra I can
remove the
column right all those Transformations
whatever I do in the back end gets
captured in the applied steps section
right this is the customer data you can
create uh you can merge it you can
append it uh you know with other data
set right look for example I want to
create a merge data set of my categories
and subcategories so I can say mer
select the two data sets and say merge
queries as
new and I can select product categories
and product sub categories
select product category key on both the
side and then they do a left Auto so
whatever product categories are there
I'll get the subcategories associated
with it and I'll create a new table
which will
have now I have the table which has the
category and the subcategory and
subcategory in one table itself so I can
rename it now to as
category
subcategory table it's a it's a merge
basically it's a join between category
and subcategory and now I have a common
table right and I can close and
apply so imagine I have created a new
table which is imported created from one
data set is which is Excel page and
another data set which is text
base see this category subcategory table
so now I can use it the way I want in my
visualization reports so that's what the
presentation says right that once you
have uh the imported data you can shape
you can combine you can adjust you can
do whatever transformation you want to
do and create your visualization what is
powerbi it is a business intelligence
tool to visualize your data and share
insights across your organization so
when we talk about bi it came into
existence as a self-service bi tool and
it does have different components which
can be used now before we get into
details of powerbi let's understand what
are the different components or what are
the different ways in which you can work
on your powerbi now one of the main
challenges when it comes
to organizations or users is that data
is scattered in different places it
might be in different formats and anyone
everyone would want to use that data to
basically perform some
calculations create visualizations or
dashboards which could be interactive
and that's where they would want to
bring all the data in one place might be
transform it so that you can filter out
and not load huge amount of data in your
system and you can can work on selective
data so when it comes to powerbi it
helps us in ETL it helps us in data
modeling it helps in data storage and
Reporting so what are the benefits of
powerbi here are some of the benefits so
extract intelligence rapidly and
accurately so that's basically
transforming your Enterprise data into
Rich visuals and accurate reports for
enhanced decision making now one thing
we already know know that when we talk
about data data in raw format might have
lot of hidden information if we look at
different data sets which I'll show you
in the
process it might have lot of meaning but
then the real meaning comes out of the
data if we can create visualizations if
we can create relationships between
different data sets and thus that can
help us in enhanced decision making now
powerbi supports Advanced Data Services
it integrates seamlessly with Advanced
cloud services like Cortana to provide
results for the verbal data queries as
well when you talk about seamlessly
integrating with existing applications
that's one more benefit of powerbi so it
adopts analytics and Reporting
capabilities easily to embed interactive
visuals quickly in your applications you
can build rich personalized dashboards
so it basically provides a unified user
experience with customized dashboard and
reports that meet your exact needs it
also has a way where you can have secure
way of publishing your reports so you
can set up automatic data refresh and
rapidly publish reports allowing
multiple users to Avail the latest
information across your organization or
across your working
community so powerbi can connect to
different sources we'll see that in a
while so basically you have an option
which says get data and that basically
opens up a window where you can find
different type of data sources such as
Excel your CSV or text Json
PDF getting data from databases or
directly accessing data from databases
now before we get further into
understanding how powerbi looks like it
would be good idea to share information
and how you can set that up on your
machine so when it comes to your powerbi
and let me open up a notepad
here so for example I bring up a notepad
let's say when you talk about your
powerbi
components so you basically have powerbi
desktop and that's mainly your
playground or that's mainly used for any
kind of development
activities you have your powerbi
server or you can say service now this
one is where you would make
Reports
online and
share or make them
[Music]
available to different
buus now that's one more component of
powerbi and then you also have your
power bi mobile which is mainly for
viewing the information or I would say
viewing reports so these are the three
main components we can also look at the
licensing information of these so these
are the mains so powerbi desktop is
something which you can set up on your
laptop or on your machine powerbi server
is where you can login with your user
idid and password and powerbi mobile is
mainly to view your reports now how do
you set this up before you can explore
or start working on powerbi so here is a
link which you can basically use so if
you look into this so this one basically
says Service s Service sign up for
powerbi it says sign up of powerbi
service as an individual normally when
you would want to use powerbi you can
use a website called
HTTP and then you have
basically app and let's say I think it's
called app powerbi.com now this is the
place where you can basically login now
if you see here I have created an
account and if you look at my account it
says auat l. onmicrosoft.com now how do
you get this kind of email because when
you talk about powerbi it will expect
you to have a official ID and it does
not take IDs which are from common
domains such as Google or Yahoo and so
on so this particular link gives you an
idea how you can do that so basically
you have what is powerbi basic
explanation on that it says signing up
for powerbi service so powerbi desktop
it's a totally free download and then
you have mobile apps also a totally free
download and here it says that what kind
of email addresses it supports and if we
look into this you have to either sign
up because that does not accept your
private email IDs or you can go for this
one which says enroll US government
organization and this is where you can
basically sign up for powerbi so it
basically says try free if you go to the
website say powerbi Microsoft . or you
could go into this one which I was
saying
HTTP SL SL app
do your powerbi.com and this is what you
can use or as mentioned you can go to
powerbi.com for example if I open this
in a different tab it takes me to powera
Microsoft I can say start free I can
click on this it says Drive free but
then when it asks you to sign in this is
where some of us face problem because it
does not take your private email ID now
how do you tackle that what you can do
here is on this page which says learn
about alternate ways to sign up you can
basically open up this link and in this
link it says sign up for powerbi with a
new Microsoft 365 trial account and what
you can do is you can basically click on
this link which takes you to The Office
365 and what you can do here is you can
search for something which says say 365
E3 and here you have tried for
free so in my case it is translating
okay so here you have an option which
says tried for free click on this one
and then basically go ahead with your
sign up process now once you do that you
can basically create an account or give
a email ID so it asks you to give an
email ID to check if you already have an
account and once you do that it will
guide you through the process where you
can create an account like I have done
now once you have done that so for
example we can go into my this page
which I said HTTP SL
slapp powerbi.com
now once you have created an account you
would be asked to login now I can click
and login here and then basically given
my password and once I do that it takes
me to the powerbi server or service now
on the top right it might say that go
for a trial version I have already
selected that and this is a Pro trial
which is giving me validity for 60 days
so this is the service which I can use
now now what it means is I can be using
my powerbi desktop which would be also
installed so once you log into this page
you can basically click on apps you can
basically search for something like
powerbi and that will show up an app and
you can install and download on your
machine now once that is there you can
basically bring it up so for example in
my case I can just say power bi desktop
and that's the app which I have
installed on my machine and basically
that comes up so that's your powerbi
desktop which is coming up and it will
still ask you to sign in so that you can
share your information through powerbi
so you see here on the top I'm already
signed in and here it also shows you
some tutorials and videos which
basically helps you in getting to know
something more or what's new so you can
always browse that so you would have
your powerbi desktop which would be set
up you would also have your powerbi
service which would be running and then
basically whatever you have developed on
your powerbi desktop you can share that
through the powerbi service now usually
when you talk about licensing I can give
you brief insights here so you basically
have Your powerbi Service as I said
licensing so you have the pro version
which is
basically uh your
$9.9 per user per month and basically it
has some kind of limitations so it has
say Max 10 gab you can work on uh some
features like incremental refresh is not
allowed you can always look onto the my
Microsoft website for more details and
in those kind of cases you usually go
for the premium account if you are a
extensive user and premium account
basically is conditional based so it
depends on your requirements and then
basically you pay for the service what
you use so that's mainly about your
servicing now when you talk about your
server and Service as I said it is
basically making your reports online and
sharing and making them available to
different buus so that is the Highlight
so when you talk about sharing reports
that's one of the things you have
anomaly
detection that's also possible here you
can talk about automation of reports you
have security that is you can go for
role based or roow level based kind of
security implementation and all those
are some of the features of your powerbi
server and service so it is good to know
and basically have your desktop and
powerbi Service setup now once you have
that then you basically have your
powerbi now when you talk about your
powerbi it basically helps you with
various things so this is how easily you
can have it set up and then basically
you can explore this so for example as I
was saying powerbi can connect to
different data sources sources now I do
have an option here which says get data
I can click on this and that shows me
all the different data sources I can
even click on more if I'm interested in
looking what more powerbi desktop tool
helps me to do so it shows me all the
different ways in which you can get the
data you see here the servers so the
database Services your folders your
different formats you can click on file
formats or databases
you can look at Power Platform so if
basically you are connecting to a
platform and getting some Services you
can connect to the cloud that is aure
you have online services and then you
have other options so these are all the
ways in which you can get your data when
you talk about visualizations you see a
lot of visualization options here which
can be used once your data is loaded and
I will explore and explain more about
this so you have something called as
insert wherein you can go in for
different visuals or different types you
can also get into say transform the data
now that basically is going to pop up
and bring a power query editor now
that's where lot of your ETL Works
happen so when you when you do a
transform data it opens a power query
editor which we can use to transform the
data or change the data or modify the
data as per our requirement before for
loading all of it into our powerbi so
you also have option here which says
modeling where in we can create new
tables or we can work on our data where
we can manage relationships so as of now
we don't have any data so it does not
show this one as activated but that can
be activated this is where you can view
your reports so this is in short
exploring your powerbi we'll see what
are the different options which we can
use here so it basically supports
different kind of data so when we look
at the visualization pane that basically
allows us to create different kind of
visualizations here and we will
understand that so you can basically
visualize on your different data and
create different kind of charts graphs
maps and basically derive insights from
your data now when you talk about data
models that's where you can basically
establish relationship so when you talk
about data models it is basically used
to connect multiple data sources to
build a relationship now we might have
different data sets or we might have
data coming in from different tables
where we may want to
basically get insights or get data from
multiple data
sources for our purpose now in that case
data models do help us so for example if
you have two tables let's look at the
standard tables so you have products
lookup table and you also have the sales
table now usually what you have in any
kind of scenario is if we basically say
you have your data tables so that's
basically where your data resides and
then you have have series of your lookup
tables so usually you might have say
your data tables here and this is what
I'm talking about which might have some
data for example let's say sales is one
of them you might have some other data
table which might be for example let's
say budget table or might be something
else and these are your data tables now
at the other end you might have your
lookup tables so basically you have
various lookup
tables and these lookup tables for
example let's say this one is
customer this one is
territory let's say this is
product and let's say this one is a
calendar so these are basically my
lookup
tables so we can basically as I said
your data might be coming in from
different sources let's say database or
let's say some kind of files or let's
say some kind of systems what you have
so your data might be coming in from
different places now you might want to
transform the data so this is where I
could say there is your query editor
which I was explaining so you have your
query editor which basically allows you
to edit the data table or basically
allows you to edit the data before it is
loaded right you can hide a column you
can add a new column you can modify your
column so your query editors would be
basically used to work on the data which
goes into your data tables now you might
have lot of lookup tables as I said so
let's say these are my lookup
tables and these are my data tables so
what we need is sometimes we need
information based on our lookup tables
and data tables now that's where data
modeling comes into picture so basically
if I would want to extract information
from here so I can notice that there is
a product key here and there is a
product key here now this is where we
are already talking about say foreign
keys or we are talking about your
relationships right now when you talk
about relational databases you have
something called as foreign key
constraints which is in in powerbi terms
I would say it's not exactly a
constraint but it is more of a filter
propagation instead which is used to
basically connect your different data
sources and you could have basically
crossfilter directions you can go for
single or one to one or one to many or
many to many kind of relationships which
basically allows you to work on the data
so we will learn more about data models
when we are doing a quick demo there
where we can talk a little bit about
normalization and
denormalization the way the data exists
right and then you basically would want
to gather insights from your data so
when you talk about your two data
sources as I said so you have a products
lookup table you have a sales table now
if you would want to calculate the total
order quantity of each product name
which is we are talking about the order
quantity as a information here and you
have product name here now how do you
get that information what we see here is
we would want something like this or we
would want more information so how do we
do that so what we can do is the order
quantity for each product is BAS
basically showing us the same value now
this is because the product and sales
tables are not connected and there is no
relationship between them or even if you
would want to take two sources and just
get information out of them powerbi I
would complain that there is no
relationship established between them so
what we do is we create a data model so
what we do is we build a relationship
between both the tables using a common
key column which exists in both cases
as I said there is a product key here
there is a product key here so that
basically allows us to have a
relationship between these two now that
could be one to one this could also be
related to other tables so it could be
one to many you could have many to one
so all those relationships are possible
so product key is basically used to
create a relationship you see the arrow
Mark and then there is also this star
which can basically mean one to many now
when the product key is used to join
these two tables or form a relationship
then we can look at the product names
and the order quantities which basically
gives me a total now that's the basic
use of your data models now what about
this Dax so basically data analysis
Expressions now that's say library of
functions and operators that can be
combined to build formulas and
expressions and power VI desktop usually
when we work on our data sources when we
would want to connect them it
automatically shows us these data
analysis Expressions however this gives
us extension it basically gives us more
power to work on our data now sometimes
instead of working on Dax or Dax
Expressions it would be good to go for
better data modeling and have the
relationships established better and
sometimes when the relationships are
established you could use your tax which
basically gives you more power on
working on your data so your values are
calculated based on information from
each row of a table it appends values to
each row in a table and stores them in
the model it increases the file size so
that's what happens now you can right
click on any column to add a new column
and for example in this one it shows
that there was a quantity type
calculated column which was based on the
calculation what we see here on the top
in the in the expression bar which says
what kind of calculation was performed
and that basically gives us the value
for quantity type and that is basically
added here to our existing data so
that's the power of Dax and powerbi so
you also have something called as uh
measures so Dax allows you to create new
calculated columns and measures so
basically here if you see we are working
on AW score sales and then we have
selected quantity sold and what we are
looking in the report is we can
basically right click on any table name
to add a new measure here so we have
added what we call as quantity sold as
the measure so values are calculated
based on information from any filters in
the report we will see this how this can
be done and that basically here the
measure does not increase the file size
it does not create new data in the table
themselves in comparison to what we were
seeing earlier that is your calculated
columns so these are your type of Dax
functions so Dax allows you to create
new calculated columns and measures so
you have dat and time which basically
allows you to work on date and time data
or Fields you have logical functions
which allow us to create new filters or
add more filters to our data you have
text functions which basically allows us
to say transform the data into a lower
case or an upper case or basically get
the length of a string or concatenate
two fields or basically uh do a
filtering based on some criterias or
replacing some content you also have
statistical functions which can be used
you have information functions which can
be used so these are different types of
Dax functions which we can use in
powerbi so we will learn more on powerbi
through a quick demo where we can U use
some data sets and those data sets could
be found on internet although I can also
upload that on a GitHub link and you
will have access to those data sets so
let's learn about powerbi through a
quick demo by uploading some data sets
and playing with those data sets let's
look at a sample data set and let's
upload it and as I explained while
uploading let's also transform the data
so that we can have selective fields or
selected data loaded here instead of
loading the complete data set and then
let's see how we can visualize this or
how we can use the information in this
data set now what we can do here is we
can click on get data and then we can
choose one of the data formats which we
would be looking for so for example I
can go for Excel and basically click on
this now here are some of my data sets
so let's look into the folder here and
these data sets are also available on my
GitHub link which I'll share with you
later so here we have something called a
super store let's click on this and here
I already have a data set which is
global super store or I also have
selective data so let's select this one
click on
open now that's basically connecting to
my data source and that will show me
what does that Excel sheet have so it
has different tabs which is orders
people and returns so let's s
orders and that basically gives me a
preview of the data which I have and if
you scroll all the way to write it shows
me city state and then country and if
you see here we do see information of
all the countries now this can be huge
amount of data which may which we would
want look into but say for example my
use case is that I'm interested in
looking for the data for United States
and uh as a country and all its states
so we will do that when we do a
transform now we can also select the
returns Tab and that shows me these
three Fields however the first row
should have being the heading of this uh
particular data set and we will
transform that now I can go ahead and
click on load but that will load all the
data so instead of that let's go for
transforming so let's click on trans
form data now once you do that it brings
you your toolkit that's brings you your
power query editor which allows you to
transform your data so for example we
have uh data from returns tab or returns
data source as you see here so we see
column 1 column two and column three and
that also shows the type of the data
here it also gives me a quick small
option here let's select this and then I
can say use first row as header now
there are various other options which
you can do you can add a custom column
you can add column with examples you can
keep the top rows you can remove the top
rows you can keep errors keep duplicates
so there are different ways and you can
also do a merge query or a pend query so
as of now let's just say use first row
as headers and that basically shows that
now my first row has become the header
you ALS o see in the applied steps it
basically tells me if I have changed the
type of the data if I have made any
other changes those steps will get added
here so it basically shows me the name
as it returns it shows me applied steps
where I've changed the type and now I
basically have this information now this
is something where you can change the
type or you can basically set it to a
particular format however we are not
doing anything of that sort right now so
we can do that for any of these columns
so this looks good when it comes to
orders let's click on this and as I said
I would be interested in selecting for
country as United States only and let me
just work on that data however we can
work on all the data so let me scroll
all the way to right and here I have the
country now there are these filters
which we can use so basically I can
click on this and that shows me all the
countries are selected now there is also
something called as text filters which
we will see how we can use to select
particular data I basically have other
ways of filtering the data so for
example now I will just uncheck this
select all and what I would be
interested is in United States so let's
type it here that shows me has an option
here select this and and then basically
say okay so that should basically now
filter out and it shows me the data is
United States only and then you have
different states and rest of the data
remains so if you look at the applied
steps it tells me that there are
filtered rows now we have done the basic
transformation for this data set on
these two data sources that is orders
and returns so here you have an option
with says close and apply so close the
query editor window and apply any
pending changes you can click on this
and it says apply so for example I can
just say apply for now and that should
basically apply the
changes which I have performed using my
query editor that is I have transformed
the data so that I can have selective
data uploaded in my powerbi now it's
doing that it shows me it is working on
both of these data sources that is
orders and returns so that's done and
now basically if there are any other
pending changes we can just do a close
and apply so that basically has closed
and now you would see the data appearing
here so I have uploaded the data as per
my preferences now if you click on the
data tab here so it basically shows you
your data fields it might take some time
to populate but if you see in the
country field now if even if I click on
the filter it just shows me United
States now that's what we wanted so we
have already uploaded this data in
orders you can always expand the option
here which shows me all the fields which
are there in this might be this is an
aggregation might be that's an order
date so this is again some kind of
aggregation we can change the data types
so we are looking at all the fields in
my orders table or basically coming from
the orders data source I also have
returns which shows me three fields and
that shows me the data which is returned
order ID and region so the column names
are applied correctly as we want and
that basically looks fine now we can
also look at
your model so when you click on model it
shows me these two however there is no
as of now relationship established
between them so it says under properties
select one or more model objects to set
their properties so right now these are
not related there is no relationship
established between them so if I would
want some data which relates to orders
and returns then that would fail because
it would say there is no relationship
now I can go to the first option which
says report and we have not created any
report here although we can create a
simple report we can look at the data so
we have our orders field now we can
basically pull out some information from
here we can choose what kind of report
we may want to create so for example
let's go for uh the table option from
visualizations you have various options
here which we can use this is where you
can do a formatting this is where you
can select the fields this is where
where you can search and filter out the
data you can also add data fields here
so first let's click on table and that
basically gives me a table now this
table as of now does not have anything
so you can use the filter and
slices option here which will affect the
visualization or basically what you can
do is now since we have orders here so
this is my orders and I would like to
work on this so let's say for example
country is I can select country as a
field and if you say it shows me country
is all as of now and it says the value
is United States what I can also do is
I'm interested in the states so I have
state now I can basically drag and drop
it here and then the state gets added
here so I can basically say select all
and that should basically take care of
my State field being added here so state
is all country is all now we can
basically look at something else so
might be let's choose sales and I can
just drag and drop sales here so that
basically says if you would want to have
any kind of advanced filtering which
says filter type so go for advanced
filtering is less than or equal or you
can also go for for advanced filters so
that's fine as of now so we have added
some Fields here and that's
basically my data here so let's go for
filters
here which basically should select all
my
Fields now if you see the visualization
shows my country sales and state which
we had either by selecting the fields
and dropping them here or you can in
this section where it says field so you
can for example let me show it again so
I can just delete this I can click on
the table option I can just drag it here
I can basically make it bigger and I
need to add data to this one so it says
add data fields here so now let's say
country is what we are interested in we
are also interested Ed in
States so let's drop that here and let's
say sales so this is also what I'm
interested so I'm looking at one
specific country I'm looking at sales
per state and when we look at sales it
basically tells me that this is
summation so you will basically get the
total sales which have happened now we
are looking at this data here we can
always go to formatting we can click on
grid we can basically increase the font
here we can change the grid color so for
example let's make it for example
blue so I can just select
this and it should basically allow me to
have the grid color as blue now I can go
in for the grid thickness I can go for
rope padding outline color so we can
basically make it a little bit more
readable and then we can basically
increase the font size here to look at
the
information and you have other options
here so what would you want to do with
column headers so I can basically have
the font color background color is fine
do you want to have an outline do you
want to have a change in font what is
the text size might be we can make the
heading a little bigger and then
basically you also have the field
formatting so all those could be done
you could go for background and all
these things can be done in formatting
so now we already have our data here and
this basically looks good and this is
basically one of my visuals which I have
here and this has given me some
information for sales and basically I
can scroll this I can also make it
bigger
so I could select a particular field if
I'm more interested in looking at the
information for a particular State now I
can add more fields to this so this is
my one of the reports which I have
created now what I can do with this
report is I can basically have more data
fields I can add filters to this I can
basically look into all the data here by
just clicking somewhere in the grid but
somewhere outside if you select a
particular row then that data shows up
here you have an option of focus mode
which you can go for you can look at the
other options which says export data now
if this is the data which you are
interested in you can export it you can
always do show as a table if you are
interested in you can do a sort by
country sales or state so for example
let's do a sorting by
state and that basically gives me the
data which has been sorted by state
information now we could obviously have
the information here so I can then
change the order so it shows me
alphabetically this is the information
which I have so I've created a simple
visualization using the data which I
have and what I can do is I can click on
save so that basically asks me to save
this as a powerbi file which has an
extension of PB iix and I can basically
call it my report so let's say first
report and here I can say country or I
can say
state wise sales in
USA let's say USA and and that basically
is my first
report
now once you have saved this report you
can always look on your machine for
example if I go in here and if I go into
this folder might be I should look on
desktop and this is where I should have
saved it so it shows me first report
statewise that will open up in powerbi
and we have created a simple report
which We have basically used by taking
our data now I can also do is I can
publish this if I would want to share
this information so publish this report
online in powerbi service you can
basically
select your report what we have here and
I clicked on publish so it says what's
the destination so you can have
different workspaces I will choose the
default that's my workspace I can click
on select now it says publishing first
report statewise sales in USA to powerbi
you can create a portrait view of your
report and you can do all that stuff so
let it publish and then we can basically
look into our powerbi server that's our
service where the information is already
shared or published I would say which
can then be shared with different
sources so we can come here
and basically I can look into the
powerbi and this is where I will be able
to look into my workspaces and let's
look in my workspace so it says this is
the place where I had initially
downloaded powerbi data set it says your
data set is ready let powerbi help you
explore your data right so you can
always do this you can click on view
data set which basically allows you to
bring out your work space and first
report state wise sales now that's the
report which we have published so let's
first check in our desktop if that's
done so it
says success open first report in
powerbi now I can click on this one
straight away and that takes me to my
service now once it takes me to the
service it shows me the report which we
created which we published and it
basically has the option where I can
save it
as a a different copy or give a
different name I can embed this in diff
in a website or a portal like can
publish to
web embed this report for Public Access
by anyone on the internet we can do that
we can export it to PowerPoint so we can
do all these options you also have an
option of view where you can change the
view you can basically also edit report
here so you can do that if you are in
interested in something specific you can
do a sharing to teams so if you have
your teams or group setup you can share
it with them you have an option of
common pains you can basically view
usage metrics report now that can be
sometimes helpful you can basically go
ahead and go and subscribe a particular
report so if there are new changes made
you will be the one who will be informed
you can click on share now if I click on
share here from my service it says only
users with powerbi Pro will have access
to this report recipients will have the
same access as you unless Ro level
security on the data set further
restricts them so I can grant access and
this is where I will have to give the
email IDs of the people with a message
that I would want to have them look at
this
report right you can also allow
recipients to build new content using
the underlying data sets and you can
send an email notification to the users
as of now I don't have any other groups
so I'll not be sharing it but I have
created a simple report now let's also
look at edit report let's just to see
what it helps us and when you click on
edit report it basically brings up this
one which says your file view it gives
you the filters it basically allows you
to add data fields to this so it is
basically giving access to these data
sets which were in my desktop it is
basically allowing you to give or create
different
visualizations now here we have the data
which we are looking at and if say for
example somebody is interested in
filtering the data so you could do that
so you could click on filter here and
that basically applies this is the
filter we have now country is fine sales
might be I can click on sales and I
would say okay let's look at sales which
is more than a particular amount so we
can say is greater than and might be I
can give a number here so I can say
30,000 and
basically I can say apply
filter so right now I'm applying filter
and I would look at the values which
also shows me the total value is changed
so you have not only created a report
you have published it and now from the
service you can edit it so I'm looking
at particular data here and then
basically I can click on file and I can
save it or I can say save a copy of the
report and let's say I will call it the
same name so I'll say
first
report score state wise sales and I will
say modified so let's do a
save and the report has been
saved so now you're looking at the data
here so that is basically giving you
information so when I click on my
workspace
here I can click on reports and that
does show me my previous report it shows
me the modif report it gives me an
option of looking at the usage metrics
report so say for example you want to
click on this one and it will basically
give you the usage metrics so let's
click on this one and that basically
shows me the report usage metrics which
is generated so views per day unique
viewers per day you would want to look
at the different platforms who was using
it views by user and this can be
sometimes useful if we we would want to
look into this one now I can go back to
my workspace I can click on reports and
that basically took me to usage metrix I
could be sharing it I can analyze in
Excel I can look for quick insights
based on this data what we have you can
basically look at the related
information you can also look at the
settings of this one and basically this
is how you have your data report here
now that also shows me the data sets
option so which basically gives me the
data sets which can be used to create
further reports and we have our data
here so for example if I click on create
report it basically gives me these data
sets and we can continue working on this
so this is how I have a simple report
created without basically working on two
different data sources but I have
selected some data here and then I can
basically add details to this so for
example now if we look at orders and say
for example this is the data I have and
say you would want to add some Fields so
let's go to returns and say for example
I would be interested in looking at the
the products so might be what I should
do is is I should replace the report
here instead of country it would be
interesting to look at the product which
we have or basically customer ID so we
can look at customer ID we can look at
the order ID which would be interesting
to see if there is a particular order
what was the sales which was generated
and if there were any returns which were
happening on that so for example here
when I have these let me cut out country
as a field and I will basically take
order ID and place it here so now if you
see my data has been easily modified so
I have my order ID I have sales and I
have statewise information so you have
basically all the information but this
is now order ID State and so on now what
if I would want to also see based on the
order ID if I say I would want the
returned field so for example I would
want to take this one and let's drag and
drop it here now that says cannot
display the visual now why is that so if
you click on C details that says cannot
determine relationships between the
fields so it cannot display the data
because powerbi cannot determine the
relationship between two or more fields
and how do we fix that so for example if
I click on F fix this now it says there
is a missing relationship between these
fields use autod detect to search for
relationships or create them manually
now I can click on autod detect which
will try to search for fields which
exist in both the data sets or basically
I can create relationships so let's
click on create relationships and that
basically takes me to this page which
says there are no relationships defined
from table to table and so on so I can
click on
new now here it says select the tables
and the columns that are related now I
can say orders now those are my Fields
where you have order IDs and it
automatically shows that returns also
has an order ID field although all the
values might not be same but this is how
you can create a relationship and it
says the cardinality says many to one so
you can have BAS basically many to one
relationship you're saying cross filter
Direction is single so make this
relationship active and it has already
helped us basically identifying the
field so I can say okay so it says now
these two tables should be related or
should be connected based on order ID
so here we have this and let's basically
say
close now once that is done if you
see I have order ID I have returned I
have sales column and I have state and
if you see in returned I do have a value
of yes which shows this particular order
ID had generated some sales and it was
for state Alabama and it was returned
and the value is yes so if you scroll
down you basically see all the values
now we can add different filters where
we can say I would want only yes and no
now this is again an interesting report
so let's go in also into the
formatting and what we can do is we can
look at say the grid option if we would
want to basically say vertical grid and
let's
say on and it says vertical grid color
so let's select this might be I can try
doing a black here it puts it in a right
nice table format and that basically
looks good so you have sales returned
and so on and this is basically the
order which I'm seeing here so for
example if I would want to change the
order and if I'm saying okay I would
like to look at sales and returned and
so on so we can be doing that we can
come here and say for example I have
sales and returned let's try moving the
sales column over here might be state is
uh an information which we would want in
the beginning so let me also move the
states all the way here so it gives me
state it gives me the order ID sales and
if there was a return which was
happening on that particular product so
easily I've modified my report now what
I can do is I can just save
it and I can do the same thing so I can
publish it I can basically continue
using it or I can work on a new report
so let's continue learning and uh now
here we will also see how you can load
some data and perform some
Transformations and basically get
multiple results or multiple tables or
multiple data sets which can be then
further used for reporting so powerbi
does give you a lot of options now here
you have an option as we saw earlier
that is get data or what you can do is
you have an option where you can create
new data also which says enter data now
this is something which can be easily
used if you have relatively less number
of fields so you can basically add more
columns here and you can basically add
values so for example if I would just
call it something
like um scientist
ID okay and then I can say scientist
name and then basically I can say uh
[Music]
domain and then I can say for example
let's say ear or of joining and and I
can keep adding the number of columns
here I can delete the columns right and
I can give this and I can say country so
that's it and now we have created these
five countries uh sorry five columns
which we have given some names and we
can start entering some values so I can
basically say let this scientist ID
be
2234 I can give some name so let's give
Peter let's say domain and I can say
biotechnology I can give year of joining
2011 and I can say Germany as the
country and I really don't want this
particular column so I can go ahead and
delete this now I can come here and then
I can give something else so I can say
this is scientist ID I can give
John let's say the scientist is mainly
working in
physics and then I can say
2018 and let's say
France and go back here and let's
say
4567 and let's say Marie and let's say
uh she does her research in uh molecules
and let's call it 2000 one and let's say
Italy okay and you can continue adding
datas in this way now you can say if the
data is already here so I can say for
example no I do not want this particular
row I do not want this particular row so
you can basically keep adding values
here now you can say edit so here we
have to give some Nam so let's say
scientist okay and then if you choose
edit it basically brings up your powerbi
editor which allows you to work on these
fields if you would want to make some
changes now we can make some changes
here we can see what are the number of
rows we can basically perform any kind
of transactions here so this one
basically tells me what is the data type
so here we see scientist ID and this
clearly tells me this is an integer
however we will not want to do any kind
of computations here so we can as well
change this so I can just do a right
click and I can work on this particular
column what I can also do is I can just
click on this and this tells me that you
would want to change it to date time or
you want to change it to some number so
I can just say string because we are not
going to perform any computation here so
on the ID column so let's say text and
I'm changing it so it says replace
current add a new Step so selected
column has an existing type conversion
would you like to replace the existing
conversion or preserve the existing so I
will say replace current and now the
data type has been changed it is of a
string and if you see this step has got
added did here so it says that the
change type is the kind of
transformation we did here so that's
fine now what we can also do is we have
the scientist name but we don't like the
column name here so it would be good to
change this so there is something called
as remove or remove columns and so on so
when you do a right click it gives you a
lot of options in applying filters or
doing some transformation if I just just
click on this one so what I can do is I
can look at the date time and let's go
here so we have an option which says do
you want to change the type now we could
have done that here or like I said you
could choose the time and do it you can
just say transform and how do you want
to change it so do you want to change it
to uppercase well you can do that and
changes all the values of this one what
I can do is I can again do a right click
and I can choose basically if you would
want to clean up the data or if you
would want to convert to lower case you
want to capitalize each word so let's
choose that and if you see here the
steps are getting added now to undo any
particular step if I just cancel this
then I'm back to this if I cancel this
I'm back to my original form so you can
anytime undo your changes and you can
basically work on this so we are working
on this particular column now there are
various other options that you can look
at so for example these are this is some
of my data but it does not have much
information it would be good to load
some bigger data set and then use these
Transformations or basically working on
changing the data types as I mentioned
or if you would want to do a filter
and remove certain fields and only
select particular Fields if that's what
you're interested doing a right click
where I want to create a copy of this
and then basically I can use that
particular copy now what I can also do
is I can add column from examples I can
duplicate column and then I can make
some changes to that so this is my
duplicate column and say for example you
would want um this one to be changed so
we can say remove duplicates we can
basically if you're doing some kind of
change you want to change the format
here you can do that you can use for
other things like filling up and all
that now I can just call it rename and
let's say um Alias scientist name right
and I can continue adding columns or I
can do some Transformations and once you
have done with these transactions now
this one if you see it shows as integer
but is it an integer no this is an date
format so I can go for modeling and
change the formats what I can also do is
I can select this and it says it's not a
decimal it's not a fixed decimal it is
date time it is date it is date time and
time zone right and you can select any
one of these so for example let's make
it date which makes it more meaningful
but then what happens is when you do
this it is going for the default dates
or the older dates so I don't like that
so what we will have to do is we will
have to basically transform this and
here we have transform you have change
type so you have date and time you have
date you have time so let's choose date
and time and if you see here it gives me
some default timing based on on these
values which we do not like so again
filter it out but what we can do is we
can just make sure that this is changed
or you want to make it a string because
we are not going to do any computation
here so I can keep it as date but then
if I have more Fields like month and
days and so on then you can do that so
here it also has the options so when you
have selected this you have an option
called transform and transpose uh sorry
transform also has various options which
allow you to work on these do you want
to do some scientific calculations do
you want to work on the date field so as
of now it is just integer so we can use
one of these we can do a group by but
obviously we don't have much data here
so as of now let us retain this I can
just change this to text and that's okay
because we are going to look at this
later we can add more data and work on
it so as of now once we have done all
these changes you can go back to say
home and here you have close and apply
and I can basically say close and apply
so the changes will be applied and then
my new table which we just created by
entering some random data performing
some basic
Transformations will be available so if
you look into this
one so that's where my data is it shows
me the columns but there is no
aggregated column as such here you don't
see any summation Mark you just see the
field names or the column names you see
the values now obviously if you go into
modeling there is no or there is no
existence of a different table which you
can join these tables or you can perform
some transactions come back to the data
set so this looks good and we have it
here now obviously we have not created
any visualization based on this which we
can and we can continue working on it so
here this is my data set which is a
small table where we have created some
data and we can use it anytime now let's
work on a bigger data set and see what
kind of Transformations we can do we can
then also see on modeling or basically
using some smarter ways of working with
the
data so what we would want to do is we
would want to load some data here so
let's go
[Music]
into sorry let's go into home let's go
to get data let's use our old store data
and I'm going to take the global super
store which is huge data set with all
the countries and the products and the
sales which have happened and we can
take this data but before before loading
it as I suggested earlier we should
basically transform the data we should
basically transform the data so that you
don't end up loading everything and you
don't work on all the data I mean unless
you really want to so here I will this
Excel sheet which I'm talking about has
two different tabs we have used it
before so let's use orders let's use
returns and that basically shows me the
data what we have so I can do a load but
that's not what we would want to do so
you can do a load and you can get all
the data but let's go to
transform make some basic
Transformations before we load the data
so our power bi editor allows us to work
on this now here we
have it says this preview may be up to 9
days old so I can do a refresh I can
select this and I say first thing is use
first row as header because that's what
I want so it is basically setting the
first row as header which looks good and
we have some order IDs we have
the returned If the product was returned
so let's look at the filter here so it
just has yes values which we are looking
at
so it says list may be incomplete let's
say load
more and let's see what are the filters
here so either there might be a product
which is returned or it might be blank
field so that is chosen so that's fine
we have order ID we have region which is
basically showing me different regions
here let's look at orders and orders is
again having your row ID order ID order
date ship date ship mode so you have
quite large amount of data here for your
different countries now in earlier
example I chose United States and then I
was only focusing on the states and city
in United States so we can do that now I
can basically work on refresh so
whatever preview was stored in the
memory we are just refreshing it now
here we have this row ID and if you see
the row ID is an integer obviously we
will not be performing any kind of
computation here so here you don't have
any row ID but here we have row ID so
let's make it uh from integer let's make
it string and I'll say replace current
so that's that looks fine it's say row
ID which we will use to search but we
are not going to perform any
computations unless you want to find on
an average on row ID or anything else
now you have order IDs so what we can do
is we can filter some
values we can rename the field as we
desired right so for example let's go in
here and what we can do is let's go
into uh customer ID
ship okay and here you have say State
you have
region okay now at any point of time if
I would want to filter out the values
the easier option is that you can select
on this one and here you can do some
text filtering okay or you can basically
select the values from here so for
example if I say let's get rid of select
all what we will be interested in uh say
United States and UK that's the data we
want and then I can basically say okay
so it is basically going to filter out
the data which is for United States and
UK as of now now what we can also do is
how about doing some more filtering
before we basically work on this so
let's go in here and we are looking at
United States and UK related data and
let's look at it is sometimes good that
you can
basically uh work on the data here so
for example I go into orders now what I
would want to do is I would want to look
at the fields okay and we want to we
have not yet loaded the data so if you
look in the background I just have my
scientists because we have not applied
these changes we have not loaded we are
still in the transformation stage right
now what we can do is let's go for so we
can do segment and all these kind of
fields can be used for grouping the data
so we will see that whenever you have a
data said you would already know there
are certain fields which have repeated
values which can be used to group the
data and we can do that we can change
any kind of values which are not going
to be computed on so for example I have
postal code I can use this but again we
are not going to find a postal code
which is greater than something right so
integer is not the valid type let's
change it to text
okay and uh if for example I would want
to look at this so I have done some
changes here okay and this shows me null
so for example let me just rever this
back and let's make
it a whole
number okay so there are certain columns
or rows which do not have some values
and we can basically get rid of those
values so as of now we can do a
filtering here so let's keep the postal
code AS integer or let's change it to
text do a replace content and now what
we will do is we'll scroll all the way
right might be I'm interested in
technology category so that's what I'm
interested in so what I can do is is
here I can do some
filtering so I can basically
choose technology now the easier way
would be since these are categories and
there are only three categories we
really don't want to go and apply text
filters here but if you had something
like an office supply and um Office
Inventory then you could have done some
text filter so let's not do some text
filtering here what we can can do is I
would be interested in technology so
that's the field I'm interested in so
now you are only having data which is
related to
technology okay and you have some
product names so this is where we want
to do some kind of filtering so we can
rename the field we can select some
Fields so let's for example let's go
for uh any of the field which I think
might have more entries here so for
example let's go
for Canon Wireless or Canon Image right
so let's go for product names and I will
say
let's go
here now I could have done a
transformation but that's not what we
want we want to do some filtering so
let's go to text filter and here I can
say begins with I can say ends with I
can say contains so let's go for
contains and it says enter a value here
so you would want to keep the rows where
the product name contains something and
it gives you some
suggestion right so where you are seeing
in some values here so for example if I
would have selected this then it applies
the complete thing but that's not what I
want so I will get rid of all this and I
will say it contains Cannon now I can go
for advanced filtering also okay wherein
you can select Advanced and then you can
give different columns and what do they
contain what kind of values you're
looking for so you can do that but we
will not go for advanced in one step
let's go for basic and let's say okay
and now I should get all the products
which are Canon and you have different
products so this is one kind of
filtering I've done it tells me what is
the category of this it is machines it
is copers it is obviously belonging to
the technology category we are looking
at uh the market which is for this
particular data when you look at the
country we are still focusing on United
States and United Kingdom that kind of
data right so we have filtered the data
we have done some uh selection based on
on the data here and what I can do is I
can then basically rename a particular
field so I can do that I can say I'm
interested in um sales which is the data
here we can basically look into the
quantity so sales is something which we
are interested in but might be we are
interested in sales which are more than
a particular value I'm not interested in
lower amount of sales I would want to
look into United States and UK data but
I'm interested in sales or I'm looking
at if the discount percentage was
something or if the profit was more
right so we can apply different kind of
values here but what we can do is with
these changes because you don't want to
transform and make changes all here you
want to make the changes once the data
set is uploaded so we have selected some
data
we have create done some Transformations
we can basically break a particular
column into multiple columns if that's
what we want if we see that we will do
an aggregation based on ear or we will
do a aggregation based on the country or
year and Order ID right so we can break
this data into multiple columns so we
can do that but for now let's do a close
and apply and let's apply this so that's
going to apply all these changes it's
going to load my data but remember now
we are having selective or selected data
which gets loaded so that should get be
available here so it takes time
sometimes so you have to wait and then
you can go ahead and check here so for
example now I'm looking in tables let's
basically minimize this let's go for
orders and this is the data I have which
obviously row ID if you see so you have
all the row IDs and again again you can
do filtering here but this is where you
have already loaded the data the data is
available and then you can start working
on the columns here so we have this if
you closely see we see this summation
Mark and this basically means that these
are my aggregated columns or these
values are measures which can be used
for calculations so we can see that we
can create our own aggregations so we
can do that we can rename the field as
we have
seen we can filter out the data so we
have all the fields showing up from
orders and let's also look at the
returns which basically has the columns
the order ID and your region so it
basically shows the region here where
was the product returned from and we
have this information so what we are
doing is we when we were doing a text
filter in the previous example remember
it was case sensitive okay and you have
to take care of when you're doing a text
filter you have to give a field which
exactly matches as it exists in the
content now okay this is the data we
have and let's look at the order column
right now what we can do is we can do
some quick Transformations here and we
can basically look for more data here so
let's say we have uh some filtering to
be done now I can do a filtering based
on
my uh product so we had all these
products but now let's do a filtering on
product and then products you have
copers you have machines so you have
many two categories right and when you
look at machines it basically talks
about your
PC uh something so let's look for
machines and here we have basically The
copier fields which are more so I can
basically go for filtering
here and that's the data we have so we
don't want to really unselect any of
these here but what I'm doing is I'm
saying text filter and let's go into
this one now and let's say
contains okay so I'm saying contains and
then I can basically say uh let's say
copier now that's what I'm interested in
and uh show rows where product name
contains
copier okay now you can give a and
condition here so if you would want a
specific copier if you are interested in
okay let's also say uh contains and
let's go for laser
also laser and let's say okay so you see
the data gets filtered out here and uh
we have the sales which we are seeing
here so let's go to sales and we will be
interested in anything above 500 so
let's go to
sales let's go for number filters let's
say greater than and I will say for
example 500 oh sorry
500 okay
and uh let's say okay so that basically
filters out the data and then I am also
interested in quantity Where I would
want the quantity to
be more than one or more than two so for
example so let's go in
in here and you can basically choose
what is the filter you want so you can
apply any number of filters now you have
the filtering here you can always click
on the filter and if you want you can
just do a clear filter and the filtering
will be gone so you have all the data
right and this is the particular data we
have and here I have say for
example product name now I can keep the
filter because I'm interested only in
these values or I can filter out so this
tells me that when we did a add it is
basically going for laser and copier
right so let's say for example clear all
filters the thing is gone what we can do
is let's go here go for text filter say
contains and here I will say it can be a
copier okay or so last time we did a and
and I'll do a contains
laser so let's choose this that gives me
more entries so either the product name
has copier or it has laser it has the
quantity it has the product name and we
have all this detail here now what we
can also do is we can do some
transformation on the product ID so for
example you have product ID or order ID
so order ID shows up as uh looks like
the country name uh the year and then
the order ID so we can basically split
it up so I can select this and here I
have option
of let's go to home so when you have you
have selected this column so you have an
option of transform data here so use the
power query Editor to connect prepare
and transform the data so if you really
want to transform the data here if I
basically select
this if I just do a right click here now
here it just tells me do you want a new
column do you want to create a copy of
this column okay you want to create copy
table so this is your transformed data
what you have and for example let's
create a copy
table and let's come in here
so you should be able to see
your copy table now so let's go
in and select this
one and what you need to do here is
creating a copy of this or copy table
would not be the right option what we
can do is we can work on transforming
this rather than doing it from here so
you have this option of ADD a new column
going for a new measure renaming it
right so that's okay but what we can do
is Select this particular column let's
do a home and first thing is let's go to
transform so I want to transform the
data now let's select this one and it
brings up your power editor again here
we were interested in orders so we are
looking at our data here now if you you
see my country is United States and UK
so you can confirm that if you look at
category it is technology product name
has copier and Laser as we selected so
those things are retained so you have
not lost any changes as of now so this
order ID column what we have now as I
said you can be doing a filtering okay
you can select this particular column
and then you have other things which can
be used to transform here like you want
to change the data typee you want to use
first row as header you want to replace
some values okay you want to run some
merge queries you want to do some
analytics so all these options are here
now what we can do is while this column
is selected I can do a right click now
there is an option called transform
which is basically going to help me in
changing the data here okay now I can
basically duplicate the column so I
really don't want to work on this column
it's self but it would be good to have a
duplicate column on which we can work on
so I can do a split column here if I
would want to but let's create a
duplicate column so let's say duplicate
column now that gives me a duplicate
column so we can rename it later so now
I will not work on my original column
but I'll work on a duplicate column and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
basically transform or split this so
again do a right click now you have a
split by so we can say split by by D
limiter or by number or by characters or
by positions so by lower case and upper
case so you can do all of this so let's
go for by D limiter now if you see it
basically identifies the D limiter which
is hyphen or Dash now you can go for
split at leftmost identifier right sorry
left most D limiter rightmost each
occurrence of D limiter and that's what
we want to do you can look into Advan
options where it says split into columns
so do you want to split that into
columns do you want to split that into
rows because that's more or less like
doing a group by and you can say number
of columns to split into so we have here
1 2 3 4 values so that looks good to me
and uh let's do say for example if I
choose
three
so I can choose three and then split
using special characters so you could do
that so let's for example let's say
okay and let's look at the data how it
looks like we can anytime delete the
data we can keep it the way we want
right so what we did was we created a
copy of the column then we did a split
and what we have seen is we just have
three columns now if you see the fourth
bit is gone fourth bit doesn't show up
right because I just did a three as
the resulting column so I have the order
ID okay and we can check if there is
already an order ID column so we have
order ID but that has the complete order
ID here and the relatively product ID so
you can see the customer ID you can look
at this one so it basically has as your
order ID and then let's look at the
fields here so we have the product ID
which says Tec M A I'm looking at the
first one
370 and that has in no relation to the
order ID right so we can make sure that
there is nothing which is conflicting
with our entries now once that is done
so we have order ID which which can be
used to categorize the data you have
order ID which is basically the year
okay and you have order ID which is
basically having some more value now I
can keep this data as I want so I can
basically click on this I can go for
renaming and I can say let's say let's
call it
order
ID and let's say
IDs so let us in case there is a
particular column and you would want to
look at so just give the name correctly
now order IDs is f so here we will also
rename this one so let's call it uh
order
year and that's going to be order here
so we can again change this to string
okay and here you have the order ID so
let's rename this
one and I have
my let's call
order
number right so we have we are seeing
all the steps which we have added here
we just split the data based on the D
limiter and we have now three new
columns which have got added to our
existing data which was already filtered
and we have done some splitting up of
data by creating a duplicate and then
renaming it right so if
you go and look at your Transformations
now if I would have done a split here
straight away then my original column
would be gone but probably we want the
original column because sometimes you
may want to search order ID with a
Consolidated information sometimes you
may want to segregate it based on year
right now we have the year field or
order date field here you have the ship
date right but then might be you want to
just aggregate based on year you don't
want to really spend time in aggregating
or extracting the month and day and so
on so my these three columns can be
useful now what I can also do is I can
merge The Columns if I want so we have
split the columns but what I can do is I
can say select select select so using
your control and now do a right click so
you should have an option called merge
columns right now this is something
which is uh we would want to merge so
let's say merge columns and let's say do
you want to keep a separator so yes yes
I want to keep a separator but might be
this time I will give my separator is a
uh colon and then what is the merge
column name you want to create so let's
call it something
like
um
order okay
uh and then let's call it num right so
some sometimes renaming the fields to a
name which makes more sense or based on
your naming convention is good so let's
do a merge and now what I have done is I
have done merging of those columns so I
split the data I merg The Columns and
now if you see my The Columns which I
had created those columns are gone
because you did a merge you did a merge
and now you have the fields which are
either
uh earlier you had something which is
separated by a hyphen and here you have
something which is separated by colon
right now anytime if you want you
can unmerge this by removing this step
right and you can get rid of this merge
column so if for example I would do that
so I have my data back right I have my
data back so what we could have done is
we can select
this okay and then what we can do is
like what we did earlier so you can
basically go for removing the columns
okay you can do a merge column okay you
can select one by one and create
duplicate of those and then you can
merge them right so all the possible
options are there so you can the best
option would be to create a duplicate of
these columns and then basically merge
them as per your convenience so might be
you can say order IDs and order number
is the pairing what you want ear is
something which you don't want right
because we already have the date field
so I can basically say
remove and this one is gone now I will
select this and this
and let's go for merge columns and I
want to give a separator which
is might be without the ear and you have
space or you can go for custom like
earlier we had give a symbol and then
what do you want to call it so let's say
order
specs
okay right so this makes more meanings
because we already have the date field
so why do I want the year into my order
ID so I can always be doing a
segregation now based on order
specs right now this is some simple
Transformations what we are doing here
we are seeing the data which we have
okay now what I can do is I can
basically first apply these
changes so that all my changes what I
have done are applied right now once
these changes are done we can basically
go ahead and save this file so I can
just say save I can go for save as I
have different other options so if you
would want to perform keep performing
your transformation then you can just do
this you can add a column you can view
the data so for now our Transformations
are good enough and what we can do is we
can
basically go back to home we can do a
close and apply and we will be back to
our data set which has been modified so
we can see if the data what we have has
been
transformed so we have order specs here
that's good we did not do any filtering
or um we have the filter left here which
B basically tells me that there are
these different fields we have not
removed them but what we are doing is we
are just applying a filter to choose
copiers and Laser
Printers so that's what we have here and
this is good enough now what I can do is
once this is done I can basically save
it so I would want to call it some kind
of report if you would want to create
Okay so so let's call
it as uh uh let's say
second
report and here I will say
country and
Technology specific
info let's save
it and and now basically I have saved my
data so what you can do is you can go
[Music]
for creating other report or basically
having this information published if
that's what you want to do if you want
to go for visualization because right
now what we are seeing is we have lot of
data here we have lot of data here it
shows me there are these uh tables or
data sets which we have worked on
that shows
me here in the models but there is no
relationship in them if you go into
visualization then you don't have any
option or you have not created any
visualizations based on this data but if
you go here now based on the data what
we transformed if you see we have order
specs right now that's what we chose we
basically have other fields so you have
Shi date you have aggregated column s
which can be used for visualizing and we
can work on this so I can come back here
and what I would be interested in is
this data set is fine but I want to do
some grouping I want to basically have
some selective data in this and for that
what I can do is let's go for ship mode
now this is something what we have so we
are in this data field
now we have this transform so let's go
back to transform
again and let's choose our orders so
that's the data we have and now if you
see here this
is you know huge amount of data what we
want is we want to group them based on
the shipping mode so here you have a
option called Group by so I can select
this I can go in here I can basically
work on okay get rid of duplicate values
but that's not what we want to do you
want to do a group buy so as I said you
can do a group buy from here or you can
choose from the transform option above
and you can do a group buy so let's do a
group buy now how do you want to group
the data so I'm saying I want to group
the data here based on shipping
mode or which is the other column you
want to use to do a group byy so let's
go for shipping mode and what is the new
column name right so we want to
basically find out that you want to go
for ship mode but that's not enough I
mean I can do a ship mode and I can do a
grouping by but you want to just count
the rows no that's not what we want to
do so let's go to Advanced so ship mode
is fine so that's your grouping right
but then what we also want to do is we
want to do a grouping based
on say sales so here for example let's
go for
sales okay and what should we call this
so might be we can say uh
shipment wise sales whatever you would
want to call so you can basically get
the operation do you want to really
count the rows no we want to basically
do a summing or we want to might be find
out an average price right so let's do a
sum okay and here I would want to do a
summing based on say for example sales
so this is what I'm going to use for
getting a count of the sales now
grouping by might be we will change this
instead of
uh instead of sales we are using using a
ship mode what we can also do is let's
go for a
segment and that would be valid grouping
so it will take a combination of ship
mode segmenting group the data based on
that and then get me the sales which
is which is basically let's call it
shipment wise
sales so it gets a sum so let's do a
okay and that's my more relevant data
which I'm looking at so I'm looking at
the ship mode I'm looking at what is the
segment and then I'm looking at what is
the total sales there I'm looking at
again the ship mode standard and home
office so always remember when you are
choosing multiple fields or multiple
columns for grouping by you are
basically
having a combination of two Fields so
that has to be unique and your grouping
is done based on that so now you're
looking at the sales wise and this is
something as an important information
what we have so we have done some
transformation and what you can do is
you can use other ways like you can use
pivote to get individual values from it
you can run on merge queries which is
basically running some merge queries and
merge the query with another query in
this workbook if you have so you can go
for for this now I can basically go for
apply and close so just to add to the
group by step what we did was if you see
here I have removed the group by filter
which we just did couple of minutes back
and what I have done is instead of
transforming your complete data set you
can basically create a copy of it so for
example I can just do a copy and then I
can come here and do a based and I have
done that and I'm calling it order
summarized but this is my complete data
now what we will do here is we will
basically go ahead and do a grouping byy
again like what we did earlier based on
your shipment based on your segment and
based on the sales so that's what we are
looking for so let's go for the ship
mode and we go for group
bu and and here you would want to go for
advanced to ship mode and this one I
will go for Segment so that's fine now
we want the new column name so let's say
shipment wise
sales so I want to do a summing not the
counting of rows and I want to do a
summation based on sales like what we
did earlier and then you say okay
and that basically gives you the data
here
now what we have is we have the
resultant data based on the data which
is coming in from here we did the same
thing just 1 minute back but we worked
on the original data set so what I did
was I created a copy and now I'm working
on this one so I'll say close and
apply and now we are back to our our
desktop so it is applying these changes
where we have done some Transformations
we have done some grouping by and what
we can do
is once we have the data here we can
anytime look at our data sets or tables
so this is my original one if you see
now I have order summarized I can just
pull out this information I basically
have my returns which we have not really
touched and we have the scientist so we
have all the four data sets here now
what we can also do is let's look into
order summarized and we just have this
data here so this is fine and you can
continue working on this you can
basically merge columns from two
different data sets and then you can get
the merged column and you can rename it
so you can obviously do that you can
basically do a
uncheck whenever you are working on
these data sets so what you can do
is if you would want to work on
transforming for example let's go back
here and say I want to do some
transformation on it so how did we do it
we just did a
transform and you can go back to
transform so so you have this data here
and the data what you have you might be
interested in transforming this into
something else and then you don't want
to maybe load this data so you have this
option where you are selecting orders
and then you have something called as
enable load which can be unchecked so
when you do a uncheck what will happen
is whatever changes you perform only
those changes related data set will be
load Ed and they will still be available
but this will not affect your it will
not affect your original one so for
example let's say copy and let's go in
here I will do a paste let's say
orders oh I did a paste I need to rename
this so let's renaming let's say orders
and here I will say summarize
and I will say
us so I'm renaming it now let that get
loaded we can perform some
Transformations on it so I have
here where is my country so let's look
for
Country yeah and let's look for Country
so here I will go for only United
States okay that's what I'm interested
in and then I can choose well I
interested in just Central us so I can
basically go for just the central us and
I can get rid of all of
these so now I should have only Central
us data and this is fine and this is the
data might be we are focusing on right
now for doing some visual ization might
be looking at sales might be looking at
the product name so you have the product
name now remember you don't see any
filters here right because the filters
are coming from the resultant set and
your transformation so if you have any
filters you would be seeing in the top
row now this is the data we have Let's
uh let's not restrict it to region
region would then can reduce my data but
that's good enough for us I can just say
no I'm clearing off this filter I'm
still looking at United States but I
want to look at all the regions yeah
what we would be interested in category
and that's anyways chosen as technology
which we had chosen when we were loading
the data we have copers and machines
right and we can basically keep this now
this is fine I can apply the
changes I can apply the changes based on
this one and what I can do is I can just
say for now
apply so that's going to apply all the
changes which you have done in orders or
summary or the new one right and what I
can do is now I can choose order and I
can say don't enable this in load so it
says disabling load will remove the
table from the report and any visuals
that use it columns will be broken we
are not creating any visuals as of now
the table will be removed so that's
fine and now I will say close and
apply so what happens is you are loading
the data based on the changes okay now
you have
your order summarized you have returns
you have scientist but you basically do
not have orders anymore so that was not
loaded so so I only have this one I only
have this one
and you have returns you have scientist
you don't have the orders column right
now that particular data set was not
loaded at all because we did not choose
that to be loaded right now while I'm in
this orders which
is let's see here and actually you can
drag in yeah
so you have order summary and this has
basically kind of data which I'm looking
for so I really don't need the ORD
stable so you can do it in steps and you
can aggregate this you can have
aggregated data you can have all the
data which is filtered transformed
grouped by and then basically just load
it and the original data set which you
used that's no more being loaded here
now at any point of time if if I really
want I can go back to transform data and
remember it is still here it is still
here it's not gone right so you can
basically select this and you can say
enable load and you will have the data
back which you can continue working on
right so these are some quick
Transformations which really help us in
working on the data now obviously if you
have data you want to perform some left
joints right joints joins you have inner
joints outer joints so you can always do
that you can take two different data
sets might be I'm interested in taking
the orders summarized which talks about
standard class consumer shipment wise
sales and here if I look at order
summary I have other details but the
thing is we need to make sure that these
have the
values these have the values say for
example the segment column here here and
the segment column here can really be
used to join these two tables so if I
create a relationship or if I create a
join I can basically merge the data so
this is how you work on data we will
also see some more examples on might be
modeling the data using some Expressions
to work on the data so we already looked
at creating a report selecting
particular fields and then publishing
the report onto your powerbi service now
this is the report which we had created
which says State order ID sales and then
I also added this returned field and
that was basically by creating a
relationship between order and returns
which we can also have a look in model
so this is the relationship which is
created if you just place your cursor
here it tells me that we have a
relationship between order ID of returns
and Order ID of orders and that
basically allows me to join the data
bring it in my one report now this is
basically your data sources you can look
at and if you click on your
visualization so that shows you your
report now what we can also do is we can
make it interesting now we would not
want to scroll through the fields to see
wherever or what was the order or what
was the order ID which was returned now
I can do a sorting I can filter out what
I can also do is I can use this option
which shows slicer here and that
basically allows me to work with this
data so we have this report here and
basically as I said you can click in
here it shows the data now what I can do
is I would want to filter out
information or slice the information
using your returned either being yes or
having a field which has no value how do
we do that so basically I can drag and
drop the
returned here as a field which comes
from returns now that basically shows me
only the value as yes but I do know that
there is there are some fields which are
blank now how do I add filter to this so
I can click on this one and then I can
click on slicer now once that does so it
basically pulls out all the different
values so you have either yes or you
have the blank field for returned so
what we can do is we can select yes you
will see
only the orders and their IDs and sales
where the products were returned so that
gives me 10
18,18 and I can select blank so that
will basically get me all the orders or
products which were not returned now
this is a simple way wherein I can add a
filter to or a SL ER to my report to
basically give viewers a choice of uh
selecting different fields and you can
add any number of slicers you can
basically say I would want particular
kind of information so for example if I
go into orders and we know we have the
state now I do have the state
information here and basically I can if
I would be interested I could filter
this out in my report itself I can sort
it I can look it in a different order
what I can also do is how about bringing
in state here and basically dragging it
here so that gives me the state option
it is giving me a visual which is
basically giving me a geographic
location of all these points so yes that
can be good what I can also do is I can
keep this which basically shows me the
state map mightbe it can be useful you
can zoom in you can zoom out you can
look at specific information here you
can drag and drop here so that's fine
what I can also do is I can again take
the state and bring it here and that
basically can be instead of my map I can
go for slicer so that gives me all the
values here and which basically allows
users to choose the fields or the states
which you would be interested in looking
at so for example if somebody is
interested in looking at the data for
Georgia just select this one and you see
the map automatically shows you where in
the map that's the place and it shows me
all the sales for Georgia State now I
can also basically select yes and that
shows me which were the orders which
were basically returned so that gives me
a quick overview of statewise what is
the geographical location if the orders
were returned or mightbe I can just
click on blank and it shows me The non-
Returned orders I can again go here and
uncheck the joio option and that shows
me all the states now once you have done
this this looks like a comprehensive
report which can be useful for the
viewers for your management team and so
on so we can just do a save and that
basically is saving my report so I have
this report now what if I publish this
report so I can just do a publish and
when I publish it says okay workspace so
let's say
select and then it says replacing this
data set may impact two reports you
already have a data set named by this
one view the impact I would say replace
or I will say view impact
so that basically takes me to the
powerbi service because sometimes we may
have some reports which we have already
uploaded and updating an existing report
might basically affect my existing
report so it basically shows me the
impact analysis it shows me one
workspace there are two reports they
they have not been added to dashboard
but these are the ones which will get
modified so let's for example as of now
go ahead here
and let's look into my powerbi so go
back to your desktop and I'll say no I
don't want to replace so click on cancel
so I do not want to publish it what
might be what I can do is I can try
saving it as a different report so let's
say save
as and now I will basically
say
additional filters
okay let's save it so now you see the
name on the top changes to additional
filters now it's save to publish this
and now I can go ahead and publish it
select your
workspace and basically it says this is
the report being published with our
additional filters with a map which
gives a
geographical uh area showing us the
information and then basically what I
can do is once it is done I can look
into my powerbi service like we did
earlier you can do a filtering we can
basically query this data we can share
it with other users who might be
interested in looking at this particular
data now this says it is done so it says
get quick insights and might be it's a
good on option to look into what kind of
insights it's it gives you so click on
that see the beauty of powerbi where it
tries to search for any kind of insights
which it can gather from the kind of
report which you have built now once the
insights are ready it will let you know
what we can also do is we can come in
here click on view data set so you see
now it shows your additional filters and
here you have option where it should be
showing your report so let's say View
and view is fine so and if it doesn't
show up sometimes it might be taking
time for refreshing so you can always go
here and then you can click on your
report and that should get
populated so this is the report these
are the filters which I have gives me an
option of choosing all the states and
basically allows me to edit the report
and look at all the information here
meanwhile we can see here it is still
trying to gather some insights from the
data and now you see there are some
insights here so it says sales which is
coming up and a subset of your data was
analyzed and the following insights were
found so you're looking at sales by ship
mode so it's a standard class second
class first class and same day so there
were different shipping modes in our
data and that's what it shows me the
sales which one had the majority it
shows me the profit so which city or
state had more profits so New York City
has noticeable more profits here average
by shipping cost by subcategories so
there are these different subcategories
which we can look at such as copers and
machines have noticeably more shipping
cost profit by product name and you can
basically look at at the row ID and
quantity so this is where you're looking
at a regression analysis you're looking
at row ID and quantity so there is a
correlation between row ID and quantity
so these are two different variables or
fields which are related you're looking
row ID by
category row ID so it says California
has noticeably more row IDs sales your
profit count of region and count of
returns so there is a core relation
again between two different variables
average of shipping cost now we would
have taken lot of time in building all
these
visualizations but powerbi has already
helped you in gathering all these
insights and then you can basically
select which one of these is what you're
interested in you can focus and look for
more information based on all the fields
it has given you good amount of insights
which will help anyone who is looking at
this particular report so that's your
quick insights here and we have this
information now once you have this
information this is basically where you
have your focus mode so it says subset
of your data was analyzed following
insights were found you can basically
say
download and uh here you have other
options which allow you to work with
your powerbi so so let's look at this
one so this is where we have our report
and we can continue exploring it
more one more interesting feature which
powerbi has other than having your
insights ready to use which is basically
in your workspace and you can basically
use these insights what we are looking
at various options here and basically
you have this option where it says spin
the visual if you are interested in a
particular Insight you can always pin it
which you can always go back and look
into what you can also do is you can
also click on edit report here now
that's a report which has already been
published to your powerbi service not
yet shared but that can be shared or
that can be subscribed now once you
click on edit report it has option of
reading View mobile layout you have
basically basically an option which says
basically options for navigating through
the data set you can go for how visuals
on the canvas interact with each other
you have all these options and one of
the good options is ask a question so
you can always click on ask a question
and that basically B
says some suggestions now you can open
this and it says okay ask a question
about your data try one of these to get
started what is the average sale sort
orders by order date sort orders by
product ID how many ship modes are there
compare quantity and discount so do not
worry that your report has only four
Fields so it has State order ID sales
and returned with some filters but what
about you looking at how many ship modes
are there so it is already looking at
your data so if you click on this one
here and you can see what are the
different fields what we have and you
have ship date and ship mode so this is
one of the fields which it is showing
you to ask a question now what you can
do is you can say how many ship modes
are there let's click on that let's ask
this question it says four ship modes
and do you want to add this to report
yes you can you can let it be as it is
so you can basically keep this question
here and here you have an option the
visual is showing number of ship modes
when you place your cursor here if you
see here turn this Q&A result into a
standard Visual and let's do that and
basically it is saying number of ship
modes right so now that's the power of
your uh bi power bi which has basically
allowed you to ask a question and
quickly add a visual to your report now
what we can do
is we can basically save this or you can
say save as and give a different name so
might be I'll just say save because I
would want to have this information and
the report is saved so in this way you
can basically not only create smart
visuals you can not only
relate different data sources using data
models or relationships you can add maps
you can add filters you can add quick
questions you can basically just go here
and say for example you would want to
ask a different question now we see the
fields here how about looking at the
shipping cost right so here I can say
um what is
the uh highest
shipping cost and that shows me some
suggestions let's select that and that
shows me the value
which is great and I can keep it as it
is I can basically convert this to a
visual I may want to keep the question
because might be this question was asked
and uh you would want to see the result
here might be you can move this
somewhere
here and that gives me some kind of
question which was asked and we can do a
save and that's my report which has been
saved in my bi service the data set is
still there you can basically go ahead
and share this how to connect different
data sources with powerbi so in this
session today we will see how can you
connect different type of data types
data sets like Excel PDF CSV Etc to
import in powerbi for your data
visualization needs so what's in it for
us today we will be learning how to
connect to data different data types
data files like Excel PDF then what are
the different data importing modes and
then I will also show you practically
different sets how to import them in
power VI and use it for your
visualization purpose now what are the
steps to connect to data so now we will
go directly into powerbi and try to
import one by one few most commonly and
popularly used data sets which are most
most commonly used uh in a day-to-day
activity rest of course there are uh
powerbi supports n number of data
sources uh but we will uh do something
practical on the most popular ones so
let's let's open our
powerbi now this is my powerbi and first
I want to show you that how can I import
data directly from a web page and import
the data now it is asking for a URL in
order to import data so what I have done
is I have created a Google Excel sheet
with simple data with rows and columns
and what I've done is I've have Shar
this sheet as publish to
web okay so you just need to say publish
to the web the link as web page and say
done it's it's automatically published
and say link so copy the link which you
have published on the web copy this link
and then go back to your Tableau paste
it link over here and click
okay now powerbi will try to establish a
connection with this Google doc sheet
because it's published on the
web you need to wait for a while while
it is
reading
okay now it has read one of the HTML
tables so I'll select this one now you
can see it has it is showing me a
preview of the table which is there on
my Google sheet right it has 11 rows so
it has all showed all the 11 rows so now
I can go and transform this data because
I can see my headers are there starting
from the second row so there's an
opportunity for me need to transform the
data so I'll go and transform it so that
it looks
clean okay so first is I need to remove
the first row which is
the null row remove the top
rows okay and then I need to use the
first row now as a header so you just
click this option use first row as
headers that's it so now if you see my
row ID order ID order date ship date all
my data is now ready so I can say close
and
apply click apply
changes now this is an example of web
data import you can go and preview your
data right now uh the biggest advantage
of this data connection is that it's a
live data so for example I insert
another
row let me change the order
ID some some I've some changed some
basic stuff and
I it's Auto saved contrl s now I'll go
to my tblo and I'll
refresh
now you can see as I refreshed my power
query editor I clicked refresh all and I
got my new row which is there in the
live data I got that fetched from
my okay I got that row the row row ID
number 12 so I so I have to say close
and
apply now you can see the new row the
row number 12 is now available in my new
data set in the data set because it's a
live connection it's a live connection
with the web based Google sheet okay so
this is one important way in which you
can import data now let's try to import
data from a text file now I have already
prepared a text file called
subcategories do
txt now let me just open it in a notepad
now it's a very plain simple file tab
separated file in which you have product
subcategory ID subcategory name name and
product category key so basically to
which product category this particular
sub product belongs to right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go back to
my get data
option and I'm going to select text SL
CSV
option and I'm going to select option
mod product subcategories do
txt okay so now powerbi has identified
that it's a tab delimited file it has
recognized the headers
Etc right and I can now directly load
this
file okay so now once the data is
imported in powerbi it is like
irrelevant to me it's a composite data
in import I'm doing right so in my
presentation when I'm talking about
importing data there are different
importing modes right import data import
can happen through different ways
okay one is direct query mode in which I
create a live uh connection to the
database which I'll also show you uh
using MySQL and mssql server and also
you can do a composite mode in which you
can have data imported from Excel plus
you can have direct query modes so you
can have multiple uh modes to connect
and create a composite data model and
that's what we are doing right now in
our practical so what we are doing over
here is one we have imported data from
the web second we have imported data
from a text table now after doing text
now our next task is to import from CSV
let's try another one so now I have
imported product
subcategory now I'll
import a CSV file so again I'll choose
the option text / CSV and now in this C
CV file let me open this CSV file and
show you what is
it so this is a list of all my products
product key product subcategory key
product uh stock keeping unit Etc a
simple CSV file and I'm going to import
that okay so now it is identified the D
limiter is comma rather than a tab and
it has already recognized the headers
correctly so I'll load
it okay so now my products are there
product subcategories are there for
product categories now what I have done
is I have created a Excel mode now so
now Excel I'm using to import my product
category so now I have to click on the
option of import data from Excel and
I'll say product
categories select the sheet
load and now so my products product
product categories product subcategories
though with different uh data storage
types but still now the data is imported
into powerbi it is a composite data
model now another very important data
type which you can import is the PDF
also right so what I have done is I have
created a PDF called customers my
customers data is lying in a PDF so what
I've done is I've created a
PDF which has data for some
columns are there like you know customer
key prefix first name last name birth
date marital status gender email address
annual income total children etc etc so
this is the data set which I have
created in PDF so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to select PDF
now and import customers. PDF and see it
has recognized my table on page one
which I'm going to
load
okay you can rename this as
PDF
table so this basically these are the
different type
of
data types we have imported PDF Excel
text CSV and web page now let's take a
look at another interesting data set
which we want to import is the my SQL
Server data
set so what I have done is I've already
installed my SQL server on my local
instance and there's already a schema of
SQL live tutorial over there and I have
certain tables
already prepared over there like
Department employee Etc so my goal is
now to import this data or create a live
connection with this data set now in
order to
import my SQL data base Connection in
powerbi you need to First
download
a connector my SQL powerbi connector so
you need to go to this
link and then click on download and
install the my SQL connector based on
the operating system you have you click
on download and install it after you
have done this go back to
powerbi and then give the IP address of
the database in my case it's there in
this
local machine and the schema which I
want to import is SQL live tutorial so
I'll give the
name click
connect okay now it's connected so now
it is asking me which particular tables
you want to create a connection with I'm
choosing department and
employ and I'm just loading
them
okay so now this is the exact data which
is there in the employee and Department
in my C okay so this is one example of
how to create connectivity between
powerbi and my SQL now I want to do the
same thing using SQL Server Microsoft
SQL Server so I have also installed
Microsoft SQL server on my machine and
and I have used the SQL Express so this
is the name of my server so which I'll
copy the server name and go to get data
select SQL
server and for now database is optional
I can say direct query click
okay okay now it is showing me what all
tables I can import so in my SQL Server
tutorial in my SQL Server I
have I have these three tables customers
employe Tre Olympic events so I can use
probably the customers one which
is
now you can see this is the data the
customers data which is lying in my SQL
Server okay so I can preview it and load
it so now you can you can preview the
data in uh powerbi that this is the data
so I can rename is customers from
mssql and this is
from my
SQL
and
okay so now this is not the only uh
data sets you can import now if you take
a look at the options which powerbi gave
of what different type and variations of
data it can it has compatibility to
import
from okay so we can just take a look at
the categorization on the left hand side
first there are file based like Excel
text XML Json is also possible you can
evenly directly import entire folder and
within the folder whatever uh data types
of files are there it will detect it PDF
Pary or even SharePoint folder which is
itself for
Microsoft uh technology then different
kind of databases SQL server and my SQL
we just saw but it's not only limited to
this you can connect to Microsoft Access
ssas Oracle database IBM db2 postgress
uh sbase Terra dat and then sap uh uh
databases Amazon red shift Impala
vertica Snowflake and N number of
databases which are there in the market
today uh Amazon Etc then it also allows
you to connect with its own power
platforms powerbi platforms data Mars
powerbi data flows data ver Etc azour
there are different kind of storage uh
mechanisms in azour and azour itself is
a Microsoft Technology so it has a
compatibility with lot of azour uh based
data storages like azour SQ database
blob storage uh aure data brakes right
aure HD inside spark so if you have
those kind of services running on your
AER cloud services you can even import
them over
here
now online services like you know you
have erps running uh or some data which
is shared on the internet if you want to
import it uh that is also possible
through certain products uh Dynamics 365
Microsoft Exchange online Salesforce
Google analytics Adobe analytics GitHub
uh LinkedIn sales if you want to do some
analysis of some social
networking uh you know feeds that also
you can
import then other miscellaneous are also
there web based Hive R script python
script if there something to import get
data from uh Google Sheets like we saw
one example in our video right now so
there are multiple options
available
now once you have imported the data
which is relevant to you um in our
subsequent sessions we will see how to
create relationships but just giving you
a glimpse that whatever data you
importing powerbi autod detect certain
relationships and it will create for you
but then you can go and manually also
change so this is the composite data
model which is getting created in the
back end while you are importing the
data you can easily go and manage these
relationships either keep them as is you
can delete and create new ones manually
so there is no limitation in
that so this is what we have witnessed
we have imported data from different
files types data types and then you know
we have tried to once it is imported
into uh powerbi then there is no
limitation of how you use it you can
create visualizations across different
data sets and then create
your standard
reports so this is the example of
importing data from web importing data
from a database from a PDF and then once
you have data you can shape and combine
data you can basically do what whatever
transformation you want to do you want
to uh make joins merge the data so for
example if we go back to our powerbi and
if I go back to my transform data
section now as I have now different data
sets available with me I have I can do
any kind of U you know operation
transformation on the data right uh so
like I showed you I uh upgraded the
header row because one of the imported
data was not showing the header
correctly uh or this columns like this
exact one column is extra I can remove
the
column right all those Transformations
whatever I do in the back end gets
captured in the applied steps section
right this is the customer data you can
create uh you can merge it you can
append it uh you know with other data
set right look for example I want to
create a merge data set of my categories
and sub categories so I can say mer
select the two data sets and say merge
queries as
new and I can select product categories
and product
subcategories
select product category key on both the
side and then they do a left Auto join
so whatever product categories are there
I'll get the subcategories associated
with it and I'll create a new table
which will have
now I have the table which has the
category and the subcategory and
subcategory in one table itself so I can
rename it now to
as
category
subcategory table it's a it's a merge
basically it's a join between category
and subcategory now I have a common
table right and I can close and
apply so imagine I have created a new
table which is imported created from one
data set is which is Excel page and
another data set which is text
base see this category subcategory table
so now I can use it the way I want in my
visualization reports so that's what the
presentation says right that once you
have uh the imported data you can shape
you can combine you can adjust you can
do whatever transformation you want to
do and create your visualization data
modeling in
powerbi now today we will discuss how to
create relationships and different kind
of data models within powerbi based on
the structure of data you're
importing okay so what topics we are
going to cover today we going to talk
about different types of data modeling
and the most important part and aspect
of data modeling is the cardinality the
cardinality which you basically decide
after reviewing the nature of data and
after you imported it what kind of
cardinality you have to basically
highlight right and there are different
type of cities which you might have
heard earlier also if you are from plsql
background like 1 is to one one is to
many Etc we will we will talk about
that now what are the different types of
data modeling now dimensional data
modeling is one of the most popular and
most uh you know widely used uh modeling
in dimensional data modeling you have
Master data uh like for example customer
data date store data product data so
these are like you know uh less
frequently changing data sets so there
is an organization right and you have
set of customers their email ID phone
number numbers Etc that will change less
frequently as compared to the sales
transactions because transactions are
happening every day every minute so
sales is a more fast changing data set
in dimensional modeling which is in the
terminology of data uh is also called as
a fact and customer store product which
are like more of static data and less
changeable data is sometimes called a
dimension so so this is a typical
dimensional data model which is
typically used uh sometimes right and
then there is another model which is
relational model this is a typical model
which we have been using in database
design like you know primary key foreign
key relationships so for example you
have a customer who has purchased a
product so probably he might have the
customer might have the details of the
product which he has purchased and you
will make a join between customer
customer and product table and even uh
you can make a join between product or
product type or customer or product type
customer table will also have a key to
the product type so this is less uh
conducive for reporting but it is more
of a transactional uh relational model
but of course this is also feasible but
from the powerbi perspective when we
talk about reporting and visualization
this is the most extensively used
dimensional data model and this this is
what we going to see in our example now
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you certain data sets first we will
prepare and uh create certain of our uh
data sets and then we will Import in our
sample powerbi file and then slowly
slowly we will create the
relationships now one important thing
which you need to understand that in
powerbi if you go to powerbi there is an
option
that that powerbi autod detect new
relationships after data is loaded and
import relations from the data source on
first load so for example if you are
importing the data from a database where
you have already defined the primary
keys and the foreign key relationships
so uh that is the first option which
powerbi will autod detect and secondly
if suppose you are importing two
different kind of data sets one is Excel
one is csb and if powerbi detects a
common column key columns it will autod
detect a relationship which you can go
and later change modify manage in your
relationship uh menu manage relationship
menu in powerbi which I'm going to show
you okay so if I open a powerbi and this
is where the option lies go to file go
to options and setting
options data
load and these are the two options which
are by default checked you can uncheck
it and auto and manually prepare
relationships there's no limitation to
that but if you uh keep it checked then
powerbi will do its job to detect the
relationships
okay now coming to the next important
factor cardinality now before I start
playing around with my data and start
showing you certain relationships it's
very important to understand these four
types of cardinalities one is many to
one right so basically many to one means
that many orders contain data of One
customer so per order one customer is
there so from customer to order or
product or delivery address it's a one
to many relationship and from the other
side from order to customer perspective
it's a many to one
relationship okay second other
cardinality is 1 is to one one is to one
relationship is only applicable when you
are saying it's an extension of the
current table so for example in one
table you have employee details and you
are extending the details of the
employee in another table like employee
address employee ID so that is like one
is to one there's no multiple records of
a single employee in the address table
only one employee ID exists
right now one is too many as I said is
the reverse side of many is to one so in
customer table only one customer record
exists per customer and one customer can
place many orders for multiple products
and can also have multiple delivery
addresses so that way this is a typical
1 is to many relationship we will be
seeing this example also in our sample
data set
and last is the many to many
relationship now many to many is a very
typical example so which I'm going to
show you pra practically and in our case
we will see that like for example you
have placed an order for a particular
product you know but there are multiple
fulfillments which has happened so
suppose you made order for 10 products
but at the back end when the company is
fulfilling it is first fulfilling the
first two products then the rest three
so basically you the Fulfillment is
happening in batches so one order ID
might have a multiple fulfillments for
the same order ID so there will be a
multi many to many relationship which
I'll show you practically so now with
this background let's start importing
our data now the first important thing
which you need to import is the master
data so first I import all my master
Dimensions which are which I'm going to
you know use in my example so first is
the customers table customers
data so this is the customer details
like customer key prefix first name last
name birth date marital status and
gender some redundant columns are also
present but we'll remove
it
so my customer data is loaded now
today's session is all about this
section of modeling so we will keep our
Focus over
here okay now some columns probably some
blank columns are there I can select
them and say delete from model
yes
okay so now this is my customers data
with the relevant columns and the key
per customer customer key now there's no
relationship in this model right now
right because only single table is there
and the associate data is only imported
now let me also import my another
important master table is the
products select the product data product
key product subcategory product SKU
product name model name product
description color size so just see all
the relevant information only specific
to the product is available so I'll
import
it okay now see there's no relationship
between product and customers directly
because until unless a customer makes an
order places an order for a particular
product there is no join right so now
between these two tables the most
important now another table which will
now make sense is the sales order table
sales
table now I I'm assuming that powerbi
have autod detected the relationship now
you can see that because I've already uh
ticked that check box now let's see what
powerbi what relations powerbi has autod
detected let's first check the relation
between customer and sales I'll double
click
this uh join now what it has done is it
has created a join of many to one
between sales and customer so what does
that mean is that one customer has can
uh Place many orders right and that is
that it has detected by the quality of
the data and the data sampling which
powerbi has done you can also reverse
this relationship here I can select
customers and I can select sales now it
has become one too many so that you can
also do manually so that is what I said
whatever powerbi is detected it is up to
the discretion of powerbi internal um
configuration and algorithm but you can
go and change it so this is now you can
make this is by default active so we
want to keep it active One customer many
sales orders cross filter Direction
means that only from customers to sales
is the filter applicable not reverse
I'll come to this with my another
example but first let's change the
relationship so one is to many means
from One customer and many sales
orders similarly let's see what has
happened at the product side of the
relationship similarly powerbi many
sales orders for one product you can for
Simplicity sake you can say products
sales product key is the join now just
focus one more thing please uh also see
the co the column on which the join is
is the grade column grade out column
product key is also here and product key
is also there and it is what we wanted
so one is too many relationship from
product to sales table and active now
looks fine this is something which is
looking logical and probably now we can
proceed further to create a report now
let me explain the cross filtering with
an
example now for example I want to check
in a report that what is the count of
products
which uh which a particular customer has
ordered
okay so what I'll do is I'll select the
product count of product
name now if you
see the and for each customer in front
of each customer name the count is
coming as 293 293 it is getting
repetitive because because there is a
oneway filter Direction filter between
customers and sales and sales and
products right so this
join is single sided it means that from
customer to product you can't find a
relationship because it's a single side
cross filter right what does this if I
change it to both it means that it is
equal to a join between product and
sales and every product detail now is
appended to the sales table so if I want
to make you visualize this you need to
go
here I'll first open my sales
table we can also open it here let's
make click it is okay now if I click
okay you can see the single arrow is
changed to Double Arrow it means it's a
it's a both side filter So when you say
a both side filter it means that
implicitly within powerbi you can
imagine that all the product columns now
with will get appended because of both
ways filter you have applied and if you
go to your report now see the change of
the numbers now 40 20 so the total count
of products across all my customers come
out to be 293 now the report looks uh
correct if I change the relationship
from back to single between product and
sales then you can't make a joint
between customers and product basically
you can't dve the product count from the
product table see
this if you have to live with it then
you would have to go to the sales table
get the product key and get the value of
count of product key but that is not
correct
okay so if you want a report in which
you want the count of product name and
even if you you want to count of
distinct product name so this will not
come correctly you would have to go and
change the direction of the filter which
is from single to both so this is a
typical example there where you want to
use a twood directional
filter now let's proceed further and
import other data set in order to give
show you another example now I want to
show you an example of 1 is to
one so I have another table which is
called customer details so the key in
this table is again customer key but
only email address annual income total
children education level Etc other
details of the customer is
there so I'm loading the customer
details now you see it has autod
detected a 1 is to one relation
reltionship
what is the meaning of 1 is to one means
One customer key only has one entry in
customer details there is no multiple
entry so if you click this
button it's a 1 is to one and the cross
filter can be both or single doesn't
matter because one customer will have
only one value you can make this as
active okay and if you go to the
customer report table you can now
easily associate a
email address with the first name you
will get 1 is to one
record so now you can see that with 1 is
to one
relationship with the first name I have
Associated the email ID and for each
email ID there is a Associated first
name with that so this is an example of
1 is to one relationship so in this
example what we have explained is that
for each customer there is an Associated
customer detail right uh so you have the
first name email address education level
homeowner occupation and total children
count so in this report what we have
done is uh if you click over here so the
first name and the email address okay so
there's a 1 is to one
relationship and
then and if you
drag customer
key uh report takes time to render and
even if you
can so this is the reporting output you
have the customer key first name
associated email address and the count
of product names uh which the customer
has ordered now this is an example of 1
is to
one now I want to show you an example of
many to many now for that I'll import my
fulfillment data
set
okay now in my fulfillment data set
there is a column
for order number so basically what I'll
do is I'll drag order number from here
to
here okay so now what has um uh powerbi
detected
I'll do one thing I'll select sales over
here fulfillment over here and order
number to OD number okay so it's a many
to many relationship so it means that
per order I have created multiple
batches to fulfill that particular order
now many to many relationship is a
definitely a candidate for both ways
cross filter detection uh a direct
but you can you can check that but
definitely uh powerbi shows a warning
that this relationship has cardinality
to many to many and this should only be
used if it is expected that neither
column contains unique values okay so we
know that fact that's why we are
accepting this relationship as many to
many because we know there are multiple
order numbers over here in the sales
table which are mapped to the multiple
order numbers in the Fulfillment table
we'll click
okay now you want to keep uh the uh
direction as both ways or One Direction
that is up to you the way you want to uh
map the report so I can double click
over here and you can even click so now
you can select from which way single
filter you want from fulfillment to
sales or sales to fulfillment I'll
prefer Sal sales to fulfillment and
click
okay okay now we have our all our
different kind of relationships over
here uh which we have tried to short
list one too many many to one one to one
which is uh this example and many to
many now if I show you further
relationships which you can keep on
adding like for example I have have uh
uh the example of
territories now in which particular
territory the sales was done so I can
map it over
here okay so now it's a typical 1 is to
many relationship because territory is
my master team table uh where I have a
static list of continent country region
and it is mapped to the uh territories
which are for in which my orders have
been placed so it's a typical one is too
many so that way you know you can keep
on adding data then you
have uh details of
returns now this is another
transactional table which is about about
the orders which have been returned
rather than being you know returned by
the customers so you have a product key
H so automatically powerbi has detected
a relationship between the product key
and the product uh table right and even
if you can join the territory key in
which territory the return has happened
right so mostly the most common
relationship which you will observe is
the one is to many because as I told
earlier the most common relational model
is the dimensional model uh the static
data the slow changing Dimensions the
scds are the master tables and the most
frequent changing are the fact table so
if I talk about a typical dimensional
model the Fulfillment table sales table
and the tror table sorry uh the
Fulfillment table sales table and my
returns table are the fact tables of my
data model so what exactly you mean by
data transformation in
PBI so data transformation can be a
little similar to data cleaning so
before any kind of data analytics you
might be receiving raw data from a
website Source a c database or an Excel
file or multiple sources right once
after you receive the data whether it is
batch mode data or stream data you are
supposed to clean it right you might
have to clean up the discrepancies like
the blank rows or the blank cells or any
irregularities in data such as wrong
data type right such discrepancies from
the data should be eliminated in the
first stage of data analytics so that's
exactly where data cleaning and data
transformation comes into the picture so
you have various tools for data cleaning
and data transformation like Excel SQL
but if you are a powerbi user then good
news for you power query and powerbi can
assist you in terms of data
Transformations so in this tutorial we
will be discussing the fundamental the
most important day-to-day data
Transformations which a data analyst
takes care of in the process of data
analysis is what we going to discuss
today so let's quickly switch to power
Pi but before that let's have a overview
of what kind of data we are exactly
dealing with today so we are dealing
with Superstore data and that's in Excel
format so this is our Superstore data
set and we have four tabs here the first
one is orders tab where we have customer
ID order ID date ship date ship mode and
customer name and in the second tab we
have store sta set which has the details
about the customer from where he or she
is the state City postal code and which
category or subcategory that they
purchase and Order sales discount profit
everything right and here we have some
information about any of the orders
which were returned and some people over
here so these are the four tabs that we
are dealing with today now that we have
an overview on the data that we're
dealing with let's quickly now switch to
PBI so now we are on the PBI window you
can just discard
changes there you go let's quickly
import the data from our downloads this
this is the data that you want to deal
with today now it might take a little
while to connect to that particular data
set and load the data on power PN just a
couple of minutes since the data set is
a little too heavy it's about
10,000 so let's wait shouldn't take
long
there you go the data got successfully
loaded so you have the option of loading
what kind of data you want you have four
tabs as we just discussed you can load
the orders Tab and you can load the
stores Tab and in case if you want the
returns tab you can also load that and
if you want all of those just load all
of those right now I just want the two
tabs order and stores now here I can
just directly load to get started
working on this but in case I don't want
any kind of discrepancies in case if I
have a doubt that this data might not be
cleaned I shall go with data
transformation so ideally you should go
with data transformation check your data
first before any kind of analytical
processes so let's go with that
transform
data and shortly we should be having the
power query window open on our desktop
screens
so there you go you can see the
completed data set has been successfully
uploaded both these stores and ERS data
sets now uh let's quickly check the data
from our data set so here you can see we
have orders date right but I can see 4
2682 and
4253 this is not in the form of dat
correct so this is the simple uh uh step
that we discuss changing the wrong data
tyag so you can just click on the lower
arrow button over here and
uh you can right click and here you have
an option to change the type correct so
it is considering it as a whole number
which is wrong so you can change it
to
date replace
current so now we trying to change the
order date from a data type whole number
to date data type so there is some error
if you click on error or if you just
navigate on to it powerbi should be able
to show you what error was it in just in
case if it's not working okay we are
unable to pass the value provided so you
can just remove that and try it in a
different way change type
to date and time
zone
date I think this should
be
helpful
or if it's not working here let's
quickly check what could be the
eror and now let's try to refresh the
data it is taking a little while
uh we also have another information that
we deal with we have the first row as
row headers so we should be declaring
PBI that we also have a row header over
here just taking a little while to
refresh meanwhile let's quickly check
into the stores data and here we have
customer name so let's try to apply
second di proof data transformation
which will be like let's say split
column we have uh the complete name of U
the customer let's try to split it into
first name and second name so by the
limiter and we can give multiple options
over here left mostly limit let's say a
person has three uh parts of his name
first name middle name and second name
or the last name so but we just wanted
to split into first and second name so
we would go with the first left mostly
limiter and split the data set press
okay and it should help us to split the
data
first name and second name and we can
also name the column separately as first
name and second name instead of custom
wiing it's taking a little while than
the ideal time but it's completely all
right since considering the 10,000 rows
of stores data and 10,000 rows of ERS
data it is all right not a problem now
let's try to take a look at the order
status it it has successfully changed it
no it is still showing us an eror I
don't know what's wrong
here it's maybe
incomplete let's quickly refresh
all instead preview and check if can it
can help
us so there you go after refreshing the
first order date is changed to D type so
what we missed is when you change the
type you're supposed to add a step so
what exactly I mean by that now we are
trying to change the second one as well
so just wait for a while and it will
give us a choice if we want to add a new
step or not that's when we select the
option yes please add a new Step so what
do I mean by steps so applied steps you
can see something over here right so
every alteration every change change or
every modification that you're doing
every transformation you're including on
your data will be recorded as a macro so
that can be implemented if you are
loading a similar dat set for the next
patch let's say this is 2022 data and if
you trying to analyze the 2023 data and
every column is similar and you can just
follow these appli steps and the same
implementation will be automated you
don't have to spend time and doing the
same process once again there you go
so this time it has recorded this step
and it automatically take has taken a
new step over here change type step one
change step step two if you don't want
the step to be added you can just select
the red x mark over here it will remove
it and similarly when you when you go
back to the stor data set here you have
the first name and second name split
successfully and uh now uh let's say you
want to have unique uh customer data
right in that scenario you can just even
remove duplicates from this particular
column just remove duplicates and you'll
just have unique data it's possible that
one customer might have come here to buy
the same uh you know buy the same
product from different dates or One
customer might have uh done a repeated
purchase so it's possible but again if
in case if you just wanted to know if
there is a way to eliminate duplicate
entries then you can do that so for now
let's not delete the customer IDs here
because one customer might have visited
the same store for multiple times and
might have purchased a different uh
product or might have made the same
order with multiple products right so
there is a possibility for that let's
not disturb the data set so I just
wanted you to know if there is a way to
eliminate the duplication from the DAT
is set yes it is now let's also check
another possibility of data
transformation so let's say you wanted
to add a new column and identify or
include some mathematical operations for
now let's say I have sales quantity
discount and profit but I don't know
what's the rate right so here the sale
is for2 $61 and quantity is two but I
don't know what's the rate of one for so
I can include that you can just select
the last column or where you want a new
column just go to the add new column
here and here you can just uh choose the
custom
column should be somewhere over here
yeah this is the custom column and now
if you click on the custom column you
can rename the custom CL column to rate
of
product and here you can choose the
mathmatical operations to be applied on
the columns so sales column insert
or double click divided by
quantity okay now it should give you the
rate of each product individual
product it is taking some sizable time
which don't take so long so there you go
you have the rate of product and now
let's say you want to combine multiple
data sets for for example here I have
stores data set but my stores data set
doesn't have any data related to orders
and orders does not have any data
related to customers now I want to
combine these two is there a way yes you
can do that now let's get back to stores
and here go to home option and here you
have something called merge queries so
now the stor data set has been selected
in the first data set here just select
the dropdown and select the second data
type just orders so here you can see
stores with the current one which is in
the first place now select based on
which primary key you want to combine
both so I want to go with customer ID
because both of my data sets do have
customer IDs so I'll go with customer ID
and both data set will be combined at
the end at the last column powerbi will
show me a new table not a new column it
will give me a table combined with all
the columns in one column you just have
to expand the column and select which
columns from the second data set you
want to include in your overall data set
so let's do that practically so here you
can see I just have tables if I select
the expand column option over here you
can see I have a lot of columns here so
just deselect everything I do have row
ID I do have a customer ID what I need
is order ID order date shift date
shipment mode and customer name I do
have it so that's all I need so just
press on okay and I should have them
included in my new data set Al
together it might take a little
while so there you go we have the new
orders ID order date shift date and
shift mode added to our data set now
just click on close and
apply
and your data set is already ready for
data analysis Supply changes it is
taking a little time so at the end you
just have to click on the apply changes
and your data will be ready for analysis
so that's exactly how you can perform
data transformation in powerbi desktop
version so there you go the res set got
successfully loaded all over here and
you can just drag and drop them onto the
visualization spot and you can work on
your data yes yes so now the power Pi
visuals are on the screen you can see we
have file home and add data to your
report visualizations filters data Etc
right for now I think we don't have any
data we can quickly import the data onto
this particular platform and starter
analysis but before we get started with
that everybody knows there are simple
tricks to create all the type of
visualizations right if you expand if I
if I could expand my screen here you can
have all these visuals and let's say if
I just double click here and if I want
any type of visual it'll just show me
the visual right let's say I want a bar
graph for the sales happening in all the
regions so I'll just double click I'll
tap it down give me a bar graph for
sales right it will give you and just in
case if you wanted the py chart for the
country wise you can just give
Countrywide sales by chart right but now
let me tell you a few things correct so
if you are using a pie chart and if you
are dealing with let's say a lot of
companies or I mean countries a lot of
countries like 20 countries or 25
countries right in that scenario pie
chart look a little clutter all right
and let's say you wanted to find out the
sales that are happening in the region
wise and you asked power to create a
line graph for that that would not give
you the proper visual that will not give
you the proper visual ization to be
honest right so as a beginner if you are
learning powerbi the most fundamental
thing is not just understanding how the
tools in the powerbi work what kind of
visualizations you have the most
critical thing that you will need to
know after understanding the basics is
what type of chart is to be used for
what kind of visualization right so
that's exactly we are going to discuss
today what kind of data requires what
kind of visual ization let's say I'm
working with date data type let's say
I'm working with sales data type let's
say there is a requirement where I need
to present the data in form of table or
a card then what are those scenarios and
if I want to use the pie chart or bar
graph then what kind of data types that
I need to deal with what are the
situation where I need to use the bar
graph and where I shouldn't right a few
basic fundamentals that we will be
dealing with today so we have uh a wide
variety of bar graphs in the first row
and a wide variety of line graphs in the
second row which deal with the line
graph area area graph ribbons Etc and in
the third row we have waterfall funnel
scatter plot pie chart donut chart tree
map and next we have map and right
filled map and we have uh the gauge
cards and everything right and here we
also have a kpi right so we'll also go
through a kpi uh type of chart and if
you want want to learn about the kpis
exclusively then we have the kpi
tutorial and powerbi lined up in this
particular Series so you can also go
through that and after that we have some
slicers and we have tables and we have
Matrix right so a wide variety of charts
available correct so we will try to
understand the major ones the first true
bar graph which are the scenarios where
you need to use the bar graphs next R we
have the line right line area so all
these Comm the one uh kind of set they
are similar to one another so which is a
scenario where you can use a line graph
which is a scenario where you can use a
waterfall or a funnel chart which is a
scenario where you can use a scatter
plot which is a scenario where you can
use a pie chart right a a wide variety
of uh probabilities a wide variety of
permutations and combinations so what
are the exact needs what are the exact
visualizations that carry a value that
carry a meaning to the stakeholder
which are those particular charts which
explain the numbers in the right way
possible so that's the point of today's
discussion so to begin with let's import
the data first from the Excel document
so we will be using the Excel data over
here just click okay now you have a wide
variety of tables which are present in
that particular workbook we are dealing
with the data tab so just click on it
select and load if there are any
mistakes or if there are any
discrepancies power bi will let you know
and it will also it has the caliber to
also fix those particular data rows
right so there is one or seven errors
right now you can choose to close but
the overall tutorial is about learning
the type of visualization right so seven
rows out of 10,000 will not make a huge
difference for us right now because we
are trying to just understand the basic
understanding of what type of charts to
use so I'll just quickly close this but
in case if you want to fix you can just
click on this View errors and the power
query will open up in the background you
can just switch to the power query Tab
and fix the data rules where they really
need to be fixed right so let me close
it for now and now in a short notice you
can see we have the data loaded here now
we have two types but if you let me let
us imagine that you're on tblo and on
table you have two things dimensions and
measures right so measures is
self-explanatory anything that deals
with numbers is called as measure and
anything that deals with characters or
names or anything such which is not a
number is considered as a dimension
right so here we have category City
Country customer ID so these are the
ones which can be considered as
dimensions and where you have a
summation logo or a mathematical symbol
right in front of it can be considered
as a measure right now let's say we
wanted to create the month-on-month
sales report correct which deals with
the data type so just uh data data type
right just remember whenever date is
included in your parameters either
you're adding it to the rows or columns
just make sure that you are using the
line chart which is over here so let's
quickly rename our page to line charts
or
graphs
correct now we have named that now you
can either choose to double click and
add that and then here you have x-axis
and ya Axis or you know you can just
drag the order date expand this order
date and the hierarch is over here so if
you want to go with the month on month
you can simply add this to x-axis and
you can have your sales data somewhere
over here drag this to Y AIS this is one
way of creating it but in case if you
don't want to waste time in this
particular huge uh process you can just
choose to Simply double click on the
canvas and write it on here line
chart sales month click and there you go
right brilliant now if you choose to
Spotlight or you can just expand this
right and if you choose the spotlight
you can see a vertical line showing you
the numbers correct we start from
January and all the way to December
right and here you have the monthon
Monon sales so remember whenever the
date data type is included in one of
your parameters then the best way to
represent the best way to visualize the
reports will be the Lang dra right with
that let's switch to the next one now
since we were supposed to discuss the
bar first but let's it's it's okay not a
problem so let's discuss the bar charts
now let us know the data set first so we
have sales profit discount numbers Etc
right and we have region wise city wise
category wise country wise so let us go
with category now let us go with
category and try to build a bar graph
just double click anywhere and category
okay bar graph
okay if not category you can also choose
to have subcategory Okay g r a p just
take care of your spellings I think I
missed an R over here bar graph
subcategory enter
sales there you go so you have your
chart right here if you just expand it
you can see we have a wide variety of
subcategories and powerbi who was kind
enough for us to you know sort the data
in form of highest uh um ticket price or
highest selling product in the first
place and the lowest selling product in
the last place so this is how the bar
graphs work but just in case if you you
can tell me why couldn't we go with a
let's say pie chart right let a soldier
check there if I just click on this what
happens you can see a lot of cluttered
data right you have a lot of subc
categories here more than maybe 10 right
so in this scenario the visuals are a
little displeasing and you don't have
the accurate value over here just undo
it and you have the bar graph which is a
a little clearer to look at a little
more you know decent to understand
what's happening you can just focus on
the top five over here and you can
understand what's going on right now you
can just rename them
as and you can choose to go with any
kind of bar graph vertical or horizontal
or in case if you have a few more let's
say we go with the category first and
under the category you have subcategory
then you can also go with that and you
have an overlapping type of graphs over
here stacked bar graphs which can show
you in that particular category which
was the product which was highest
selling right now you can also add that
whereas the category right you can just
choose that
okay so I think we can open a new tab
and okay so we have the paragraph next
we have waterfall so let's open a and
let's name it as
waterfall so waterfall is uh something
which get performance of that particular
uh property or that particular entity
let's say I wanted to find out the ear
on year or wise performance of that
particular subcategory in those
scenarios I can go with waterfall so
just simply double click and ask PBI to
create a waterfall
model waterall
chart Enter space
sale there you go so it's giving you the
period over period sales report of
subcategories and the green line
indicates that it is slowly growing in
terms of sales and sub and the red one
shows the decline in sales which is not
happening anywhere and this is the total
the overall you know the overall
subcategories so it'll give you a
waterfall model and the overall total of
that particular uh segment is this much
and now we have dealt with subcategory
uh waterall model and let's try to
create a ribbon chart so ribbon chart
chart and the area chart those are
similar to one other stacked area area
and ribbon chart so ribbon chart will
give you the performance of that
particular product in the uh timely if
you want to see the performance of that
particular product in measured in terms
of time let's say uh month on month
quarter on quarter year on year day by
day that can be done using the ribbon
chart similar to the line chart but
anyways let's let's take a look I'll
name it as ribbon and uh just double
click the powerbi
canvas ribbon chart I just ribbon
subcategory
enter sale there you go if you write
order month you can also track the
monthly performance of those products
right you can see a study deine you can
see a study upline and uh so here you
can see
the months and here you can see the
different colors of months the different
colors represent the months so here are
the products and based on the products
how is the monthly performance right is
it declining or is it uh increasing can
find it out you can basically find out
that and uh moving ahead we will deal
with u scatter right so first we dealt
with the the barass next we dealt with
the line graphs and now we also dealt
with waterfall funnel which is something
similar next we have stack chart scatter
plot chart right now scatter plot is a
little different let's say you're
dealing with numbers only numbers
nothing different usually what we do is
we carry out a dimension and a measure
right but in this scenario you want to
deal with only numbers let's say you are
providing some discount on all your
products and you wanted to know the
profit against the discount offer here
you're dealing with two numbers profit
and discount right so in those scenarios
what do you do so that's when you find
out by using the scatter plot just
double click on the canvas write it down
as build me a scatter plot just check
the spelling s c a t e r scatter
discount enter and profit now it will
create a scatter plot based on discount
and against the profit now you can give
some uh Dimension you can go with
subcategory there you go now you have
the profit obtained against discount
offered based on different subcategories
just expand it and you can see in which
subcategory what kind of discount was
offered and what kind of profits did you
make so 25% uh uh discount was being
offered on accessories and you made a
profit still you made a profit of
$333,000 and here you can see almost 200
discount was offered and still you I
think that is OnePlus One offer or maybe
end of the season sale but still they
made a profit based on some parameters
and here you can see
the least discount and highest profit
okay the least profit and highest
discount is in terms of tables which is
33% the maximum out of everything and uh
they still did not manage to earn some
good profits out there so this is how
you create a scatter plot just quickly
name it as scatter and next we can deal
with the pie chart now just double click
on the canvas pie chart
region
sale so you have four to five regions
here and using a pie chart would make a
good uh impact on this particular visual
as everything seems clear and you can
easily make out which particular region
made the highest sale by just looking at
the size of these pieces right now let's
quickly name this as
p and now let's move to the you can just
uh you know you can use the same data
for creating a donut craft you can use
the same data use to create a treay map
and yeah those are similar to one
another and let's let's quickly jump and
now let's create some maps right now
when do you need to use map type charts
let's say your data set has some
geographical data something like City
something like country something like
continent right or longitudes latitudes
anything which gets in touch or gets in
line with the geographical data then you
can proceed and build the map data types
I mean the maps correct so something
which is related to the map data type
you can build a map now let me double
click on the canvas and ask powerbi to
create a
map
country
sales there you go you have as simple as
that you have the country wise sales
sales on power PI right here you can
also choose to have Fil A map which will
show you how much sale is happening the
darkest color will indicate the highest
sale and the lightest color will
indicate the lowest sale now moving
ahead we have the cards and gauge so
cards and gauge completely similar to
each other just click on the powerbi
double click we can write card country
okay let's go with region because we
don't want to go or you can we don't
want to have multiple cards we just want
to have three to four cards on our
dashboard so we'll go with
category save so you just have a card
here right you can just keep it anywhere
on the corner in terms of real time
dashboard you you can just keep it
anywhere and uh let's name it as card
now let's proceed and create a kpi so
multi row card you can also create a
multirow card let's say you have uh
let's go back to card and check it once
so if you create a multirow card we have
three categories and you can also add
add the subcategories of each category
so that's similar to a multi row card
correct now let's go back to the last
type or we have kpis and uh table so KPS
and table are completely similar to each
other let's try to go with the kpi now
we have discount profit sale and uh
quantity correct so kpi is something
which gives you the direct realtime
number of what's happening with your
real time dashboard correct now how many
number of you know how many number of
products are sold what's the overall
sale that we performed what's the
overall profit that we received what's
the overall discount that we offer in
terms of one single uh dashboard you can
create a kpi for that now now let's let
me create a kpi discount first that's
easy as that now kpi for the profit
enter there you go now double click kpi
for sale enter there you go and lastly
kpi for
quantity there you go now that's how you
create the different types of charts so
basically if you integrate all these
charts into one page or One dashboard or
one canvas that's what you call as a
realtime interactive dashboard in Pap pi
and again coming back to the slicers if
you were using Excel you might have to
interconnect each and every single chart
using the report connection option but
in Pia you don't have to create that
particular report connection process you
can just click on the uh s or slices any
of the chart and you can click on the
any of the options let's say you wanted
to find out country wise sales you just
click on the country provided right so
here somewhere you had yeah you have Jan
Feb and everything right so if you just
click on Jan every chart available on
the powerbi dashboard will connect to it
uh connect to the different you
dependent charts and give you a real
time information without having to
create or report connections to each
other right so basically if you just add
all these charts onto one particular
canvas that's when you get the realtime
interactive dashboard in powerbi and so
I hope you have understood what kind of
chart you need to use based on what kind
of uh data you have so we are on the
powerbi window right now so here we can
see we have already loaded the data we
have the filters we should I izations
Etc and we have the canvas over here
right so in the visuals section if you
closely observe you have the kpi over
here right so you can either select and
drag it onto the canvas or you can just
simply double click and create a kpi but
before that what exactly is a kpi right
it's the key performance indicator right
it's a full form of kpi so what exactly
is key performance indicator let's say
we have the sales dashboard over here
sales data over here right now we have
region wise sales we have country-wise
sales we have region wise profits we
have region wise uh discounts we have
quantity right so it's like a visual
it's like a number clear literal
readable number right on top of your
dashboard right so if you just want to
have a quick glance of how many number
of sales you made how's the profit
happening how's the sale happening how's
the discount that you're getting right
and how many number of quantity of
certain product is been sold in a
segment right so those are the key
performance numbers which will be
available right on top of your dashboard
so that's exactly what you call as a kpi
now how do you create a kpi so one way
is you can just hold the kpi and drag it
onto the canvas or so this is one way of
creating the kpi let's remove this now
another simplistic way of creating a kpi
is just double click anywhere on the
dashboard or the canvas and you'll have
this Jo so just write what kind of kpi
you want to create so I want to create
kpi for sales just create that and you
have your kpi there now another one kpi
discount just click on that you have the
kpi for discount double click once again
kpi for
profits have the kpi for profits now kpi
for
quantity there you go that's how you
create kpis in power player should you
need to arrange the kpi sizes or color
or background you can also do that by
just simply playing around the sections
over here right the background or the
the outline section over here you can
just play with it you can increase the
size decrease the size add a background
you have a setting over here you can do
anything that you want right now we will
discuss about calculated columns now so
far what we have done as per our last
session is that we did data modeling on
the different data sets which we had
imported in powerbi like products sales
data returns fulfillment customer
details uh and customer Master data
calendar details Etc so in the last
session we prepared a data model and
established the relationships between
these different data sets
like 1 is to one 1 is to many many to
one 1 is to one Etc and we saw the
examples now once our relational model
is uh prepared our data model is
prepared now our next activity is to
create certain additional columns which
we want to derive bases the data which
we have imported so for example I'll
start with my product data set now in my
product dat set I want to introduce a
column which basically categorizes that
if any product which has a color uh you
know red black or gray I'm going to tag
it as a colored product rest I'm going
to say not a colored product right so
all these are like example of B type
product skus so for that now in order to
introduce a new column you just need to
to do what you need to select the table
in the data grid go to the table tools
and say new
column okay so column will get appended
to the rightmost part and you will start
see a uh formula section typical to like
you get in your Excel now I'm going to
say that the name of my column is going
to be bik type color okay and I'm just
creating a if condition
if
product
color is equal
to
Black
okay
or or if it is equal to red or if it is
equal
to
gray then say yes it's a colored product
I'll
say
no okay so now you can see Bas is the
product color red and black they are
saying bike type color Yes blue is no
multi is no etc etc so this is a classic
example of an if and else condition
based conditional
column okay so you can create such
columns now second column custom column
which I want to create is I'm going to
call as
discount now basis the pricing of my
products I want to associate certain
discounts which I'm ready to give to my
customers Bas is the product category
like what is the pricing of the category
again I'm going to use make use of if
else but in a nested way so if I'm
seeing if
my
product price is less than 100 then I
will
give 0%
of uh 0 percentage of uh discount so
zero into product price just to keep it
consistent now I'm seeing
else if less than 100 than zero else
I'll check again that
if the price
is less
than 500 then I'm ready ready to give 1%
discount on the product
price
else I'll move further so like this I
have created a
formula so what I'm saying is if product
price is less than 100 give 0% if it is
less than 500 then give 1% less than
2,000 then
1.5% less than 3,000 then 2% and
otherwise else less less than 3,000 if
it 2% else 3% right now after this
column is
created now you can check right so this
see the product price for this
particular product it is less than 100
so that's why there's no discount it is
uh between 100 to 200 then this has been
given a 1% discount so like this all the
discount column is now calculated now
this column is available just like a
regular column in my product table
now after this I'll go to my sales
table now in sales table I want to
identify
uh create a column called as cost there
is no product cost column over here so
that will be
derived so let's create a
column
called as
cost and it is derived by order
quantity into now the cost of the
product is in the product table and I
know I've already created a relationship
between product and sales
table so I just need to select the
product cost column now only keyword
which I have to use in powerbi is the
related keyword so this will pick up the
relation and now for this particular
sale order the cost has already been
derived so this order number this is the
cost for which uh the product has is the
costing of the product for this
particular
order
okay now I'm going to create another
conditional column over here called as
order
status I'm seeing if
any order whose order quantity is
greater than
two then for my organization it's an
urgent order else it is
a normal
order oh
sorry
I lost
it
so this is
my order status column and I have my
order
quantity urgent or
normal so any order which has order
quantity one is normal any order which
is having order quantity as greater than
two is is urgent you can see this so
there's
a this whole
powerbi uh tabs and sheets allow you to
also review the data what you're doing
so it's very
convenient
now I have my sales data now what I want
to bring within the sales is my discount
column so here also I want to bring the
discount which I have
created so I'll say
[Music]
discount discount will be order
quantity
into
related product discount right so the
discount calcul column which I had
created under products I'll bring over
here now I am creating the order level
discount so if you see for this
particular order there's a
25 uh uh you know for 25 rupee discount
at the cost is 100,000 rupees
okay
and what is the order price now so I
have taken the order cost the discount
now I have to create a column called as
price order price so that will
be again order
quantity into
related price which is per
product price enter
okay so now I have the cost the discount
and the price right available with me
now I want to calculate the
total uh total revenue total profit and
loss
right per order how
much so first I'll calculate per order
how much revenue I'm generating so now I
have to generate a column called as
revenue revenue is
price minus discount
so 1700 - 25 1700 - 25 2071 - 42 and if
I want to calculate the profit per
order
then it is
revenue Minus
cost okay so now you can see you know
typical custom columns calculated
columns which we have created are all
playing around around with the number
numeric values numeric data primarily
and trying to give inferences into per
order cost discount per order price
revenue and profit so typical
calculation columns which I have
prepared in front of
you now let's take a look at other
different variations of custom columns
uh I'll create certain columns for text
based custom columns calculated columns
uh using text based data so I'm now
moving towards my customer table in
which I have customer key prefix first
name last name birth date marital status
and
gender now I want to create a new column
in which I want to derive the age of
each customer as of today right so I'll
use another function a date function
called
as date
diff now date diff so I want the
difference between the birth date of the
customer and as of today in years
okay so this customer as of today 68
year old one is 74 68 57 Etc so this is
one derivation of calculated column of
age let's take another example now this
is a text based column where I want
to derive the full name name of the
customer now here I'll say
first lower case in lower case I'll
concatenate the
prefix then
ENT
space and
mcent first
name
ment space
ment last
name and closing brackets
Etc full
name okay so this is an example of full
name in low
cases now another calculated column
additional column at the customer level
I want to identify a flag which says who
is my Target customer veres the
demographics shared over here Target
customer so I'll
say
if the marital status is equal to
M
and total children
three and total children annual
income so okay so let me change the
logic a bit so marital status is M and
age
is less
than
50 these customers are my Target
customers okay so I would
say yes
else
no see this his marital status is
married Logan Dias and age is less than
50 else everyone so if I try to
filter so these are the my Target
customers 69 out of 1178 so this is just
a conditional column but a logical
condition an example which I'm trying to
highlight over here
okay now let's look at certain
calendar date oriented columns
calculated
columns very typical like now I have a
simple date column now I'll keep adding
certain columns which uh you know which
help you which will help you understand
how we can uh you know do some
calculations on the dates so like for
example I want a date which is 12 days
after the current date the date in the
column so just simple 12 Days After
select the date and add
12 now if you see the date format you
can go and change the format at the top
and if whatever you feel like like
this
now see 12 Days After 1st Gen 2015 is 13
gen 2005 you can go and change the
format and other
details let me also show you if I go to
my cost and other columns I can go and
change the format this is like a
currency cost is currency so I can go
and uh select the change the currency
type and you can even show the dollar
value or whatever currency type it
is so for numbers you can do currency or
text or dates you can select the format
so this is available at the column tools
level now in
customers like we had
our column of full name so now what all
things are available format as text okay
data type text so very minimal options
are there with date you have options of
the date
format now
next I want a column which defines the
expiry date okay so 8 months prior to
the expiry date with is which is uh
coming up in 8 months so I'll create a
column called as 8 months
expiry and then there is a e date
function I'll use that I'll use
my date in the data
set comma I'll say eight so now this
date column will append 8 months to
my actual date and again I can go and
change the
format correct now another important
column like I want to know the date
name so I'll use a function called as
format and I'll select my calendar date
column and I'll say give me the
dddd format of it so it will give me the
day name the day the day name of on that
particular
date
next ears in
between so I want the ears in between
the today's date and the date of my
calendar so equal to date
diff the calendar
date comma
today comma
year
and 7 years 2015 to
2022 then last date of the month so if I
want what is the last date of this
particular calendar month I will use a
function EO month which is there
available in
the powerbi so I'll
say last date of the
month equal to EO
month
then just select the calendar CSV date
comma zero in months and enter
change the
format then similarly start of the
month
so I'll use a function called start of
month so for for all January dates end
of the month is 31st Jan and start of
the month will remain 1st of
Jan change the
format
next I want to know what is the week
number of that particular date so now
there is an inbuilt function
called week number week num and just
pass the date and you will get the week
number first week of the year second
week of the year
Etc
now another
very good example is whether the
week day is a week day or a weekend
right so what is it's a week type
okay so I'll CH I'll put a if condition
and there is a function called
weekday and I'll pass the
calendar if it is less than six it means
it's a
weekday else it's a
weekend so all
Saturday and Sunday day names will come
as weekend G else everything else will
come as
VD so these are very different
variations of different column types
calculated columns which is a very
important utility and uh and any Bravo
bi project you will definitely be ending
up creating n number of calculated
columns to derive your numbers to
prepare your reports
but it's important to understand what
all things we can do that yes there are
n number of functions available in
powerbi uh but uh what I have tried to
Showcase over here is some important
functions but basis your utility basis
your problem statement you can uh look
up for a relevant function in the
powerbi
dictionary now with
this introduction to calculated column
this is the base for us to now get into
our next session
where will be we will be talking about
creating Dax measures and Dax functions
we will be using powerbi Dax functions
which is much more powerful than simple
uh calculated columns where you can do
more uh complex calculations uh you can
calculate totals and then use them in
the reports so for that we will look up
into our next session powerbi let's also
learn about Dax expressions and that's
basically your data analysis Expressions
so it's basically collection of
functions operators and constants which
can be used in formulas or Expressions
to calculate or return one or more
values now we can basically add a new
column so we can do that or we can also
create new measures now usually there is
a shorter way of doing it you can go
into modeling and here as of of now
nothing is highlighted because there is
no data uploaded we see just a new table
what I can do is I can go to home and I
can let's get our data but this time
I'll take the simpler data although we
can work on the same earlier data set
which relates to IP addresses and all
that so that also can be done and to
learn we can take up this particular
data which is global super store which
we have used earlier now here I can
select orders I can select people and I
can also select returns now what we can
do is before loading we can just do some
quick transformation on this particular
data so that opens up my power query
editor so here if you remember we have
worked on this this is returns so what I
can do is I can basically go in here I
can say use first row as headers now
that's one transformation which I would
want to do let's go to people and it
basically has person and region we will
still do the same thing use first row as
headers so that gives me the name of the
person and the person belongs to which
particular region you have then your
orders data set and here things look
fine so we can select different
countries we can select different
product categories we can basically work
on your different use cases here like we
have seen earlier picking up a category
as technology picking up a
subcategory and we can also create
models based on these three data sets so
this looks perfectly fine to me so let's
go ahead and just do a close and apply
and let's have our data quickly loaded
now as I have explained earlier it is
good to do transformation enough data
wrangling so that your data is not huge
when you're loading it because then that
will slow down your queries slow down
your visuals slow down your reports and
so on now this is the data we have and
say for example I would want to work on
a visual so we know how we can do that
so I can basically click on my orders I
can look at the aggregated columns such
as discount might be postal code might
be profit and it depends if you have
basically not changed the data types now
now if you see here postal code and
summation really does not go well
probably this has been as uh this has
been loaded as a data type which is
integer but profit and quantity looks
good row ID sales look good so we can
work on Dax Expressions now here if you
go into the modeling it says do you want
to create a new measure you can create a
new column that will get added to your
Visual and here when you are looking
into to the table you can click on this
and this also gives you an option of
creating a new measure or a new column
new quick measure and you can work on
Dax so when I said Dax let's quickly
look at what or how Dax looks like talk
about Dax the simplest way to understand
is knowing the basic syntax so usually
you first have some kind of measure name
so for example we can say average about
something we can say okay let's say
average sales so that becomes one of my
measure which I'm interested in
calculating now how do I calculate that
so for that I use an operator so which
shows here so that's your operator which
you're are going to use and then you use
a Dax function so Dax has or powerbi has
lot of functions which we can use so for
example I would use a function like
average which we can choose from the
drop- down as we start typing in now
this one as a function then needs a
referred data table so basically let's
say I would be interested in orders so I
can select my table or my data set as
you say and then you can choose a
particular column so from orders I would
want to do an average on say sales and
and I can key in the column name here
and that basically is my simplest tax
expression so we can have a complicated
way of looking at it or we can basically
say okay I would want to find out
average sales and I would want to might
be look into a particular City or where
I would say it is per City so mightbe I
could say average sales and then I could
say by city or by year or I would want
to look into a particular year if we
have the order date so we can say
greater than a particular order date so
we would want how our sales have got
affected after a particular date and
that depends on the situation so I can
do that and here I can say greater
than
order date now for that obviously we
have to use the operator and then I
would want to calculate so I can
basically say
calculate now this is what I would want
to find out so I can say calculate and
then in calculate I can say let's take
the column which we are interested in so
we can pass in something like a measure
here so for example I can just say
average sales this is what I want but I
will give a separator here to filter out
the data and then I am going to use my
order
date for example I can basically say
let's take
orders and in that I am taking order
date and then basically this order date
has to be greater than or lesser than
something so here you are specifying
your data set your table and the column
you are giving a filter here and that's
basically your Dax expression so your
Dax has different functions so when we
talk about these functions like as I
said you are going for average or you're
going to calculate something so you have
what we uh usually mean or uh we use is
your predefined formulas now that can
perform calculations by using specific
values called arguments so which are in
particular order and structure so always
remember that when you talk about Dax
this always refers a complete column or
a table now there are different
categories of functions which we can
work on so you have date and time such
as date difference or finding out now or
finding out lat later time you can use
something like time intelligence which
is dates between first date and last
date you can go for information
functions which contains custom data you
can have logical functions mathematical
functions statistical functions uh text
functions you have uh basically working
on parent child relationship so there
are different function categories which
can be used and as as I said we can go
for creating a new column or a new
measure and we can use this Dax for our
data analysis now let's see how we do
that so say for example I have my order
date now I would want to work on this so
let's select say for example go to your
data set and you have lot of data here
so you can basically go for all this
data here which shows me complete
information of the different columns and
you can choose which columns you are
interested in which columns might be you
would want to cut short so for example I
have order ID I have row ID mightbe I
don't want a row ID so I can choose if I
want to delete this and you can say okay
I would want to delete this now these
are some Chang es which you are applying
and now if you see there is
no uh row ID what we see here as a field
you start with your
order ID you have your category you have
your order date shipment and here you
have your
segment and for example we have country
region Market category subcategory
product name sales and then you have
your quantity discount profit and all of
this now what we can do is I can
basically add something here so this is
the data which we have and what we can
do is we can continue working on
this so let's click on home and here you
have ways to transform the data you have
a new measure you have quick measure you
have new column and you can try out
these so for example example I can go
into new column and that basically says
okay what is your column called now I
can say for example as I was explaining
let's go for average sales so let's call
it average sales now that's what I'm
interested in now I need to use an
internal function so let's type in AV
and that shows me okay so there is an
inbuilt function called average we can
use this one so you can just hit on
enter and now it says okay which is the
data set you're interested in now based
on the reports based on the data sets
I've used earlier it shows me options of
different tables what we have or
different data sets what we have so
let's choose orders so this is what I'm
interested in you can go for double
click and that gets selected and now it
says okay you want average on sales but
which is the column which you would want
to use
so we can go for category we can go for
Country we can go for customer ID all of
these are your different columns so for
example I can go for something like
country and that basically gets selected
now I can complete this by just closing
the
parenthesis and that's basically my dags
function so my D function is ready and
if you want you can add details to it so
if you would want to continue your
function you can always do a shift enter
that takes you to the next line if you
do not want it you can go back you can
add a comment by saying alt shift and
letter a and then you can say my first
Dax function and you can give in some
information depending on what kind of
function you you are creating and that
basically allows you to create the
function so this is done now let's hit
on enter and basically it will say the
function average cannot work with values
of type string and and that's right I
mean we basically chose the wrong
country I mean you cannot have an
average on Country so that's not right I
should use something where I have to
take a numeric value so for example I
will replace this so I will say I want
average sales and here I can choose what
should I take so for example let's go
for
sales and that's what I would want so it
says order sales and then hit on enter
and it basically has populated my new
column but then it is basically taking
average sales and it has taken average
sales overall now we have not we have
just selected a column we have not given
any filter so it just gives me average
and it populates every row with this one
now this is fine that we have added a
column it has the same average value and
that basically gives me sales on average
so as I said your Dax function always
references a complete column or a
complete table and then basically it
adds the value now let's see how we can
use this if you notice the field or the
column has got added here let's get into
visualization and what I can do is I can
basically choose one of the type of
visualizations so for example if I
choose this and say for example I would
be adding this average sales and that is
the data I would want to look into so
what we can do is we can just say okay
I'm interested in this average sales it
shows me the function and we can add it
here now this is just giving me the
average sales overall now that really
doesn't make sense let's look at this
one or plotted graph so it gives me what
is the aage sales and it gives me some
visualization so we can create
visualization like this based on our
column now what we can also do is we can
go back to our data and we can go for
different functions so as I said you can
create a function that adds a column now
let's go for something else so I will
say average sales and I would be
interested in say a particular
product now we have average sales and
that is the the measure which we can use
so for example I would want to find
out
um wherein the year or let's look at the
date field here so for example we have
country as
France it is telling me City it is
giving me customer name it gives me a
segment so let's choose a different
field and we can filter by that so for
example example I'll say average sales
buy or whatever name you want to give
let's say segment now what I will do
here is instead of using this
average so I will go for something like
calculate now I can go for calculate I
can go for concatenate so let's go for
calculate and we know that we have a
particular column so let's go for this
one which is let's open up a bracket
here so let's go here let's give
our column name so that could be your
average sales so let's look at what was
the column name and we have average
sales with a SS Capital so let's go for
average and then let's go for sales now
this is what I want to do but on what so
let's choose this
and here I'm going to now
[Music]
choose orders so and then we have to
basically look at the column which has
the segment value so segment now this is
what I would want to use and then we can
try giving a value to this so you have
segment as corporate so for example
let's say let's go
for so it says calculate given
expression which we have already given
that's your average sales or we can
basically give the expression what we
did earlier and then you go for a
filtering value so I'm saying order
segment and let's go for something like
corporate now that going to be my
segment let's close this one so here's
the example what you do is you give your
measure name so that says average sales
by segment you can do a calculate now
here you have to pass in a measure so
for example I'm saying average and I'm
saying take an average for sales that is
give me an average value of sales but
what I'm interested in is when the order
segment is corporate so I'm giving a
filter here and then it gives me average
sales by segment so that's the column
value here and it is basically filtering
out based on the segment being
incorporate so segment is our particular
column here which is showing up
somewhere let me see where is my segment
column so we have your
product now I have uh let's search
for Country City postal code customer ID
and since we have chosen order sales it
is giving me this average value and you
can choose a different column or you can
say profit is greater than something
else so I would be only interested in
those values and you can continue adding
things to your tax expression
and this is how you can do here so
basically what I did was we were using a
measure which is average order sales I
said my segment has to be corporate or
basically you can just say segment has
to exist so you can say a Boolean value
like equals true now I'm saying orders
profit has to be greater than 100 and
I'm only looking for my average sales by
segment where profit is greater than 100
segment is Corporate and now this has
calculated the value so you basically
see here so it tells me 286 if you look
at the profit value so it is greater
than 100 what I can do is I can even add
a filter here so for example I can say
greater than and let's give some value
here so for example let's go for 100 and
let's see if it has done the work so you
see all the average values where it is
greater than 100 and then we have to
also look at our other values we can
filter it so segment has to be corporate
and let's apply the filter here so I
will uncheck I'll say corporate now this
is what I'm interested in so it tells me
the corporate is sector now you see the
sales value which is already showing up
here which we have we have a sales by
segment which is telling me that you
have corporate segment and it gives you
where the profit values are greater than
100 now we have this Dax here we have
applied we have the filter and what we
can do is we can go to quickly
visualization and what I can do is I can
choose this I can add it here and then
that says me average sales by segment
however we can go for different kind of
visualization which can give us more
meaning here and look at the data so
this is how you can simply use your tax
Expressions now this is a simple quick
uh session where you are looking at the
Dax expression so when you look at this
symbol it means it is a Dax expression
so you can
obviously double click on this one and
that shows you what is your tax
expression now as I said I have given
two filters here so always remember once
you have given a measure you give your
first filter and then you can give any
number of filters you can just order it
in a different line that should be fine
let's say average sales by
segment okay so let's say
average
sales
by set segment okay
profit greater than 100 so I can give
some kind of name which basically
identifies my column and that gives me
the value now if you see here we have
applied these filters and that's why we
are only seeing the relevant data which
is profit which is a particular segment
and you can create any number of Dax
expressions like this using some inbuilt
functions so anytime
if you would want to see if your Dax
expression is working fine what you can
do is for example I can say test
function okay now I would want to create
a function and then I can basically
choose the available functions as I said
you have logical functions you have
statistical functions you have
mathematical functions you have
information functions so you have all of
these options here and you can choose
one of these so for example we were
going for average you have and and or
for example I can directly go for and
but that would not make sense in the
beginning you can go for absolute value
of something so for example let's choose
absolute and now I want to work on
orders so I go for orders and here I can
say okay I'm looking at orders but I
would be looking at sales value I I
would want the exact value so I can
choose this one right and here now once
I am creating a function so I can be
selecting a different column so this is
basically one column now you can add
calculation you want to do but this
basically says unexpected expression
because this is a new dag for a new
column so what I can do is I can take
this out from here I I can go ahead and
create a new column and then or a new
measure so I can do that and it works
perfectly fine now I can save this and
we can call it whatever report you would
want to call so let's say super
store with new Dax and you can share it
you can publish it you can continue
using it in your reports so you can
create any number of functions as such
and then just save it so for example I
have set of Dax functions and I can
upload it on a GitHub link so here for
example if I go in here and if I click
on Dax so that tells me the different
kind of visualizations I have based on
the standard data so it depends on uh my
file which is which should be existing
here so I can go in here and this should
actually work but the location has
changed and I just click on open report
I can do a browse report I can go into
powerbi content and here let's look into
this one and just say open so that will
not only load the report it has
different visuals and uh different
visuals with the standard data set which
comes with Microsoft and it basically
has different kind of visuals and each
of those visuals again have different
tax functions so you can use these also
so what we have learned is working on a
store data set working on some thread
hunting data sets working on our own
created tables and these are some of the
pages what you see here so this is based
on the data which comes in with AWS and
you can always look into one of these
and you can search if you see here look
at this icon and it tells me okay this
looks like a tag function and let's
double click on this one and that shows
me the function what you're doing so
you're creating a function called age it
uses State difference it works on dim
customer table on the birthday date and
you would want to basically find out the
date difference between now and the
birthday and you would want the year so
this is is the data what you have you
can obviously choose this you can look
at the result of this and you can see
the visuals so these are some simple tax
Expressions you can create lot of data
expressions like this now this
is here you have date function so I can
choose which are the tax functions which
are existing here I can just load them
so for example this one is is one of my
other data sets and then you can play
around with the data here so this is how
you create your Dax expressions and this
is just this was just a quick demo on
going for some simple Dax Expressions
you can create different kind of visuals
and you can then save those reports you
can publish it to powerbi service and
and you can then gather insights based
on this so this is how you work with
powerbi wherein uh you can use Dax you
can use powerbi service to gather
insights you can use desktop to work on
loading your data transforming your data
in different ways and then basically
analyzing it so these days you might be
hearing a lot about PBI we do have a lot
of bi tools in the market like Excel
Tableau click view a lot but people are
talking about powerbi the most but why
so we will be knowing that in a while so
let's get started with uh building a
dashboard first and eventually in the
process you will definitely understand
it so making a dashboard in powerbi is
just like a breeze so before we get
started with powerbi I would like to
explain you a few fundamentals that you
might want to take a look at before
getting started so data cleaning is a
much needed process so you can do data
cleaning using public query or you can
just simply open your Excel and try to
check the data types for blank cells any
inappropriate datas eliminating them
right so simple basic fundamental data
cleaning process if you have some
irrelevant data in your data set just
eliminate that row or try to fill that
with the proper data that was supposed
to be there and if there are any blank
rows or blank cells eliminate those
blank rows and blank cells so that your
data is up toate and accurate and apart
from that uh let's check out some data
types for example the first one which
happens to be the r ID here so this is
the data set that we will be dealing
with today so this particular Road ID
has a general data type so it can be
either a number or a float and when you
come to the ship date over here the
order date over here right so those are
date data types and they might follow
different formatting let's say they
might follow uh date number that is day
number and for month they might add the
alphabetical name like Jan or Feb and
the year or a few others might format
with date time and uh you know we will
be having date uh and at the time which
will be describing the hours minutes and
seconds right so there are a lot of
variations where a data from date data
type can be saved so it's your
fundamental you know responsibility to
make sure that all the elements from a
specific column are of one single data
type so that the the entire data set is
inte you know it's very uh good and it
should be intact that's the whole point
of it and if you have any
inconsistencies in your data set that
might result in you know abnormal
predictions abnormal dashboards or
charts whatever you make there will not
be uh those dashboards cannot be relied
on your reports cannot be uh reliable so
that's the whole point of it so just
make sure that you go through the
fundamental very basic data cleaning
things like eliminating blank rows blank
cells maintaining a uniform data type
for all your columns you know based on
the data it's not like you have to
maintain character data type for your
dates so you need to make sure that what
kind of data type suits what kind of
data and you need to check that and make
sure that all the elements in that
particular column follow one standard
data type so I'll be going with date
data type for audit date and sh date and
ship mode will be character serial that
is row number will be serial number or
row number will be integer and uh
everything else will be C data type and
when it comes to the last four rows
sales quantity discount and profit so
those will be the uh you know float data
type and when you check out the location
here we have country north so these will
be segregated by your bi tool either
Tablo or powerbi whichever you you're
using so those will be segregating these
particular location type data types and
it will show them as map right so this
is the major thing which you need to
make sure before starting with your you
know building dashboard so that you know
having said that let's begin with the
powerbi let me start the powerbi bi tool
here it is just click on it it should
take a while so here we are we are on
the you know first page of the powerbi
so you can import the data from Excel
you can import the data from SQL Server
you can just copy paste your blank
tables so you can make use of some apis
and plugins and get connected to the
data sources from web or any other
sources and you can also import the data
from that particular source so today we
will be dealing with the Excel data set
so we will be importing the Excel file
and before that here you can see some
options which are filters data
visualizations and uh data so we haven't
loaded any data so you can see the data
over here and if you are on table they
will be available on the left side and
you will call them dimensions and
measures so you can apply the same uh
analogy here so you'll be available with
the dimensions and measures once we
import the data and here you have a wide
variety of charts and graphs that you
can just you know drag and drop and
create so once you have the data over
here you can just drag and drop onto the
canvas over here and then it will
automatically generate some type type of
a data set or chart let's say it'll give
you a tabular chart you can just click
that particular chart and come over here
over over here and you can select any
one of the charts available here let's
say you wanted the P chart you can do
that uh you can do a donut chart you can
do a dream app right so once you h on to
it it will tell the name of that
particular chart and you can select that
like it's based on your choice right so
this is about it basically now you can
also do some drill throughs that's again
for a session in another time another
day so that's a session for a different
day for now let's try to create um
dashboard in a routine way remember I'm
telling you or I'm specifying in a
routine way because we also about to
learn why powerbi is being uh so popular
currently in the bi industry right so
there are some tips and tricks that will
help you in the long term so let me
close the filters close the
visualizations close the data and now
let's click on this particular option
which says import data from Excel right
now we are in the Excel data set so this
is the file where I basically store my
Excel data sets that I'll be working on
so you can also have access to this you
can just let me know and we will drop
down the tribe Link in the description
box and you'll have the accessibility to
all these data sets so remember I spoke
about data clearing right so this Excel
data it is completely cleaned every data
column has a uniform data type and it
follows that data type throughout and if
you check out this particular original
data set which is sales European sales
over here so this is the original data
set which follows different
nomenclatures for data types for example
if I come down to the date column there
are different types of data types some
of the cells have only dates they follow
date month and year and some of these
cells have date month and year along
with the time so another clitch here so
a few of the cells were following the uh
you know 24hour timing nomenclature and
a few others were following 12 hours
this is specifically mentioning am and
p.m right so this causes a lot of
trouble when you're creating a report
trust me I've been there so what I did
is I clean the entire data set removed
the cells I mean the blank cells remove
the blank columns remove the blank cells
remove the blank rows and in any
situation if there is um you know uh
discrepancy followed in data types I've
also cleared that and I saved it as
Excel data right so we will be using
this particular data now and if you need
these data sets I can provide you with
that using the Drive Link and you can
have access you can also try your data
cleaning by following our tutorial which
is linked in the description box below
for data cleaning and you can do it and
you can start with your dashboards now
let me just extract this particular set
just click on open and you will be
having it on the screen just in a moment
so when you check out the original data
set we have a lot of sheets here right
so these were some pivot tables that we
created for data analytics using Excel
so you can also check out that video now
we will be doing the same data analytics
and creating an entire interactive
dashboard on PBI with the same data set
so you can see uh powerbi is trying to
load all the tables and all the sheets
available in that particular file but we
just need one out of those you can also
click all of those or you can just click
get one out of those so for now I just
need one out of those so here it is and
you can check the data you can have a
quick preview of how your data is
looking right and then just click on
load and the best part is powerbi will
also perform a data cleaning operation
from its end and identifies if there are
any rul or any cells that I missed out
to clean and it will notify you if there
are any errors and it will also I mean
it is also capable to you know um fix
those errors for you you can see I have
seven errors right so you can just view
errors and clear them or I can just
close so that in the background PBI will
take care of them for me now we have the
data right so here you can see the data
tab got opened and here you can have a
new drop- down if you click on that you
have all the data elements present in
the data set or in terms of T you have
dimensions and measures so basically
wherever you have a sumission or any
kind of mathematical operation present
in front of the column name that
particular element or that particular
column is considered to be the measure
so which is which is basically dealing
with the numbers and all the others
which do not have any other mathematical
symbol like equals hashtag or sumission
those are the dimensions basically the
character data type or the date data
type whichever uh the data type it is
but not numbers right so here we have it
so what you basically do is completely
similar to uh Tablo click view or any
other business intelligence tool
basically just drag and drop right now
let's say I want to find out the um
region wise sales what can I do here is
I can just drag it onto the canvas and
again I have sales over here I can drag
sales to the canvas I can just you know
H it onto the existing box you can see
this particular box right you can just
drop it inside the box so that powerbi
will understand that I'm trying to uh
you know extract the region wise sales
and it will perform the sumission of all
the sales region wise and it'll give you
a table let's say you're not satisfied
with this particular table
representation you can just hold your
table and here you can open the
visualizations and open the filters
right right and here you have
visualizations over here if you want to
segregate that in form of a py chart you
can do it right now it will give you the
sum of sales based by region now want to
calculate the U let's say audit date you
know uh date wise sales then I can also
do that you can just drag the sales over
here and select that particular table
and you know whenever you are dealing
with date data type right when you're
are dealing with dat data type then what
you do is you try to use the line cop
it's the best way to represent your
sales how they are happening right and
uh few other things let's say I want to
calculate uh the profit by city or
country which country is facing the
highest number of profits we can also do
that just drag and drop you know how it
is and okay it's giving a lot of
countries but but still it's not a big
problem for us you just Dragon drop the
sales and here you can select any one
out of these let's go with the bar graph
and here you have it right now so for so
good right so far we so good now if you
um worry about the interactivity you
don't have to basically when you're
using Excel or any other W let's say if
you're using Excel you might have to use
slices right so if you're not aware of
what am I talking about you can just go
check the data analytics of building the
dashboard using Excel where I have
completely explain the day data set and
they have you know built an interactive
dashboard there so it'll give you a
better idea about it so before that um
let's get my let's Circle back so here
uh you don't have to create a slicer and
you don't have to report the connections
between each and every chart it's
automatically done in the background for
example let's say if I wanted to
calculate the sales of central region if
I just click on the central region it
will automat Dr matically change the
display of the entire dashboard that
will give me the central region sales
right and uh if I just go back it'll you
know it'll give me the entire sales
dashboard let's say if I want to
calculate the west region I have my best
data right so that's the best part of
pobi and now we are going to identify
why this this is one good reason why
powerbi is popular but there is another
good reason why powerbi is so popular
right now so popular so easy and so
effective that even a schoolgoing kid
can build a dashboard trust me a
schoolgoing kid of grade 11 grade 12 or
a candidate who is just graduating or a
fresher or any person who doesn't have a
computer knowledge but has some good
knowledge about numbers and how
businesses work they can definitely
create an interactive dashboard using
powerbi even if they are new to powerbi
so we going to just see just that let's
create a new page or you can just go
back to the same
page okay let's create a new page now
let's say I don't know uh how to create
a chart I don't know let's say my
manager asked me to create a complete
report of the sales happening and I
don't know powerbi and I don't know
anything about how to create a chart and
how it's work right but I have certain
idea right let's say I have a certain
idea I want to find out the regionwise
sales I want to find out the
country-wise sales I want to find out
the performance of sales date on date
year on year month on month quarter on
quarter whatever it is you just want to
create you know you just want to extract
the you want to build an Insight on the
date wise sales and uh you want to find
out um you know profits based on certain
regions or certain categories right
which category is the highest performing
category which is the majorly used
shipment mode right there are Limitless
possibilities you know what to build but
you don't know how to build right in
such situations powerbi is here for the
rescue just right click on the canvas
just click anywhere right now you okay
it was not the right click it was the
double click so just double click
anywhere on the powerbi canvas and there
you can see something called ask a
question about your data let me expand
that for you you can see ask question
anything about your data now let's say I
want to create the same region wise
sales right you can just type on the
region wise sales and it's already
giving you a uh you know it's already
giving you a bar graph now let's say you
don't want the bar graph you want a p
pie chart or a donut graph right donut
chart so you can either select any one
of this I'll go with pie chart for now
so you can just select on that and here
you have your pie chart right how simple
is that how easy is that right and now
you can just place it anywhere on your
dashboard check the size alignment and
good to go let's close these filters for
now so that the canvas is a little more
better visible now let's say I want to
find out ship Moree profits and uh the
type of graph I'll go with the bar graph
there you go sales that happened using a
certain ship mode and you have the data
right here and I'm choosing the bar
graph now let's say I want to calculate
the month-on-month sales right so double
click anywhere on the canvas
sales audit date and remember we want to
represent the okay it's too intelligent
it already gave you a line graph right
just click that select that and uh just
place it anywhere on your chart you can
expand it there you go there you have it
right and now let's do let's try to find
out a few more things let's try to find
out uh which of these segments gave me a
lot of profits category wise
profits category profit and let's try to
build uh we have a pie chart so let
let's build a donut chart there you go
place it anywhere on the canvas like
whever you need it now few more things
statewise okay now let's make it a
little more
interesting State fail map you wanted a
map right so just select on that and you
will be having the map okay some problem
here so I think let's go with
country sales
map okay let's enter now let's select
this particular chart okay no
interactivity I need right now select
this and here let's select map and map
and fil map visuals are disabled to
enable them go to a file options
settings options Global Security details
okay let's try this file options and
settings options global global security
use map and fi map visual
I think they should fix this okay let's
refresh this should help us there you go
you have your map let's place it
anywhere in r in the dashboard now we
have the region wise sales or
country-wise sales and shipment mode
subcategory and uh let me know what else
we can build let's have the kpis here
now let's go to the sales just drag and
drop the sales sign anywhere on the
table and I want the data presented in
visuals I have the card now let's have
profits and that should be a card again
and let's have U quantity that should be
a card again that's our kpi profit sales
quantity discount is another one where
which you can add and just add number
card again there you go you can go to
the insert option insert text box and
there you can just write down sales
dashboard align the text to Center and
that should be good there you go so far
so good and in case if you wanted to add
a few more visual athetics to your
dashboard you can also do that you can
just click down yeah I think you
remember your PowerPoint right just go
to view and you can select any of the
backgrounds you want and there you go
you have it if you're not happy with
this you can also have some images in
the background you can add some images
which will make it look a little more
interactive right so that's how you
build an amazing interactive dashboard
in powerbi and uh that's the reason why
uh the Simplicity why powerbi is being
so popular amongst the all other
remaining bi tools and now let's get
started with the customer analytics
dashboard using powerbi so we will be
using the Amazon sales statuses from
2023 and 2024 for this particular
dashboard using powerp so let's quickly
switch between the PowerPoint
presentation and the D set that we are
going to use today so this particular
data set is available on kagle and it is
actually the data set between 2020 and
2021 so we carried out a little bit of
data cleaning process and we enhanced
the data set like removing the blank
spaces removing the blank cells and the
blank rows basically so and after that
changing the data type of dates so you
might be wondering there might be a few
discrepancies in the way the data is
formatted because there are many ways
for example if I just select this column
and go back to data type and if I go to
the available dates there are many
formats so you can see year month and
date date month and year and there is an
alphabetical representation of month
right so there are many variations where
you can represent the date so we are
going to use one single form format for
the entire data set so that it can be
easier for us to identify the week on
week month on month quarter on quarter
and yearly uh analysis so that's the
whole point of it first point just try
to eliminate any kind of blank cells
rows or columns in your data set so that
the accuracy of the data that you are
using to perform analysis is intact and
good right so apart from that just check
if you want to eliminate any of the
decimal points just select this and here
you can see the option to elim Leading
decimal numbers right you can use this
option over here so there are about 2
lh86 393 rows in this particular data
set so it might take a little while to
uh reflect my actions on this particular
data set and apart from that if you
could just hover over through this
particular data set you have a lot of
things to deal with you have regions you
have username discount percentage and uh
you have
first name last name of the user
quantity order price value so why are we
basically going through this particular
data set is is when you understand it is
when you can quantify what's happening
with the D set that's when you can plan
out what kind of analysis you want to
perform right let's say you did not get
any kind of prerequisites from your
manager you just have the DS head and
you need to perform the exact uh you
know analysis which could benefit your
organization so they also want some
insight so that they can make out some
decisions out of it right some business
decisions so in that situation you just
have to go through the DAT at once and
do the data cleaning process and then
understand what exactly has been
mentioned in this particular data set
and what kind of uh insights you can
extract out of this data set and you can
proceed with that so basically we have
quantity order price value and uh total
apart from that you have category you
have uh different payment methods you
have uh the year you have the dates and
uh so when you have dates you can also
create some trend lines out of it and
apart from that um let's say you have
zip codes region right so you can find
out region byse sales and a few more
things what you can basically do out of
it right so having the data set
understood let's go back to powerbi so
this is our powerbi platform so
basically you just select this
particular Excel work option and import
it data I've done it basically here you
have it so we have the age category City
Country everything presented over here
now let's quickly create
the visualizations using this particular
so I would firstly go with u a bar graph
okay let me choose this uh bar graph
right over here and uh let me
create gender Dev sales let's let's have
this
[Music]
here so we should be having something
called as a price or a sale so we have
price over here you can quickly draw and
drag this and drop it on the
xaxis okay we y axis and uh gender on
the
x-axis so we don't want this filter over
here you can eliminate
this so now you have um gender wise
sales right now next let's use a pie
chart now you can find out the region
why sales quickly add the region
into the
legends
here you have the region by sales so you
have Midwest Northeast South and
southwest regions so these are the sales
uh line graft which can help us to to
okay so just click on the canvas and
then double click for your drop the
sheet now let's use the audit
date and drop it onto
xaxis and
um rise on to Y
axis now if you could uh use the drop
down and use the date hierarchies you
can use the year on year month on month
so let's go with month on Mon quarter
okay let's go with quarter on quarter
now you can see how are the sales
running quarter on quarter in the for
this particular data set so we have two
years that is 2020 and and me yeah 2023
and 2024 the quarter on quarter
comparison for year on-ear sales figures
right now let's click on the canvas once
again and now you can choose the over
here and uh so since we
have two genders and I think we also
have a column for age it should be
somewhere in the
list so basically you can derive what
age groups have made the maximum number
of sales
right yeah so here we have
it and the sales so basically it'll
create a bucket right uh age group from
18 age group from 19 20 21 and so on now
just go through the orders or you can go
with the price so just drag and drop it
in values and you have it here and you
created a donor chart of it and uh let's
try to create a field map now uh you can
understand which uh area or which region
was the highest uh sales uh we received
so just go through the data set over
here so we have the country just drag
and drop the country
and then have the price or orders you
can use anything okay let's go with the
orders quantity
order and add it in the
values so here we have it so if you
could expand you can find out which
region was the one which giv us highest
number of
orders and there is another simple way
to do it as well if you just double
click on the
[Music]
canvas it will give you a prompt where
you can write
map country
wise map okay map state so we have a
state uh column here sales or
price and uh it will automatically
understand your query and create a
map which will show you the highest
number of sales from the regions or the
region or statewise sales brilliant now
if we proceed into the final chart okay
we have a waterfall chart so now you can
create a waterfall chart so you just
name it
waterfall so we have U category
some yeah forall category wise just
enter price or sale and we have a
waterfall chart over here based on the
categories you can just drag or you can
know expand the canvas to have a clear
picture and uh yeah so far we have dealt
with okay we have a scatter plot we can
do a scatter
plot scatter plot for quantity of orders
received against discount
offered so we should be having quantity
ordered
ut5 against
discounts or I think we can go with
order rties so it'll give us a unique uh
representation there has been a small
discrepancy order ID or you can also go
with customer Ting
against discount
offer so we have a huge data set 2 lak
plus so might take a little while to
respond to the requests that's
completely all right now what left out
is the kpi so you can also create some
kpis so just double tap and uh write a
kpi for total sales write a
kpi toal
orders
29,000
API for total
discount kpi for Discount
percentage or we can use kpi for gender
which can tell us how many number of
females or how many number of males did
create an order then we will be having a
number
here Order
writing if you could just close these
visualizations over here we can expand
the canvas and you can also Al have okay
we can also minimize this particular
area and we can also
have another
chat or bar bar
graph for types of payments payment
types payment method right so we will be
generating a bar graph with highest
number of payment methods used that is
cash on delivery online payment
Etc so it will take a little time to
reflect on this particular screen that's
all right now if you can just go to view
and here you will be having various
options for representing your data set
just click on the best way to represent
your data set there you go so basically
that's how you create okay let's try to
rearrange our charts a little bit so
that the kpis and kras are clearly
visible
there you go so that's how you create a
customer analytics dashboard using
powerbi powerbi makes data visually
appealing it has easy drag and drop
functionality with features that allow
you to copy all formatting across
similar
visualizations powerbi fetches data from
Factory sensors and social media sources
to get access to realtime
analytics let's see what Tableau really
is tblo is a powerful business
intelligence tool which manages the data
flow and turns data into actionable
information it can create a wide range
of different visualization to
interactively present the data and
showcase insights tblo has the feature
of drag and drop which allows its users
to create interactive visuals quickly it
can also build interactive dashboards
with just a few
clicks so powerbi was originally
designed by Ron George in the summer of
2010 and the initial release was a
available for public download on 11th of
July
2011 the key components of powerbi are
powerbi Desktop powerbi Service powerbi
mobile apps powerbi Gateway and powerbi
Report
server tblo software was founded in 2003
in Mountain View California and the tblo
desktop 1.0 was released in 2004 on 1st
of August 2019 Salesforce acquired tblo
tblo products include tblo desktop tblo
server tblo on online Tableau visible
Tableau public and Tableau
reader now let's see how expensive these
tools
are powerbi is way less expensive than
tblo software powerbi professional
version costs less than $10 per month
per user the yearly subscription comes
around $100 powerbi premium is licensed
with dedicated Cloud compute and storage
resources and is priced at
$4,995 per
month on the on the other hand tblo is
more expensive where the pro version of
tblo comes at more than $35 per month
per
user the yearly subscription costs
around $1,000 tblo Creator costs around
$70 per month while tblo viewer is
priced at $12 per month if you are a
startup or a small business you can opt
for powerbi and then upgrade to tblo if
the need
arises now coming to
Performance powerbi is easy to use it is
faster and performs better when the
volume of data is limited powerbi tends
to drag slow when handling pul
data but tblue can handle large volumes
of data easily it is faster and provides
extensive features for visualizing the
data tblo doesn't limit the number of
data points in a visualization or
enforce row or size limitations so you
can have a complete view of your data
tablo's wide range of built-in analytic
capabilities allows you to spend less
time worrying about manually creating
calculations designing visualizations
and formatting
dashboards now let's discuss the user
interface of these tools the user
interface of powerbi is highly intuitive
and it can easily be integrated with
other Microsoft products powerbi
interface is easy to learn and
understand it is user friendly and
allows you to operate better powerbi
desktop provides three views which you
can select on the left side of the
canvas the first view is of the report
View
where you can create reports and visuals
the next is the data view in this view
you can see the tables measures and
other data used in the data model
associated with your report and
transform the data for best use in the
reports model and third is the model
view in this view you can see and manage
the relationships among data in your
data
model tblo has an intelligent interface
that enables you to create an custom
czee the dashboards according to your
requirements
easily it has an inviting workspace area
that encourages you to experiment with
data and get smart results the workspace
area has different cards and selves
toolbar sidebar data source page status
bar and Sheet
tabs with that let us now talk about the
different data sources that powerbi and
tblo can connect
with another important feature of
powerbi is that it supports we ious data
sources but has limited access to other
databases and servers compared to
Tableau some of the examples are
Microsoft Excel text or CSV files
folders Microsoft SQL Server access DB
Oracle database IBM db2 mySQL database
postre SQL database
Etc tblo software has access to numerous
data sources and servers such as Excel
text file PDF Json statistical file and
Amazon red sift cloud data Hadoop Google
analytics Dropbox Google seats Google
Drive and lots
more now let's talk about the ease of
use powerbi enjoys a slight Edge in
terms of ease of use because it is based
on a user interface that has its roots
in Microsoft Office
365 which most end users are already
