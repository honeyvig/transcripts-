hi - okay now we are going to discuss a
plan for the next 30 days and before
going into the plan I'm just going to
give a brief idea of what we are going
to do okay so from now as already
discussed every 21st will take new
things and every twentieth will have
exam not normal exam grand exam okay so
every one month we are going to deal
with few things for example from January
22 Feb 28th so we're going to deal some
some things okay something okay okay
this is what our plan for the upcoming
few days and now coming to the two
things okay one is offline and one is
all like okay
offline will include both offline plus
online online will condense only alright
okay so in online you have your regular
regular whatsapp discussions your video
classes okay
apart from this you'll have your smart
notes okay you'll have textbook reading
from one one side
and apart from the textbook reading you
have your PP books on other side and
apart from all of this you have your
regular I'm sick your books reading okay
so this is common for all the students
but this is exclusively for MDS conquer
strains everyone do this so we'll also
do this so there's some basic mcq books
that every individual who prepared for
the enters they do this so we do this
regularly so apart from the regular
preparation you will have this
preparation you'll have textbook reading
which is really required you'll have PP
books you'll have smart notices that are
being exchanged in the group and you'll
have video classes you know how the
audio classes you'll have what sub
discussions you'll have some PDFs that
are being shared on the group and
everything so apart from all this you'll
have your exams okay you'll have your
exams that is one is topic specific
exams one topic specific means if it is
an important topic for the examination
for example implants is a very important
topic for the examinations AIDS related
diseases or the course of AIDS from all
the subjects is very important so you
have a topic specific finish lines is an
important topic enough PD you'll have an
exam on that major constructors minor
characters are important topic in our PD
you'll have an exam of its numericals in
dental materials are important you'll
have an exam of this so in how topic
specific exams that can be a daily exam
daily you'll have some topic okay
reading of some topic and further topic
specific you will have some examination
on the side okay so once you are done
with the topic specific there's
something new that we are adding that is
topic specific diagram based exam so the
few things that really required for
example implants you should have a topic
specific diagram based because you have
you there being asking questions new
questions from the implants area
and that to diagram based questions and
most of the uses and most of the thing
most of the
a basic mcq books are not at all
covering any of these aspects so it's
mandatory that we need to go with some
topic specific diagram based exams also
next one is will how subject specific
subject specific exams okay that minimum
five to ten exams for each subject
subject specific means covering all the
subject once you are done with a
particular subject you'll have a subject
specific examination okay so next again
subject specific diagram based exams and
now because of the lengthy lengthy nurse
in the meet 2020 paper I have decided
from my side to have diagnosis a new
thing okay means questions only based
upon diagnosis of a disease or questions
only based upon the diagnosis followed
by the treatment none of it Isis so our
our goal our goal from our side is to
cover almost all diseases solidly from
the textbook and according to the
blueprint and according to the need
syllabus okay so we'll have diagnosis
and treatment plan questions and you'll
have multi-level questions
multi-level means easy questions because
2018 question paper is easy new
questions 2019 question paper one
compared to 2018 is more of new
questions with repeats and lend the
questions that is 2020 is all of lengthy
questions mostly related to your
diagnosis and treatment plans so we'll
have all levels of game here okay not
only sticking to the simple level all
levels okay so that is how the pattern
of examination for the upcoming change
in the pattern of examination from
upcoming few days and next one who D
just you who teaches you in the offline
in the online so all and for every
subject
we have picked three to four mentors out
of which two mentors will teach and two
mentors out of which one mentor will be
taking specific exams and one mentor
will be dealing with the grand exams so
ideology behind this is when you have
more mentors and for the offline you'll
have two mentors for each subject and
these four mentors are not included in
these two matters so if you're a student
of offline you're being exposed to the
mindset of six mentors for every subject
and if you're offering to and you're
being exposed to mindset of three to
four mentors for every subject means the
ideology of a question pepper the papper
setter will be different okay one
question or one subject questioning is
different from other subject ideology
will be different how they will be
different so when you are exposed to
multiple mentors who are really capable
of who are filtered mentors like most of
the MDS conquer mentor MDS conquer
students okay who has this ability of
multi-level orientation or
multi-directional preparation
okay so such people they have a quality
of giving the best questions okay apart
from giving new questions they also
maintain your confidence levels that is
more important so when are being exposed
to five to six minutes for every subject
and imagine that how many it's going to
be for 20-odd subjects so there are more
than 100 plus mentors here who work day
and night online as well as offline to
make your preparation more looser so
these are the people who are going to
give and for offline you'll have more
fun funny funky and more of motivation
okay involvement in the preparation
taking the responsibilities XY chat are
the qualities of MDS conquer team okay
so I hope you are cleared that who
teaches you from now okay the next one
what I am going to discuss right now is
about our schedule okay so about our
schedule so first goes I think this is
already posted on the group but anyway
I'm taking one more step to discuss what
you have to do so it's the upcoming few
days we're going to cover subjects like
one oral medicine which is going to
cover seven marks according to the need
to open it and the blueprint of PGA and
need it where aims it varies
okay the next subject is oral path which
includes oral microbiology also where
majority of us we neglect this of course
our basic mcg books has already
neglected that so oral microbiology
which includes bacterial diseases viral
diseases fungal diseases means you have
to read them at the depth they're very
important for examination point of view
okay
the next is few areas of general
medicine and physiology will discuss
waters those areas not complete
gentlemen's and physiology few areas of
general medicine and physiology which
are really required in combination with
Ray okay let's this is going to be
fourteen marks and let's make it as this
is actually 14 plus 14 28 according to
the need blueprint but we are going to
cover maximum of five marks now not
completely a maximum of 5 marks which
are which we are going to do so total in
this month we are going to cover 14 plus
5 that is 19 plus 7 26 marks ok 26 marks
is somewhere around 10% tears of sellers
so we are going to cover 10 percentage
of the syllabus in the upcoming one
month okay so next goes is
next course is the plan of action so
books to be books that you need to carry
is the basic mcq books like dental pulse
dentist okay
apart from this you how many other books
but preferably these two okay next one
is you need to carry out power play
books which are mandatory for the
preparation highly recommended
particularly for subjects like oral
pattern oral medicine okay and you'll
have textbook reading and everything
they go simultaneously preferably you
just take you just keep a textbook for
reference
preferably I think most of us we have
taken Shaffers for a little path so keep
that as a reference and I don't know
what you have done for oral medicine but
make sure whatever you have done please
do take that book only a few people they
have done for Gomes few people they have
done for bucket so make sure whatever
book that you have done for oral
medicine please do keep that as
reference okay I hope that is clear the
next course is about the plan okay so I
have shared this on the group that's
nothing new in this but now I am going
to help you in elaborating the things
once again okay so 21st Jan we are going
to cover developmental disturbances of
oral and parallel structures
developmental disturbances so in the
developmental disturbances the main
concern that should be given is diagrams
okay one is diagrams the second one is
the basic description of each
developmental disturbance for example if
it is a neuron sure what does it mean
dye laceration what does it mean fusion
what does it mean germination or does it
mean one there
the important thing that you have to
make a note whatever it may be all oral
/ our developmental disturbances you
need to know the meaning for the term
second one apart from knowing the
meaning you need to know the diagram
also okay what is miss Odense what is
parents okay so you need to know you
need to know the meaning and you need to
know the diagram the second point is
diagram is mandatory preferably the
first diagram that is that is coming in
the Google can be a good good option or
else you can go with the textbook based
diagram to understand the diagram also
cleverly understand the diagram the
third important point that you need to
make a note in their developmental
disturbances of oral and per hour and
structures where does it is most common
for example it is a neuron sure which
teeth is most common supernumerary teeth
where it is more most common die
laceration is most common at which teeth
are most common at which position even
para oral structures disturbance is also
most common at which place so these are
the three basic important points that
most of your questions will move around
and rest all will be discussed on the
group and on your examination platform
or on in the basic chemistry books okay
so we go with this chapter for two days
Jan 1st and 21st coming to 23rd task the
23rd task is all about the tumors so
benign and malignant tumors of the oral
cavity please do list out all the benign
and malignant tumors and make sure go
very deep into the things which are most
common for example a most common tumor
is the most common question in your
final layer during your examinations for
example ameloblasts trauma is most
commonly asked coming to talking about
the cysts ok AC is most commonly asked
dentists iris is most commonly asked a
radical assist is most commonly as
coming to the unimportant cysts
nasopalatine cyst is most commonly asked
so it is mandatory that you have to go
through this for example benign and
malignant tumors swamis cell carcinoma
is most commonly asked basal cell
carcinoma is most commonly asked and of
course these are the two things which
are most common so whatever are most
common in the population they are most
common
so such things you need to go very deep
very deep if it is possible if you have
a textbook and if you feel like you have
time textbook reading is very good for
such things why I'm stressing is you're
already being done the same in the final
year or after one year one year it made
one year cap if you're already done with
internship we have done this so that's
the reason why I'm asking you to keep
your book whatever you have done as a
reference so that it will be easy for
you to see the things I hope you have
already underlined few things you can
focus on few things you can you can have
a quick recap so this is all common for
all the things 23rd we are going to
discuss about the benign and malignant
tumors of the oral cavity okay and 24th
we are going to talk about the tumors of
salivary glands most common again most
common malignant tumor most common
benign tumor are the most commonly asked
questions okay so next is next you can
go with the 25th task 25th Rask is the
cysts of cysts and tumors of odontogenic
origin again most comments are most
important next course is the 26th I have
kept for the revision so that's the
Sunday we have a revision so you can
plan accordingly
if you have any backlogs you can finish
them if not you can do the practice
papers on that particular day the
practice exams
exam specific diagram specific things
you can take on 26 so coming to the 27th
is all about oral microbiology 27th 28th
and 29th one day you can cover bacterial
infections viral infections and fungal
infections so if you see the way it is
viral and bacterial infections will be
more in number they may take more time
when compared to the fungal infections
so plan in such a way that these three
days you are going to cover oral
microbiology at your best
so next comes is xxx xxx we are going to
deal dental care is very easy to of it
for most of us again the most common
disease and this is the soft pulp and
periapical okay and 31st chant we're
going to cover spread of oral infections
likelihood weeks and you know cavernous
sinus thrombosis all these are very very
important in that physical chemical
injuries of oral cavity
they're aggressive alterations of the
teeth and heaving above the wound all
these are very very simple small topics
way to cover and what to cover I'm going
to discuss on our group in specific
before you take the topic on that
particular day okay the reason is
already discussed Chuck I don't want I
don't want everyone getting benefited
rather than my first reference is my
students okay so we'll discuss that in
person next comes is the first first
fitb we need to work from all directions
all directions in all the ways that is
possible that is the whorl aspects of
the metabolic diseases and allergic and
immuno genic diseases of oral cavity in
this the oral aspects of the metabolic
diseases is a very very important topic
that most of us and most of the men
tested neglect you need to be more
focused and coming to the second flip
okay all your offline classes as well as
online classes and both the centers were
suspended because 29 we are taking the
success mate so most of your seniors who
are part of MDS conquer last year and
who bang great things are going to come
so we are going to have some fun we are
going to have big party and we are going
to have get great interaction with them
so it's a great opportunity that if you
plan to come over to the success meet
i'm going to post the official
invitation on the group inviting you in
person but now i am just
letting you rebelling you the out that
success mate will be on 2nd February
updates will be posted on the group it's
you're most welcome because its success
mate is basically for you so that if you
can talk with the seniors their ideas
what they have done what extra that you
have to do you can see the crowd from
all the colleges like a conference ok
gatherings you'll have fun you'll have
games will have party will have will
have everything whatnot
ok so that's that's that's the hard work
that's a that's that's the party of all
hard well that boy what we have done in
2019 so we are suspending the classes
and everything on 5th 2nd and coming we
will regather ourselves on 3rd February
back to the preparation with all the
energy levels from the success meet so
[Music]
we're going to talk about the diseases
of bone and joints for two days that is
fourth and fifth in which I am going to
cover few medicine aspects also fifth
sip is exclusively the physiology part
of blood and sixth and seventh we are
going to cover both oral medicine oral
pathology and general path and general
medicine parts of the blood they're very
easy if you study in comp oh okay so you
have three days for the Bloods to play
with the blood at your best so again I
have given eight also a blood that is
leukemias and other aspects so I have
given four days for blood so four days I
think it's sufficient enough to have the
best so tenth
we have planned for the diseases of skin
again I have given two days 10th and
11th but one day is sufficient so it's
it is how you you plan because if you
are taking blood here blood also don't
require fighters sorry for days you can
you can manage in three days where you
can say one day here you can say one day
similarly you have many revision days in
the middle so it's all about how you say
other things
ok the length then the next course is 12
and 13th you will have CNS physiology I
think CNS physiology is again one day or
one and half day where you can say hard
day the next course is the 14th and 15th
general medicine oral medicine oral
pathology aspects of now diseases again
two days are sufficient one and half day
is sufficient you will have half more
coming to the 16th
you'll have your revision then where you
can complete your backlogs 17th these
are extra things red and white lesions
are already covered in the in the
diseases of skin but I cannot have given
some more time because I have seen good
number of questions from these areas
where you need to spend more time and 18
February and you topic no need to read
anywhere you can just follow the group
that is periodic oral medicine or here
at recorder medicine so both both
aspects of oral medicine of old days as
well as the ancient and will be covered
in that particular day so 19th February
our plan is to cover the image based
questions image based things and
specimens because we are dealing with
almost all the specimens of oral path
now it is they are giving questions on
specimens and histological slides to and
xx is going to be your grand exam ok xx
is going to be you were
Grande excellent so for 240 marks so you
know 120 each subject that is oral path
and oral medicine in oral medicine
you'll have 20 marks on general medicine
five marks on general path I mean I'm
giving in specific blueprint but no need
and you'll have 20 marks on physiology
you'll have minimum 40 plus diagram
based questions okay so this is a rough
plan for the upcoming one month of time
okay I hope we are very clear about this
in specific things will be discussed on
the group once we take the topics okay I
don't want to post this on youtube I
don't want to discuss our plan of action
everything on YouTube so tanking of site
