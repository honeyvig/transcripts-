hi traders welcome back to zen and the
art of trading this is matt and today i
have a very important video lesson for
you guys especially you newer traders
and that is of course risk management
you either love it if you're a
successful trader or you hate it if
you're unsuccessful and there's a
correlation there to keep that in mind
if you're not interested in learning the
fundamentals behind risk management
winrate then you'll never make it as a
trader you are doomed to failure but if
you bear with me throughout this video
I'll explain the concepts behind
successful trading consistently
successful trading and once you learn
this stuff and it becomes second nature
your trading will improve massively and
the risk of you blowing up will
dramatically decrease there's a large
misconception in particular in the forex
trading community especially among new
traders that your win rate is the most
important factor that determines your
success as a trader that couldn't be
further from the truth
what does really matter is this guy down
here your risk reward ratio now what
this means is how much money do you make
on average versus how much money do you
lose when you're wrong on average this
guy is far more important than this guy
but the two go hand-in-hand and I'm
gonna explain that in this video so
let's think about win rate for a moment
ego aside and your feelings of being
really cool aside what role does win
rate play in your trading
well let's approach this from a risk
management perspective rather than a
profit making perspective your win rate
needs to be equal to or higher than the
minimum win rate for you to break even
first of all today's video I'm gonna be
talking about percentages percentage
return versus percentage risk
rather than dollar return versus dollar
risk there's a very important reason for
that if you master these concepts in
relation to percentages then you can
scale up indefinitely these concepts
apply to a thousand dollar trading
account the same way as it does to a
hundred thousand dollar trading account
if I were to talk in dollar terms that
wouldn't be the case and it's best that
you develop the habit of thinking of
everything in trading in percentage
terms because that way you can scale you
can scale up your account you can
increase your account balance without
having to change anything about your
trading strategy or trading plan now if
you're trading hundreds of thousands of
dollars obviously it's gonna be a little
bit different but going from a thousand
dollar account to a ten thousand dollar
account should be seamless
once you master these concepts now in
regards to win rate what is the ideal
win rate well let's think about it for a
second your win rate needs to be high
enough that it makes up for your losses
it's as simple as that
it doesn't matter what that number is as
long as it makes up for your average
losses and then what do I mean by that
well let's say you're risking one
percent of your account in order to make
one percent you need to win fifty
percent of the time that let me draw
this out so you're risking 1%
you're gonna lose 1% when you're wrong
and you're going to make one percent
when you're right on your trades this is
very simple to understand that's why I'm
using these numbers but I'll go into
more complex numbers in a minute but
basically if you have this risk reward
profile in your strategy and you take a
hundred trades you need to win at least
50% of those trades in order to not lose
any money or in other words to
break-even anything above 50% means
you're making money with this risk
reward profile therefore for a one to
one risk reward ratio your minimum win
rate needs to be 50% or higher and it's
that simple it's the same for long
trades as it is for short trades and
what happens if these numbers change
what happens if
making you're taking trades with the
two-to-one risk reward ratio in this
scenario when you're wrong you lose 1%
of your account just like in the
previous example but when you're right
you make double your money but what does
your win rate need to be in order to
break even that's all that matters
doesn't matter how high it is what
matters is that it's not lower then it
needs to be in order to not lose money I
know it's a bit difficult to wrap your
head around but I'm hoping these visual
examples will help you so I've written
an article about this I'll leave a link
in the video description
but the article on my blog goes into
great detail about the mathematics
behind this concept so if you want to
see a text version of this lesson you
can go there and check that out
but I'm gonna give you the formula right
now for determining your minimum win
rate in order to not lose money anything
above this minimum win rate means you're
making money that's all that matters
doesn't matter if you've got a 80% win
rate 70% win rate you know if you've got
a negative risk reward ratio on average
then a high winrate can still lose you
money so that's why win rate isn't that
important compared to risk reward risk
reward is far more important than win
rate obviously the two go hand-in-hand
but the metric you need to be focused on
is what do you what is your risk reward
profile in relation to your win rate so
this is the mathematical formula the
algebraic formula if you want to get
fancy for calculating your minimum win
rate or win percentage basically I'll
just break this down and then we'll plug
this into a calculator and we'll
determine what our minimum win rate
needs to be for a two-to-one risk reward
ratio so what this means is you divide
your risk in this case 1 divided by your
risk plus your reward in this case that
would be 3 2 plus 1 is 3 and then you
times it by a hundred in order to
convert that into a percentage so let's
bring up the calculator and plug these
numbers in so here's our good friend the
inbuilt Microsoft calculator does a lot
of the heavy lifting for me in my
trading and let's plug in these numbers
so
got one / and I don't have brackets here
so we have to switch to this scientific
calculator but don't worry we're not
going to be using any of this stuff just
these two little guys here so we're
gonna have one divided by open bracket 1
plus 2 close bracket equals 0.33 0.33
recurring we times this by a hundred and
we get 33 0.33 recurring percent so in
order to not lose any money with a one
to two risk reward ratio we only need to
win a third of our trades if you can
consistently hit these numbers above a
33% win rate you're gonna be making
money if you really grasp this concept
it should excite you it should make you
excited because what it means is it
relieves a lot of the pressure on you to
be right all the time so let's say that
you're a swing trader or a trend
follower and your average winner is even
more than two to one or let's say that
you optimize this strategy find out that
you can have a tighter stop-loss and
still win a lot of trades how does that
affect your minimum win rate so in this
example let's go to a 2% risk let's say
we're we're extra confident in the
strategy and we're going to risk 2% of
our count on each trade so now we have a
1 2 3 risk reward meaning that we win 3
times our money when we write then we
lose when went wrong how does that
change our minimum win rate well let's
bring up the calculator again and
there's plug this formula in so we've
got 2 percent of risk divided by 2 plus
6 in this case because two four six
three times our risk is 6% close that
off times this by a hundred and suddenly
we only need to win a quarter of our
trades we only need to win 25% of the
time in order to not lose money anything
above a 25% win rate means you
gonna be making money in the long run
over a large sample size of trades how
powerful is that how exciting is that
my cat could probably hit these numbers
by accident if he knew how to use a
computer this is not rocket science by
any stretch of the imagination this
means you could lose seven trades out of
ten still make money on the final three
let's let's plug that in to show you
that that's the case you got - two - two
- two - two - two - two - two
so we've just lost seven trades in a row
and we're down 14% but in the final
three trades let's see how this pans out
we win one we win another one and then
we win one more you up 4% out of that
example a 4% profit out of only three
winning trades in ten total trades so I
think that's enough examples to get my
point across with this simple
mathematics again if you want to learn
more about this you can go to the video
description and read my article on this
concept it goes into a lot more detail
and shows us a bunch more examples and a
few more mathematical equations because
over how to calculate your current wind
percentage based on your trading results
it also tells you how to calculate your
expectancy over a large sample size of
trades by combining your average win and
your average loss with your current win
rate and with this information you can
calculate what I like to call your
danger zone so your danger zone is the
wind percentage you need to stay above
in order to not lose money so at the
time that I wrote the article my average
loss was 1.0 3% and my average gain was
one point four five percent because this
is alive this is a real-life example of
using this information to calculate what
I needed to win above in order to not
lose money so I was losing 1.0 3% on my
average loss and I was winning one point
four five percent on my average gain
what that gave me was
danger zone of 41.5% what this means is
that I had to win at least 41.5% of my
trades in order to not lose money
anything above that meant that I was
making money so that's one that's how
you reverse engineer what your win rate
needs to be you shouldn't start with
your win rate you should start with your
average risk reward and then backwards
engineer what your win rate needs to be
in order to stay safe as a trader not
blow up and start making money now just
a few final thoughts on this if you're
seeing these numbers and you're thinking
1% 2% who's risking 1% of their account
that's way too small then you don't have
the right attitude as a trader your
mindset is in the wrong place long-term
consistent trading is all about keeping
your losses small and allowing your
winners to make up for your losses and
then compounding your profit over the
long term if you're just shooting for
massive gains you're treating the market
like a casino you're gambling and that's
okay that's fine you can do that just be
aware that that's what you're doing
let's say you're risking 10 percent your
position size equates to 10 percent of
your total trading capital on each trade
you take you can only lose 10 trades
before you're out of the game before you
hit that do not pass go do not collect
$200 do not play anymore you're out of
the game you're off the board go do
something else with your time that's
free because you don't have any money
left no one wants to be in that
situation if you value your money in
your time at all this is not a position
you want to be in losing 10 trades in a
row in some cases is not that
unreasonable to expect that happens
quite frequently in fact even with a
high winrate strategy even if you're
winning 50 or 60 percent of the time you
can still lose 10 trades in a row
depending on how the market conditions
unfold at any particular time but now
let's say that you're only risking 1% of
your account per trade suddenly you can
lose a hundred trades before you blow
your account that's a much safer
position to be in if I was giving
someone my money to manage I would much
rather this number then
the 10 and obviously 2% portrayed you
need to lose 50 trades in a room to blow
your account now the odds of losing 50
trades or a hundred trades in a row
compared to 10 trades is very different
if you're losing 100 trades in a row
that you'll notice it long before you
hit that hundreds of trade you'll get to
about a 30% drawdown and you'll note
you'll think this isn't working and
you'll stop and then you'll reassess
what you're doing you'll optimize your
strategy and you'll survive over the
long term you're risking 10% of your
account you'll hit a 30% drawdown in 3
losing trades which is extremely common
in trading so I'll leave it at that I
hope that that made sense to you hope
you could understand these concepts if
not go and read the article that I
linked in the description and basically
the gist of the article the conclusion
of the article is basically that your
win rate should be whatever you're
comfortable with if you're comfortable
losing 50% of your trades even 60% 70%
of your trades if you're comfortable
doing that and still making money then
you can tailor a strategy that will
achieve that if you're not comfortable
with losing 60 70 percent of your trades
then maybe you have to adjust your
strategy to win more often which may
mean that you need to reduce your
average reward because the the more
profit you shoot for the less likely you
are to hit it so some strategies perform
really well with a 1 to 1 risk reward
and a 50 60 70 percent win rate other
strategies can't survive a 1 to 1 risk
reward because they don't win often
enough so your win rate is really a
matter of preference in relation to your
risk reward you should decide on what
risk reward profile you're most
comfortable with before you even
consider your win rate if you decide you
want a 60% win rate that's meaningless
in and of itself because if you're only
winning half a percent for every 1% of
risk you're gonna lose money even though
you're winning 60 70 percent of the time
if you're cutting your profits short
just so that you have a high winrate
that's dangerous and could lead to you
blowing an account on the other hand if
you're shooting for 3-4 to 1 risk reward
you may enjoy extremely long losing
streaks and nasty draw downs but you
might
out ahead over the long term over a
hundred or thousand trades you might
make money you might make more money in
fact than someone with a sixty or
seventy percent win rate it all comes
down to this guy here your risk to
reward I hope that that sinks in I hope
you understand that I hope that this
video helps you with your trading I hope
that it inspires you and encourages you
to go out and create strategies with a
bit of creativity understand that the
most important thing isn't being right
in trading the most important thing is
capping your downside when you're wrong
that's the most important thing the
longer you stay in this game the higher
your chances of being successful and
making money so manage your risk be
conservative especially if you're a
beginner and you can increase your risk
per position as you get more confident
in your strategy and you start to crunch
the numbers and you can see that your
strategy can handle that increased risk
without imploding best of luck with your
trading I'll see you in the next video
take care
