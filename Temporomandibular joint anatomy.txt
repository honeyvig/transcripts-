hi everyone so next important topic from
your Anatomy is a temporal mandibular
joint which is very important for your
basics paper
okay so let's discuss myself doctors IT
team MDS conquer so any essay question
so we usually TMJ is given as an essay
so if it's an essay question then you
have write the contents so either you
can write the contents first and then
you can write the answer or else you can
leave some space right the descriptive
part of the answer and then write the
contents okay so based on your length of
your answer you can write the contents
so it exactly actually attracts the
examiner if the contents are very clear
okay so vice-versa you can do this way
or that way it's up to you okay so these
are those contents that you need to put
in in on your paper so that includes the
introduction the development the
innovation and the blood supply the
components of the joint and components
of the muscle the jaw movements
examination in various imaging
modalities disorders followed by the
conclusion and the references so these
contents you have to put in for sure
so introduction you can give it's a very
important joint for the movement of the
jaws okay so it is the joint is where
the bones get connected to each other
and it is constructed to allow the
movement as well as to provide the
mechanical support okay so next coming
to the important introduction for the
temporal mandibular joint so it is
actually called as a England at throttle
joint
why so because it provides a hinging
movement in one plane that's the reason
it's called as ganglia Moyne and at the
same time it also provides a gliding
movement so which classifies it as a at
throttle joint so that's the reason it
is called as a king Lima at throttle
joint okay so you have to write this for
sure and you have to underline that so
coming to the development so meckel's
catalyst the catalyst of the first arch
if I actually functions as a primary
joint jaw joint okay later the Incas and
the malice of the middle ear are derived
from the dorsal and the ventral part of
this cartilage which is surrounded by
the developing mandible so the formation
actually
in the 12 weeks in the utero where the
join spaces and the articular disk
actually start to develop and at
approximately 10 weeks the fetus future
component of the joint becomes evident
in the Maison Kaymer between the candela
cartilage of the mandible as well as a
developing temporal bone so this is how
you have to ride the development related
to TMJ okay so the first evidence is
actually it is divided or it is given as
a two distinct regions or which is
related to the mesenchymal concerns
condensation that includes a temporal
and the condylar blastoma so little
introduction of the development is
enough next we have to write the blood
supply of that so all the Bloods
arteries which supply the TMJ include
these arteries so you have to write okay
so they are actually the branches of the
external carotid artery predominantly
the superficial temporal branch so and
the other branches include these so this
branch you have to mention and the other
branches also you have to write if
possible if you can draw this diagram
okay it's good so you can you have can
draw the TMJ joint along with that
Eclair disk and Maya fossa do you know
it for sure and you can draw these
diagrams like the maxillary artery
tympanic artery showing the arteries
posterior auricular deep or ocular
artery so you can just show arteries
it's not mandatory if you can it's
better you draw then coming to the nerve
supply and so the mandibular nerve
actually provide the efferent
innervation additionally it is also
provided by the deep enteral as well as
a mass Ettrick okay most of the
innervation is actually provided by the
auricular temporal now okay so by
mandibular nerve auto-close temporal
nerve you have to write next coming to
the main anatomy so we have given a mild
description or a small description brief
description of the development followed
by the blood supply and the nerve supply
now coming to the main anatomy of the
joint of how it looks so it has actually
have the hard components and the soft
tissue components so the first is a
kondal ahead you can write the
dimensions as shown in this picture you
can write you can draw and you can give
the dimensions and then you can also
next you have fried the fossa so it is
located where is located exactly it's an
infinite part of the squamous part of
the temporal bone which is composed of
the articular eminence at the anterior
limit and the glenoid fossa so you have
to write like this next coming to the
soft tissue components which include the
articular surfaces are two clear discs
and the ligaments so first you have
tried the hard tissue which includes the
fossa as well as the condyle condyle
ahead then you have to come to the soft
tissues which include these articular
surfaces the discs and the ligaments so
articular surfaces the upper articular
surface is actually formed by the
eminence the articular eminence and the
anterior part of the fossa whereas lower
articular surface is formed by the head
of the mandible it's very simple okay
next articulate this graph to highlight
short answer can also be asked on
articulate this okay after draw
beautiful diagram and you can color the
articular disk and showing that Gladys
as shown in this picture this picture is
very easy to draw as you can see you can
draw this showing the article a disc
okay so the unique feature of the TMJ is
the its its articular desk okay it is
actually a vascular in the center okay
whereas the peripheral portion is
vascular and thicker the center area is
thin and it is a vascular okay that
dysfunctions at the articular dis
against the temporal bone as well as the
mandible and it's usually 10 mm in
anterior posterior and 20 mm and medial
lateral dimension those always you have
to put in okay next coming to the
attachments of the disc so posteriorly
it is attached via retro at a skull
tissue it is highly vascularized and
innovated and so also called as by
lamina joan because it has superior
rhetorical lamina and inferior to the
skull lamina as you can see in the
picture so it's also called as a by
lamina joan
so you can write this next coming to the
attachment anterior posterior
attachments you have written the retro
driscoll tissue and next coming to the
anteriorly so the superior inferior
attachments of the anterior region of
the disc are to the capsular ligament
which surrounds the most of the joint so
anteriorly it is
to the capsular lignin and between this
attachments the disk is also attached to
the lateral pterygoid muscle okay so
that you have to mention so if a
question is as again on that this little
description of the joint and the disk
description and its attachments are very
important okay the posterior as well as
the anterior attachments so next coming
to the capsule or the joint capsule so
it is completely in a capsule the TMJ
surrounded by a beautiful capsule
okay superiorly that is again attached
to the circumference of the mandibular
fossa anteriorly to the articular
eminence and again inferiorly up to the
mandibular or the condylar neck as you
can see so inferiorly it's to the neck
and superiorly it is to the fossa
anteriorly it is to the articular
eminence as you can see okay so that's
it
so again next important concept as the
synovial fluid so it actually divides
the joint into two distinct cavities
it's upper or the superior cavity and
the lower cavity so the upper is again
Phi the disc and a mandibular fossa
superior surface of the disc and the
mandibular fossa lower is by the condyle
and the inferior surface of the disc
quite simple so this is again surrounded
by synovial lining so what is the
important functions of this synovial
fluid it acts as a lubricant okay the
boundary lubricant and the whipping
lubricant so boundary lubrication is to
prevent the friction between the moving
joint and it's a primary mechanism of
the joint lubrication
whereas whipping lubrication helps and
eliminating the friction in the
compressed but not in the moving joint
so you have to write this okay next
coming to the ligament so we have
written the heart tissue components in
the soft tissue components we have
written that to clear surfaces and then
we have gone to the articular disc it's
attachments okay and then also then we
have come to the ligaments part okay so
coming to the ligaments they have mainly
three functional ligaments and to access
area ligaments so again you have to draw
a diagram showing the ligaments as shown
here okay the diagram is very important
the three functional ligaments
through the collateral the capsular and
the temporomandibular Lichtman whereas
necessary includes a Sneiderman tubular
and the spin oh man tubular so the
collateral ligaments attach the medial
and the lateral posts of the articular
dis to the poles of the condyle
these are also called as a disco Lippman
so medial disco ligament and the lateral
disco ligament okay they're actually
true ligaments which is composed of the
collagenous connective tissue and they
usually do not stretch okay they are
responsible for the hinging moment of
the TMJ next is a capsular ligaments oh
it is attached about to the articular
tubercle around the circumference of the
fossa and the squatting panic fissure
and below to the mandibular neck or the
neck of the mandible as you can see in
the picture so this diagram if you draw
it will be really fetching so as I said
this diagram showing the ligaments you
can draw it is taken from the occasion
textbook which is especially given for
the TMJ joint so this is articular
disease is a condyle and this is your
glenoid fossa ah the Manjula for serve
okay so here you can see the middle and
the lateral fiscal ligaments or the
collateral ligaments and these two are
the capsular ligaments okay so you can
show like this okay so this is the
so the medial and the lateral ligaments
you can see the lines which are there
okay so these are the middle and the
lateral discs are ligaments whereas this
one is the collateral
sorry capsular ligaments okay so you
have to draw accordingly as per the
label given do draw this diagram the
diagrams are very much fetching to
answer and to for the marks to score
okay next coming to the temporal
mandibular ligament so it has a inner
horizontal portion and outer oblah
portion so the outer oblique portion
actually this is the excessive drooping
of the condyle
therefore limiting the extent of the
mouth opening whereas the inner
horizontal portion actually limits the
lateral pterygoid muscle from over
lengthening so you can draw this diagram
as well especially the ligaments
question if it disaster you have to draw
individual diagrams or else for the
twenty marks were for the essay question
if they ask if you draw the diagrams for
all the ligaments then it's really
fetching for you then coming to the
assessor documents at a style of manwë
and the spine or mandibular you can draw
this diagram and you can just mention
them that's enough coming to the various
muscles so the muscles you know the
temporal temporal is masseter lateral
pterygoid and medial pterygoid so again
a separate presentation will be made on
muscles of mastication so here if it is
si question is being as we have to
mention the muscles of mastication along
with the origin and the insertion and
the functions if you can mention it will
be really useful so that separate
presentation is being made will discuss
therefore the muscles of mastication
okay next coming to the jaw movements so
he tell now we have given the clear-cut
idea of the anatomy of the TMJ along
with the muscles of mastication okay it
includes the heart and soft tissues okay
the articular surface articular discs
and the important ligaments along with
the diagrams and also the muscles of
mastication the origin the insertion and
the function so here with we have
completed the main answer the main core
of the answer next necessary things you
have can give the jaw moments okay
so first there is a hinge movement or
the rotational movement by which the
condyle actually
rotates around the glenoid fossa then
followed by the gleaning gliding moment
or the translation moment so if a person
wants to open the mouth from a rest or
from occlusion position to the rest
position then first the condyle rotates
okay
within the fossa it rotates later if he
wants to open the mouth widely it glides
over the articular eminence so that the
person can open the vault open the mouth
widely this is important moments related
to the TMJ so the normal mouth opening
is around 40 to 50 mm okay being
measured from the edge of the lower
front teeth and the edge of the upper
front teeth okay these are the various
functions it uses for elevation
depression of the jaws and also
protrusion and rotation are also further
exertion moments and the lateral moments
so these are the important movements and
functions given by the TMJ so next
coming to the clinical examination just
brief description of the functions of
the TMJ is enough what is the hinge
movement and what is a guide moment and
a little description that's enough
next coming to the history we have to as
a patient whether is having pain with
his having tenderness in the muscles
whether he's able to open the mouth
frequently or sorry widely or not any
frequent headaches and tooth aches and
any injuries or any history of trauma
and any changes in his bite so all this
detailed history you need to take
followed by which you can do inspection
by measuring the opening with comfort
and without comfort or like with pain or
without pain okay and also the maximum
lateral and protrusion movements should
also be inspected later you have to make
a diagnosis based on the alaskans
diagnostic criteria this you have to
mention students it's very useful for
scoring point of view so Alaskan has
given a diagnostic criteria so it has
two four four sorry four cardinal signs
and two negative characteristics so the
four cardinal signs which denote there's
a TMJ disorder is a unilateral pain the
muscle tenderness the clicking or the
popping noise in the TMJ and limitation
in the jaw movement whereas negative
characteristics include there is no
radiographic evidence and there is no
tenderness in the T
J on palpation via external auditory
meatus so this alaskans criteria
diagnostic criteria irrespective of your
department if you're right it's really
fetching for you
so next coming to the earth deviation
and deflection you have to write so
deviation so on wide opening again the
mouth before you come back to its normal
position whereas in deflection it stays
back in the deviated or a deflected
position so it deviates from the midline
and it stays like that that's a major
difference so you know how to palpate an
auscultate the boast intraocular and the
extraordinary you have to mention them
and the provocation tests like the
examiner is asked to apply pressure
against resistance so the patient is
asked to open the mouth widely against
resistance so how far you can open with
pain and without pain or with comfort
and is without discomfort is being
measured that is called as a static pain
test okay so here the manual forces
actually applied lateral upward and
downward direction okay so this if you
right it's okay or else you can leave it
next intraocular examination you have to
see for all these you have to see for
any history of cheap chick cheek or lip
biting s any weighted Linea Alba any
scalloped tongue or borders occlusion
where tooth mobility and all these so
you have to look further internal
examination as well next of various TMJ
imaging modalities we can write just the
names you can write if it is an oral
medicine student if you can give little
bit description of the imaging
modalities it will be useful for you so
these are the various imaging modalities
but for the articular disk to observe
MRI is more useful okay because MRA is
especially it gives a detailed of the
articular disk or the soft tissue part
so MRA is more useful so you can mention
there so for observing the articular
disk MRI is more useful so next the
diagnostic Elena blocks also you can
give and the various disorders the
classification you can give like intra
or claw or intrinsic and extrinsic
disorders again you can give this in
disorders and you can give this
classification
as an applied aspect okay I can give a
heading as applied aspects and you can
give related disorders due to intrinsic
as well as extrinsic so these are the
various intrinsic factors as you can see
okay so can just note it down and these
are the other factors intrinsic factors
which are broadly classified as all
these then extrinsic you include them
masticatory muscle disorders also from
the trauma like Myositis tendonitis
internal dis rearrangement and all this
okay next inflammatory join disorders
include the inflammation of the synovial
membrane or the synovial lining or the
capsulitis or even the that is an
inflammation of the capsule or the retro
disc itis which is the inflammation of
the retro difficult issue okay
so again you can give a brief
introduction of the ankylosis where is
an abnormal a mobility of the joint okay
that again you can if you know you can
give a mild description of the causes
and the main signs and symptoms of
ankylosis that's it and the relation
between the teeth and the joints at the
end you can give so which includes like
the any habits like the clenching of the
teeth or bruxism so that's again related
to any TMJ disorder that you can end
like that so you can finally conclude so
this is how you have to write the answer
student so first we have to give a
Maggie's introduction or this simple
brief introduction of the joint and the
ding limb of a throttle join later you
have to give the blood and nerve supply
followed by and also the development of
TMJ followed by the hard and soft tissue
components of the TMJ you have to give
detailed description of that followed by
the muscles of mastication and the
various TMJ movements the hinge movement
the gliding movement and the functions
of the TMJ followed by the clinical
examination that is inspection and
palpation and the static provocation
test again followed by the disorders and
the applied aspects so for if it's oral
medicine student you can give a detailed
description of the imaging aspects as
well okay this is how you have to write
the exam more answer in your exam for
the anatomy part of point of view for
the TMJ okay and these are the various
reference
that you can put in so the must and the
if a TMJ question comes do write this
reference that's occasion occasion is a
specific texture book for the management
of the TMJ disorders so case and you do
write that apart from that your chowder
shared your development book for in the
basing and the bucket okay you can write
that and any articles if you can you can
write so as shown here you can put
forward any articles if you
