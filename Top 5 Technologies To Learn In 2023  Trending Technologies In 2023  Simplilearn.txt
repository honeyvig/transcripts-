technology refers to the application of
knowledge for the betterment of human
society over thousands of years
technology has evolved providing humans
with major comfort from creating the
telephone to the world of tablets and
phones from making computers to
developing highly intellectual robots
technology has been evolving in almost
all possible Fields providing various
job opportunities that are continuously
growing day by day
in this video let's discuss some of the
best Technologies for the coming year
Yes you heard it right we will focus on
the top five Technologies to learn for
2023
stick to the end of the video to know
which is the most trending technology of
2023 but before we begin consider

and hit the Bell icon to never miss any
updates so if you are a tech geek here's
a question for you what was the first
digitally operated and programmable
robot called here are the options
unicorn unimate unifac and yeah let us
know your answer in the comment section
below so without any further delay let's
check the technology which is trending
on number five is Robotics and
automation robotics is an influential
industry gaining momentum over time in
the coming years robotics will offer a
lot to the world like smart factories
the adoption of agile Robotics and
cobots to name a few some companies
actively working in the field of
Robotics are Boston Dynamics and
Universal robots
some core robotic skills you need to
possess are python Matlab problem
solving mathematics and machine learning
the global robotics Market is estimated
to reach 70.84 million dollars by the
end of 2023 with a cagr of 10.5 percent
at number four we have iot Internet of
Things quickly becoming an integral part
of our lives iot or The Internet of
Things is a futuristic technology
recognized for its social and
technological Marvels
iot devices are increasing by almost 31
yearly and according to reports there
will be 30 billion iot devices by 2022.
the number of active devices is
estimated to double by the end of 2023.
iot has aided firms in improving
customer service streamlining operations
and increasing profits mindtree IBM GE
digital and Verizon are a few companies
getting more involved with iot
the top in-demand iot skills are machine
learning and AI python JavaScript big
data and node.js
according to reports it is estimated
that the market value will reach or even
exceed
566.4 billion by the end of 2027 with a
cagr of 6.7 percent
now coming to the top three we have
Quantum computing
Quantum Computing uses the properties of
quantum physics to perform calculations
and simulations that would not be
possible on a traditional machine
while not just a research experiment
anymore Quantum Computing is a tool
changing the face of several Industries
including medicine biology and climate
change
big names like Microsoft Google IBM and
Intel are in the race to build Quantum
Computing tools
to learn Quantum Computing you need to
know programming mathematics mechanics
scientific Computing and algorithms
reports state that the quantum Computing
Market is estimated to reach
411.4 Million by 2026 with a cagr of
24.2 percent at the runner-up position
we have proof of work and proof of stake
decentralized cryptocurrency networks
must ensure that transactions are
carried out safely and securely without
a centralized organization like Visa or
PayPal to accomplish this networks use a
technology known as a consensus
mechanism proof of work and proof of
stake are the two consensus mechanisms
that enable all the computers in a
crypto Network to concur on which
transactions are valid
proof of work is the older one of them
used by Bitcoin ethereum 1.0 it uses
mining by miners around the world and
proof of stake is the newer consensus
mechanism that powers ethereum 2.0
cardano tezos which employs a network of
validators to validate the new
transaction update the blockchain and
earn a reward if to excel in this
technology you should have Proficiency
in at least one high level programming
language a solid grasp of cryptography
and security principles knowledge of
smart contracts and familiarity with
algorithms and data structures
according to statistics it is estimated
that the market value will reach 69
billion by the end of 2030 and the
technology that has taken the World by
storm ranking at number one is AI as a
service gone are the days when you
needed a hard copy of a map to travel to
your favorite place as Google Maps has
efficiently replaced them with its
powerful ai ai or artificial
intelligence is the top most trending
technology today it enables machines to
think and act like humans now talking
about AI as a service
aiaas is a third party offering AI
Services which help individuals and
organizations to conduct AI experiments
at low cost some top companies using AI
as their core technology include Google
Amazon apple and Microsoft the market
value of AI is projected to reach 42.4
billion US dollars with a cagr of
29.75 percent
that concludes our list of the top five
Technologies for the year 2023 so if you
