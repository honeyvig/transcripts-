hello guys so here we are bringing to
you ready to write series it's regarding
the questions which are very important
and are meant to be written properly in
the exam so many of the times we read
the topic but then we should know how to
frame an answer and how to represent it
in our exam so here are some topics for
the same first is tissue conditioners
here is the contents for the answer
first of all is introduction in this we
are supposed to write 5 we need tissue
conditioner sometimes or why there are
some type of clinical conditions which
we see in the patient in which we need
to use tissue conditionals so followed
by definition it would be good if we
write a definition from the recent GPT
that is GPT 9/3 is history for this
classification and types of tissue
conditioners followed by ideal
characteristics of tissue conditioners
composition and rule of every
constituent then mechanism of action
then indications contraindications and
limitations of tissue conditioners then
users of tissue conditioners according
to different powder liquid ratios
advantage and disadvantages
then techniques for denture aligning
steps for denture aligning and recent
advances now I have explained some of
the parts further in detail like for
classification we have five types of
classification for tissue conditioners
as for for from I so there is short term
and long term from D CNA we have short
term long term and intermediate term
based on the duration like short term
liners they are used up to one month
whereas intermediate term can be used
from one to six months and long term can
be used as long as more than one year
third is acrylic and silicon based
liners this is very basic classification
and then again these are further
classified as heat cure and self-care
type of liners the next is Mac Cape
classification they have classified as
hard realign tissue conditioners and
soft realign whereas according to
Phillips it has been classified
according to the materials like critical
- silicon liners well can I trouble
polyurethane and polyphosphates in next
is desirable properties which are needed
for an ideal tissue conditioner so among
that we should write about adequate
compliance then dimensional stability
adherence to the denture color stability
like it should be it should not lose its
color then added ends to danger is it
should be properly adhere to the denture
then bio biocompatibility low solubility
etc then followed by ideal properties we
need to write about composition and
functions of each constituents like we
know that a basic composition for tissue
conditioner is powder and a liquid so
powder is basically a polymer and liquid
is basically methacrylate monomer then
next we have function of solvent and
plasticizer these two components they
play very important role in the tissue
conditioner solvent we have we usually
use ethanol whereas plasticizer there is
dibutyl phthalate so how this
plasticizer it gives the property of
visco-elasticity to the tissue
conditioner so that we need to mention
about the property of his core
elasticity that is the next point
followed by that then mechanism of
action there is same as that of
viscoelasticity how when we mix powder
and liquid how there is gelation
formation and how that gel gives the
property of visco elasticity to the
tissue conditioner and how it is
advantageous to the denture that we need
to write for mechanism of action next we
have indications contraindications and
limitations that is clear-cut given in
every book and then next we need to
write about the users according to the
variable powder liquid ratio like if we
are using it for tissue conditioning we
need to use powder liquid ratio as 1.25
is to 1 or if we are using it for
temporary operators we need to use
powder liquid insurance 1.5 is to 1 for
stabilization of dentures 1.75 is to 1
whereas for secondary impression 1.5 is
to 1 so these are the variable powder
liquid ratio accordingly there are
variable users of the tissue conditioner
then advantages and disadvantages in
advantages we can write the various type
of effects which we see in the patient
after using the tissue conditioner like
increased comfort to the patient or
increase retention or stability to the
patient or if there is mucosal soreness
before then that mucosal soreness gets
decreased after the use of the tissue
conditioner that we need to mention in
advantages whereas in disadvantages we
need to mention about the properties of
the tissue conditioner after some point
of time where in which the plasticizer
it deteriorates or its generation
properties it decreases it loses its
color then many of the tissue
conditioners they have ability to form
the colonies of the various
microorganisms such as Candida albicans
which is very much common so that we
need to mention in disadvantages next
comes about techniques and steps for
realigning so in this case we need to
explain what are the procedures we carry
out at the time of the realigning like
what are the changes we make in the
denture we trim that enter borders by
around 1 to 2 mm and then we go for the
realigning so there are two methods
direct method and indirect method of
realigning so about that we need to
mention
and lastly recent advances do not forget
to add recent advances in every answer
like you should add it as much as you
can in every question in recent advances
some of the names for tissue
conditioners are poly for spazzing floor
elastomer polyurethane hydrophilic
acrylics higher methacrylate tissue
conditioners conditioners with titanium
oxide catalyst and product with
undecylenic acid so this titanium tio2
catalyst thing is it is a it has one
specific advantage that it does not
allow the colonies of Candida albicans
to form so this is the main advantage
for this fifth one so next topic for
ready to write series is mandibular
movements in this what we need to write
is firstly introduction like how
mandibular movement is helpful or why
mandibular movement is needed for every
the activity we do in our day-to-day
life next is roll-off temporomandibular
joint and muscles in mandibular moments
how the TMJ and muscles they play a role
for the every type of mandibular
movements that we need to write like in
short not into detail
nextly there is determinants of
mandibular movements like condyle ah
guidance incisor guidance and
neuromuscular factors so we need to
write about these three factors then
next is types of mandibular movements
now here is the classification of the
mandibular movements which we need to
write about first is based on extent of
movements then next based on type of
movements and next based on dimensions
of movement among which we have border
movements and intra border movements
nextly if there is effect of mandibular
movements on occlusion then para
functional mandibular movements in short
and lastly methods to record mandibular
movements among this I have just written
the headings of the types of mandibular
movements just to brush up first is
based on the dimensions of moment we
have rotation around the three axis that
is transverse or hinge axis
anteroposterior or societal axis and
around the vertical or frontal axis and
fourth is translation in time whereas
the next classification is based on the
type of movements where we have hinge
movement proto reserve movement retro
Civ movement and lateral movement in
lateral movements again they are
classified as lateral rotation movement
and been achieved now among lateral
motion rotation sorry
among lateral rotation we have five
types of direction of the condyle that
is lateral Trojan lateral Trojan lateral
rusian lateral protrusion and lateral
region so this five types of rotation of
the condyle needs to be written next is
Bennett shift again which is sub
classified into immediate side shift
pre current side shift and progressive
side shift so we need to write about
this now next is based on extent of
movement in that we have border
movements as well as intra border
movement so in border movements we need
to write about horizontal sagittal and
coronal plane and corresponding trace
things like diamond-shaped racing shield
tracing and beak shaped racing for intra
have water movements we need to explain
about chewing and it's chewing gives
teardrop shape of tracing that we need
to mention then next followed by this we
have to write about the envelope of
motion which was given by posit in 1952
so this is nothing but the combination
of all the three movements of horizontal
plane sagittal plane and coronal plane
so this combination of these three
planes puzzle has symbolized it in a
single diagram so that is called as
envelope of motion
nextly there is effect of mandibular
movements on occlusion that is we need
to explain the effect of movements on
the occlusion with respect to Bennett
angle as well as the incisal guidance
that is as per the slope of the anterior
teeth how the mandibular movement is
affected
nextly we need to write about para
functional mandibular movements that is
in case of bruxism or clenching or any
type of habitual movement which patient
may show which is different than that of
the functional movement is called as
para functional so we need to write
about this that in some patients we also
see some type of para functional
mandibular movements which are not that
regular and which may lead which may
harm the temporal mandibular joint and
muscles so they should be taken care of
so after mentioning about para
functional movements lastly we need to
write about the methods to record the
mandibular movements so we have almost
five six methods so first is all
ultrasound by using the ultrasonic
motion detector accelerometers we which
detects dynamic motion of the job third
is video fluoroscopy with the help of
the continuous x-ray to detect the
motion of the jaw for this scenario
graphi my injection of non-toxic radio
pick medium or die and 50s ARCA stigma
which is the byte registration system so
these are some of the methods to record
the mandibular movements next ly we move
on to the next topic of ready
right series that is systemic diseases
in concern to prosthodontics now this
question is something which is very very
descriptive and you need to know about
many type of medical diseases in this
case so let's see what all right and
what are not firstly introduction that
why like how the systemic disease is
present in many type of individuals
which comes to our clinic so that we
need to write in an introduction then
how we need to check those systemic
diseases that is by recording the
medical history so we need to write
about medical history and its importance
now third point is basic protocols for
appointment schedule like in various
types of disorders there are various
types of appointment timings like for
diabetes or hypertension or asthmatic
patients we have different type of
appointment schedule so that we need to
mention and a basic protocol like
patient is mostly patient is called in
early in the morning or after having a
proper breakfast or we should not make
the patient to sit for so long so that
is all the basic protocols which are to
be mentioned there for this stress
reduction protocol that we usually know
so that we should we need to write about
next point is something from where the
main answer starts that is to explain
the various systemic disorders their
dental significance clinical feature and
dental management as you need to write
about many diseases so it's better if we
focus only on the dental part of the
every disorder now first of all this
cardiovascular diseases in that major
disorders what we have is angina
pectoris myocardial infraction sub acute
bacterial endocarditis and hyper and
hypotension so basically when you write
about these diseases you just need to
suppose if you are writing for angina
pectoris then just explain what is
angina pectoris and if the patient has
suffered previously from angina or
recently he has suffered from angina
then what are precautions we need to
take during the dental treatment so that
we need to
and if there is any type of dental
emergency how we are supposed to manage
it that we need to write so just
segregate your answers in the headings
that's it next we have endocrine
disorders among which we have thyroid
diabetes mellitus which is very very
important and can't come as a separate
question - so diabetes needs to be read
in detail with type 1 and type 2
disorders next we have adrenal gland
disorders then followed by endocrine we
have hematologic disorders in that we
have anemia leukopenia and hemophilia
then followed by that we have bone
disorders with osteoporosis
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
next we have old submucous fibrosis and
xerostomia xerostomia has been explained
in our video of saliva and its role in
prosthodontics in detail neurologic
disorders in that we have syncope stroke
epilepsy parkinsonism and Bell's palsy
then next we have mucosal conditions in
that we have basically vesicular erosive
lesions then systemic lupus
erythematosus and burning mouth syndrome
and lastly HIV which is very important
and we can also add a short note on
Corbett because that is the pandemic
which has occurred and and still going
on like very very recent thing so if you
add a note on covered that would be good
and also we know much of the things
about its protection so we can add much
more about Corbett disease also so
basically for this type of questions
what we need to know is a basic like
what the disease is what happens in the
disease then what is the dental
significance of the disease and how to
manage the disease if there is any type
of medical emergencies occurring on the
dental chair so this is these are the
three to four things which you need to
know and most importantly pre
medications
if we need to give before any surgery so
that you need to make mention example in
subacute bacterial endocarditis if you
need if you read it you will come to
know about the pre medications before
every surgery which is to be given to
the patient next ready to write question
is psychological implications of patient
care in prosthodontics now though not
mentioned here this question is more to
be emphasized for geriatric patients
because many of the psychological
implications they are more concern to
the geriatric patients who are old aged
so introduction should be written that
fie the psychologically psychological
condition is important to judge for
every patient and with special emphasis
on geriatric patients now after giving
on special emphasis for geriatric
patients we can move on to the effects
of aging in prosthodontics now effects
of aging in prosthetics has to be
written with respect to skin with
respect to teeth with respect to every
type of system like GI T or bone what is
the effect of the aging on the bone so
various points we need to explain for
effects of aging in prosthodontics
followed by appointments guidelines for
the patients
now how we need to handle the patient
when patient comes to the clinic so that
we need to write about followed by a
medical history which is very very
important that patient may have some
other other psychological type of
disorder going on or patient may be
under the medication of the same so that
we need to judge and this we can only
judge by recording the help of the
medical history next comes psychological
conditions experienced by the dentist
basic personality traits for the patient
like how the dentist should be for the
patient this is something which comes
under the basic personality traits how
the dentist should behave with the
patient who is psychologically
compromised or like any ordinary patient
next is classifications for the
patient's behavior and explain the
classification like we
for a house classification of the
patient like philosophical and
historical etcetera then also we have
Frankel's classification of patient
behavior we have Winkler's
classification of patients behavior like
three to four classifications you need
to write and you need to explain about
the same that what type of patient shows
which characteristic and how to identify
that patient
nextly we have treatment planned
formulation in that case what what we
need to write is suppose a patient come
who is completely attention Asst so what
all treatment plans can be for the
patient the patient can be given removal
complete denture or the patient can be
given implant supported over denture or
the patient can be given implant
supported fixed denture so what all
things what all treatments can be given
to the patient and what are the
advantages and disadvantages of the
every type of treatment so that needs to
be explained to the patient so that
which forms the next point explanation
of advantages and disadvantages of
clinical procedures so basically in
treatment plan formulation you need to
explain to the patient the multiple type
of treatments which can be given to the
patient in order to rehabilitate the job
so that in new you need to explain to
the patient followed by the advantages
and disadvantages of every type of the
treatment plan you have explained to the
patient and after that lastly you need
consent from the patient for every
clinical procedure you are performing on
the patient so you need to formulate a
consent accordingly and get the consent
signed by the patient by explaining him
or her the every type of the thing he or
she is going to face during the surgery
or after the surgery now explaining
about the psychological conditions
experienced by the dentist there may be
many but then mainly we have anxiety
depression conversion hysteria and body
image disturbances which we usually see
in the patients among that also anxiety
and depression they those are the most
common conditions which we see in the
patient next is basic personality traits
for the patients like how the dentist
should be for the psychologically
challenged patient so how the dentist
should behave the dentist should be
agreeable
he should be good listener he should
avoid arguments he should criticize
tactfully he should not be too egoistic
then he should remember the names and
faces of the patient like when the
patient comes after so long one or two
months suppose if the dentist remember
his name or face or if the dentist
addresses the patient with his name the
patient feels psychologically
psychologically very comfortable so that
thing needs to be followed and lastly he
should be interested in others like he
should be interested in listening to the
patient his or her problems so these are
the seven basic personality traits for
the patient just mentioned these these
are important this is not given in some
book I have taken it from the article so
you just take care and write somewhere
note it down lastly all the very best
hope this small discussion would make
your exam more easier if the question
comes in the paper hope you can write it
and represent it neatly and beautifully
thank you once again and all the best
