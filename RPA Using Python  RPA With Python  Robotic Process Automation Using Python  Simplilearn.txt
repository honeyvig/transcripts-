robotic process automation is in demand
and is highly growing field robotic
process automation is the use of
software with artificial intelligence
and machine learning capabilities to
handle high volume repeated tasks that
were previously required humans to
perform python is an interpreted high
level general purpose programming
language rpa when interfaced with python
helps users to transform tds task and
business process into automated process
hey everyone i welcome you all to this
session in this session we will see how
python is interfaced with rpa tools like
uipath and automation anywhere let's
look at today's agenda we shall begin
with ui path and see the different
python activity packages that it offers
followed by which we will look at the
hands-on demo in the uipath studio
proceeding further we will jump into
automation anywhere and look at the
python script package and look at the
demo in automation anywhere using python
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn so
without wasting any further time let's
get started with rpa using python ui
path using python to invoke a python
script in uipath
we must first create a new sequence
then we should drag and drop the
following activities from the python
activities pack we need to drag and drop
python activity scope load python
activity invoke python activity and get
python object then we will use a message
box to display the result variable let's
jump into the uipath studio and explore
each of these activities in detail the
first thing we should do is go to the
manage packages
and
install python activities pack go to all
packages and search the keyword python
and here you will get
uipath.python.activities
so install this package click on install
and get it installed so i have already
installed it so i'll close this so let's
create a new sequence
we'll name the sequence as
python demo
let's create the new sequence now that
we have installed the python activities
package search for python keyword and
you will get the python activities
package so this pack allows you to call
python scripts and methods straight from
any workflow you may also provide input
parameters and obtain the output data
generated by the activities to the
invoked code so the activities present
in python activities pack are get python
object invoke python method
load python script python scope and run
python script so first we will drag and
drop python scope so python scope is a
container that sets up a python
environment and provides a scope for
python activities all python objects
loaded up to that point are erased when
the python scope activity finishes
so we need to provide the path where the
python is installed so the prerequisite
site is you need to have python
installed in your system the latest
version of python so search for python
where it is installed in your system and
go to the file location
since this is a shortcut
go to the file location and copy this
file location and paste the location
here in the path paste it in the double
quotes okay so now we have pasted the
location in the path and target change
it to 64 if it is 64-bit and version you
can change it to any version which you
have installed the python version or you
can keep it in the auto so that's not a
problem so after dragging and dropping a
python scope drag and drop load python
script get it inside this do activity
so here you can write the code or if you
have an existing file you can copy the
file path here so i'll write a simple
code
so write it in the double quotes
so i'll define a function
say
i'll name the function as name
and i'll pass an argument
same message and pass argument as
message
and
return the argument
okay so i've written a simple code i
have defined a function and returned
that argument so we'll create a variable
here
right click create variable and name it
as say script
you can name it anything
name it as script okay the variable is
created so this load python script is
the command that converts python code to
a python object variable the generated
variable can be used to invoke the
methods in the code next we need
invoke python method
invoke python method allows you to run a
specified method directly in a workflow
from a python script the method
containing script must be first loaded
into the environment using the load
python script activity so we have first
loaded it with the load python script
activity then only we can use invoke
python method okay now we need to
provide the input parameters instance
and name instance is the variable which
we created previously in the load python
script we created a variable named
script so select that variable and name
is the function name which we had called
we had called the function name as
name
right in the previous load script
activity so we'll name the function here
so we have name the function as name and
we'll pass the input parameters so we'll
pass the input parameters here since we
are passing a string use double quotes
and i'll pass the parameter as
thanks for
watching
this video
so i have passed this input parameter
okay now in the result we need to create
an another variable so last time we had
created the variable called script so
we'll create this variable as script one
okay next we need
get python object so drag and drop get
python object activity bring it inside
so get python object this method returns
the dotnet type used in the python
script so go to the input python object
enter the variable which you had created
in the invoke python method we had
created a variable as script two right
script one so select that variable it is
the type argument is of type string
select the type string since we are
passing a string and in the result
create an another variable right click
and create variable and will name the
variable as script 2. okay now we need a
message box
to display the result but before that we
have used load python script and invoke
python method get python object and
python scope we have used four of this
activity and the one activity left is
run python script so this command allows
you to run python code you can either
type the code straight into the activity
or give it a file so we will not use run
python script in this project so after
this much is done we will search for a
message box so drag and drop a message
box inside the python scope so we'll
enter the message here the result
variable which we had created in
the previous activity get python object
is script two so to display the message
we'll enter that variable script two so
we need to convert it to string so enter
the function dot
to string we'll concatenate it with the
text
say
subscribe to
our youtube channel so we have
concatenated a message
so we are all done so we'll save it and
click on run
and here you go you can see the message
thanks for watching this video and
subscribe to our youtube channel
automation anywhere is one of the
leading robotic process automation
platforms automation anywhere is built
on the world's most commonly used
automation and artificial intelligence
platform automation anywhere using
python in this we will write inline
scripts using the command python script
and its machine learning capabilities
within the automation anywhere
we'll first login to the control room
and create a new bot then we will drag
and drop the following actions from the
python script package we will use python
script open execute function and python
script close
then we will add a message box to
display the result variable let's jump
into the automation anywhere control
room and explore the python script
package and each of its actions in
detail
log in to the control room enter the
username and password click on login
once you have logged in the control room
go to the automation
click on create new
bot
enter the bot name as
bot enter the description which is
optional
and select the folder where you want to
store the bot and next click on create
and edit
so the bot is successfully created
go to the search actions and search for
python script package
so the python script package contains
actions that enable python script
functions in a task
on the device where you wish to run the
script the relevant version of python
should be installed version 2.x and 3.x
of python are supported by automation
anywhere
the path of the python folder is
modified in the path environment
variable
enter the python on the command prompt
to see if python environment variable is
set correctly
the python environment is set up
appropriately if it returns the python
version that is installed
so these are the list of activities in
the python script package
close action closes the session and
specifies the name
execute function executes a function
within the python script execute script
executes a script within the python
script and open action opens a python
file so let's use open file now drag and
drop the python script open so enter the
new python session
so enter the session name by default the
session name is default so let's keep
the session name as it is and there are
two options
one is to import the existing file if
you already have the file on your device
you can import it from the control room
file or desktop file or variable the
other way is to manually enter the code
so we'll enter a simple code
we'll define a function
let us name the function as name and
we'll pass an argument as message
will return the argument
message
don't forget to give colon in a function
so we have entered the simple two line
code select the python runtime version
if you have python version 2
installed then select 2 if you have
python version 3 installed in your
device then select 3.
now next
drag and drop execute function
in the python execute function action
enter the python session
as it is default enter the name of the
function to be executed in the previous
action we have named the function as
name so enter the name of the function
and arguments to the function
so select the argument to the function
so we'll create a new variable
we'll create the variable as
python
variable
and it is of the type
string so we'll select the type string
you can select whichever type you want
but for now since we are displaying a
message which is of the type string so
we'll select the type string
and enter the value which you want to be
displayed
so i'll enter the value as thanks for
watching this video
subscribe to our youtube channel
so i have entered the default value a
message which is of the type string
if you want you can enter the
description which is optional and
click on create and select
so we have created a variable this
supports only zero or one argument you
can't pass more than one argument
and assign the output to variable so
which is optional but we'll select the
variable which we created now python
variable
and next we need a message box to
display the variable so search for a
message box
drag and drop a message box enter the
message box window title when the
message box is displayed it contains a
title so what title you want the message
box to be shown so enter the title here
so i'll keep as it is the default title
automation anywhere enterprise client
enter the message
so to enter the message
select the variable which we created
choose a variable python variable click
s insert
scroll bar after lines
so after how much distance you want the
message to be displayed in the message
box so select those many number of lines
next click on close message box after
check this box
and it's recommended to at least keep 9
or 10 seconds by default it is showing 5
seconds we'll change it to 10 seconds so
the message box is done now when we have
opened the python script we also need to
close the python script we'll go to the
list view
and
go to the python script package
and select
close
action
and in the close action
make sure that the session name is same
the session name which you provided in
the python script open action and the
python name close and the python script
close action the session name should be
same let's save
python what is successfully edited and
saved
let's click on run
so here you can see the message thanks
for watching the video and subscribe to
our youtube channel so this window will
close within 10 seconds
so we had provided a 10 seconds closing
window so the window was closed within
10 seconds after the message was shown
then the still the bot was running why
because after the message box we have
provided the python script close action
that is why the bot was still running
and closing the script so your bot has
run successfully

regarding the projects both in ui path
or in automation anywhere or regarding
python please comment in the comment
section and we'll try to answer all of
your possible questions and do watch our
