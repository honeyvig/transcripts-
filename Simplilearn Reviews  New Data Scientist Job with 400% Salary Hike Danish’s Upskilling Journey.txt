same field but after six months I
realized that I was not happy or
satisfied in my job that's when I came
across the field of data science and
decided to upskill myself I chose simply
learned Advanced certificate program in
data science in partnership with Purdue
University it was the best decision I
could have made for my career the course

hi I'm Danish I'm working as a data
scientist at Sutherland Global in
Bangalore I took the advanced
certificate program in data science from
Simply learn in partnership with Purdue
University
my experience with simply learn has been
fantastic
the course is designed in such a way as
to slowly groom you on the basic
concepts to the advanced ones
it contained many industry relevant
projects which is extremely important to
get Hands-On skills one of the best
features is that it has a blended
learning of both line lectures and
self-paced learning which enabled me to
study according to my own schedule
post gave me the confidence and
ammunition to pursue the field of data
science of which I knew very little off

should prioritize it the job market
changes rapidly so staying up to date
with the latest trends and Technologies
is important by upskilling you increase
your worth your current employer and
open up more new job opportunities in
the long term I want to learn all that
is in the field of data science it is a
very vast and exciting field which I
explore more and more every day I want
