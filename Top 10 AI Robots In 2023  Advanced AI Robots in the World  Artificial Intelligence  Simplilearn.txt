ever wondered how Google Maps can
provide the fastest route almost
instantly have you ever considered the
speed and accuracy of virtual Bots like
Google assistant or Siri
all of them are powered by artificial
technology AI for short
riding on the data science hype train
the global AI Market is projected to go
from around 87 billion dollars in 2021
to nearly 1600 billion dollars by 2030
artificial intelligence has impacted
almost all sectors of the it domain but
its significance in the robotics
industry is unmatched even Tesla has
announced a new humanoid robot name
Optimus recently built to perform daily
activities and helped in Tesla factories
in today's video let's go through some
of the most advanced artificial
intelligence based robots Paving the way
for a faster and smarter future in 2023
before we start here's a question for
the AI Enthusiast watching this video
which one of the following is not an
example of AI is it a computer vision is
it be it web design is it C voice
recognition or D robotic
please leave your answers in the
comments below and that's a cue to get
started with the top 10 AI robots for
2023
number 10 on our list is IBO
Little Robot Dog created by Sony this
robot was retired nearly a decade ago
but has been brought back with even
greater human operation capabilities
this artificial puppy responds to words
of Praise or head scratches can learn
tricks and seeks out owners
a very important feature of IBO is that
it has an app that owners can use to
alter system settings or add new tricks
and store Memories by connecting to the
cloud AI system
next on number nine we have spot
form a sport robot also known as spot
mini is really a four-legged robot
produced by Boston Dynamics and American
robotics company spotted 83 centimeters
tall and weighs only 25 kg sport can
perform various tasks including walking
stairs and navigating rugged terrain
it's small enough to be used indoors as
well
Spock's unique selling point is that it
can go places other wheeled reports
cannot all while carrying carcos of up
to 14 kilogram of examination gear
number eight we have Serena 4 Serena 4
is a humanoid robot created by
scientists at the University of Tehran
the fourth generation of Iran Serena
robot can imitate a human position grip
a water bottle and write its name on a
whiteboard the robot which took four
years to develop can track objects
properly and its new hands permitted to
manipulate various objects from delicate
gestures to using Power Equipment
however the improvements are not only
internal Serena Force exterior has been
upgraded with new plastic panels making
the robot appear sleek and just slightly
threatening
next we have Aqua knot at number seven
Aquanaut is a shape-shifting underwater
robot developed by Houston mechatronics
Incorporated in Texas
The Equinox design allows it to mop from
a sleek and small submarine to a
slightly humanoid form with two extended
arms allowing it to perform various jobs
underwater Equinox was created to
address a long-standing problem in
offshore oil and gas which was the cost
of maintaining offshore sites with no
similar device on the market The Equinox
might have a significant Advantage
because it can accomplish this task
without the inconvenience of being tied
to a support vehicle and with only
minimal oversight from a human operator
at number six we have strontronic
stantronics are simple animatronics
stunt doubles each strandtronic employs
onboard sensing to perform numerous
flips twists and postures with
repeatability and position combining
modern robotic technology with the
investigation of untethered Dynamic
movement the initiative to investigate
stunt double animatronics began then
attempt to manage the landing of a
figure heard from a window by Walt
Disney Studios
meanwhile Disney research experts worked
hard to utilize angular momentum
conservation to enable fine Airborne
motion control a union of the two
projects allowed the team to construct
the stantronics platform which is ready
to bring a wide range of dynamic
characters to life
at number 5 we have flipping flippy is
an autonomous robotic kitchen assistant
that can assist chefs in preparing
freshly cooked burgers and fried foods
such as crispy chicken tenders and tater
tots
for example while cooking at the grill
it can automatically detect when the raw
burger patties are placed monitor each
Patty in real time and switch between
spatulas for raw and grooming Libby's
brain is powered by Cloud connected
artificial intelligence allowing you to
learn from its environment and acquire
new abilities over time next we have
Sofia at number four Sophia is regarded
to be the most intelligent humanoid
robot she made her dpu in 2016 and an
interaction with humans was the most
extraordinary thing you'd ever witness
in a machine Hanson robotics based in
Hong Kong developed her to integrate as
an elderly companion in healthcare
facilities or crowd management at events
Sofia is the world's first robot Citizen
and the UN development program's first
robot Innovation Ambassador Sophia has
integrated neural network models and
artificial intelligence to recognize
human faces and interpret the gestures
and emotions at number three we have
Atlas Atlas is a humanoid robot created
by Boston Dynamics and renowns for its
unmatched ability to jump over obstacles
do backflips and dance Atlas completes a
parkour track in one of the company's
most recent videos its Evolution has
been nothing short of remarkable aside
from the spectacular acrobatics it
demonstrates some interesting
foundational abilities such as operator
shifting its equilibrium after landing
atlas's Behavior has also been extended
by providing it with a collection of
template behaviors such as sleeping and
vaulting and allowing it to adapt those
behaviors to the new scenarios it finds
next we have pepper in the second
position the pepper robot is among
businesses most sophistically
commercially available social robots
today SoftBank robotics designed it to
be friendly and engaging as well as to
put people at ease and is equally at
home with infants as it is with adults
pepper can hold conversations and
incorporate Knowledge from those stocks
into his words it may be trained to
recognize items pick them out in a room
and make decisions to Enlighten or amuse
finally at number one we have Amika
engineered Arts describes Amica as the
world's most advanced human-shaped robot
reflecting The Cutting Edge of human
robotics technology the robot can mimic
Expressions fairly well in response to
all questions articulately engineered
Arts Amica Hardware is based on the
research into human and Robotics and is
built on the proprietary Mesmer
technology
amica's artificial limbs ligaments
Motors and sensor Aries are made with
Cutting Edge technology as shown in
movies the rise of air usually results
in chaos amica's developers on the other
hand argue that the scientific
breakthrough will be used for a
different purpose claiming that Amica
will serve as a future phase of robots
so that wraps up the top 10 aie power
robots for 2023. if you feel you need to
