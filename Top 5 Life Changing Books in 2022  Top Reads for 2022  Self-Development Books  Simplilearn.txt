without further ado let's get started at
number one deep work by karl newport
deep work is on the importance of
focused work in order to succeed in an
increasingly distracted world the crux
of the book is that there are two kinds
of work we do one is shallow work deep
work shallow work is easy and ubiquitous
any work which needs a little bit of
time and focus like replying to emails
social media presence etc these works
are easy to replace and not valued much
in society and deep work is the ability
to focus without distraction on a
cognitively demanding task cultivating
deep work ethic will help you focus for
an extended period of time in producing
better outcomes and less time it's
demanding and helps people provide
valuable things to society that are hard
to replicate or replace the book is
divided into two parts part one is about
why deep work matters and its scientific
backing part two is how to achieve deep
work to increase productivity so if your
time and energy are being pulled in a
million different directions and you're
feeling overwhelmed this is a must read
book for you
