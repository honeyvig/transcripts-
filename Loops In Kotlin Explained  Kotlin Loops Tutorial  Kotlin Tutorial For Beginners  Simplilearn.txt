hey everyone welcome back to another
video session by simply learn
in this video we will be learning about
loops in kotlin which is a very
essential topic in kotlin
so let's go ahead and have a look at
what we will be covering today
so we will start with loops in kotlin
and then we will understand different
types of loops
we will learn about for loops for each
loop and for loop with ranges
after that we will understand why loop
and do while loop in kotlin with the
help of hands-on examples but before we
begin

now let's go ahead and understand loops
in kotlin
are used to repeatedly execute a series
of statements until a certain condition
is met
typically a process is carried out such
as retrieving and altering data
and then a condition is verified such as
whether a counter has reached a
specified value
if it hasn't the next instruction in the
sequence is a command to go back to the
first instruction in the sequence and
repeat it
so until a specified or given condition
is true or the loop is broken with the
break statement
a series of statements are going to
execute
there are various types of loops in
kotlin like for loops for each loop for
loop with ranges
while loop and do while loop
so let's go ahead and understand these
loops
now we'll start with for loop in kotlin
a for loop is a conditional iterative
statement that checks for a specific
condition
and then
constantly executes a block of code as
long as those criterias are met
the for loop differs from other looping
statements in that it provides an
explicit loop counter that allows the
loop's body to know the exact sequence
of each iteration
the for loop is used in kotlin to
traverse over ranges areas and maps
as you can see in the diagram first
there is an initial statement then there
is a condition and if that condition
evaluates to be true then the statement
inside the loop body are executed and
updated the updation can be incremental
or decremental
then again the condition is checked if
it's true then the same process will get
repeated and if the condition is not
satisfied then the control jumps out of
the loop
this complete process will keep on
repeating until the condition evaluates
to be false
now
let's understand for loop with the help
of an example
so this is our code editor intellij idea
here we will be doing an example of for
loop
in which we will print the odd and even
elements from an array
so here we will use a for loop and if
else condition
so let's start
first of all we'll
make the main function
function main
inside this function
let's declare an array
val num
num is the name of the array
and the array of function
inside this
we'll mention the elements of the array
let's say 7
21
then let's say 23
these are the elements of the
array now after this we will simply
print a message let's say
like the odd and even numbers in the
list are as follows and then we will
apply the logic
right
the
odd
even numbers
are as follows
right
now we'll use for loop
now inside this
for loop item will be the name of the
variable that will store the
variables or
elements of the num array one by one so
num is the name of the array and in
between there will be inoperator
so one by one each element of the array
will be stored in item and now
we'll use
if condition
now we have to print even an odd numbers
the logic is simple we'll write if item
percent sign
divided by two
if the
remainder is equals to 0
then it means it is an even number so
any even number on when it is divided by
2 it will give 0 as a remainder
so
if it will give 0 as the remainder then
we will print
even number
then here we'll write item
that particular element will be printed
all right now in else block
we'll do
println
and here we will write
odd number
here again we'll write
plus
item
so all right
i think our code is done and
we can
run it
let's try to run this one
so as we can see even numbers and odd
numbers are getting printed
so 16 is an even number 2 is an even
number
all numbers 11 17
28 2081 number or number 39 and even
number 10
so i think all the elements are getting
covered
here we go 721 odd number
so yeah so this is how you can use for
loop and here we also have used if and
else statements
now let's understand
for each loop
for each method in kotlin allows you to
access elements in a collection or list
and perform actions on them
we can achieve the same thing using the
for loop but several for loops would
quickly make your code unreadable
as we can see in this example there is a
list name my list
and like in arrays we use array of
function similarly in list we use list
of function
the elements of the list are in winter
is and coming so there are three
elements first is winter then is then
coming
so to print each element of the list we
will use for each loop
as we can see
here we have used my list dot for each
that is the forage loop and then we will
print the iterator to print all the
elements of the array
now let's do an example on for each loop

the link in the description to know more
so again we are back in our code editor
here we will be doing an example of
for each loop
so this example would be a simple
example function main
and inside this function
we will create a list
let's say
where
a list let's name it a list
okay
so
after that
we'll use list of function
and
also let's mention the
data type
all right so now inside this
list we will mention the elements let's
say 110
and
265 and let's say 315
so these are random elements
all right now we will have to create a
variable sum and initialize it with zero
now using this list b
sorry a list
that is the name of the list we will use
a for each loop to iterate through each
element of of the list
we'll use for each
e must be capital
after that
right for each
and now we will use
this
sum variable
to do a simple sum of each element of
the list
sum plus
here i t so i t will be storing each
element one by one it will some with the
help of sum it will add each element to
one another
so initially sum is 0 when 110 is added
then 265 is added to 110 then 315 to
both of them
so all right now all we need to do is to
print this we'll write print talents sum
so here we go now i think we can
try to run this one
although it is showing an error but
let's try to run this
as i thought
i think we have to write the correct way
only
this is
the right syntax of for each loop and
yeah so now let's try to run it
so as you can see 690 is getting printed
so we have to use for each bracket with
for each
only and we can't we can't enter put
space
with it so yeah so this is the syntax of
it
now let's move on to the next loop which
is for loop with ranges
a range is a set of values that fall
within a specified lower and upper limit
and the values can be numbers characters
or objects
ranges might be incremental or
decremental
but the difference between two values is
always one as we can see in the example
inside the for loop
num in one two eight
here dot dot is the operator it means
all the numbers from one to eight range
will be printed
also we can use a step function to print
the elements with a gap
and we also have to mention the gap like
step two
there are more library functions that
build ranges that aren't covered by the
double dot operator
for example down 2 creates a range that
counts down
while range 2 creates a range that
advances to
a certain value now as we have
understood ranges now let's understand
while loop
while loops are used to repeatedly cycle
a block of code as long as the specified
condition returns true
the condition is verified first and if
it is true the blocks code is run
every time it enters the block the
condition is checked and as a result the
code will keep running until the
condition is met
once the loop starts the condition is
checked if that condition is satisfied
then the set of instructions are
executed and if the conditions are not
satisfied then the control jumps out of
the loop
this complete process will keep on
repeating and executing unless the
condition evaluates to be false
now let's understand while loop with the
help of an example
now here we will be doing an example of
while loop
so here we will use an array and we will
create elements of the array like
positive and negative
then using the while loop we will print
the positive numbers and the negative
numbers separately
so let's start
first of all we'll create the main
function
and inside this main function will
create an array let's say
arr is the name of the array
and here we are using the array off
function
inside this function we'll write down
the elements like 50 to any random
elements
minus 77 we have to write some negative
elements as well
minus 67 let's say and
minus 20
all right after that we'll
create a variable let's say i and assign
it to 0
initialize it with 0. so here we are
initializing it
now
within the while loop
we will write
i less than
arr dot size that the array size
so it means
this loop will keep on iterating
till the size of the array is greater
than zero
and when it becomes zero the loop will
break
or the control jumps out of the loop
all right
so as we know i is 0 so that is why i
less than arrow dot size we have used
now in if condition will write a r of i
greater than 0
that is positive number
if the element
here if the element is positive that is
greater than 0
then we'll print
positive number
right now here are
i
so that is how we will print it now here
we will write else block
and inside the else block
again we will print
negative number
arr of i
okay so after that we have to
increment i plus plus basically
we have to we have to make the loop to
keep on iterating so that is why we have
used i plus plus for the updation like
to move to the next element
in for loop we don't do the updation
part
like ourselves but in while loop we have
to do that
now let's try to run this
so here we go
50 to 10 positive numbers
minus 77 negative 82 is positive then
there are negative numbers
so here we have used the while loop
and it is
easy pretty much easy
now let's move to the next loop which is
a do while loop
the do while loop
the while loop and do while loop are
quite the same kind of loops
the only difference is that the function
is run at least once before the
condition is evaluated in the do while
loop
the while loop on the other hand checks
the condition before executing the
function
so as we can see in the diagram
the do while loop starts and the set of
instructions are executed
after that the while of condition is
checked
if it is true then again the set of
instructions or statement will execute
so basically in do while loop
the set of instruction will execute once
before checking the condition and after
that it will check for the condition to
be true
so we can say the set of instructions
will execute once even if the condition
is not met
let's understand do while loop with the
help of an example here we will do an
example of fibonacci series so fibonacci
series is the series in which the
sum of the
previous two elements is equal to the
third element
so let's start first of all we'll write
function mean
now inside this we will create a
variable let's i this is a counter
variable so we'll start with 1
and now another variable let's say n
let's assign it 10
after that
we'll create a sum variable
and sign it 0
then where
let's say f1
and make it 0
and where
f2 and we'll make it
1
all right so we know in fibonacci
sequence first two elements are 0 and 1
all right so that is why we have
assigned f2 as 1
and we will print it
now we have to do this example with the
help of do while loop so first of all
we'll write do
and inside this do
we'll write i plus plus that is we are
incrementing the counter
then
we'll print
f1 because
in
fibonacci series the first number is
always 0
write f1 we have assigned f1 as 0 so it
will get printed
now we'll write sum
equals f1 plus f2 this is the logic
and after this we'll write f1 equals to
f2 that is we are assigning the value of
f2 to f1
and
f2 equals
sum
so here what we are doing is
for each iteration we are assigning
second number to the first number
and assigning the sum of the last two
numbers to the second number
so
fibonacci sequence works that way
0 1 1 that is the sum of the previous
two elements is the
third element like 0 plus 1 equals to 1
then 1 plus 1 equals to 2 then 2 plus 1
equals to 3 so that is how it goes on
now
after do block we'll use
while loop
inside the while loop will put a
condition
that if i is less than equal to n
as we know the value of i is 1 on
increment it become 2 and the value of n
is 10.
so the loop so this block will keep on
hydrating till
i becomes equal to 10
and as we know that i is now 2 after
this block executes which is less than
10
so again this block will execute
so it keeps on iterating till n become
till i becomes equal to 10
so it will print up to 10
that is 0 to
10 digits of fibonacci series now let's
try to run this one
as you can see
these are the fibonacci series 0 1 1 2 3
5 8 13 21 34 there are total 10
digits so as you can see 0 plus 1 equals
to 1
1 plus 2 equals to 3
then there is 3 plus 5 equals to 8
then there is
8 plus 13 equals to 21 13 plus 21 equals
to
34
so
this is our fibonacci series and we have
done it with the help of two while loop
so these were some examples of loops in
kotlin you can try some more examples on
it it will help you understand this
topic better
so with that we have come to the end of
this topic
