hey everyone welcome back to another
video by simply learn in this tutorial
we'll make a project in c plus
this project will be a login and
registration system in c plus
in which a user can register
log in and also if he or she forgets the
password then also it can be recovered
we will make this project using the
fundamentals of c plus like switch case
statements and file handling operations
etc
but before that if you are new to our
channel then consider getting subscribed
to our youtube channel as we have daily
updates on multiple technologies
let's go ahead and understand this c
plus plus project of login and
registration system
in this project first of all we will
make a menu page
in which there are options like login
registration
forward password and exit
then we'll ask the user to select anyone
among those options
once the user has selected a particular
option
then we have to continue with the
functionality of that
so now let's switch to our code editor
and do its practical implementation
so this is our dev c plus plus code
editor now let's create a new file
now first of all we will include the
header files
the hash include iostream
then there is
f stream class or file handling
operation
hash include f stream
then there is string dot h
for string
then we will include the namespace
standard
now we will do the forward declaration
for three functions that is login
function registration function and
forward function
and after that inside the main function
we will make the menu for the login page
so let's start
first of all we are doing the forward
declaration
this is the login function
this is the registration function
and this is the forward function
now inside the int main
first of all we will make a variable c
which stands for choice c for choice
so now
we will make the menu page
so let's
create will use
slash t writing the horizontal space
now in the end we will use slash n
all right similarly we'll do here
welcome to
the login page
now again we'll do the same
slash d
slash t slash t
and now
underscores
menu
slash insulation
all right now we will make the options
so we'll do the slash d
now after slash t will add
vertical bar
then
we'll write press
1
to login
let's make it capital
press one to login
and after making some space then
vertical
bracket again
then end l
similarly we'll copy it and do for
option 2.
press 2
to register
all right
let's maintain the symmetry
press three
if you forgot your password all right
press 4 to
exit all right
so this is done now after that we will
ask the user to enter your choice
and for that we'll display a message
saying that
please enter your choice
but before that we'll use slash n and
some slash t's
all right now we'll ask the user please
enter your
choice
all right
now we'll take the input of the choice
that is c that we have already declared
next line
now
we'll use switch case statements
for example if the user selects 2 to
register first of all
then
inside the switch case statement in case
2 we will call the registration function
and if the user enters 1 then we will
call
the login function
so let's do that
let's create a switch statement
and see
that is choice
now inside the switch statement first of
all we'll create a case one
inside this case there would be
login
we are calling this logging function
and then there is break statement
all right similarly now we will
create case 2.
so case 2 would be registration
here we are calling the registration
function
and then there is break statement
in case 3 there is forgot function
that is if the user forgets the password
then this function will be implemented
now
there is a default case
no now there is a case 4.
in case 4 there would be a message
saying that
thank you
because case 4 would be exit
so we'll display a message saying that
now we'll also have to make the default
case
that is if the user selects 5 6 or any
other number that is not in the menu
then we will display a message saying
that
please select from the options given
above
so before that we'll add the slash d
please select
from the options
given above
after that we'll use slash n
and endl
after that we'll call the main function
so that the control goes back to the
main function and
we'll also use
system
cls that is clear screen
it means every time the code is
processed it will clear up the screen
now all we need to do is to create the
login function
so
i'll write
void
login
and inside this function first of all
we'll create some variables
and so let's do that and count
user
id
no this user id would be of string
write
string
user id
then there would be
password
then id
then pass
all right so these are the variables
that we have created
now again we'll use the
system cls
that is clear screen
we have to
write cls inside the double quotes
all right now we will display a message
that please enter the username and
password
so we'll do that
and we'll write slash g slash d slash d
and
please enter
the username
and
password
all right now
will again display a message saying that
username
now we'll take the input
so here user id
is the username that the user will enter
now again we will display a message
saying that password
let's make it capital
again we'll take the input
now as the user has entered the username
and password
now we will check that if that username
and password already exist in our
records
and for that we will use the file
handling operation of if stream class
because if stream is used
to read the data
so
we will use if stream
and if stream class
this will read the data from the file
input is the object name
and
the file name would be
records
dot txt
all right we'll have to
[Music]
make it inside the double quotes
all right
so now this if stream will check inside
the file that if that login password
exists or not
and to check that we will have to use
the while loop
inside the while loop will write
input that is the object name
then there would be id
and then
pass
so this is the id and password
and this is how we read in file handling
operations
here what we are doing is we are reading
that if
that id and password is there
and then we will match those id and
password
with
the id and password that is entered by
the user
so for that we will have to use the if
condition inside the while loop
so let's do that
we will write if
id equals user id
and
pass equals password
then
count would be
one
and then we will use system cls to clear
the screen
here we have assigned one to count
because in the next part we will use an
if condition
that if the count is one then we will
display a message saying that
your login is successful that is the
password or username entered by the user
matches with the record that is
the user has already registered
so now before that we have to close this
file
so
let's do that
we will to close this file we will use
the object name that is input dot
close this is how we can close the file
all right now we'll use the if condition
and inside this if condition
as i have said if count equals 1
all right if count equals 1
then we will first of all display the
user id that is the username
and then we will display a message that
your login is successful
so let's do that
your login
is successful
now thanks for logging in
now again we will
shift the control to the main
because there is the main menu
and now
inside the else block
we will display a message
that is if the user and password is not
found inside the file then
it means that the
user is not registered so he can't login
he has to register first
so we'll
display a message
saying that
login error
please check your username
now again
main function
now we have to create another function
that is the registration function
that is if the user press 2 then this
registration function would be called
so let's create this function
void registration
now inside this function we will first
of all create some variables then after
that we'll ask the user to enter the
username and password pretty much the
same as that of the previous function so
first of all string
r for registration
user
id
our user id
then r
password
then rid and our pass
system cls again clear screen
all right
now we will
display a message saying that enter the
username
again
enter the password
our password
all right
so in the previous function we have used
if stream class but in this function we
will use off stream class because we
want to write inside the file and off
stream helps us with that
so
for that we will use off stream
and object name would be f1
and
records is a file
and we will use the
app mode this ios mean the input output
stream and app will open the file and
append the output in the end
so this is our app mode
there are different modes
so here we are using this app mode
so after this we'll put the semicolon in
the end
now
we have to write inside the file so
we'll do the
f1
and this is how we write inside the file
f1 here is the object name
and our user id
is the username and after that we'll add
some space
and then
our
password
that is the password
we want some space between the username
and password that is why we have
used the single quotes and
this is how we write inside the file and
after that we'll again use the system
cls that is the clear screen
all right
now we'll display a message that
registration is successful
as we have already written inside the
file so now we can display this message
saying that registration is successful
now again control back to the main
function
so now we will create the forgot
function
this is the last function
void
forgot
so this function
would be called when the user
forgots the password or username
so first of all we will create a
variable
option
now we will ask the user that you forgot
your password no worries then we'll ask
the user to press one to search your id
by you by your username and press two to
go back to the main menu
so let's start
before that we will use system cls
all right now we'll display the message
saying that
you forget the password
no worries
and then
new slashing
now press one
to search
your
id
by username
all right
now
press 2 to go back to the main menu
all right now after that
we'll use slash d
all right now enter your choice
now we'll take the input
c in
option
after that using the switch case
statement
option
now inside the switch case
you will create cases
so case one
that is when the user selects option one
then
hint
we'll use bracket over here because
there will be
multiple lines
all right
now int count
we'll initialize it with zero
now
some more variables we will declare the
string
s user id
and
s id
then s pass
so these are some string variables and
count is the integer variable after that
will display a message that enter the
username which you remembered
so let's do it
the username
you remembered
all right
now
we will take the input from the user
as user id
so once the user entered the username
then we will check
that if that username exists in the file
using the if stream object as we know
stream is used when we want to read from
the file or check from the file
so we'll create the if stream class
and the object name would be f2
and
records.txt is the file
all right now using the while loop
we will check
that if
the username is there inside the file or
not
so sid
and s pass
so now
if
s id equals
s
user id
then
count equals one
so we will assign one to count and
after that we will close the file that
is f2
dot close
so here what we are doing is we are
checking inside the file using the
stream object that if that id or
password is there and if that id is
there then we'll assign one to the count
as initially it was zero and then again
we'll do the same as that we have in the
pre as we have done in the previous
function that if count equals to one
then we will
print a message that your account is
found
so let's do that
so as we have closed the file now after
that
we'll use an if statement
with a condition that if
count equals 1
then we will print a message saying that
your account is found
your password
s is
so it will display the password
again the control will be shifted to the
main
where there is the main menu
and inside the else block now
inside the else block will
display a message
saying that
sorry your account is not found
sorry
your account
is not
found
so as the case one ends we will use the
break statement
now we will create case 2.
in case 2 as we have
said that it will simply call the
go back to the main menu so
all we'll do is
call the main function
so that the control will go back to the
main menu
and now also we have to create the
default case
in the default case we'll simply print a
message saying that wrong choice please
try again
so we'll you slash t slash d slash d
wrong choice
please try again
after that
we will call the forgot function
so that the user can try again with the
correct option
all right so
we forgot to save this
so let's name it as
register dot cpp
and save it
now let's try to run this
go to execute and compile and run
there is some error
all right so it must i must be capital
as we have declared
let's try again
so as you can see welcome to login page
this is the menu and this is press one
to login press two to register press
three if you forgot your password press
four to exit
so now we will enter our choice first of
all we need to register so we'll write 2
and our username as
sam
at the rate
email
is our username
and now our password
sam123 is our password
so as we can see the message
registration is successful
after that we will log in
as we have registered now we'll try to
log in
sam address email is our username
and sam
one two three
our password so as you can see your
login is successful
thanks for logging in
now let's say i forgot my password
so i'll press 3 as if you forgot your
password you have to press three
so
there's a message you forgot the
password no word is please
press one to search your id by your
username so i'll press one
now i'll write my username the last
username i remembered
sam at the rate
email
so your account is found your password
is this as you can see
so let's say
again if i forgot the password and by
chance
i write
sammy
at the rate email
then sorry your account is not found is
displayed
as sam at the rate email is the
registered customer and not sammy at the
right email so it will display this
message that sorry your account is not
found
and let's say again if we try to
press let's say 5
then we can see that please select from
the options given above actually we have
to make it below options given below
but we can do that else everything is
working fine so now we will click on
exit that is 4
and this is the message thank you
so as you can see this is our
registration and login
system in c plus and this is how we can
do it
we have created these three functions
that is login function
then there is registration function
after that there is a forgot function if
we forgot the password and the code is
pretty easy and not that much long so
you can try this code on your own
all right guys with that we have come to
the end of this tutorial on login and
registration system in c plus plus
