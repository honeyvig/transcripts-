in recent years the cost of data
breaches has steadily risen the
additional vulnerabilities that occur
due to the move to a remote Workforce
dramatically enhance the chances for
cyber attacks and introduced several
weak points for hackers to exploit
additionally automated hacking assaults
and the capacity to exchange Bitcoins
via ransomware have increased the cost
of cyber crime in general jaanese
workforces have transitioned to
full-time work from home models which
gives rise to new attack surfaces threat
actors target the people who are most
vulnerable by taking advantage of
current events and shifting situations
to better understand this growth in
digital crime let us go through a few
statistics 2020 brought with it a SLE of
new problems for both businesses and
consumers in the midst of a worldwide
epidemic forest fires and political
instability it's easy to overlook a
serious albeit less physical threat
it set a record for data loss due to
cyber attacks as well as the sheer
volume of attacks 2020 is already
outpacing its predecessor the graph
below denotes the percentage of
companies that fell victim to at least
one Cyber attack in the respective year
with the numbers growing steadily we are
yet to see the true Crux of this digital
revolution in situations like these
penetration testing has been a gift for
organizations worldwide while security
testing cannot guarantee a 100% solution
it can go a long way in securing those
critical data from falling into the
wrong hands hey everyone this is BB from
Simply learn welcome to this tutorial on
penetration testing let's go through
some of the topics we will be covering
today we start by learning about
penetration testing and ethical hacking
and the different use cases in the IT
industry next we know about the benefits
of penetration testing and how to help
organizations save money in the long run
moving on WE familiarize ourselves with
the different types of penetration
testing or ethical hacking with each
serving a different category of
Personnel in the next section we read
about the five distinct phases in every
ethical hacking campaign and how they
help clear up the extensive report at
the end of every penetration testing
session finally we have a live
demonstration on how we can check for
vulnerabilities and the ways hackers can
break into devices without adequate
security measures in place
let's start by learning about
penetration testing in
general organizations can Define
penetration testing based on the
objectives of the test all networks
applications devices and physical
security components are included it
imitates the behavior of harmful
individuals or the hackers experienced
cyber security specialist use
penetration testing to strengthen a
company's security posture and eliminate
any weaknesses that leave it vulnerable
to attacks penetration testing when done
correctly goes beyond simply preventing
thieves from ging unauthorized access to
a company systems it generates realistic
scenarios that demonstrate how well a
company's present defenses might perform
in the face of a full scale cyber
assault the simulation AIDS in the
discovery of the sites of exploitation
and the testing of it breach
security businesses May acquire
professional and biased thirdparty input
on the security procedures by conducting
frequent penetration testing
testing while relatively timec consuming
and costly can Aid in the prevention of
highly destructive and expensive
breaches a white hat hacker employs
hacking talents to find security flaws
in Hardware software or networks on the
other hand white hat hackers follow the
rule of law when it comes to hacking
instead of black hat hackers they assist
firms in conducting penetration tests to
analyze their security index and make
the necessary
improvements ethical hacking provides a
full audit of your security policies and
in the case of bug bounties can assist
you in identifying holes in existing
operational systems it takes a far
broader approach to cyber security than
penetration testing whereas penetration
testing focuses on system flaws ethical
hacking allows actors to utilize any
attack tactics available to them they
can take advantage of system
misconfigurations send fishing emails
launch Brute Force password assaults bre
physical boundaries or do whatever else
they feel will get them access to
critical
information because thieves are
progressively changing up the approaches
and launching multi-layered complex
attacks this is incredibly useful for
determining just how exposed the
organization is to cyber
threats considering the vast domain that
is ethical hacking we have multiple
categories of penetration testing
methodologies let's cover them in the
next
section when configuring a secured
system testing is critical to preventing
Hackers from penetrating the perimeter
there are three sort of tests Black Box
gray box and white box in the Black Box
testing the tester receives no
information during the penetration test
in this case the pentester takes the
method of an unprivileged attacker from
initial access and execution until
exploitation the scenario is the most
realistic showcasing how an attacker
with no inside knowledge May Target and
compromise an
organization however because of this it
is also the most expensive
alternative white box penetration
testing which is also Al known as
Crystal Box testing entails sharing all
Network and system information with a
tester which includes Network maps and
passwords this saves time and lowers the
overall cost of a project a white box
penetration test effectively simulates a
focused assault on a given system using
as many attack paths as
feasible in a gray box penetration test
also known as a transparent box test
very restricted information is present
with the tester graybox testing is
beneficial for understanding the extent
of access a privileged person may get
and the possible damage they could wreck
grok tests achieve a mix between depth
and efficiency and may be used to mimic
either an Insider danger or an assault
that has infiltrated the network
perameter now that we covered the basics
of penetration testing and the relative
categories one must know how these
testing campaigns benefit the
organizations conducting them let us go
through a few perks of penetration
testing
regular penetration testing helps your
business assess the security of online
applications internal networks and
external networks it also assists you in
understanding what security measures are
required to achieve the degree of
protection your company needs to protect
its people and assets prioritizing these
risks offer firms an advantage in
anticipating hazards and preventing
harmful assaults penetration testing is
similar to a real life hacker rehearsing
for a real life hack regular p ntion
testing helps you be proactive in your
real world approach to reviewing the
security of your it infrastructure the
process identifies gaps in your security
allowing you to correct any flaws before
an actual attack
happens it is undeniably expensive to
recover from the effects of a data
breach legal fees it cleanup consumer
protection programs lost revenue and
dissatisfied customers May cost
businesses Millions penetration testing
regularly is a proactive strategy to
remain on top of your security and may
assist in preventing Financial damage
from a breach while safeguarding your
brand and
image penetration testing Aid in meeting
the compliance and security duties
imposed by industry standards and
regulations such as PCI Hippa fisma and
ISO
27001 having these tests done regularly
help demonstrate du care and your
commitment to information security all
while avoiding the significant fines
associated with the non
compliance with the entire process
seeming to be a lengthy AAL what are the
multiple phases in the process
theoretically we have to follow a
five-stage
process reconnaissance is the first
phase of the penetration test in this
phase the security researcher collects
information about the target it can be
done actively meaning you are collecting
information by sending a request
directly to the Target and interpreting
it passively where they collecting data
without contacting the Target or both it
helps security firms gather information
about the target system Network
components active machines Etc this
activity can be performed by using
information available in the public
domain and using different
tools the scanning phase is more tool
oriented rather than performed manually
the penetration tester runs one or more
scanner tools to gather more information
about the Target by using scanners such
as War dialers Port scanners Network
mappers and vulnerability scanners the
penetration tester collects as many
vulnerabilities which help in turning to
attack a Target in a more sophisticated
way the third phase is gaining access of
the system in this phase the penetration
tester tries to connect with the Target
and exploit the vulnerabilities found in
the previous stage the exploitation May
buffer overflow attacks denial of
service Doss attacks session hijacking
and many more
pentester extracts information and
sensitive data from the servers by
gaining access using different
tools in the fourth stage the hacker has
to maintain access the penetration
tester tries to create a backd door from
himself it helps the penetration tester
to identify hidden vulnerabilities in
the system and can later access the
machine should the need
arise in the Final Phase of clearing and
covering tracks the penetration tester
removes all logs and Footprints which
help the administrator identify his
presence this allows the penetration
tester to think like a hacker and
perform corrective actions to mitigate
those
activities with the cost of cyber
security platforms going up train
penetration testers receive an excellent
level of remuneration for the efforts as
per reports the average yearly salary
for a penetration tester is 6 lakh
Indian rupees of $10,000 in the American
counterpart finally let's let's go over
some of the ways hackers can identify
vulnerable positions on a system to
gather information in a live
demonstration in this demo we will start
by setting up a VPN connection that will
allow us to access to a vulnerable
Network by creating a local virtual
group over the Internet we then try to
scan the victim machine for breach entry
points find the username and password of
the user in question and eventually grab
the root password from the device to
start our demonstration we're going to
need a vulnerable machine to work on now
this vulnerable machine can be found on
the website known as try hackme which is
a service catered towards penetration
testers before we connect to the machine
we need to join the network where the
machine is located we can do that using
an ovpn file which is short for openvpn
protocol to connect to this ovpn file
we're going to go into a new workspace
on parot security
we're going to activate the root
AIS and we're going to connect to it ha
test.
VPN once we see the message
initialization sequence
completed we can be sure that we have
connected to the network which has the
vulnerable machine now to start the
vulnerable machine Ma we're going to
click this button and wait for a few
seconds as you can see it gives a 1
minute countdown before it shows you the
IP address now remember whatever the IP
address we receive here it is a machine
being launched on the tryhackme servers
but we can access that machine because
of the ovpn connection that we have just
set up using this file this ovpn file
can be found on the try hackme servers
profile section which I downloaded
beforehand as you can see we now have
the IP address of atim
machine let's try if we can reach this
machine or not we're going to copy the
IP
address and we're going to try and ping
to the
machine if the connection is successful
and we have joined the network we should
be able to see some response over here
as you can see we're receiving uh
request pings from the victim machine
which means that we have already joined
the victim
Network now that we are confirmed we are
able to access the vulnerable
machine let's run the first step in a
penetration testing which is
reconnaissance let's run up and map
scan we're going to use the flag of SV
so that we can know which version of the
service it is running we're going to
take up the IP
address and paste it
here this scan will only be possible if
the openvpn connection is up and
running as you can see it is still
running
running and we have our results over
here we're running the scan so that we
can find the services running on the
host machine that we will run end map
against we conclude that a web service
is running actually on Port 80 as we can
see over here which is using the Apache
server
system in addition to this there is a
SMB Samba Service as well running on
ports 139
445 now that we know we have an Apache
server we can use this IP
address to open it on the
browser
okay since the current homepage is not
accessible we can use some other URLs as
well as far as Apache servers are
concerned there are a certain set of
URLs that can be used to
open however if you go to the URL which
is IP address
SL
development this opens up a new
folder if we try to check the contents
of these files this is for the dev.
txt you can see the version of the
Apache HTTP server that is being
run this is the dev. text
if we go back and we check the second
file as
well it says the conten shadow has the
credentials okay if we go back
again SMB has been
configured which we have already found
out nmap that it is running a Samba
server now with this version of the
Apache server we can find version
specific exploits that can be run on
Metasploit but there is sometimes no no
need of that we can use another
technique as we now know that there are
multiple users that is being run over
here we can use a tool known as enum for
Linux what it does this is acts and
enumerates the windows and aamba systems
to run that command we going to use enum
for
Linux minus a
and we're going to take IP address of
the
machine going to paste it
here what this will essentially do is
provide us usernames that are being
stored in the victim machine it's going
to take some time to find out the
usernames once we find those out we can
run the necessary
attacks as we have already seen on the N
map it is also happening in SSH port
so if we find the username and we find a
single hash that can be cracked we can
use the SSH to get inside the
machine right now we have to wait for
the results of the enum forx
command e
as you can see we have found two users
of the machine known as K and
Jan I think we can stop the enumeration
right now since we have the two users of
this
machine Next Step what we can do is we
can try to SSH into the machine
now to run the SSH command we're going
to need the password of one of the
users for this example let's say we go
with the user of
Jan to Brute Force we're going to use
the Hydra
tool this is like an example command is
how we can use let me just copy
this and paste it over here
here all right Hydra minus cell user as
we have already decided we're going to
use the user
Jan
and we're going to use
SSH for the IP address we're going to
copy it from
here and paste it
here now for the password list we're
going to use a word list
which has a few passwords already
present in it for this example I'm going
to use the rockyou.txt file which has
like millions of passwords already
stored in it what the Hydra will do it
will try to bypass the SSH console on
the machine using the passwords present
in the rock. text
file we will give the path of rock Q
over
here like this
and we're going to run
it as you can see it's mentioned that
it's attacking SSH at this IP address
now this attack is going to take a while
and after this attack is done we are
going to get the SSH password which is
basically the credentials of the Jan
user in the victim
machine for now I'm going to stop this
attack what I would recommend is for you
to run this attack and write down the
password that you received in the
comment section
below the password that we receive from
here can be used to log in into the
machine let's try that
once to SSH into the machine we're going
to write SSH user at theate IP
address we're going to write yes and
press enter
now we're going to enter the password
that we have found after running the
Hydra
command I'm going to type the password
and press
enter and we have logged in as you can
see now if we try to look
around there are no directories over
here okay so let's go one step
back give a space over here okay
let's go to the second users
folder
okay these are the contents of the K
folder and you can see there's a SSH
folder over here so we're going to enter
that let's have a look the files in this
folder
and we can file an RSA ID over here
which if I'm not wrong should be an RSA
private
key which can be used to SSH into the
machine here we go you can see it's a b
in RSA private key and it should
end here as well now what this private
key does this hash will be used to log
SSH into the machine when using the user
K once this hash is cracked using Hydra
or any other cracking software like John
the Ripper we can easily use the
passphrase to login into the machine
with the user of
K what I'm going to do is copy this
private
key I'm going to launch a new terminal
we create a new file known as Nano ID
paste the private key over
here and save
it as you can see you have saved the
file over here now this hash can later
be used to crack into the machine using
the user of K this hash can be cracked
using either John the Ripper Hydra or
there are other Cloud mechanisms that
can be used to crack this machine after
it is cracked we can use the passphrase
derived from it to SSH into the
machine to perform the SSH entry we're
going to use this command SSH minus I
we're going to use the same
file which we
received we're going to write the
username which is
K
10.10 we can just copy it from the here
right
minimize this and paste the IP address
over
here or we can do one more thing we're
going to use a pseudo command together
as well it's
better Pudo
SS enter the system
password this passphrase is the one that
we received after cracking the hash in
this ID
file whichever password you receive
after cracking this using Hydra or John
the Ripper please write the password in
the comment section so that we can know
that we have successfully crack the
password we're going to write the pass
phrase over here press
enter and as you can see we have entered
the system of
K here we're going to press
LS and we find the backup file of the
password we're going to write cat
passord back and here is our final root
password so as you can see we have now a
we have now received the final root
password of the primary user and we have
already cracked the password of the
other user that is
Jan so this is the entire process of how
you can use nmap to find out the
vulnerable points you can see which are
the softwares that are running which
versions they are running and which of
those versions have a legitimate claim
as an insecure because
exploit hope you learned something new
