hello students myself dr. site e team
MDS conquer today we are going to
discuss about the corona virus so corona
virus also called a scope in nineteen as
a present prevailing outbreak or the
prevalent pandemic disease that has
turned the entire world upside down so
even LA layman exactly knows what are
the causes what are the symptoms and
even what are the precautions to be
taken from being infected so this
particular presentation emphasizes on
the pathogenesis of this retrovirus
which I feel that every doctor should
inherently know that and apart from that
as Nate point of view is also quite
important because the next need exam few
questions can be asked in and around the
scenario of this virus okay let's
discuss so coming to the main structure
of this virus so it has an envelope and
a nucleic acid like the every other
virus has so especially this virus has
spikes and this spikes or projections
are very important for the fusion of
this virus to that of the host cell
especially the spike s which is noted by
s helps in the fusion of this virus
through that of the host cell apart from
that it has xenon which is a
single-stranded RNA so mainly you need
to remember the spikes with which it
fuses to that of the host cell later the
single-stranded RNA which is a genomic
material for this virus okay so the
origin of this virus actually occurred
in the City of ohon and China so it said
that the people in the wet market who
consumed improperly cooked died
especially having the animals like pads
so the virus has been entered or has
been initiated from there okay later it
has been transmitted from person to
person via respiratory droplets okay if
the person infected person is at least
less than three feet away then it has
more chances of transmission because
it's it is being said that it stays in
air for around three hours and also if
the infected person touch
any object and that object can also
transmit the disease so that's the
reason we have been instructed to stay
at least 6 feet away with more than 3
feet away from the infected person okay
this has Maine transmitted from person
to person so now we have seen many lakhs
of people have being infected because
the transmission has been occurred
because via or it has been occurred via
respiratory droplets clear so next
coming to the simple pathogenesis so
like any other virus the spikes goes and
fuses to that of the host cell okay
later when it enters inside and it
releases its xenon that is
single-stranded RNA these goes and
attack the ribosomes of the host cell
after which it starts replicating so
entire process of replication occurs by
via enzyme which is called as RNA
dependent RNA polymerase so we know the
RA or the replication occurs by a
transcription so here the RNA dependent
RNA polymerase is enzyme mainly
responsible for that later it again
produces after the replication there is
n number of very ons at the white are
the virus particles are being produced
the viral proteins are being produced
which are initially inactive and later
they become active and get assembled
once they get assembled they go and gets
the does the budding to that of the host
cell which finally gets released from
the host cell so it is quite simple the
genomic material is released into the
host cell which replicates and finally
it gets assemble and again goes for
budding and exits from the host cell to
go and again attack the neighboring cell
so this is how the simple pathogenesis
occur so the main site of the target of
this dreadful virus is alveoli which are
present in the lungs okay so the alveoli
hacks actually has the lungs alveoli in
the lungs actually has two types of sets
the type 1 and type 2 so the type 1 uma
sites are actually responsible for the
gaseous exchange where ice tied to nuuma
site secrete the pulmonary
fact n't okay so these are the main two
types of cells where this certain virus
targets among this two in the early
stage the type to Numa sites are mainly
affected and as later stages that Ivan
also affected but in the early stage of
the disease the type to Numa sites are
mainly affected okay so as I said so
this is simple pathogenesis again so as
I said then corbett 19 affect the type
to Numa sites and damage is that so once
they get damaged it releases
inflammatory mediators which activate
the alveolar macrophages these are
activated alveolar macrophages will
release the cytokines especially the
tumor necrosis alpha the interleukin 1
and interleukin 6 okay once these are
being released then the capillaries
which are present around the alveoli
they end up with endothelial contraction
and retraction
finally causes vasodilation because of
which there will be increase in
capillary permeability once the
capillary permeability increases which
are present around the annulus the fluid
from the capillaries enters into the
interstitial space and again the fluid
from the interstitial space can enter
the alveolus or the alveoli so because
of which it results in pulmonary edema
so this is how the pulmonary edema
occurs okay will again discuss this so
as I said so this particular dreadful
virus that is coronavirus affect the
type to nuuma sites in the early stage
of the disease these type 2 new muscles
are responsible to release the
surfactant and maintain the surface
tension so as they are damaged there is
decrease in the surfactant because of as
the surface tension gets increased that
finally the causes the collapse of the
alveolus which results in the decrease
of gaseous exchange so finally it
results in a condition which is called
as hypoxemia that is the concentration
of the oxygen in the blood decreases and
the person has to meet the increased
demand of oxygen because of which the
alveoli gets inflated and the work of
the breathing increases so WB is nothing
the work of breathing okay and next is
after the cytokines are being released
they attract the neutrophils into the
scene these neutrophils release the
reactive oxygen species and proteases
which again damage both type 1 and type
2 as it - Yuma sites are responsible for
gaseous exchange so the gain the gaseous
exchangers affected because of which the
hypoxemia occurs so this is simple
pathogenesis of how the type 2 and type
1 Yuma sites are damaged which results
in the collapse of the alveolus okay so
as we have discussed already so there is
increase capable capillary permeability
via which the fluid again enters into
the alveoli causing the edema apart from
that the cellular debris also enters
into the alveolus because of which there
it results in a lowlight consolidation
so there's complete collapse and
consolidation of the alveoli because of
which it irritates mechanical irritation
occurs and thus results in the
respiratory symptoms like cough and
shortness of breath okay this is the
reason of why the patient's affected
with the dreadful karana virus or the
cove 819 shows the initial symptoms of
the cough and shortness of breath
okay next and apart from this a few
patients also present with runny nose
okay next why this high fever in these
patients is because these inflammatory
mediators are the interleukins and the
tumor necrosis factor they go and affect
the hypothalamus so they they're the
prostaglandins are released so they
cause the hypothalamus to release the
prostaglandins because of this the body
temperature increases so that's the
reason these patients will have
high-grade fever okay so we have
understood of how the respiratory
symptoms occur and also the how wide the
body temperature is being increased we
know the prostaglandins are mainly
responsible for the body temperature and
the pyrogen Center is present in the
hypothalamus so these inflammatory
mediators target the pyrogen Center to
release the prostaglandins that is
especially the prostaglandin e2 and that
the reason the body temperature is being
increased
so clear next apart from that there is
decrease in the oxygen levels and
decrease pressure of oxygen because of
which it triggers various chemo
receptors these chemo receptors go and
activate the sympathetic nervous system
so because of which when the sympathetic
nervous system is activated the force of
it has a positive inotropic effect on
the heart so the force of contraction of
the cardiac muscles is activated because
of which there is increased heart rate
as well as increased respiratory rate in
these patients in order to meet the
increased demand of oxygen okay that's
the reason the vital signs of these
patients have to be regularly monitored
once they get admitted in the hospital
clear so in these patients is increased
heart rate and increase respiratory rate
in order to meet the oxygen demand and
also because of the activation of the
sympathetic system okay so and
eventually if the patient is left
untreated and if it's not under any
supportive therapy then it results in
multi organ failure why because there is
increased capillary permeability because
of which as I said the fluid escapes
into the interstitial space and there is
renewed reduced blood volume in the
particular blood vessel because of
Frizzle is reduced peripheral resistance
followed by which it results in
hypotension and reduced organ perfusion
so it eventually ends up with the multi
organ failure so the patients will die
because the multi organs almost all the
organs are being affected and and the
patient cannot compensate that because
of which the death rate has been
occurred in this particular virus okay
so that's the reason once the patient is
being admitted in the hospital the
regular of liver function and the kidney
function test has to be monitored okay
so the liver function test or the
patient's if it is left untreated then
if they show increased geo TSG PT as
well as bilirubin and at acute phase
proteins like CRP and all that apart
from that the renal function tests they
also they can show increase very a
nitrogen and serum creatinine so they
have to be regularly monitored in order
to know the functions of these organs
apart from that the patient in case if
there is
severe pulmonary edema so the patient
has to be put under ventilation and
intensive care so that they can breathe
properly okay so so far we are done with
how the respiratory symptoms occur how
the fever occurs how the vital signs are
being increased and also how the multi
organ failure occur okay now what are
the tests that are being done to know
this virus as the incubation period of
this virus is act exactly about 2 to 14
days and the test is that is being used
as a real-time reverse transcriptase PCI
that is polymerase chain reaction so
this is very important that you need to
remember so the main differences between
the throat swab and the blood test so
throat swab is usually taken so the main
difference is the throat swab for the
results to come it takes about days
whereas worth lettuce it takes only a
few seconds or minutes and in the throat
swab the PCR is being used
whereas in blech test the solution is
added in order to test the device later
the throat swab
it actually looks for the corona virus
genetic material whereas the blood test
shows or it detects antibodies which are
produced by the human body in order to
fight a comeback this virus okay so
these are the main differences so in
case if the throat map has shown that
antigenic material of the virus then the
patient is said to be positive if the
blood test shows antibodies then it does
like it shows that even the patient was
must be infected in the past or in the
present so both the tests are being done
over days in order to come to a
conclusion okay so what are the various
treatment modalities that have been
implemented but there is no 100%
treatment yet so initially they have
used oseltamivir which is inherent
amylase inhibitor it was a drug of
choice for the pandemic swine flu it
then flew a tablet which we use really
give for the flu patients it consists of
oseltamivir but it was not that
effective in treating this particular
virus but when combined with some other
protease inhibitors and chlorpheniramine
it has shown better results but still it
is under trial but the chloroquine which
is anti-malarial drug especially in
India it is as shown a better result
when compared to other drugs
okay why because it has its own McCann's
of action so mainly this spike proteins
which I said the spikes of the virus
actually they exactly bind to the AC e2
receptors that is angiotensin converting
to receptors which are present on the
pneuma sites especially the type 2 so
they bind these spikes go and bind to
the AC e 2 receptors on the new muscles
so this drug is said that it can block
that binding or can block that fusion
okay so one of the reason is that and
one of the other reason could be it has
a very good or anti-inflammatory
property that it can have effect on too
many necrosis factor as well as
interleukins it has very good
anti-inflammatory property so because of
which it can reduce the severity of the
disease so these are the could these
could be the one or two reasons this
could be one of the many reasons for the
treatment of forgiving this
hydroxychloroquine for treatment for
treating corona virus but it has its own
complications and side effects it can
cause cardiac abnormalities as well as
the contraindications include the like
myocardial infarction and all that so
the dosage of the drugs has to be
monitored before giving to the patient
and all the vital signs and the
important things have to be monitored
okay
and since this drug is being showing
better results at the reason Prime
Minister Modi have been asked to export
this drug to several other countries so
but still there is no 100% assurance
that this drug is being ignore the cure
for this virus so it's not like hundred
percent assured and apart from that
nowadays we have been heard that the
antibodies from the plasma of the cured
patients or of the recovered patients
have also been taken to treat the virus
even that's under trial so we know it's
the treatment is not like confirmed yet
okay it's not that this is the treatment
is like that is not yet confirmed so
still many under trials many human
trials and many in-vitro trials are
being happening so let's see when the
treatment comes out okay so I would like
to conclude by saying that stay home
stay safe but though being doctors the
government might are
as for the rescuer help so we need to
have a good idea of the pathogenesis and
the twist to water being done and also
the drugs that have been tried so that's
the reason I have made this presentation
so do have an idea students but I wish
the government should never get that
situation of asking help I touch what so
many cases should not increase and they
should not need our help actually but in
case if that happens so we need to have
an idea okay till then stay home stay
safe
okay thank you
